{"title": "Perfick!", "date": "Tuesday 26 December 2023", "text": "Blink and you've missed it - but what a lovely stay we had at the safari park. We got there around mid-day and as our chalet wasn't ready yet we went for a wander round the park first. The weather was glorious and not at all cold - which obviously helped - so we got to see quite a few animals before it was time to head on up to our chalet. The chalet was lovely with two bunkbeds in one room and a double bed in the second room, but the best part was that our balcony overlooked the wolf enclosure! As soon as they heard rustling they came running over to the balcony, although we were under strict instructions not to feed them, of course!If you can imagine a place designed and furnished by IKEA this would be it, and the design fit so well with the location!One of the windows in the main bedroom!My boys get along really well and both have a great sense of humour, so we were treated to their renditions of various songs from The Lion King as we made our way round the park. The funniest had to be at the lion enclosure though, when André raised Charlie above his head and yelled \"he's alive\" in his best gibbon voice!At one point we were heading down a tunnel in order to get below the waterline at the seal enclosure when Jen turned her head and came face to face with a hyena. She yelped and they both beat a hasty retreat! I think the seal enclosure was probably Charlie's favourite spot in the whole park, and I must admit we all found it fascinating to watch as they kept swimming past us, \"showing off\" or probably just playing around!Charlie really was a little trooper and the only time he whinged was when Jen tried to put him in a stroller. He wasn't having any of it and when my fitbit logged 15,000 steps at the end of the day we had to give it to him - he'd done so well!The company prepared dinner for us, which they left in the fridge and all we had to do was heat it in the microwave. It was really good - foie gras for starters (not my thing though), roast capon, gratin and green beans for the main course, and tiramisu for dessert, with a chocolate yule log and a bottle of wine to top it all off. After that none of us particularly felt like trudging back into the park for the light show, but we were all so glad we did as they had all the fairytale characters lit up so it took us another hour or so get round it all yet again!We were also first in to see Father Christmas,although to be honest Charlie was none too sure!André and Jordan stayed outside chatting until around 2 a.m. and said they could hear the lions in the background most of that time. I didn't hear that but oh my goodness, at least three times the wolves set off a complete howling cacophony during the night and it was wonderful!As we were staying in the chalets onsite, the next day we were allowed access to the park one hour before it opened for the day, although even when it did open up it still wasn't busy so we had none of that Disney feel to it where you just get shuffled along with the crowd. This was when we did the car ride through the main park to see the elephants, rhinos (you wouldn't want to cross them, I can tell you), hippos, moose and so on and we were lucky enough to see what must have been a very confused bear lying around in the sunshine, probably wondering where all his mates had got to!We got back home around 6 pm and were all so tired I don't think anyone really wanted to \"celebrate\" Christmas Eve. Next day everyone was coming to my place and we'd decided on raclette (basically melted cheese, potatoes, dried meat and salad) to make it easier all round. Presents were exchanged, we all enjoyed a really good meal - and then of course André spotted the whoopee cushions and false noses so off we all went. Jen's mom's partner, Fabrice, is pretty quiet but André had him doubled up laughing, particularly when he unleashed an app on his phone with (I think) 112 different fart sounds! I thought Fabrice was going to fall over, he was laughing so much. Oh, and I forgot to tell you, when I asked André what he was doing for New Year he told me he was off to Genoa in Italy! Huh??? Turns out on his trip to Thailand they met up with a couple who were travelling together with a young Italian designer and they sorta followed each other's circuits and kept meeting up. So now he's off to Genoa for New Year and having dinner with her parents (????) I just hope she's equally enthralled with his farting app, 'cos he's classy like that! If it goes well, she's coming up to France on 18th January to spend a few days with him - so things could be looking up for him. At least I hope so for his sake!Oh and I also forgot to tell you another bit of news. When we were in the chalet Jen was getting Charlie ready for bed when he came out of the bathroom wearing his jammies and a t-shirt which read \"sometimes you've got to be able to read between the lines\". I never paid any attention to it because, well, a t-shirt, but Jen's mom read it out several times and said \"are you trying to tell us something?\" - and she was. It was maybe a little early to be spreading the news but --- Jen's pregnant again, and we're all thrilled. So right now I just can't see how things could get any more ..."},
{"title": "Like a kid in a sweetie shop!", "date": "Friday 22 December 2023", "text": "We're off tomorrow morning to spend the night in \"tree top cabins\" in the safari park near Lyon that Jen organized. It's only an overnight stay but I'm really looking forward to it and hoping the weather plays along. I just checked it out and it's looking good so fingers crossed the weathermen got it right! I feel kinda guilty feeling so happy when things with my favourite neighbour are just horrible. The silence coming from that house is explosive, but on a positive note I understand the husband is slowly moving stuff into his daughter's apartment in the next village over as her tenant has just moved out. I had mentioned to the wife that I would be going back and forth to a fabric store in a place called Sallanches as I was dropping off and picking up our sewing club sewing machines for servicing, so I sent her a message to say I was going on Wednesday and did she want to come. The reply I got back was that it wouldn't be a good time right now so I'll mention it to her next time I go. Her husband had had to go all the way to Lyon for tests a couple of weeks ago since two of the local hospitals won't deal with him any more. At the first hospital he was in bed waiting for an operation to insert a stent in his leg and they told him the surgeon would be along at 3 p.m.. When 3 o'clock rolled around and the surgeon hadn't showed up yet (unavoidably detained in surgery) he got dressed and left the hospital in a fit of pique. At the second hospital they inserted yet another stent in his leg (must be about six by now) and wanted to keep him overnight. Well he wasn't having any of that and signed himself out against medical advice for the second time so I believe that hospital won't deal with him any more - hence having to go all the way to Lyon for tests on his heart and lungs. When he got back she asked how it went and he just said \"fine\" and walked out, only for her to find out when she answered the phone later that day that they were scheduling insertion of a stent, in his heart this time, for the following Wednesday. When she asked about it he told her he didn't feel like going (probably scared but seriously, can you keep messing medical personnel around like that?)! Ultimately he ended up going for the operation and was kept under observation for 24 hours. When she popped round for a coffee she said it was the best 24 hours she'd had in a long time! How sad is that - but I know how she felt! When my ex used to travel for work the tension levels in the house used to drop from 100 to zero only to shoot back through the roof when he got back!So it looks like he'll be moved out sooner rather than later - which can only be a good thing for both of them. I was asking her what she was going to do about banking and she told me \"she didn't like to snoop\" but that she was also afraid he was going senile. Ha, any man that can visit a lawyer to effectively try to disinherit his wife of 51 years, locks her out of their joint bank account and who has a complete file labelled \"divorce\" isn't senile, he's trying to put one over on her! So I offered to help her with using my old laptop as he will be taking their one and only laptop with him. She's very resistant to \"technology\" but hey, she'll have no choice now, will she! His public persona is Joe Helpful but what goes on behind closed doors is quite another thing!She was telling me that with age he has gotten more and more like his mother, who was apparently a nasty piece of work. He was the only son and had three sisters and I remember his mother telling me one time how lucky I was to have two sons rather than daughters! I was shocked and said I was just happy to have healthy children - the sex doesn't matter! So I guess having been treated like the Boy King all his life he has no respect for anyone! I remember a few years ago when her father died very suddenly, grandma came to stay with them for a few days after the funeral. When I walked in to give her a hug she slumped down on the sofa and the husband said \"see, look at how she just slumps down on the sofa when anyone is around - it's all an act\"! I basically balled him out and said that she'd buried her husband of 50+ years just a few days ago, I don't care if she's slumped down on the sofa! So yeah, I'm sure this separation can't come fast enough for either of them!I think I mentioned in my last post that I'd bought myself a pair of earbuds/airpods in order to be able to get stuff done while I'm listening to books or podcasts. It was been nice to get into bed and have someone \"read\" to me, BUUUUUTTTTT I hate the fact that as soon as you tap one airpod it either tries to answer or make a phone call for you! The other night I was listening to a podcast in bed around 1 a.m. and when I turned my head my bloody phone tried to call my gynaecologist!!!!! I think I've managed to cancel this function because I don't want to be randomly calling people if I nod off in bed!And joy of joys, our local bus company just sent out an advance copy of their 2024 catalogue and Corsica is back on the menu again next year. I called my friend and knowing that this trip will sell out quickly we drove down to their offices this morning to put a deposit on the Corsica trip and a trip later in the year (just an overnighter) to a place called Guédelon, which is a place I have long wanted to visit. It's a medieval castle that is being slowly and painstakingly restored and is just a couple of hours from here! Guédelon!Skimming through their catalogue I must have listed about 15 trips I would like to do (hence the kid in the sweetie shop reference) but realistically we'll only do a couple, plus a few day trips and save the rest for next year, I guess. After we'd reserved we stopped off and ate in a very good Indian restaurant in town and while the quantities weren't big, and in any case I didn't finish mine, I flaked out on the sofa for a good few hours when I got home. Then for some reason I decided that right now would be a good time to start going through my food storage cupboards and I'm ashamed to say it took me a good few hours to go through it and throw out some stuff that must have been bought when Guédelon was originally being built! Just like my freezers, shame on me for letting it get that bad, but at least it looks good now! After that I've just crashed on the sofa again tonight but oh, pro tip, if you want to waste a few hours going down the feel good rabbit hole, start watching Nate Eaton's (East Idaho News) Secret Santa videos. If that doesn't make you grateful for everything you have, nothing will - and god bless the wonderful Secret Santa in East Idaho for making such a huge difference to struggling people's lives!So I'll be off tomorrow and get back late Sunday evening, and after that it'll be Christmas Day. I doubt I'll get to read any blogs for the next few days so I'll wish you all a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays, and speak to you all again soon!"},
{"title": "God I'm glad I'm retired!!!", "date": "Tuesday 19 December 2023", "text": "Come 31 December I will have been retired five years - and I'm still so, so glad! I mean, who wouldn't be? I don't actually know anyone who regrets retiring - or maybe one or two, which surprises the heck out of me! The other day it was peeing down rain when the Amazon delivery guy showed up, so when it's like that I usually offer to make them a coffee to go. He didn't accept because he had so much stuff to deliver, so while I like being able to find pretty much anything I want on Amazon, and I guess they're also keeping a lot of people in employment, man do those delivery guys work hard (and of course it's not just Amazon delivery guys). Then earlier this week another delivery man knocked on my door but when I looked at the address I told him that he'd got the wrong address - it was destined for next door. At this point my other neighbour came out as she'd been expecting to take in the stray parcel but when she tried the QR code it wouldn't work. So she called the intended recipients, who were in Annecy, and the husband did his nut because he'd been expecting it on Saturday!!! Try what they might, it just wasn't going through so when I offered this young man a coffee he gladly accepted. We ended up having quite a little tea party, with him saying he'd come back around 7 pm to try to catch them. So yes they work damn hard, which might also explain why they tend to drive like lunatics too!The friend who I met on my first day in Geneva called me last week for a catch up. We only worked together for about a year as she moved on to another organization, but we have kept sporadically in touch over the years. I asked about her kids - one of whom was doing well in Switzerland and the other had sadly just lost her job in England. She mentioned that she would be having her ex-husband over for Christmas as he still lives in Geneva. Not my business of course, but I never particularly liked him. I found him arrogant, bragging about his \"fancy job and fancy company car\" - well that was until he lost the job and she later found out that he'd stopped paying the bills, including the mortgage. She'd just had a baby and had switched to part-time work and then he got made redundant in his mid-40s, and as far as I know never really found another decent job! They had bought at the height of the housing boom and ended up selling in a depressed market so basically they lost everything they had put into the house. She then moved into France and bought a small apartment for her and the kids and him - well he ended up living in a small studio in Switzerland on not very much money, I imagine. It's funny how life works out, isn't it. One day everything looks like it's hunky dory, and the next, well it just isn't any more! Sadly they're not the only couple I know where that happened either! I've been very tired lately so actually had to laugh when someone asked me if I would be going skiing over Christmas! I don't think I'd even be able to walk with those boots on any more, let alone ski! I also finally bit the bullet and signed up for audible as I found I was wasting so much time sitting on my bum reading or listening to podcasts on the computer when I could be quite happily doing something else while listening to them on my phone. It only took me how many years to figure that out?I have been in the mood for trying out new recipes lately, so it's good when a new recipe piques my interest. I had to laugh though because there's a lady on a FB group that I follow occasionally who is posting some pretty nice recipes. It's a group for people who've been cheated on by their partners and since I'm so far out I only occasionally catch up with them. But what have recipes got to do with being cheated on, you might ask? Well this lady's husband (they're still in the process of divorcing) moved in with his girlfriend and apparently the gf can't cook. So he's been asking his wife (who's a pretty good cook by all accounts) for some of her recipes. When she told him to get lost he deleted her online recipe collection!!!! And if ya think that's weird, I was putting some of my clothes aside for Goodwill when my still husband asked if he could take them because he thought his gf would look good in them!!!! Anyhoo, this lady is slowly reconstituting her recipe collection so every so often she'll post one on FB, especially if it's one of his family favourites. This is a private group and she posts them knowing he'll never have access to them again. Yeah, I like that kinda petty!Earlier this week I had a dermatologist's appointment in Geneva so I left really early in order to park at the border and catch the bus in. Problem was, when I got to my usual car park, it kept indicating one or two spaces available (there are usually loads) and about 10 of us kept driving round and round looking for them. But no luck - I then drove on to another car park and it was the same thing there. Turns out French transport workers were on strike so people who usually took public transport in to Geneva were taking their cars, hence no bloody parking spaces. I called the doctor's office to explain and they were very good and said they wouldn't charge me as they knew what had happened. Then today I had a different doctor's appointment (trying to get them all in before the end of the year) and the same bloody thing happened. No parking at the border, the car park near the hospital full (turns out there'd been a landslide on the railway line), but I eventually managed to get a spot in a car park in central Geneva, and then legged it up to my appointment. Good thing I left so early right? While I was waiting to get a blood test, I heard the receptionist very firmly telling someone on the phone that \"no, if she didn't make it this afternoon she'd either have to go to her local clinic or come back in January\" (apparently this lady frequently cancelled at the last minute). I commiserated with her about juggling appointments but she said this was a 53 year old lady who was pregnant through IVF???? Yikes, I would not want to be pregnant at 53, all the more so when she pointed out that this lady already had four daughters, but wanted a son. She probably shouldn't have told me this, but when she found out this latest baby was another girl her whole attitude totally changed! Again, yikes, I would not be going through that again at 53 no matter how many daughters I had! Which reminds me of my Uncle Phil who approached my dad when I was born and asked if they could adopt me because \"you've already had six children\" (even though they'd lost two). I guess it was sincere and they would have treated me well, but man oh man am I glad that my parents said no!And finally, I had just got home when the doorbell went again. I was crabby because I thought it would be another wrong delivery (I'm not expecting anything) but when I opened the door there was a charming older gent from the Mairie delivering Christmas gifts to all the over-65s in the village! Which kinda surprised me because when they sent round the registration paper earlier in the year I didn't fill it in because I wasn't 65 yet. We'll open it on Christmas Day I, but I wonder what's in it - biscuits maybe or chocolates? That'll teach me to be such a crab!"},
{"title": "A tale of two marriages!", "date": "Sunday 10 December 2023", "text": "Just like in my last post there's still not an awful lot happening here. I've kept Charlie for two Mondays as Jen's work are down from four staff to just two so she's doing a lot of overtime. Because of that I've missed yoga for two weeks so I'm really looking forward to getting back to it tomorrow. On the walking front, this year has been pretty much a washout. I reckon I'll only make it to 800 miles by year end so my \"resolution\" (in as much as I make one) is to get back out walking in 2024. Mind you, the weather remains pretty abysmal, with tons of rain and lots of localized flooding, so I'm hoping that'll improve sooner rather than later!The other week I thought I'd treat myself to a mani/pedi since I have a voucher which will be expiring soon (I only hung onto it for almost a whole year!!!) so ended up in a new-to-me salon next to my hairdresser's. She was very professional and did a good job, so I think I'll try to get into the habit of doing some kind of treatment at least once a month just to treat myself. Mind you, about a month ago I picked up what I thought was a face mask that they had marked down, but turns out it was one of those \"foot masks\" - you know (or maybe you don't know) they're kinda like little plastic bootees that you wear for a couple of hours and it's supposed to do your feet the world of good. Well after a couple of hours I took them off and thought \"what a load of rubbish\" as nothing had happened. That is, nothing happened until about three days later when my feet started to peel like I had a bad case of sunburn! More alarmingly this went on for almost three weeks and my feet seriously looked like they'd been dipped in eggwash and then into a bowl of dessicated coconut!!!!! I hadn't intentionally bought these things and don't think I'll bother again but the pedicure lady said it was some kind of chemical exfoliation that was okay to use once in a while, but nah - no thanks. I looked like my feet had dandruff!In other news, I thought I should knuckle down this weekend and get a few pending administrative tasks done as I'd been letting things slide, so I sat down and paid some bills, then got online and booked two tickets to an André Rieu concert now that he's finally coming back to Switzerland in 2024, and then I wanted to get a few Christmas cards sent off. I think I mentioned before that the French Post Office is pushing people more and more towards self-service (who isn't?) so now you get to buy your stamps online and print them yourself. Well last time I had a helluva time getting the stamps to print properly so bought some sheet labels from the Post Office online shop specifically designed for the purpose. Except, the formatting is just slightly off by a few millimetres so every bloody stamp straddles two labels. First world problems I know, but I swear open heart surgery has got to be easier than trying to peel two small labels off the backing sheet and getting them to match perfectly on the envelope so that the complete stamp is visible. Just when I thought I'd finally cracked it, I'd pull my hand away and the bottom half of the stamp would still be attached to my thumb! As I said, first world problems for sure, but it certainly generated a lot of cussing!In other news, it looks like my lovely neighbours three doors away will be leaving after 40+ years. My favourite neighbour mentioned it a few weeks ago and I've seen their kids emptying out the garage and taking stuff from the house so I guess it's probably true. The wife is 90 years old and starting to lose it mentally (and is aware of it sadly), but still very glamorous and always beautifully dressed. The husband is a few years younger and an absolute ox of a man, and I know it will hit them very hard to leave after so many years. They know everybody, of course, and are a nice couple. He keeps his wood-working stuff in the garage so wherever they move to I hope they have enough room for his hobby and that it won't be too far so that they can keep in touch with all their friends here!Then my favourite neighbour stopped in earlier this week, ostensibly just for a chat, but I sensed that she needed to get things off her chest. She asked me if I knew that they were getting divorced and I said that she'd mentioned before how unhappy they were and that she'd spoken to a lawyer. Well turns out they've both been to see lawyers and are hoping to set the divorce in motion. Frankly I don't see it happening though since France has these new \"climate saving\" laws in place whereby they will have to get quite a bit of work done to bring their home up to whatever code is acceptable now before they can sell it. On the face of it the stars could be aligning since the tenants that she has in her late parents' house on the west coast have given notice that they are leaving and the wife would very much like to move back there. Their daughter's tenant in the apartment she bought before marriage is also moving out, so the husband is talking about buying that. But, there again they would probably run into these new \"climate change\" regulations before any one of them could move. Basically what these new regs will do is take an awful lot of rental properties off the market, thus exacerbating an already tense rental situation in France because people won't be able to afford to get this work done. More importantly though, the husband's mask is now totally \"off\" and she found out that he had given their son a sealed envelope marked \"to be opened in the event of my death\". She knows what's in it though as she saw it on their computer, but basically he has said that in the event of his death he doesn't want his wife (of 51 years) to get a single penny - no widow's pension, no share of the house etc. since \"she has refused to work all these years and that is her problem\". Now she told me years ago how lucky I was to be able to continue to work (even if I didn't always see it that way) because she had wanted to return to work after her maternity leave and had everything set up to do so. With him claiming she refused to work, it would alter her financial situation with regards to alimony - but she has written proof that he refused to \"allow\" her to return to work in order for him to be able to move around with his job. Mind you, I'm pretty sure he can't prevent her from receiving what would be due to her in the event of his death since in France you can't disinherit legitimate family members. Years ago I asked the notary about that - for instance what if I wanted to leave everything to one son (who was an angel) and nothing to the other son (who was just evil) - just hypothetically, of course - and the notary said the only way to do that would be to move assets out of France, so no, I don't think he can screw her over financially. Still, what an evil thing to do on his part! They don't even speak any more and she says he checks \"their\" bank account twice a day now - but only he has access to it! So for many reasons I don't see the divorce actually happening but what a sad way to live!And compare that to my sister and brother-in-law who, quite coincidentally, got married on exactly the same day in exactly the same year as my neighbours, so 51 years for them too yesterday. Their marriage hasn't always been a bed of rose petals, of course, but they are one couple who have grown to love each other more and more with every year. Probably because they're both as daft as a brush (runs in the family, it seems). My niece paid for them to have a long weekend in France this past weekend so they took just a few items of clothing from home to wear over on the ferry with them!Happy anniversary!"},
{"title": "Whoopee!", "date": "Thursday 30 November 2023", "text": "I haven't posted much lately because, to be honest, not a lot's been happening! Oh it's been piddling down a treat and as we've definitely moved on to winter weather, I'm forever grateful that homes round here have shutters on all the windows! It keeps so much of the cold out and I remember when I was still working that in the winter months I would just leave all the shutters shut when I left for work because since I was leaving in the dark and coming home in the dark it didn't matter - houseplants be damned. I'll just buy more next year! That being said, the kleptomaniac fox must be feeling the cold as he's been at it again, stealing my neighbour's crocs and leaving them in my back garden. I must admit, it's beginning to tickle me now as I'm wondering when he will finally manage to steal a complete set of four!In reality life's been just moving on as usual - which isn't a bad thing in and of itself is it. I'm keeping up with my Italian lessons and still finding it fairly easy as yet. Well that is, everything except my pronunciation of buon giorno! For some reason Duolingo has not been liking my pronunciation of that up until this week, when I finally cracked it! Damn, I hope I'll be receiving my medal soon!Yoga the other week was pretty interesting in that she had us using what looked like very soft tennis balls. We placed them in various places along our back (but never on the spine) and then did very gentle rocking movements. My God it was wonderful, the massage I got from it was so good and the effects stayed with me for about four days. While I will have a go at most things, I'm pretty cynical with it and kept imagining one of the balls exploding and sounding like a giant whoopee cushion (more on that later)!After that I went to the farmers' market and then popped into LIDL and for the first time ever I spotted that they had about 10 \"too good to go\" boxes. Seeing that one of them had leeks in it (which I had forgotten to buy), I asked the cashier how much they were and when he said €1 I bought one because at that price it didn't matter what else was in the box, did it. But the contents were great, so I split it with my two neighbours and managed to get the rest into the freezer, only losing the broccoli because it was already looking a bit sad when I bought it. Still, at €1 for this lot you can't complain can you. I haven't seen them since but it was definitely a good deal!André came back from Thailand on Tuesday and is now officially freezing, and Jordan is working up at the ski resort of Megève and loving the fact that they can only get so far up into the resort and then have to be taken the rest of the way by snow plough!Last Friday night Jen asked both us grandmas if we wanted to go up to the Château de Menthon St. Bernard (just above lake Annecy) as they have a month-long event gearing up to Christmas. The idea was great but so many other people obviously felt the same way, because when we got there all three car parks were full. We were then told that if we drove down to the tennis club we could park there and a free shuttle bus would pick us up. Problem was there were about 50 people in front of us and a 10-seater shuttle that seemed to run about every 20 minutes, so we gave it a miss and went out to dinner instead. Still, it's on for a month so I'm hoping we can make it before it finishes!Google picture - and yes it really is that lovely!Better luck next time eh!Then the next night we had our latest board game evening at my place. I was kinda hoping my bathrooms wouldn't still be a building site by this time but .... hey ho, nobody was bothered. I sneaked out the whoopee cushions I bought the other week and while everyone else was in stitches (I wished I knew how to post my video), Charlie was definitely not impressed! What did impress him though was his doctor's kit, so I ended up being his patient while he listened to my heart (making the dadum, dadum sounds - mom being a nurse, of course) and then came at me with a syringe asking me where my bobo was - so I pointed at my foot. So then he says, \"what, your socks have a bobo\"? Man that just cracked me up. I'm having so much fun with that kid - even if he doesn't like my whoopee cushions!"},
{"title": "So where did autumn go????", "date": "Thursday 16 November 2023", "text": "Crikey, one minute I'm bragging about the unseasonally glorious weather and next you know it hasn't stopped raining for two weeks!!! Well that's not strictly true because it did stop last Wednesday, but that was the only time! I know it was Wednesday because I'd dropped the car off to get my winter tyres put on and since the weather was nice I decided to walk back into town to pick it up. It took me an hour (which is pretty slow going), but in my defence I stopped next to the gendarmerie to read the plaques on the wall commemorating members of the French resistance who had either been shot by the Nazis or shipped off to concentration camps and died there. The oldest I saw was 41, but most were young men in their mid-twenties!!! RIP those brave young men!On the way there I bumped into Stephan, who I used to see occasionally up at Stan's now defunct little bar. My heart sunk when I saw him because the last two times I'd seen him he asked me for money. Oh he has plenty of money and lives with his wealthy parents but suffers from mental illness and while very intelligent (I believe) he obviously blows through money at a rate of knots. Anyway I was relieved when he didn't ask (I was going to say no this time) as I really want to have as little to do with him as possible as he gives me bad vibes. He was also one of two men who asked if they could move in with me (as in rent a room) when they found out I was getting divorced, but seriously even if I ever wanted to live with someone ever again (I don't) those two would be the last people I would ever let move in - one an alcoholic and the other schizophrenic!!! I had mentioned to Thiery at Ford that I wanted to get rid of the nasty-looking wheel rims my winter tyres were mounted on as it was getting hard for me to keep loading wheels and rims into my car and then down to my basement, so when I got down to Ford I was pleased to find out that they had taken them to the tip for me! So that's one less thing to deal with!Jen finally got me an original birth certificate for Charlie - which was the last paper I was waiting for in order to apply for French citizenship by ascendency (i.e. as the grandmother of a French child). So I thought I'd be really efficient and drop off a crate of stuff I had for the food bank, make a trip to the tip to get rid of some more stuff and then pop into the post office to mail off my citizenship application. Except on the way there I realized I'd forgotten to put in a copy of Charlie's French passport (that'll teach me to be smug), so I dashed back home to print off a copy and race back to get it mailed off before the post office closed. Except that was when my bloody printer decided to chew up a few pieces of paper, then my stapler ran out of staples (first world problems, I know), and then I nearly broke my neck dashing down the stairs to answer the doorbell - only to find a couple of rictus grinning Jehovah's Witnesses who told me they had \"good news for me\"! My first thought was that I'd like to give them a karate kick to the throat, but being short and stubby I knew I'd have to make do with a drop kick to the ankle if I decided to go that route! Luckily for them I'm British (and very polite!!!) so I simply told them I really wasn't interested thank you very much and that I was in a hurry! I made it just in time to get my paperwork sent off, so we'll see how long it takes to get a reaction from the French authorities - it's been about five years so far (and counting)!The wind and rain have been appalling these past few days and two days ago the Préfêt de la Haute Savoie (kinda like the State Governor) sent out a message (I saw it on FB) asking people to stay off the roads unless it was absolutely necessary to go out. I recognized the spot he was standing on as being alongside the River Giffre, which is the road I usually take to get to Jordan and Jen's, and while the Giffre always runs high in winter, the combination of high rainfall and snow melting off the mountains was giving rise to severe flooding and very dangerous road conditions. Then tonight I saw that the road from Bonneville up the Côte d'Hyot (where André lives) has been closed in both directions due to landslides. Not that André cares though 'cos he's in Thailand and having a whale of a time!At the elephant sanctuary!He said the baby was only a month old and while mom was standing by protectively the baby kept coming over to play with them - or \"piling on\" as he put it, and he absolutely loved it! Jammy bugger!"},
{"title": "Score again - or maybe not! Depends on your point of view!", "date": "Sunday 5 November 2023", "text": "The weather's been pretty yuck this week with non-stop rain and howling winds, but nowhere near as bad as in the north and west of France. Apparently winds hit over 200 km an hour (over 120 miles/hour) in Brittany, and while we got howlers it obviously wasn't that bad. A few downed trees and landslides but as far as I'm aware, no major damage round here! The net result of all the rain is that we've got snow on the mountains at the back of my house, so I'm guessing the snow line is at around 1,000 metres. I'm at 800 metres so I expect it won't be too long now! On the positive side I have an appointment to get my winter tyres put on on Wednesday so that's one thing crossed off my to-do list!I follow a couple of hiking groups on FB of people who hike in this region and the pictures they are posting are just out of this world. They're also very helpful in that if anyone asks, say, where is a decent walk, not too long and suitable for children, someone will always chime in with a suggestion. I've seen some fabulous hikes on these groups, but of course I'm in no shape to be attempting any of them right now. What I have realized though is that I don't mind going out in the rain and since I know I have some waterproof trousers (somewhere), next on my list might be a gentle hike, come hail or high water - though hopefully without!On the first of every month I have a short to-do list which includes, amongst other things, charging all the metallic lighting strips that I bought about a year ago. I have five in the house and one on the cellar stairs, so I'd charged them all by mid-day on 1st November and then wouldn't you know it we had a power cut a few hours later! So good timing all round. I felt pretty pleased with myself as I flicked all the power strips on and as I'd recently bought an independent power pack to charge my phone I knew I was going to be all right for a few hours. Of course the first thing to go when the power goes off is the heating, because although I heat with fuel, I need electricity to run it. And boy am I glad I had that wood burning insert installed. My neighbours use pellets but I decided to go with wood (and my trusty new chainsaw) so that I would at least have heating in the event of a power cut. So all in all it was ok, even though we never know how long they will last. In this case it only lasted a few hours, but we have had the electric down 24 hours previously, so I'd say we got off easy. Mind you, doing my monthly \"charge everything that needs charging\", I'm struck by how everything you buy today has its own charging cable. I've got a box of the bloody things and they're all different and while I'm used to it now it can get very confusing. Come to think of it, I have a drawer full of different cables that have been hanging around for years but in the end I reckon I'll just end up throwing the lot as I can't figure out what they're for!The plumber stopped by on Friday and with the help of his young assistant managed to get my very large (and heavy) shower base up the stairs and installed in the larger bathroom. It was quite a relief to get that out of the garage because I was then able to move more stuff into the garage rather than having it all sitting outside (as it has been since last April) covered in two large tarps. On the off-chance I mentioned to him that I was going to take a trip out to the charity store when he left as I had two large electric leaf blowers that I wanted to get rid of and did he know anyone who might like them? And he instantly said that he would take them. So I pushed my luck and asked if he was interested in my battery assisted bike too (all for free, I might add) and he jumped at it. So I got rid of three more large items that were taking up space and now have a very happy plumber! I know some people say to sell this stuff on FB Marketplace or wherever, but I can't be bothered and while I know all about \"sunk costs\", in the end I'm just glad to get rid of it. So score for me and score for him!While he was here I stayed out of his way downstairs and decided to get a bit of sewing done. In the same vein as T'Pol, I'm sick of having unfinished projects lying around the house so I've decided that this year at sewing club is going to be dedicated to finishing projects and using up some of the beautiful fabric that I have (before the moths get to it)! So I was quite proud of myself when I finished an advent calendar for Charlie that had been hanging around for a couple of weeks. I had seen a picture of an advent calendar \"tree\" so winged it and tried to make the same thing. It has small cars and chocolates in each pocket and is as wonky as hell (right brain, left brain again), but at least it's finished and it was made with only good intentions!Ha ha, look at numbers 1 through 5!Talk about wonky!Since 1st November was a holiday here, Jen took a couple of days off to drive up north to visit her grandparents and so that they could get to spend some time with Charlie. She sent us some lovely pictures of Charlie helping great grandpa in the garden and while it was tiring, she's glad she made the effort! Thinking they were coming back today I made a batch of soup and bought bread, ham and cheese to leave at their place for when they returned, but when I got there I found out they'd arrived back yesterday evening so I'm so glad I rang the doorbell before charging in! Then I was supposed to drive up to André's to drop him off in Geneva tonight before his flight to Thailand tomorrow. Turns out he'd made other arrangements - but just forgot to tell me! He and a couple of mates have made their own bookings for a three-week trip and I'm sure they'll have a wonderful time as André, in particular, loves Thailand!When I checked my bank account on pay day I saw that the powers that be had finally gotten round to crediting me back €2,000 which the French government had promised to everyone who put an open fireplace out of commission. It took a while but they got there in the end. Then today I was emptying another box in my cellar when I came across some pretty sad looking Christmas wrapping paper and the crumbling remains of a couple of whoopie cushions. That of course gave me an idea so guess who sent off for a couple of new ones to amuse Charlie with - ya know, 'cos I'm classy like that!"},
{"title": "Score (x 2)!!", "date": "Saturday 28 October 2023", "text": "We're still having pretty decent weather here for the time of year. Oh we've had a couple of days of heavy rain (which is only to be expected), but other than that it's been glorious - sunny and not too cold - and I'm happy to say I'm still getting loads done. I'm keeping up with the Italian lessons which are still pretty easy as it's early days yet. Then the other day a recipe popped up on my feed from a site called Ptitchef and I'm finding quite a few recipes I'd like to try out. They send an email every day with a starter, main course and dessert and if I see anything that interests me I drop it into my online recipe folder. The only complaint I have about the site though is the advertising. Well obviously they have adverts but the one that seems to pop up most often is a diagram of an enlarged prostate and showing the recommended treatment!!! That one doesn't actually inspire me to dash off to the kitchen somehow!I was chatting with my friend the other day saying how I'd like to get my old BBQ down to the tip but it was proving difficult since it wouldn't fit in my car. Then she said she wanted to get rid of her BBQ because she just never used it and was I interested? It's a good quality, gas bottle BBQ that has been covered and stored in her garage and while I was initially tempted I know I wouldn't use it so asked her if she would like me to mention it to my neighbours - who use theirs a lot. Well they weren't interested but as their daughter jumped at it I set up with my neighbour for us to go over to her place and pick it up. He told me that he'd tried taking my BBQ apart some more but I already knew that was impossible as it was so rusted, so in the end he said to just help him load it up into his car and we took it down to the tip. So score 1 - one less BBQ to deal with!Then last Saturday the tiler showed up with his young son as he was on school break. He's a nice guy and very hard working as he works a full-time job and does tiling in the evenings and weekends. He originally came to France as a refugee after the war in Kosovo and I am dead impressed how well he speaks French and how hard working he is! More power to him! I mentioned that I'd be gone for about 30 minutes as I had to pop out to pick up an Amazon package from a delivery centre. It was the first time I'd used this gas station and I had to scan a QR code on my phone and out of one of the lockers popped my new mini chainsaw! After I got home I had it on the table while I was charging the battery and when he asked about it I told him that I was not comfortable using my big chainsaw to cut the wood downstairs but was hoping to be able to at least cut up the smaller logs. So at this point he says that next time he comes over he'll stay an extra hour and cut up the bigger logs for me!!! I wasn't expecting that at all, but since he volunteered and if he wants to make some money I'm absolutely thrilled - so score 2 for me!Since then I've cut up a fair supply of smaller logs and this afternoon I cut back (massacred) the buddleia in my front garden as my gardener forgot to do it the other day. It took me all of 15 minutes and I am dead impressed, so much so that my neighbour asked me about it and has ordered one for herself. I tell ya, at the moment anything that's not on wheels I'm attacking with that saw! Which reminds me oddly enough of a story from years ago when my parents bought a new washing machine. My brother-in-law's parents were maybe 15 years older than my parents and as they were very rural she was still doing their laundry in the old washtub and wringer, so when my parents offered them their old \"automatic\" washer they jumped at it. BIL's dad said he thought he'd gotten lucky because every day when he came home from work his wife told him to \"take his clothes off\" but poor him, she only wanted to do another load of washing, she was so thrilled with her new machine! And I'm a bit like that with my chainsaw. I seriously love it, although I managed to lose my safety goggles the first day (probably threw them out with the hibiscus branches). But you know what, forget all the hoopla about the \"find my iphone\" app, I reckon if someone could invent a \"find my glasses\" app they'd make a fortune. Not from me though as I have reading glasses dotted all over the place so as long as I can still find my house I reckon I'm good!I'm still seeing an awful lot of job vacancies advertised (does no-one want to work anymore???) so who knows, maybe I could get myself a little part-time job as a lumberjack. Now there's a thought!Start 'em young I say!"},
{"title": "At least I didn't burn the house down!", "date": "Thursday 19 October 2023", "text": "While it's definitely a lot cooler here - obviously, it's nearly November - it's still pretty mild for the time of year. We've had a couple of days where it rained but other than that it has been pretty nice (to my weird taste I suppose) and with that I've gotten my energy back and quite a lot done! On Monday Jen was caught short for baby-sitting again as the daycare has this weird (rip-off, in my opinion) thing where eight days of the year parents are expected to find alternative arrangements for their children or they will pay double for the day! Say what??? You've paid for it but eight days a year you have to make other arrangements??? Sounds like a money-spinning exercise to me! Anyway, after yoga in the morning I drove straight over there to keep Charlie for the afternoon while Jen went to work. He was much better after his rotten weekend the week before but the reverse side of that coin is that he was full of beans. Not that I'm complaining, but all of a sudden I was really feeling my age!! He kept playing his favourite songs and played Allez croco, allez croco, allez crocodile over and over again ad nauseum, all the while we had to jump around like crocodiles! After about the 20th time he said \"nanny watch, I think I'm going to jump now\" - and here's me thinking \"mate, I was ready to jump half an hour ago\"!!! Still he was good and I had him nicely wound up by the time Jordan and Jen got home around six!After that it was off to Monday night sewing, so all-in-all a busy day for me. As I was driving there I spotted a young woman pushing one of those very high double strollers (for young babies) and saw that she also had another baby strapped to her chest, so triplets!!! Yikes! You've got to be young to do that, but I suppose if they're your children you do get into a routine, even if it's still hard work. When I was still working I remember seeing a young woman getting on the bus with triplet baby girls and watched them grow over the last few years before I retired. She had her act down pat but hats off to anyone that can pull that off!I mentioned above that I'd been getting quite a lot done round here, but there have been a couple of things that've beaten me, all the same. Some time ago I bought a chainsaw with the intention of chopping up all the wood that has been downstairs in my cellar since goodness knows when. Well I got it assembled but obviously hadn't put the chain on tight enough (I had protective gear on), so after a couple of goes decided to give up on that and have ordered a much smaller saw which should allow me to get through some of the smaller pieces at least. I had an insert installed in my fireplace in June (open fireplaces are illegal here now) and because of the way my chimney is built, I had to have the smallest one they had available - hence the necessity of cutting the logs up. Last night I decided it was time to try it out after I'd been a bit hesitant about it as the interior looked like it was made out of cardboard. It obviously wasn't and I soon had a decent little fire going now I've got the hang of it which, while it wouldn't be enough to heat the whole house, would certainly be quite pleasant on the rare occasions I actually sit downstairs (I'm thinking of everyone opening their presents on Christmas day)! One thing that does have me beaten (for the time being) is my old BBQ. I emptied my entire car out the other day, laid the back seats down and lugged that bloody thing around to the boot - and turns out it's probably an inch short on both sides to get it into the car. Bugger, but I'm still not giving up! When I've got more stuff sorted I'll probably rent a small van and lug the whole lot down to the recycling centre - that is if I can't find anyone going that way beforehand!I've also made quite a bit of headway on Christmas shopping, believe it or not, because as I think of something I drop into an online basket (not necessarily Amazon) and once I've made my mind up I just send off for it. In fact, I follow Very British Problems on FB and for the second time have ordered stuff from them as I like their sense of humour (last time I ordered their bestseller \"Born to be Mild\" and the kids and I got a good laugh out of it)! I know stereotypes exist for a reason but when I find myself laughing at some of the daft stuff they post I realize I am actually a stereotype myself. One of the most recent things they posted on FB was \"if you've just learned that a meteor the size of Wales is heading for earth right this minute, what would be your first thought\"? By the time I saw it there were over 500 comments, but one that really tickled me was \"oof, thank god I got the bins put out in time\"! I know, I'm a stereotype!I don't know if anyone else has noticed but Windows update number whatever seems to have permanently uploaded Bing onto my computer, and even though I've gone through all the \"how to disable/delete\" advice, I can't get rid of the bloody thing. If I go anywhere near the top right-hand side of my computer, Bing jumps out and asks if I would like to chat with AI??? No, actually, I just wish you'd bugger off! Despite that I seem to be having a massive clean up session on my phone and computer, and last night deleted about 400 photos from iCloud, about another 100 off my computer and phone and believe it or not deleted around 650 subscriptions to Youtube channels! I mean how the hell did I ever get subscribed to over 700 Youtube channels, one of which was called something like \"Canadian tax planning\"???? I've never been to Canada, unless you count changing planes at Toronto airport one time. It took me ages to unsubscribe from so many but boy was it worth it!And finally, I notice - in the British press at least - that they are singing the praises of the French Interior Minister who has promised on his honour and under his complete responsibility to immediately round up and deport all illegal immigrants on security watch in the wake of the recent stabbing of a high school teacher by a Chechen teenager who, like two of his brothers, was also on the security watch list. He swears \"on his honour\" that they and their ilk will be deported and the British media are singing the praises of this chest-thumping Tarzan. Trouble is, as is well known already, there is no way it will happen. Indeed they tried to deport this particular young man a few years ago and it was the then Interior Minister who blocked it. And even if it got that far he knows damn well the European Court of Human Rights will prevent it, so the minister (who is also under investigation for whatever, I believe) can stop posturing as he knows this particular young man is going nowhere! Wish there was a button to unsubscribe here as I can't bear him!"},
{"title": "Took a few days off!", "date": "Sunday 15 October 2023", "text": "It's been a really busy 10 days or so for me lately so I decided to spend some time offline again and ended up doing pretty much bugger all for a few days! Jen asked me if I could keep Charlie the other Friday so that she and Jordan (and a few others) could go help her mom set up in the village hall she had rented to celebrate her 60th birthday. She told me in advance that Charlie was \"a bit cranky\", but I don't think either of us realized just how miserable he was. He would be fine for a while - which was when I took him out to the play area opposite - and then all of a sudden his temperature would soar and he would be miserable as hell. I spent my time trying to cool him down and then otherwise distract him but at one point he was so hot he threw up all over the living room, so I had to hose him down in the shower and then sit with him while he, I and Mickey Mouse looked at pictures and videos of himself on my phone, as that seemed to be the only thing that pacified him! He was still awake at 11.30 pm when Jordan and Jen got home (although I had cleaned up the living room by that time) and it had been hard work all round!Next evening was the party, which also happened to be Jen's birthday, and I think everyone had a good time, although as Charlie was still cranky I and a few others spent a lot of time trying to distract him, yet again with Mickey Mouse in tow! He finally fell asleep around midnight and I left at 2 am after helping to clean up as much as possible. There were quite a few of us helping, to be fair, so it left very little for Jen's mom and her partner to do the next day! While I am a late bird by nature, I've realized that I can't pull these late night stints outside of my own home very often, but I guess that's what getting older does to most of us doesn't it!My kids and Jen jammin'!One thing I did realize that weekend though was one of the best ways to distract Charlie was to have Mickey Mouse \"be terrified\" all the time! At least it made him laugh and gave me the idea of buying glove puppets for him for Christmas. I think I'm going to buy him Punch and Judy puppets and no, I'm not worried about him turning into a thug even though in every Punch and Judy skit someone always gets bashed over the head with a rolling pin. Well I've never done that anyway, and I'm pretty sure rolling pins will probably be extinct by the time Charlie is older, so problem solved!Punch and Judy!Jen surprised her mom by booking a night's stay (23rd December) in one of the tree-top cabins at a safari park not too far from here. She's always wanted to stay somewhere overnight around Christmas so we all pitched in and we're all going (Jen, Jordan, Charlie, her mom and partner and André and me). It gives us entry into the park, dinner, an overnight stay and entry into the park again the next day, so I think she is looking forward to it. So am I actually because it's near a village called Peaugres, which is somewhere I've always wanted to visit and yet somehow never got around to it!Peaugres!For Jen's birthday we went in together to buy her a Cookeo - which is something she had also really wanted - so I would say the evening was a great success!CookeoI may or may not have picked something up off Charlie (although I doubt it), but that stupid cough I had about a month ago came back, and while it was nothing serious (I knew it hadn't gone down into my lungs), waking up every hour or so was probably the reason I was so lethargic for a few days. Well that is until I remembered my \"miracle cure\" of the last time (origano oil), took one drop of that in some hot water and about an hour later it was basically gone. Shame I didn't think of it sooner though! Mind you, I saw that they have opened a little Indian store in town right next to the Indian restaurant and when I spotted that they were selling palak paneer (a kind of spicy Indian spinach and tofu dish), I bought some to give to André as he loves it. I wanted to try it beforehand in case it was dreadful so I heated that up tonight and I reckon if the origano oil hadn't worked that would have because it nearly blew my nose off! In any case I reckon's that's André's Christmas present sorted then - a bowl of spinach (and cheap at half the price)!And finally, when I turn on my computer Microsoft (I'm guessing) sets a new picture as my opening imagine and the other day I thought this one looked familiar. Turns out it was Llanrwst, a small village in North Wales. Many years ago my grandad left my grandma and bought a small cobbler's shop in Llanrwst. I don't know if they ever divorced to be honest, but there was no other woman involved - he just couldn't stand living with my grandma anymore. In fact he tried to commit suicide one time and it was my poor mom, as a young teenager, that found him and saved his life. He continued to send money to my grandma but couldn't live with her and my mom once told me that while she couldn't accept him leaving at the time, as she got older she absolutely understood why he did it. I guess saying my grandma \"wasn't easy\" would be an understatement! Anyway, it was in Llanrwst that my brother Phil and his new bride finally found him (finding a specific \"Jones\" in Wales wouldn't exactly be the easiest thing to do) and that was how he got to meet back up with my mom again (and all of us) after goodness knows how many years. Sadly it wasn't to last long as he died of cancer a few years later, but at least he got to be part of our family for what little time he had left!Llanrwst(courtest of Trip Advisor and my computer screen)!Talking of Llanrwst, many, many years ago, before I moved to Switzerland, my then boyfriend worked at a car factory in Birmingham, and the company sometimes offered to let employees take cars for the week-end so that they could provide feedback on how they handled. Well they must have liked Mark because he got a Lotus Eclat (????) so we headed off to North Wales for the week-end. While the car was a lovely ride it was really low, and I distinctly remember going over that bridge praying that there wouldn't be another car coming in the opposite direction because we would hit it before we saw it. Thankfully there wasn't, but it had to be one of the best week-ends of a young man's life getting to drive that thing for free!Well it was the 1970s!And finally, when I worked the 10 months in England before I got my job in Switzerland, the transport manager asked me if I would go to London with him to pick up the Managing Director's new company car which, as it turned out was - you guessed it - a yellow Lotus Eclat and he let me drive it back. I was 20 at the time but looked about 16, and as I was driving round Birmingham city centre in it, the loathing from the older men was palpable - spoilt rich bitch right? Tee hee, if only they knew! But that car was quite a distinctive car and a couple of months later as I was on the bus coming back from an interview in London I spotted it passing us on the motorway. And sure enough, there was our Managing Director and a rather young woman (he would have been in his 50s I'm guessing). So me being me I mentioned to him that I thought I'd seen him coming up the motorway the other day and the frozen look on his face when he asked me exactly what I'd seen told me pretty much all I needed to know. He was apparently quite the (married) player but I guess you can never be too careful when driving a car that distinctive, can you!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 8 October 2023", "text": "The weather continues to be absolutely glorious here and I'm loving it. The high temperatures have disappeared and while it can be a bit nippy in the morning, by the afternoon it's just perfect! Definitely my kind of weather! With that in mind I realize I absolutely have to get out and start walking again before the snows come. I've let myself down pretty miserably this year on the walking front and have no real idea why - just lazy I guess. But the other day I started following a Haute Savoie hiking group on FB and the pictures they post are out of this world. I know I couldn't do most of these hikes because I'm just not fit enough, but the photos are pretty motivating - and to be honest, ain't none of us getting any younger are we, so if not now, then when?Last Saturday we had our monthly (take \"monthly\" with a pinch of salt\") board game evening at Jordan and Jen's and it was really fun. It was Jen's mom's 60th birthday that day and Jen had bought her a game - I forget the name of it - but it basically involved each of us drawing an image that would attempt to allow the same person to guess the word it represented, all while drawing against the clock. Jordan and I are absolutely useless at it as I try to go into too much detail and my pictures end up getting smaller and smaller and Jordan - well he's just crap! But we had such a great laugh, so if I can find the name of the game I'll have to get it for myself!I was chatting with V and telling her about my ongoing slow-motion bathroom refit and how the plumber tends to come over after he's done some other small job in the area. I don't mind it going slow at all (unlike Dave) but I mentioned it was good to know a plumber who would take on smaller jobs. So many of them wouldn't be interested but as V pointed out, building work has slowed right down because of price increases and difficulty in obtaining parts (apparently) so maybe that's why the trades are willing to take on the smaller jobs. Good point! My neighbour Isabelle was the only one (out of her family of four) to make it that night. Her husband is a James Bond geek and was in Paris attending a James Bond \"thingy\" for the weekend (how great is that!), while both her children are studying abroad. Her daughter's in Canada for a year and her son's in New Zealand for six months, so guess who'll be having the holiday(s) of a lifetime shortly! Last time the plumber came he was taking a ciggie break, so out of curiosity I asked him how much a carton of cigarettes was now - and nearly fell over when he told me around €115 for 200! Geez, it was around €55 when I used to buy them for my ex (in the vain hope of preventing him from going into town to buy them and then ending up in the sleazy bar opposite), but in any case he used to get through around two cartons a week so the cost would be about the same. Not that he actually smoked them - no, more often than not he used to just light them up, take a couple of drags and leave them to burn in the ashtray, so it truly was a case of money going up in smoke! But could you imagine spending around €800 per month on cigarettes??? I'm pretty sure that'd be a mortgage payment (or at least a car payment) for some. Another reason I'm so glad I never started!Our retirees' group organized a cocktail last Wednesday but for the first time I wasn't able to make it. I don't remember what I was doing but the photos were lovely and it's amazing how well everyone looks (if a little fatter, but then aren't we all). Retirement definitely seems to suit!My friend invited me out last Friday for a late birthday lunch. We went to a restaurant not too far from here and it was lovely. Neither of us had been there for a while and I reckon they must be doing a roaring trade as they've done it all up both inside and out!La Ferme à Elise restaurantI don't know how we got on the subject but we were talking about how neither of us are particularly creative. Maybe it was me talking about how easy it has been putting together all the paperwork to request French citizenship and how \"glad I was that I'm organized\". So she pipes up that she's organized too and then we get onto the lack of creativity bit. I'm convinced it's to do with left brain/right brain and while yes, I am glad I'm organized, it's hardly very exciting is it. It's like when someone says to \"follow your passion\" and you realize you don't have one! My friend laughed and said that hers probably used to be reading or doing word puzzles (again, not very exciting), so I said we could mess with people's heads and engrave her gravestone in the form of a crossword puzzle (two down, begins with a \"D\") - yeah I know, we both have a dark sense of humour, but it gave the guys sitting next to us a good laugh!Oh and as for the palaver last week with the Post Office website saying my village didn't exist, well thankfully that got resolved the next day so I guess someone somewhere was just having a bad day! But talking of websites, I heard someone mention the other day that her husband was trying to learn French online with Duolingo \"as it was free\", so out of curiosity I set up an account and have been \"learning\" Italian online for the last 10 days. So far I'm enjoying it and finding it pretty easy for the time being because I took a few lessons pre-covid, but I guess we'll see as we get further into it and move on from the basics!And finally, when taking stuff out to my compost bin the other day I was surprised to find a blue and white croc in the garden.One of these ...... not one of these!Intrigued I happened to mention it to Isabelle on Saturday night and she said she'd found one too, and thought it must be kids messing around at first. Turns out they belonged to our \"neighbour-in-the-middle\" and she said it was most likely a fox because they'd found another of their crocs chewed up at the bottom of the garden. Still, if anyone spots a rather stylish fox running around in matching blue and white footwear, please do me a favour and drop me a line in the comments!"},
{"title": "Getting back to normal!", "date": "Thursday 28 September 2023", "text": "Life has slowly been getting back to normal at my place - well as normal as it can be with the plumber and tiler trying to work around each other. To be honest it's been fine as the plumber comes for a few hours and then leaves, while waiting for the tiler to do his bit before he can carry on! And I have to say how impressed I am with how clean they leave the place. Of course there's dust but both pick up their mess as they go along and so far it hasn't been half as stressful as I thought it would be! It's gonna be slow getting things finished of course, but I can live with that - heck I ordered the fittings in January so I guess there's no rush is there!Yoga started back up a few weeks ago but I wasn't able to go because of having workmen in. That is until this Monday and boy was I glad to be back at it. After two months of no yoga I really missed it and even just one lesson a week sets me up for days on end. Sewing also started back up last Monday and it has been good to see everyone again, with two sisters who took a year off now rejoining the club. The last time I saw Marysette she was asking me about my solos trips (although I never really thought she would do anything about it) but lo and behold, she just sent us all a photo of her at Niagara Falls as part of her solos trip to Canada! I'm so pleased for her that she took that leap! There was a bit of a blip with flight delays and possibly missing her internal flight, but in the end it all worked out well, so I really hope she has a good experience. Then I bumped into the young lady manicurist (she of the dinky little pink caravan) at the recycling centre and she was asking me for more info as her mom is my age and very interested in doing something similar, although again with a French-speaking group! And again, I hope she does it. I've only heard one person being really negative about her solos trip but then this lady is negative about pretty much everything so I take that with a pinch of salt!The weather is a lot cooler but still glorious and as expected my energy started coming back. The summer heat knocks me back every year so I really don't know why it surprises me. Hmmm, maybe I should start spending my summers back in the UK to get away from the heat - now there's an idea! Go back home and visit all the places I've missed over the years! The state of the house has been bugging me again so I've started setting my timer and trying to get in at least a one hour stint of decluttering/putting the garden to bed every day and it really does seem to be a system that works for me. It's amazing how much you can get done in just one hour, even to the point that those annoying little jobs are also getting done when I reach minute 50 and have to find something to fill the next 10 minutes! It's silly really, but as I say, it sure is working! I've taken so many trips to the recycling centre/charity shop that even my cluttered up basement is starting to look a little better. You know, getting rid of all those plastic plant pots I was keeping because obviously every spring I'm going to have a lush exotic garden full of organic fruit and veg! Nah, not gonna happen. I think I'll just buy it at the health food store next year! But, for the second year running I see that a local environmental group has set up a small wood-chipping truck that will come to your home and put all your hedge trimmings etc. through it at no cost to you and leaving you with all the free chippings and/or mulch. They've also set up a scheme whereby for the month of October people can try out battery-assisted bikes for free to try to encourage more people to use them and the local bus service is free to everyone, again for the month of October! Great initiatives all round, but one that really cheered me was a scheme called Pedibus, where for a very small fee children can be signed up as part of accompanied groups from the local villages walking to and from school. Over here walking to school is very feasible for the most part, so I really hope it takes off!Jordan started his new job a couple of weeks ago, working in a two-man team for the director of his former company (you know, the one that's going bust because the owner has seemingly \"disappeared\" a lot of money) and who started up his own company in the local area. He enjoys working with Christophe and they pretty much have carte blanche to order any equipment they need - the boss just tells them to go ahead and order it and send him the bill! And talking of career plans, Jen has so much patience with Charlie and spends lots of time reading, playing and working with him and it's really paying off. She routinely has him sitting on her lap while she's cutting up vegetables and just last week bought him a \"trainer knife\" for children (I know, I was thinking the same thing)! Apparently they cannot cut themselves with it but it allows them to develop knife skills, so now Charlie is mainly responsible for all veggie prep in the evenings. They could be on to something there!Move over Jamie Oliver!Finally, thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes. I must admit 65 felt a little weird as this would be the birthday by which I had to retire from work. In fact, tomorrow would have been my last day had I not decided to retire five years early (still no regrets). As I've mentioned before, the fact that I'm now 65 fulfils the final condition for me to request French citizenship via ascendency (i.e. through Charlie), which is pretty much a given, assuming I haven't spent more than six months in prison (I haven't, I got divorced instead). So the other day I printed off a list of all the paperwork I would need and it wasn't too bad actually as I had most of it anyway, and already translated into French. The only two documents that I have to request are (yet another) copy of my divorce paperwork, and a copy of Charlie's birth certificate. I still find it confusing that documents issued by the French authorities have to be less than three months old. I mean nothing changes the fact that I got divorced on 23 December 2011 right? Well Jen was explaining that apparently French administrative papers are actually a \"living\" document, I guess drawn from a database, so if I were ever to get remarried in France (not gonna happen), my new marriage certificate would state \"formerly married and divorced from P on dates X and Y\"! She finds it strange that our administrative documents are \"static\" documents, but in the case of my divorce paperwork I'm guessing a more recent copy would also reflect any subsequent marriage. Confusing isn't it!So last night I filled out the form to request a more recent copy of my divorce paperwork - which was pretty easy and only took about 10 minutes. In order for them to send it back to me I had to include a pre-paid envelope so then I set to to print a stamp off the French post office site (a system introduced in January of this year) but what a nightmare it was. I had also ordered a bunch of labels suitable to print stamps on (rather than having my stamps split over two labels), but when I went to pay for them and they asked for the delivery address, the web site kept spitting out that my village was \"unknown to the post office\"! Say what????? I spotted that the next village over was also missing from the list and yet they've been delivering my mail to me at this address for the past 33 years! After about an hour I was pulling my hair out so I'm guessing it was a simple case of \"computer sez no\", but eventually I got the bloody thing printed and mailed off. On the positive side, they don't charge for it, unlike the Swiss who charged me SF 33 for a copy of Jordan's birth certificate this morning!!!!So slowly but surely I feel like I'm getting somewhere and who knows, maybe by the time the next General Election takes place in the UK I will have my voting rights reinstated (British in Europe are working on it) and maybe, just maybe, I'll even get to vote in the next French and European elections. A girl can dream, can't she!"},
{"title": "More Mallorca!", "date": "Saturday 23 September 2023", "text": "I figured I'd better get back to journaling about my trip before I forget it all, but I've been a bit busy since I got back. So after our island tour I took the following day as a kind of laze around day, just going for a walk along the beach (although not as far as the nudist beach!!!) and reading by the pool. I can highly recommend it - having absolutely nothing to do, that is. Anyway the next day six of us had booked a trip to Palma, Mallorca's capital - me, the three Scottish ladies, and Irene and M (The One)! The trip there was a bit tedious because the guide did his spiel first in Spanish, then in English and finally in German but since people had booked different tours in Palma I guess he had to labour the detail a little! Our ticket basically just gave us a ride there and back, but people getting on at other hotels had different coloured tickets, which indicated maybe the aquarium tour and/or the guided tour of the cathedral. None of that was an option for us, but I was fine with that as I like to do my own thing anyway.When we got off the bus the guide explained that the aquarium people should be at this spot at 10.30 and the cathedral people at noon, and M was adamant that they were booked on the cathedral tour. I told her she wasn't as that wasn't offered at our hotel but she was having none of it. In the end I've no idea if they showed up for the cathedral tour but Bernie, the little Scottish lady, just laughed and said to let them get on with it! So the four of us set off for a coffee in what looked like the old town and then wandered down the back streets to find a restaurant for lunch off the main drag and in the shade. We found just what we were looking for and were enjoying a meal of tapas when up comes a man who sets up his keyboard and started blasting out very bad music which meant we couldn't hear to speak to each other. I used to get that a lot when I worked in central Geneva, the guy who wandered round the restaurants playing three bars of Rawhide and then came round with the hat and it drove me mad - every single day! Mind you when Karen said \"I wish Richard Clayderman would bugger off\" we all cracked up - and maybe he heard because he packed up and left not long after that!After that we spent an hour wandering round the old town and the cathedral but as it was so hot we were only too glad when we got back down to the harbour to wait for the bus in a shaded café!Palma cathedral!Later that evening a young man came in who played soul music so for once I sat and listened as I love soul. He wasn't bad but the heat was a killer so I left around 11.30 pm just to get out of it! The next day was another \"do nothing\" kind of day until later that evening when the guide came over to me and asked if I spoke Spanish (I can get by, but I'm not fluent), because apparently Irene and M were at the police station and the hotel receptionist didn't speak enough English to explain what had happened. Well it turned out that Irene and M had taken a taxi to Alcúdia and sat down in a restaurant when M decided it was too expensive and got up to leave. At this point I think Irene had had enough and offered to pay for her meal but M was already out the door, so Irene grabbed her purse and ran after her. It was only when she got to the next restaurant that Irene realized she'd left her small shoulder bag with her papers, money and phone at the previous restaurant and went running back to get it, only for it to be gone. The people at the next table said that nobody had been at that table since they left except for the wait staff so it was pretty obvious who had taken it! At this point the owner refused to give Irene the restaurant's phone number and virtually threw her out the door and told the people at the other table to stop talking to them!!!!! The big worry, of course, was did Irene have her passport in that bag as we were leaving the next day, but the hotel receptionist told us that even with Irene's permission she could not go into her room and open the safe, so we just had to pray she had left it in her room (she had, as it turned out)! While I was chatting with our guide the receptionist came over to me and said that a gentleman needed her to go with him to his room for some reason, and she was letting me know that she was going up to room 152 - if you get my drift! To be honest I'd never thought about that kind of thing but she just wanted someone to know where she was in case anything happened. I guess they see it all in hotels, don't they!Later that evening our guide bought me a drink for helping her out and we ended up having a long chat about this and that - and it came out that her first husband had been extremely violent, one time throwing her through a glass door into the garden and that she would have bled to death if the neighbour hadn't seen her through the kitchen window lying on the back patio!!! Crikey, I wasn't expecting that, but she did send me a text message after she got back to England thanking me for allowing her to open up like that!The trip back was a bloody nightmare, with my flight ending up being delayed six hours and Easyjet changing the gate number from gate C44, to C62 and back to C39 all while making no announcement of the gate change over the tannoy! So I got back around midnight and threw a load of washing in because of course the plumber was coming at 8 am the next morning to start work!!!! Then I got a call from the chimney sweep, who had tried to set up an appointment while I was in Mallorca, and he asked if he could come in an hour's time too. So at one point I had a man running a vacuum upstairs with another man running a vacuum downstairs - that surely must be a Women's Libber's wet dream!It was only when I got back that I heard about the earthquake in Morocco and realized that my neighbours had been there at the time. They were in Agadir and said they were in bed on the fourth floor of the hotel when it started swaying like crazy! Nobody was killed in Agadir (most of the victims were in the Atlas mountains and Marrakesh), but one man had a heart attack and died from the fright. I can't even begin to imagine how frightening that must have been!And finally, last Sunday was our \"clean up the neighbourhood\" day and we lucked out in that we had good weather all day - only for a torrential downpour to hit right after we'd cleaned up. And now life returns to normal - or as normal as it can be with a plumber and tiler traipsing through the house most days. Still, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs can you!Oh and get this, tomorrow is my birthday but this morning I had a \"happy birthday\" text message from the young man that I dated briefly after my husband left. He lives in Berne and the relationship kinda just ran its course but we parted on friendly terms. So today he texts me and we end up chatting off and on all day, It's hard to believe we hadn't spoken in about 14 years and then just picked back up where we left off! How weird is that!"},
{"title": "Island tour!", "date": "Saturday 16 September 2023", "text": "Later in the evening of our first night our group was joined by an Irish man who flew in from Dublin (quite the character) and two older ladies who arrived from Manchester. These two ladies reminded me a little of The Odd Couple. Irene had obviously been quite the looker in her younger years and was indeed still very glamorous and sociable. M - her companion - was the complete opposite, a kinda \"quieter than a church mouse\" type. I did get to speak to M a few times because she had at one time owned a house in Normandy (and apparently very much regretted selling it) but others said that when they tried chatting to her about the many solo trips she had taken she pretty much blew them off! That kind of thing doesn't bother me much because I just do my own thing anyway, but I heard later in the week that things were somewhat tense between Irene and M because Irene wanted to do more things with the group but ended up \"having\" to stay with M all the time! Hence I don't travel with anyone on these trips 'cos my days of having a regimented schedule are well and truly over! Anyway, I mention this as it's relevant because of what happened on the last night! More to follow!There was also another couple of Scottish women travelling together and who also seemed to fit The Odd Couple mold somewhat. They too had slight tensions during the trip but ended up being okay together for the most part. I got along really well with the outgoing Scottish lady but the quieter lady had actually had quite the life too, it turns out. She had been born in India (her father was manager of a tea plantation) but when she was six her grandmother in Scotland had become seriously ill so A (the quiet lady) was shipped off to boarding school in Scotland and she hated it! She said she had never seen anywhere so cold, wet and grey in all her life, but I suppose having been born in India that was a normal reaction. Ultimately she ended up loving Scotland but said it wasn't easy at first. And Mrs. Quiet Lady had also travelled all over - although Asia was her main love, for obvious reasons! There was also another quiet lady who I put in her mid-70s (as did others) but turns out she was only 68 and she had been doing the solo travelling thing for the past 18 years. She seemed to have been everywhere and was such an interesting person to talk to, so I guess it really is true that you should never judge a book by its cover!Anyway, the next day six of us signed up for the aforementioned island tour and it was wonderful, if a little hectic! Our first stop was in a town called Inca to visit a leather goods outlet. Mallorca is known for its leather goods and cultured pearls and their wares really were lovely and very reasonably priced, but in the end I realized that I actually don't need any more stuff. I really do have everything I need in that department so decided (reluctantly) to pass! After that we ended up crawling over a hair-raising horseshoe pass to get to our first stop where we would pick up the boat. Hats off to the bus driver is all I can say!This was the \"easy\" bit. We had crawledthrough forests with steep drops over the sidefor an hour previous to this!Our guide said the locals refer to this pass as the Ay Maria pass (or basically the \"oh my god\" pass) and you can see why! Anyway, we made it out alive in time for a quick lunch and then boarded the boat to circle further down the island, heading for the beautiful port of Soller!I had to laugh at this one because some time ago I wrote about driving up a hair-raising road to get to the Plâteau de Cenise and nearly laying an egg en route. Well when I got back this picture popped up on Facebook showing just how nasty that road really is! Never again says I!I had been to Mallorca many, many years ago with my boyfriend and I remember Soller being stunning then, and of course it still is. André told me that he and his then wife took her grandma to Soller for a holiday and she just loved it (I'm not surprised)!This is a google picture of Soller, as I couldn't getmy head out of the train window quick enoughto take a decent picture!After a quick lunch in Soller we caught the rickety old tram for a few km up to the town of Soller and from there hopped on the train for a one hour ride back to our bus!Another google picture I'm afraid!13th century church!Town centre!When we got back to our hotel our guide asked us what we thought of the trip and we all said it was great, if a little rushed because of having to marry up with boat/tram/train timetables. Well all of us, except Irene and M, one of whom had apparently complained that at their ages (mid-70s I would guess) it was disgusting that they had to stand on the 3km tram ride! My eyes almost popped out on stalks because twice I had offered Irene my seat and she waved it away and the younger Scottish girl in front of me had done the same. I'm guessing it was M who was bitching then but we both put the guide very much straight about what really happened. As I say, there's always one isn't there!That evening it was back to the hotel for a quick shower and dinner in an excellent Argentinian restaurant on the beach where the food (and the margaritas) was wonderful and very reasonably priced. In fact the food throughout Mallorca was consistently good so guess who's gonna have to go on a diet now that she's back!"},
{"title": "Home sweet home!", "date": "Friday 15 September 2023", "text": "Well my first Solos holiday in over four years has come and gone and no surprise there but I thoroughly enjoyed it yet again! Even though it was only just over a week long, I felt like I'd been away for about a month and needless to say, the travel itch is well and truly back and just waiting to be scratched!I hadn't been getting much sleep the week prior as I had this stupid cough which, while it wasn't particularly severe, was enough to wake me up pretty much on the hour every hour. Then I happened to spot another video by one of my favourite Youtube doctors where he recommended putting Vicks on the soles of your feet and explained why it might help ease the coughing - and bugger me but didn't it just work!!!! My friend dropped me at the train station in La Roche, which turned into something of a nightmare. The ticket machine must have come out of the arc as it was very user-unfriendly so I went to the service counter to confirm that the ticket I finally managed to buy would indeed take me all the way to the airport - which it did (not that anybody checked it though). I then asked how I could get over to the other platform and the lady told me to \"go out of the station, turn right and I would find the underpass there\". So I did just that, left the station (in scorching heat), crossed over at the level crossing - and ended up on a construction site, so had to turn round and retrace my steps. It was only when I was almost back at the station that I realized I'd dropped my cardigan so had to lug my case back to the construction site, all the while thinking I'd gotten there so early but if I didn't get a move on I might still end up missing the train! When I finally located the underpass I was horrified to see that it consisted of 40 steps (20 down and 20 up) - no ramp and no lift! What the flip???? I mean what about people with heavy luggage, or pushchairs, or wheelchairs - or people who simply couldn't physically manage it? By the time I'd gotten my case up to the 30th step I thought I might have a coronary and that's when a kind young man picked it up and carried it the last 10 steps. Even though the airline allowed 23kg I had only packed 14kg but it still felt like I was transporting dumbbells! What a stupid set-up for a railway station - but at least I figured out a solution for next time and that would be to get on a stop earlier where there are no steps at all as everything is on the flat!When I got to Geneva train station I had to change trains to go to the airport and that was when a Roma gypsy woman and her two kids decided that they weren't going to take the escalator after all but would follow me into the lift - all the easier to trap me and ask for money, you see. Well I was hot and sweaty at this point and told her exactly where to get off! In the end I got to the airport too early to check-in, but when I saw the crowds in the food hall I decided to take myself up to the fancy restaurant on the top floor and while away the next couple of hours in relative peace!The flight to Mallorca was uneventful but the Spanish have this disconcerting habit of clapping when the pilot lands - which might lead one to think he wasn't normally very good at that kind of thing right? Anyhoo, I'd booked a hotel near the airport for the night and very nice it was too - although the mattress was a bit softer than I like so it felt somewhat like I was sleeping in a dish of rice pudding. I had thought I'd get washed up and go out for dinner but in the end I just bought a sandwich and a bottle of water and had an early night. Then next day it was back to the airport to meet up with the main group and head north to our hotel for the duration!Everyone had been on at least one Solos trip before and it turned out to be a nice group - with no \"pain in the bum\" types like there usually is. As it happens that turned out to be not quite accurate, but that's a story for another day.The resort wasn't quite what I expected in that it seemed to be more of a party resort but in the end I quite liked it and the party animals in our group had plenty to keep them occupied! The \"Bee Gees\" were playing at one of the bars the night we arrived, followed the next night by Michael Jackson. I didn't go to any of those shows but had a great time on the lovely beach the next day where I had a foot/leg massage by a Vietnamese man with fingers of steel - absolute bliss!The next day was market day so a few of us had a wonderful time wandering up and down the stalls until we could take the heat no more. One of the ladies talked me into buying a new bikini and we ended up roaring laughing with the lady stall-holder as she was flogging her wares. When I got back to my hotel room I tried that thing on and while it did indeed fit I honestly looked like a Rubik's cube with a pair of knickers on, so out came my tried and trusted \"whale harness\" and off to the beach I went again that afternoon where I found out that \"Madonna\" was playing in another bar later that evening. I never went of course, but it was nice to have some quiet time in anticipation of a couple of fast-paced trips we had lined up over the next few days. More on that tomorrow!"},

{"title": "Summer's back!", "date": "Sunday 20 August 2023", "text": "Well after weeks of pretty crappy weather, summer seems to be back with a vengeance. It's forecast 35°C tomorrow (95°F) and while many places get it hotter, that's plenty hot enough for me. Too hot actually, but thankfully those temperatures tend to last only about four weeks before dropping back down. Still, at least where we are we (hopefully) don't get the awful wild fires that we're seeing (mainly in Canada and Maui right now) - my heart breaks for the people caught up in that nightmare! I don't like to have the windows open at night (bugs and other creep-crawlies) but it has been hellish hot without AC, so I might put my little mobile unit on until this heat breaks!Last Tuesday was a holiday here (Assumption), although why the French have 15 August as a holiday and not Good Friday beats me - but then I'm not Catholic so what would I know! With that in mind, the people in the white house you can see across the field in my header picture decided to have a party last Monday night and were at it all night long! Not loud music or anything like that, but just loads of people screaming and yelling (though thankfully not fighting). I read until 3 a.m. and then must have fallen asleep until more yelling woke me at 5 a.m. and then I was done. I'm a bit surprised at it actually because the French have pretty strict rules about just how much noise you can make (or how long it can go on for) but I guess this one slipped through the net. Then on Tuesday (which was the holiday) my neighbour must have decided it was a good day to drill everything within a 10 mile radius so that was me done for the day! Still, it doesn't happen that often so I guess you have to go with the flow, even if it did feel a bit like this at times!While I was making dinner the other night, I realized that the gas flame wasn't burning very hot, which must mean that my gas bottle was running out. We don't have mains gas here so have to buy those large gas bottles that you used to see on a BBQ. Man I know I'm getting old because lugging the empty bottle down to the supermarket was bad enough but getting the full bottle off the top rack nearly killed me!!! I always have a spare on hand but could I get the damn thing to work!!!! I've changed these bottles many, many times but this time I took the sealant rings off both joints - and then realized what a stupid thing that was to do, so put them both back on and decided to sleep on it. Well next day, as often happens, I decided that \"the gauge\" (looked a bit like this):... probably needed to be in the horizontal position and bingo, it works so crisis averted! While I was running around I popped into LIDL for a few things. They'd got six crates of tomatoes for sale on an end aisle and I was pretty perturbed to see a couple bagging up the whole lot (all six crates) and clearing them all out! I guess they were going to be making a lot of tomato sauce at some point but I do think they might have left a few in case other people wanted some! Not me, because I don't buy my produce there but surely there has to be some kind of etiquette for that kind of thing - or maybe not!Jordan and Jen arrived back from Brittany having had a wonderful time. They said the initial dismal weather didn't really bother them that much as they had so many places they wanted to visit anyway. They decided to stop off on the way back to spend a few days with Jen's grandparents, and wouldn't you know but Charlie - who had been great the whole time - decided it was his time to be cranky as hell! Maybe the heat was getting to him at this point but ....! While they were away Jordan received a job offer from the new firm starting up in this area and is going to accept it - starting work with his friend, Christophe, on 11 September, so they are both delighted!I mentioned to my friend that La Clusaz were having a craft fair on Tuesday and did she want to go (of course she did), so we mosied up there in time to have lunch and then a wander round the fair - except we couldn't find it! I mentioned to a lady sitting next to us at the restaurant (who looked a \"craft fair\" kinda lady) and she said they hadn't found it either, so I'm guessing the advertising was messed up. Still, with La Clusaz being my favourite ski resort it's never a hardship to drive up there and it got us out the house (without spending too much money either)!La Clusaz!In other news, I was saddened to hear of the death of chat show host Michael Parkinson last week. Oh he was a fair age and hadn't been well for some time, but I remember as a kid really enjoying his shows as he allowed his guests to shine, rather than holding forth with some monologue of his own. Still, what an amazing life he had, and he had to have met some of the most interesting people over his 50-year career span!And talking of going back 50-ish years, I wrote in a recent post about the young woman who has set up a mobile manicure unit with the help of a small grant from the local commune. Well in order to show solidarity I stopped in for a mani-pedi (only the second I've ever had in my life!!!) on Monday and it was wonderful! Her little caravan transports you back to the 1950s-60s and I came out of there humming the theme tune from Austin Powers (but with slightly better teeth)! I hope she can make this work for her, and if so I will definitely keep going!I'll have to buy this outfit for my next visit!"},
{"title": "Ouch (again)!", "date": "Wednesday 9 August 2023", "text": "I got a notification from Easyjet yesterday that I could now download my boarding pass for my trip to Mallorca in early September. After much faffing around I got it done and printed off the list of things I don't want to forget for my trip. It's been over four years since I was in Sri Lanka and that being my last big trip I'm obviously a bit rusty at this travel malarky! One of the things I want to take with me is my kindle as it's good to have something to read during the down times. About 18 months ago Amazon contacted me to let me know that my old kindle (bought in 2010 I think) was no longer supported by their system so I reluctantly bought a new cheapo kindle to replace it. I don't like it as much as my old one, but when I started downloading books onto it, I noticed that they were also downloading onto my defunct old kindle (?) so I'm still going to use that. What a rip off though right? When I travelled previously I also used to take my clunky old iPad as I like a bigger screen than my phone, so when I saw it sitting forlornly in a drawer I decided to charge it and bingo, it still works, so I'll be taking that too!The weather here this past month has been bloody awful. Not cold exactly, but grey, wet and depressing for the most part. Last week La Roche hosted its annual Blue Grass festival and while it wasn't exactly rained out, I'm sure there would have been a much bigger attendance if we'd had better weather. It's such a shame as bands come from all over the world and the organizers put so much work into it, but what can you do? Nothing right?Jordan and Jen are still in Brittany and they're having pretty much the same weather as we are. It hasn't mattered to Charlie much as there's still plenty to amuse him, but I feel so sorry for parents in particular who are hoping to amuse their kids with days at the beach and who then end up having to fork out hard earned cash on indoor attractions due to the bad weather! When I was on maternity leave with Jordan I drove home to England for a few weeks and the weather was so bad one day that we decided to take the kids to an indoor water attraction called Splashdown. I commented to my sister that it must have been so hard on one young family who were there with their four young kids - spending money they probably wouldn't have had to if they could have spent the day on the beach. I well remember back in 1966 (the last time England won the World Cup!!!!), my parents had taken us to the south coast of England and the weather was appalling! We were staying in a bed & breakfast and the owner very kindly invited everyone into his personal sitting room to watch the match - all the while it absolutely bucketed down outside! Another wet day mom and dad took us to the cinema (we saw Born Free) and while we kids probably loved every minute of it, I'm pretty sure it burned quite a hole in their planned spending money for our holiday! In fact I called my sister on Saturday as it was her birthday and it was absolutely bucketing it down. So summer in England then! At least this week weather here is back to normal temperatures but it's been a long time coming, I can tell you! (Katie telling it like it is).On Monday I decided to have another shot at finding a store called Leclerc in the local town of  Annemasse. I hate Annemasse - it's like a rabbit warren, all one way streets, quite a few lunatic drivers and roadworks everywhere. I've tried to find this store a couple of times already and given up in frustration. Anyway, it was par for the course again on Monday and just as I'd decided to give up and go home, I realized I was right next to the entrance to the parking lot! So I finally got to check it out and I have to say the prices seem to be as reasonable as I'd heard and it was a very pleasant store to shop in (once you'd got the lay of the land I suppose), but I'm not sure my nerves could stand another round of trying to find my way around Annemasse so decided I'll just stick with the stores I already know!Then yesterday my friend and I decided that we really wanted to get back into walking again (neither of us have done much of anything lately) and since the weather picked up we decided to head off for a \"stroll\" around the lac de Montriond! It's a beautiful lake but I hardly ever stop there since we always seem to just pass it on our way up to Les Lindarets (the village where the goats are allowed to run free!Lac de Montriond(Haute Savoie photos)Les Lindarets(France Comfort photos)Anyway, we were almost there when we realized we (i.e. I) had taken a wrong turn and we ended up at another lake called le lac Bleu, so decided that was just as good as anywhere for a shortish walk. Everything was going pretty well and it only took us about an hour to walk from one lake to the next, but on the way back to the car we decided to try another route - and ended up going waayyyy out of our way, sloshing through mud and fallen trees, and coming out at a dead end and having to go back the way we came. I got bogged down in mud trying to get through one spot, and my friend went flying in another, but thankfully landed on her side rather than her dodgy knee, so after much cussing and swearing, putting in 20,000 steps and almost 10 miles, we finally made it back to the original lake looking like something the cat'd dragged in! So yeah, we wanted to start walking again, but I don't think either of us had bargained on that! My knee has been giving me some gyp for quite some time now and yesterday did it no favours, so today I tried out a few exercises that Dr. Youtube suggested and while at one point I thought I'd just moved the pain from one spot to another, since this afternoon the pain has completely gone! Isn't Youtube amazing! We've got another walk planned for next week so I'll see if my knee holds out till then - here's hoping!le lac Bleu!Part of the \"obstacle course\"!"},
{"title": "Proceed with caution!", "date": "Wednesday 2 August 2023", "text": "Well how about that global warming then! So far I think we've had the crappiest summer I can remember in a long time. While we've had a few hot days, temperatures in general have been much cooler - which I really appreciate, of course - but couple that with grey skies and peeing down rain and it's not much fun. Oh and a serious hail storm last week! Jordan and Jen are in Brittany on vacation and while they've had a few good days, the sea has been too cold to swim and the wind is blowing a hoolie. I don't think they'll mind too much though as they must both be glad of the break! Just before they left Jordan had an interview for the new position (two-man team) being set up in this area. He has reason to be more than hopeful as Christophe (his previous supervisor) has told the new guy that he wants Jordan on his team. I asked Jordan if he ever found out what the €1.5 million debt was for his previous company and he said he thought it was just pure mismanagement/theft to be honest. Apparently at one point the owner somehow (allegedly) managed to transfer €300,000 out of the business acount with no apparent paper trail, so I guess his house of cards is now coming tumbling down, so much so that when administrators were called in they found him at the Pont de la Caille! There's only one reason anyone goes to the Pont de la Caille, but thankfully they caught him before he did anything stupid - for now, I suppose!Pont de la Caille!Also before they left I got a call from Parchet, my heating system service group where Jen is now working. She spotted that they hadn't done a service for me in over two years so booked me in before she left. I told her it wasn't a problem as I had cancelled the last one since my new system had just been installed. Anyway, \"the guy\" come out last week - so there went another €300 I hadn't budgeted for. Still, you can't let these things just drag on, can you! Then the roofing guy I mentioned in my last post showed up to do some of the repairs he had talked about. When he took one look at my chimney he told me how dangerous it was. I knew this was true because I'd been told about it before, but when he showed me pictures the entire \"hat\" was cracked and if it had flown off it could have done serious damage. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at that because it's the original chimney from when the house was built in 1979, but I think I just kept putting it off until .... well who knows until when! He then showed me pictures of the top tiles that must have been lifted up slightly in the dreadful storm we had about a month ago, so I took a good look, and sure enough at the front of the house the tiles had become dislodged too. Well of course it all had to be fixed, and I give him and his young assistant absolutely 10/10 for hard work as they were up and down those ladders in the scorching heat, and the main guy was certainly no spring chick - all the more so since they were dodging wasps' nests to boot. When he got round to fixing the front tiles he pulled out one of the wooden slats that the tiles sit on and told me that they were pretty much all rotten. Now since I'd had the roof re-insulated only about 18 months ago, wouldn't you think they would have told me about it????? Well the end result is that he put in a new chimney, a few new tiles, and new slats where he could on the understanding that he would stop by this time next year and see what he could do then (i.e. when I can afford it). So again, another €2,500 I hadn't budgeted for, but I suppose needs must! Add to that I'm waiting for my dentist and gynae bills to come in and my poor bank account must feel like it's on life support! Still, it could have been worse (it always can can't it) because the other morning when I went to unlock my front door I realized that while I had actually locked it, I hadn't closed it properly and the front door had blown wide open during the night! So while I suppose I could have been murdered in my sleep, they'd have been  disappointed at this point if they'd thought I was worth robbing. Ya see, every cloud has a silver lining for an eternal optimist!I also saw last week that political figure, Nigel Farage, announced that his bank accounts with Coutts Bank (the rich people's bank) had been summarily closed in May due to his \"having insufficient funds\" (you need at least £1 million)! The next day these details were announced (???) on the BBC so he furiously put in for a kind of \"freedom of information\" from the bank which, when it was eventually supplied, turns out it was never a question of funds but more that they didn't like his political leanings. Well I'm not too keen on a lot of his political stances either. However I very much admire a person that doesn't take it lying down and since Farage had the clout and the audience, he did indeed come out swinging, so much so that he is now in the process of renegotiating with Coutts (I'd tell 'em to get stuffed, but then that's just me), the head of Coutts has resigned from her £5 million per year job, and the BBC have had to issue an apology. And I should think so too - I mean, who the hell did that woman think she was, discussing Farage's banking details at a dinner party! But Farage isn't stopping there. He's now set up a website to help other people who have been debanked with no reason given and is receiving tremendous support from the public (you can read about it here). Way to go Nigel. I guess they messed with the wrong man this time!And finally, I woke up feeling like crap about 10 days ago and reckoned I'd gotten a dose of sinusitis. Me being me I thought I'd just let it run its course and keep using the saline solution in the hopes it would eventually disappear - except it didn't! After almost two weeks of feeling like crud I happened to spot a Youtube video by one of my favourite doctors, and he mentioned that oregano oil was very good for getting rid of sinus pain. In the comments someone pointed out that it tasted awful but he had gotten used to taking two drops in hot water every morning and it worked wonders! So I ran out and bought some oregano oil and as it said to add five drops to a drink that's what I did, adding it to honey/lemon tea to hopefully take the taste away. Well I don't know about taking the taste away - that thing almost blew the top of my head off. Seriously! But, about two hours later I was already feeling much better and by the next day I was almost back to normal. So much so that after almost two weeks of doing bugger all I managed to sort two bags of clothes for the charity bins, take a crate of food down to the food bank and a carload of stuff out to the big charity shop about 30 minutes away. So as far as I'm concerned that stuff works. All I can say if you decide to give it a go is please proceed with caution! It's explosive!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 16 July 2023", "text": "I've been pretty lazy again lately and it was starting to get me down but then I realized I'm always like that this time of year - it's the heat ya see! And of course, as soon as September rolls around I'm up and running again like the Energizer Bunny! It's been hitting around 90° regularly here and not having A/C it can get pretty miserable of course. Oh I have a small ventilator unit that I sit in front of and last night I put a mobile A/C unit on for a short while in my bedroom, but more often than not homes don't have A/C here - just shops and offices!Anyway last week I decided to take advantage of the A/C at the mall down in Annecy as I wanted to pick up some garlic salt (it's not easy to find here) and look for a couple of bottom sheets for my bed. So I called my friend and asked if she wanted to go with me and then maybe head off to the Jardins Secrets, which is only about 15 minutes from there. I first went there about five years ago and loved it. Then I took my family when they were over here four years ago for Jordan's wedding and while they liked it, they weren't as enthralled as I was. This friend had repeatedly said she wanted to go so we set off to hit the mall before the 2 p.m. opening of the gardens! When we got to the mall I commented that the parking was pretty full considering the kids were still in school, but when we got inside we realized that the July sales were still on (I never pay attention to that stuff). So was it fortuitous or disastrous? Who knows! We had a nice lunch but my garlic salt ended up costing me €192 - who knew you needed a shopping trolley to buy garlic salt?We made it to the gardens around 2.30 p.m. and I think my friend loved it even more than I initially did (although the pictures don't do it justice). The flowers were in full bloom, there was so much to see, and sitting having a drink and a beignet at the end we were entertained by Alain, the husband side of the original man and wife team that had built the place. He was a real character!Alain, the owner - making beignets!The riyadh!Then Friday was Bastille Day - French national day - and since we were planning to have our latest board game evening on Saturday Jen's mom suggested we have it at her place on the Friday instead so we could watch the fireworks. We had a lovely evening and Charlie had great fun kicking a ball around, while being watched by the little boy on the first floor balcony. Jen's mom was saying that he frequently throws things over the balcony and she has to take them up to give them back, so I suggested she get them to tie a basket and string to the balcony and do the transfer like that - and maybe she could get to know them better that way! Jen laughed because when Charlie throws things over their balcony, one of the neighbours on the ground floor just sticks whatever it is in the lift and sends them a message to say \"incoming\" - and Jen runs out to meet the lift door! Meanwhile Macron was booed at the Bastille Day parade, while Professor Didier Raoult was cheered (see here). Prof. Raoult is one of France's top microbiologists, specialising in infectious diseases and who went head to head with the government over its handling of covid - and was thoroughly abused for his pains)!And what's going on with the French Post Office then! Apparently since 1 January you've pretty much got to \"conjure up\" your own stamps etc. online and drop your mail off at designated drop spots without ever seeing the inside of a post office if possible. Well I tried to avoid that kerfuffle for as long as possible, but I recently saw a post about a little boy in Pennsylvania suffering from leukeamia who was asking for postcards and decided to send him one. Except what I picked out was huge, too big to go in a regular mailbox and I couldn't find an envelope for it anyway, so I had to wrap it in brown paper like a parcel, and then gear up for registering my \"parcel\", and buying and printing my stamps online. I have to say, however, that when the little \"can I help\" chat box popped up I was expecting a bot, but ended up having a lovely chat with a really helpful chappie called Arnaud in Brittany. When I told him what I was doing he asked for the lad's address, so now Carson is going to get a post card from Arnaud at the French post office in Brittany too. How nice is that!Then the other day \"the guy\" showed up to paint the underside of several neighbours' roofs and asked if I was interested. I don't know what you call it actually - it's the copper \"plank\" that sits just below the guttering. Sorry, but I'm not sure I ever knew what that was called, even in English. Anyway I told him not this year as I'd spent plenty of money on the house already, but when he looked at my roof he asked me if I realized my chimney was wobbly - and sadly I knew he was right. He also spotted a couple of tiles that had moved - I'm guessing in that dreadful storm we had a couple of weeks ago - so he's coming back tomorrow to re-do the chimney and check over the tiles that need resetting. Bugger it! When I had my new fire insert installed last month I became entitled to a €2,000 rebate from the state for putting an open fireplace out of action, and now all of a sudden I guess I'll just briefly smell that $2,000 cheque as it's being whipped out from under my nose!Anyway, today I'd had enough of being lazy so thought I would take myself off to the lake at Passy for a walk (and possibly a glass of wine), but when I got down to Bonneville, the roads were blocked off as the bloody Tour de France (sorry Dave) was coming through! So any thoughts of getting a walk in went up in smoke and I drove back home and had lunch in the little restaurant in the village - which I have to say was absolutely delicious! I ended up sitting next to two older American cyclists who had flown over to catch the Tour and ended up having a nice chat with them before they had to dash off to ride down to Bonneville for the excitement!The Tour in Les Gets - where Jordan is currently working!And finally, I was sorting through some paperwork the other day when I came across a packet of old photos. There were photos of the kids when they were little but also quite a few photos of my ex-MIL and a few of her siblings, which I'm going to send to her once I get round to writing a letter to include with them. She was number 11 of 11 siblings and there are only two left now, so I think she'll appreciate them. I also found a photo of André when he was about 10 competing in a grand slalom with the ski club. While he was never going to win, he was doing just fine - well that is until he saw our neighbour filming him and skied over to her for a chat. The crowd all started roaring at him as she was just short of the finish line, so he never actually crossed it and came last! I guess another Olympic hopeful bit the dust that day then!André in the process of coming last!"},
{"title": "Hurry up and wait!", "date": "Tuesday 4 July 2023", "text": "Don't you sometimes feel like you're wading through treacle? I'm pretty sure we all feel like that sometimes, but as the great philosopher, Artistole, probably never said \"meh, que sera \"! I guess that's one of the advantages of being retired - for the most part you never have to hurry anymore!The plumber was supposed to start work on Monday but meh not gonna happen. Bearing in mind this has been going on since January, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. It took four months for all the fittings and tiles to arrive and then a few months to get a plumber lined up (they're all busy, of course). I had a tiler recommended to me by my neighbours but because everything took so long he's now not available until September. I had another tiler recommended to me by the plumber and he came out about 10 days ago. So yesterday the plumber calls to ask if everything is lined up for him and the tiler to play tag team starting Monday but nope. Not only has the second guy not sent me his quote but he is also unavailable until September. I have to hand it to the plumber though, he's proactive and very much on top of everything. So I suggested he come and start work on Monday anyway but since he didn't want to leave me with a worksite for three months, we've pushed it back to mid-September, after I get back from Mallorca (assuming my original tiler can now take over)! I guess there was no point being in a rush anyway, but I do thank god I'm incredibly laid back (for the most part)!We had a massive storm here last week and while it only lasted about an hour, my goodness did it do a lot of damage! Thankfully the only thing it damaged at my place was the BBQ which it managed to hurl down the driveway, but a few houses had roof damage and the school in the next village was pretty badly affected too. It's amazing how quickly these storms can build up and I admit I was worried about Jordan coming down the mountain after work, but he made it home ok, even if it was a bit hairy in parts. Talking of Jordan the company he has been working for (via the temp agency) for the last year proposed a helluva job offer to him a couple of weeks ago - he was stunned how good it was. However, he had quite a few questions that needed answering first - like why were they at the tribunal owing €1.6 million to their suppliers, and why hadn't they paid the temp agency for the last three months? They must have come up with some really good excuses because next day the offer still stood - and that is when his supervisor, Christophe, managed to get hold of him just before he signed and told him not to do it as they were going bust! Christophe told him he'd just handed in his notice and that the company's former director (who had resigned in May) had set up his own company based out of Grenoble, but was also looking to have a two-man team working the Vallée de l'Arve area (this area) and was Christophe interested? So Christophe said yes, as long as Jordan comes with him!!! They get along really well so fingers crossed it all works out for him this time. In the meantime, the temp agency has pulled him off the job in Flaine (building a hotel) and he's now working a bit lower down the mountain for another company. He said he was a bit disappointed as he would have liked to have seen the hotel through to the end, but I wonder if it will ever get finished now!My sister called me the other week and when I picked up she said \"finally, where have you been\"? Well nowhere as it turned out, but I had apparently missed a couple of calls on my mobile so she started to become concerned when she wasn't getting through on the landline either. I just laughed and told her I'd unplugged the house phone about six months ago as I was fed up of the telemarketers, but I never thought to actually tell her! Anyway, she called to tell me that my niece and her husband had received the gift certificate I'd sent them for dinner in a local restaurant when Ian feels better. In fact the manager of the restaurant had hand delivered it \"as he was in town anyway\". Ian was the one that collapsed in the street a couple of months ago and they found out he'd had several heart attacks. Anyway, he was in hospital for a total of about five weeks (they did a valve replacement) and while the operation went well, recovery is very, very slow. For as big and gruff a man as he is (he looks like Desperate Dan), it hit him extremely hard mentally, so there are huge lifestyle changes being made in the C household as a result - and good for them!Desperate Dan - god that takes me back!When I opened my shutters this morning I noticed my neighbour sitting on my wall scraping away at a few weeds growing into it. Fine by me. I try to keep up with it but I can't be everywhere all the time and in any case I know he likes to keep himself busy. But when I came down a bit later I realized he was actually painting it (it desperately needed it) and again, fine by me. It's a very small wall and he said he had a pot of paint that he didn't want to waste and he would \"paint as far as he could\". So I told him I had odd pots of paint downstairs and went down to look around and guess what - I came back with another half pot of exactly the same colour, so he is going to do the whole thing. While I know I moan about him a lot and for sure would not want to be married to him, he's not all bad, as you can see. Now I have to give some thought to redoing that front patch of garden as while the roses are beautiful they are just too overwhelming for such a small space!I had to go for a scan at the hospital yesterday, after having been seen by my gynae every three months for the last year. Apparently a cyst suddenly developed last June and he wanted to keep an eye on it - hence the three monthly visits. I can't say it ever worried me because I'm just not a worrier, and when I went about two weeks ago, he decided he could \"sign me off\" to every six months as blood markers for tumors had come back negative and he thought the cyst might be shrinking too. But still he wanted me to go for a scan just to be sure - you know, at the hospital with 100 beds and 1 and ⅓ parking spaces! So this time I reckoned I should try parking at the border and figuring out the bus/walk/tram way to get there. In actual fact it was pretty easy so I arrived very early and had time to sit and have a coffee in the lovely coffee shop. It's the hospital where Jordan was born and is very luxurious, although very pricey too, of course! Anyway, the nurse called me at 3 o'clock and asked if I had a full bladder (that's a bit personal isn't it???) but when I said no she told me I had to sit and drink at least three glasses of water for the scan to be accurate. So being a good girl I drank four, and when she came back to see me I got up to follow her and she said \"oh no, now you have to sit here for at least 45 minutes to wait for the water to make it's way through\"! Oh crap, I'm always bursting for the loo under normal circumstances, so I reckoned I was going to do the Mr. Bean squirm by the end of 45 minutes! Anyway, the doctor did a couple of tests and told me she thought everything looked absolutely fine and was nothing to worry about, so I kinda thanked her and went running out the door to the loo! After that I decided to walk back to the border and was surprised to find it only took 45 minutes so I think that's how I'll be making that trip in future! On the way back home I got stuck behind a bike race (but not the Tour de France as it hasn't reached here yet) and a vintage car rally, so I was really glad I didn't still have the four glasses of water in me at that point! Agony Ivy, as we used to say! And as I said to Dave, the cars were lovely and the bums were pretty nice too!And finally, I've been pussy-footing around lately thinking about where I might go in spring - as was my wont pre-covid, so I starting looking at Solos and Just You and Explore, and \"ooh look Explore have a special on Belize, and ooh look there's a trip to the Golden Triangle\", and then I gave myself a good talking to and said \"where have you always, always, said you wanted to visit\", so just in case this turns out to be my last long-haul, I went ahead and booked Thailand with Explore.co.uk for end February 2024. Since I wanted to make my own flight arrangements rather than having to fly back to London and then fly out again, I started looking up Thai, Qatar, Etihad and Emirates and today, after much piddling around, I booked myself on Emirates, via Dubai. The prices were pretty reasonable actually so I thought I would try to pick out a decent seat in economy, buuutttt this little voice in my head said \"go on, just do it\", so even though I might have to sell a kidney (mind you, who'd want one of mine?), I booked myself in business class and will happily spend the next year paying for it! So yay me, I'm finally going to Thailand!"},
{"title": "It's all go!", "date": "Wednesday 21 June 2023", "text": "How come weeks seem to go by where nothing much is happening, and then all of a sudden I have appointments left, right and centre? I recently ordered heating fuel so I would have a good start to the winter. It's obviously always better to order in the summer rather than the winter but I'm still thinking prices have started to come back down again after the enormous price hike associated with the war in Ukraine. The lady who took my order is very, very nice and when I told her I needed 1,700 litres she told me that comparing a 1,000 litre order last time to 1,000 litres this time, the price had come down €600, and if I wanted to compare it to a 1,700 litre order I was \"better off\" by €900! So while it's still a big chunk of chump change, I'll take the \"win\"! Out of curiosity I also went into my electric account and while it was initially showing consumption down around 27% after I had my solar panels installed, for the month of May it was down 37%, so that's looking good too. Of course it'll take a few years to recoup the installation costs, but so far I don't regret having them installed!Then yesterday \"the guys\" came to instal my fireplace insert. It's a good job I keep track of my appointments because I was kinda expecting them to send a reminder message the day before but nope, nothing doing. Thankfully I was showered and dressed when they showed up at 8 a.m. and within four hours they'd got it installed. It wasn't an easy instal because of the limited size of my fireplace, but when I told them that I'd been to three other places and they'd all said \"not possible\" the guy just said that some companies just don't want the harder jobs. That being said, they did work very hard and the poor guy on the roof must have been boiling because it was 90°F that day and then the boss came in with wood and kindling because he was obliged to start a fire in order to see that everything was hunky dory. You can't believe what having a roaring fire blazing in the living room feels like when it's aready 90°. Still, that's another thing crossed off my list, except that I have to get the paperwork from them as I'm entitled to a €2,000 rebate from the French state for putting an open fireplace out of commission. Also, with the new insert it should prevent any more birds from coming down the chimney apparently. Last week as I walked into my TV room a terrified sparrow almost blew my head off, so I'm guessing he must have plopped down the chimney during the night. Then as I was loading up garden stuff to take to the recycling centre, I didn't spot the wasp attached to the bag, so ended up getting a nice sting to the belly - but I got my own back when he died a cruel death! You guys might think you have it rough with your grizzlies and snakes and crocodiles, but sometimes I have to wonder!Monday night the plumber came by to have another look at my bathrooms, and we have finally fixed a date of 10 July for him to start work (he'd been off on paternity leave). So then when I got in touch with the tiler that I had lined up, he wasn't going to be available until September, so now I have another tiler stopping by (Monday, I think) who can hopefully work around the plumber! I'm not looking forward to the mess but I am so over waiting to get this work done!I don't know about you, but when I was still working I found I would put off making my personal appointments until I got really mad at myself and then would make 10 phone calls one after the other and get everything sorted in a short space of time. Procrastination at its finest! I had another doctor's appointment in Geneva on Friday (he's been seeing me every three months for the past year) but he thinks he can push that back to every six months going forward but as he wants to be absolutely certain of himself I have to go to the hospital for an ultrasound scan just for him to sign off. You know, the bloody hospital with 500 beds and two parking spaces!!! I'm not worried about the scan, but figuring out how to get there should be a laugh a minute! So I've got that scheduled, plus the dentist and then the hairdresser to get this mop removed from my head and then hopefully that'll be it for a good long while!Oh, but I forgot about my appointment at Ford today. I had to cancel having them take off my winter tyres and there was a minor repair that needed doing, so I left my car at Ford this morning and then caught the rickety old minibus back home. It's a real bone shaker so you wouldn't want to have brittle bones! I thought it was kinda nice though because after we'd driven through one village the driver told me he thought he'd missed a young girl who sometimes caught his bus and would I mind if he doubled back to see? Not at all, of course, and as it happened she didn't need the bus today, but I thought it was kind of him to do that. Then tonight, on my way back down to Ford, a new driver took a wrong road - and then apologised because he \"had only been here a month\". When I asked him where he'd come from he said the north of England and when I told him I was English he told me he'd go back in a heartbeat (he was French) as he loved it and had so many friends after spending the last eleven years there. So here's me totally happy in France and this Frenchman wanting to move back to England. I guess it's a good job we're all different!Talking of brittle bones though, my neighbour (who just turned 90) had a fall last week and broke her femur. I have always admired this couple because they are forever out walking and he - at 87 - could still walk me into the ground. She is adamant she didn't trip over anything, but that her femur just gave way. Poor thing, it must be a real stressor for someone who has been so active her entire life!Last night I finally finished watching the latest (and last) series of Mrs. Maisel and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can't say that about many series, to be honest, as for the most part I just can't be bothered with them. But I just loved the New York jewish humour (brilliant writers), with Tony Shalhoub as the neurotic grandfather almost having a nervous breakdown when he realizes his only grandson is not a genius - well he just steals the show for me. Him and Caroline Aaron as the brash, loud-mouthed mother-in-law. They were a real treat to watch! Tony ShalhoubAs I say, most of the series I have started I haven't actually finished because they don't hold my interest and I'm finding I'm starting to do the same with books. In the last couple of weeks I have finished seven very good books, and put three aside after a couple of chapters. Life really is too short to read a bad book!And finally, I was just thinking that I should start looking at prospective destinations if I want to maybe do a long haul trip next spring and then waddaya know, Explore (who I have used before) are offering 10% off bookings made before 27 June. So I'm drooling looking at Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Mexico, South Africa ....! Oh dear, so much choice - that's never a good thing for me!"},
{"title": "Not all superheroes wear capes!", "date": "Sunday 11 June 2023", "text": "As an update to my last post, the good news is that all of the four toddlers (aged between 22 and 36 months) stabbed by that lunatic are now out of danger (as are the two adults). The back story is he had been living in Sweden for the last 10 years and had asylum there. He split from his wife and last autumn travelled to France and requested asylum here in France. The French refused his request on 4 June on the grounds that he had been living for the last 10 years in Sweden, so now if he wanted to move to France he would have to qualify as an immigrant, and not under refugee status. Apparently his ex-wife had already written to both the Swiss and French authorities warning them that he was unstable but ....! So he'd lived in Annecy in an \"irregular situation\" since last autumn and then decided, for whatever reason, to stab a bunch of little kids in a play area. All I can say is thank God the kiddies are going to be all right. Well no, actually thanks don't belong to God, they belong to the first responders and doctors and nurses. Actually no, to give thanks where they really belong - well that would be to a 24 year old hero who came out swinging and managed to get that lunatic away from the play area until security forces could pin him down! It's ironic that footballers can be paid millions and when they score a goal they're referred to as \"heroes\" but in reality not all heroes wear capes!Henri - a real hero!In other news, my friend and I took our annual trip to the market in Turin yesterday, our first since 2019, for obvious reasons! We were up at the crack of dawn to catch the bus at 6 a.m. If all goes to plan we make it to Turin around 10 a.m. and then get to spend around six hours doing our own thing. We've done this trip often enough now to realize that next time we can afford to spend an hour or so exploring the old town before having lunch and then hitting the market. There are markets all over Turin but I reckon this must be the biggest. It's not even in the best part of town - it's a bit grubby and run down, to be honest - but god I love that market. As soon as I duck under the stall awnings I'm in my element. Prices have gone up just as everywhere else (it's still cheaper than where I live), but just the sensory experience is worth the trip for me!Look at the size of those watermelons!In my dream world I would live in one of those apartments and wander down tothe market every day! It's not even that noisy - Birmingham market is way noisier!Having lunch next tothe market!It drizzled on and off all day, but after a few minutes of rain, the sun would come back out and we'd end up walking round in what felt like a sauna! On the way back to the border we stopped at an outlet mall, the main point of stopping apparently being to buy booze and cigarettes! Our trip cost €60 so you don't actually \"save\" money by going to Turin, but I suppose if you are also buying spirits and cigarettes it might work out evens-stevens financially. I wouldn't know though, as I didn't buy either. To me it's just a lovely day out. I personally spent around €100 at the market (in addition to lunch), We had three buses going in our \"convoy\", I saw two buses from Annecy and quite a few more from other French regions relatively local to Turin, so the market really makes out by having the French buses stop in. Just as the northern French ports used to make a killing when the Brits would do a day trip by car and load up at the local supermarkets. Of course all that stopped when Britain left the EU. It's \"funny\" (in a not so funny ha ha sense) how these things have a knock on effect. Just imagine if the French could no longer visit the market in Turin and cross back into France with their purchases duty free. The whole house of cards would come tumbling down wouldn't it! A case of the hip bone's connected to the thigh bone, methinks!The Glacier de Bosson, seen fromthe Italian side, just before we hitthe French border!"},

{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 6 June 2023", "text": "It's been a few days since I last posted but that seems to be the kind of schedule that is working for me at the moment. I was a bit blah for a few days, you know, when everything gets to be too much and nothing gets done. I suppose some of it has to do with waiting around for the plumbers while everything is moved out of the way and assuming they come shortly, they'll probably be here at the same time as the fireplace people! So yeah, this place has been getting to me for a while. In reality it's too big for me, but while the house is fine, the view is fantastic (and my neighbours are great), so I really don't want to sell up, especially given how much I've spent on it lately. Also, if I sell, Jordan and Jen would like to buy it, but can't afford it so I'm hanging on until my mood picks up a bit. What I am trying to do, therefore, is keep on decluttering, and I have to say I truly admire people who seem to plow through a day and take 15 loads to the charity shop! That's not me and it's frustrating as hell, but there is only so much energy to go around! That being said, I did pack up two bags of clothes to put in the charity bin in the village but almost ended up throwing them in the trash bin rather than the charity bin. Luckily I caught myselt in time because that would have been a shame!I think I mentioned in a previous post that I was going to attend a course on ayurveda. Well I did, and it was interesting, but not at all what I was expecting (although truth be told I really don't know what I was expecting). At the end our teacher offered those of us who wanted to to do a \"nasal cleanse\" using a neti lota, to see what we thought. I'd heard of this before so while I wasn't hugely enthusiastic I just thought \"hell go for it\"! So we went outside and she handed us all a new lota filled with warm water and salt. You tip it up one nostril, swirl your head around and in theory it should come down the other nostril (makes a great visual doesn't it) rather than have you gagging because it went down your throat. Well I tried it and to be honest it did nothing for me and as she'd apparently put a bit too much salt in it felt like having your nose half burned off, you know, like when you get ducked under in the sea! Still, at least I gave it a go!Actually I think I got my interest in all things yoga and so on at a very young age from my dad - which is pretty strange considering he was a sheet metal worker and not your usual suspect! I think his interest might have come from being so ill so young (heart problems) and he would try anything to help himself feel better. Hence the time when I was a little girl and caught him in bed with a teapot up his nose and he almost choked when he saw me watching him!Talking of yoga, we had Monday's course outside in the sunshine - not something I'm particularly fond of actually because I hate being in the heat. Still, it was actually quite pleasant listening to the hens clucking around in the garden next door. Even the rooster didn't bother me too much - but when the guy got out his hedge cutters I actually burst out laughing. I mean, it's not exactly easy to \"meditate\" to the tune of a hedge cutter, is it!Sunday was Mother's Day here in France and I was invited over to Jordan and Jen's with Jen's mom. I worked all morning in the garden and then ran inside to have a quick shower and bugger it - I had no hot water!!! So I'm filthy, my hair needs washing and all I had was ice cold water. In the end there was nothing for it but to grin and bear it (bare it?) but what really pissed me off was the thought of yet another thing to fix! Nevertheless we had a nice time at lunch, but Charlie has now taken to curling up in a ball sobbing if he's ever told no. I mean, the poor little kid is heartbroken, heartbroken, I tell you - well for all of about 30 seconds until he realizes nobody is watching him. I have to be careful to look away though as I can't help laughing!And finally, I don't know what the heck is going on in my orbit, but there are so many friends, acquaintances and family going down with illnesses (some relatively minor, others very serious indeed), it's staggering. For instance, my sister went for a routine eye check and they found that she has \"an indentation in the back of one eye with a fluid build up\". She said she'd take care of it later that week but the doctor said \"nope, we'll do it right now\". So she had a needle inserted into her eye and the fluid drawn off and then she had to have it done two more times the same week and is now waiting on the results sometime in July. I mentioned to her that my friend was experiencing something similar, except in her case it was so painful she said she would have taken her own eye out with a spoon if she could, and did indeed end up driving herself to the ER. They're doing all kinds of tests on her, the next being some kind of scan on her head, but are still none the wiser. A friend of my kids has come down with breast cancer just ahead of her wedding in 10 days time, a 42 year old dad at day care collapsed with a heart attack and my 40 year old niece's husband collapsed in the street last week. Turns out he had also had a heart attack (probably several in fact) and I believe was operated on today (I have to call my sister later). What's going on with all these young people getting so sick?But the worst I heard last night from my dear friend in the States. She is one of two people I would consider to have been instant friends. You know the kind of person you are introduced to and then five hours later you're still yacking (and 35 years later we're still friends, despite being an ocean apart). I won't go into any details but the amount of pain and tragic events she has experienced in her life would have put me under by now, and then just this week she got another triple-whammy. And by triple-whammy, I mean three things, any of which would have had me on my knees. I only found out about the latest crap she's dealing with last night and I cried when we hung up. She doesn't deserve this. Well I know no-one does, but how much pain can one person be expected to endure in a lifetime? And then after we hung up, she sent me this, which is why I loved her from the minute we met! Kinda puts my cold shower starkly into perspective, doesn't it!"},
{"title": "Old lady knees!", "date": "Thursday 25 May 2023", "text": "I'm still waiting to hear from the plumber - he said he would call this week to set up a final walk through - so until that's done I don't really feel like I can make any plans. Trust my luck they'll end up starting work the week of 16 June - which is the day my fireplace insert is also being installed!! I foresee a stressful and dusty few days ahead, but I suppose it'll be worth it in the end!I spent a few minutes the other day deleting blogs from my favourites list again because while I obviously liked them enough to bookmark them, I found I just wasn't reading them. Can you believe I actually deleted about 50 blogs???? Just as well really I suppose because if I'd spent my time reading all those blogs I'd never get anything done and in any case, do you really want to spend your time reading about someone else living their life while spending your own life in front of a compter? I think not, right? I also cleaned up my main email address too. Not that I ever let it get that bad but I really hate having a ton of emails sitting there in my inbox. I was just thinking to myself that I hadn't had so many scam emails lately either - you know, Colonel Ghadaffi's only surviving daughter who wants to give me $10 million! But then as I was playing Words With Friends on my phone the other day, xfwxyag.na tried to start a game with me and then immediately sent me a \"hallo Treaders\" message, so I hit \"block\" on that one right away!The last few evenings I've watched a couple of episodes of Social Catfish on Youtube and boy are some of those stories sad. It's mainly women (although not always) who are getting scammed out of quite a lot of money and I find it hard to understand how they can fall for this crap, although I guess when you're lonely it must feel nice to have someone who seems interested in you. One woman was convinced she was in an online relationship with Johnny Depp???? and another one with an Australian actor from Stranger Things who was \"getting tired of his beautiful girlfriend but had to be careful because she was very jealous\"! Say what??? They did do an episode on a rather lovely English woman who turned out to be the first person who did not send any money. She said she was not on any dating websites but had been contacted by Mr. Handsome via her Linkedin profile and while she was initially cautious, he did manage to draw her in after a couple of months chatting. Where she was smart though was when he started telling her that he just needed $5,000 to buy a plane ticket because his bank account had been blocked in the Middle East, she would just ask him what he was going to do about it. She must have driven him nuts because he kept getting more and more angry and demanding, to which she just kept on asking him what he was going to do about it. Smart lady!Things are still just as fraught here in France as the protests are not going away. Macron was due to give a speech about a month ago and I reckon all of Paris took to the streets with saucepans and wooden spoons - so much so that they tried to ban the \"casserolade\" but that didn't fly! So now every time he or his senior ministers go anywhere they are greeted by a saucepan serenade!I did manage to get my back terrace pressure washed the other day and it looks decidedly better with most of the winter muck washed off. I suspect at some point I'm going to have to redo my terrace but that will have to wait for the time being. Then later that night my bloody knee gave out. Oh it wasn't anything like arthritis, but just felt like something had been dislocated. So then I was stuck trying to get around without putting any pressure on my right leg. I can tell you, getting up and downstairs was a laugh a minute (not)! The worst thing was that I had to go into Geneva that night to pick my friend up from the airport but luckily my leg didn't bother me at all to drive - just when walking about. This has happened before but after a night's sleep it had cleared up by the morning. So yesterday morning when I couldn't feel any pain in my knee, I swung myself out of bed - and went down like a sack of spuds! Seems it hadn't cured itself overnight this time after all! But I'm stubborn as hell so I was determined to go out shopping and duly hopped into the supermarket on one leg. The strange thing is though, when I was leaving the store and putting my cart back, I realized the pain had completely gone! I don't know, maybe the act of walking (hopping?) was what cured it but either way I'm glad it didn't last too long! On the way home I stopped in at the Chinese market and at the cash register I realized I'd forgotten to buy ice cream, so I picked up a tub of strawberry ice cream for later. When I got it home I looked at the label and saw that it was \"red bean ice cream\"!!! Seriously, red bean, as in the stuff you put in chili!! God it was gross - I won't make that mistake again!So today I took my granny basket down to the market and when I finally found a parking space (it isn't easy) I had a good old wander and bought a week's worth of fruit and veg. On the way home I got stuck behind one of those little \"licence-less\" cars - the cars that have an engine about the size of a sewing machine and which you can drive without a licence. That thing must have been going about five miles an hour all the way home, but when I saw it swerving in order to avoid pot holes, I realized that the back bumper was held on with duct tape and it was looking very rough indeed. I know how you feel mate, I know how you feel!"},
{"title": "In my defence ...!", "date": "Monday 22 May 2023", "text": "I got virtually nothing done yesterday, despite having every intention of going for a walk and then coming home and getting stuck in. In my defence, I didn't get to bed until 3 a.m. as we'd had another board game evening Saturday night (finishing up at 1 a.m.) but since I can't go to sleep straight away I was up reading until the early morning hours! Still, it annoys me a bit when I just sit around and do not much of anything, so thankfully today has been better!I decided to go to our local market last Thursday for the first time in ages, and I'm so glad I did. We have farmers' markets every day round here in different towns, with ours being on Thursday mornings. It's one of the larger markets with, I would guess, maybe 50 stalls, and it was such a treat to get out and have a wander in the lovely weather. It's also sociable as there are places to sit and have a drink and you can pretty much guarantee you will bump into at least one person you know (I did - Cynthia from sewing club). A few years ago I bought a pair of very lightweight trousers at the market in Turin and have worn them half to death. They are so easy and comfortable to wear (and cheap too), so I had a wander round and picked up another similar pair (although they do make me look a bit like Andy Pandy)!Andy Pandy - remember him?I noticed they also have an organic stall (not sure if that was there before), so I'm thinking I might start shopping at the market again to see how it goes and to put money back into the pockets of the local traders, rather than the big stores (I've even dug out my old lady wheelie bag for next week)!La Roche market!My friend and I are off again to Turin market for the day on 10 June and my ex asked what was so great about it if they just sell the same stuff as here. Well it's about 50 times bigger and is a permanent market, but I guess he'll never understand the pure joy of wandering round such a huge market with all the smells, sights and sounds. Plus it's Italy of course!!! Oddly enough, I was talking to the kids about it and they agreed with me that as soon as you come out of the Mont Blanc tunnel into Italy you can feel the whole atmosphere change - I just love it!There's a big hoo-haa going on here at the moment about a proposal to build a €60 million velodrome in La Roche, with many, many people against it as they feel that money could be better spent. My first thought was that it was for bikes, but when my friend told me she thought it might be for motorbikes that would change everything. I can just imagine the noise and to be honest I can only think of one very small hotel in La Roche, so I just don't see that the infrastructure is there. I don't know, I suppose we'll have to wait and see what they decide!There has also been a push to encourage people to come up with local initiatives, with small grants being available for anyone whose proposal \"passes the sniff test\". I've mentioned before that my little village has one restaurant and a bus stop - oh and and one of those book exchange thingies - and that's it. Anyway, one enterprising young lady put forward a proposal to set up a mobile manicure unit and I see that she was successful in winning a small grant to get her started. Apparently she will be in our village on Monday afternoons, so I must show support and stop in for a manicure sometime, even though she'd probably be horrified at the state of my hands!The mobile manicure unit - I think it's great!I had yoga today and it was tough although as usual I felt wonderful when I came out of there. Then I had the pleasure of spending the afternoon on a zoom call with André, who had left it till the very last day to file his French taxes! Wouldn't you know it! He had to transfer his taxes from paper to online so I went through it line by line with him until we got it done. Now he and Jordan just have to file their US taxes and we can all relax!My ex left last Thursday and made it home safely. I thought he looked terrible to be honest. I think \"zombie\" was a word that popped into my mind more than once, but I know he's taking lithium (for bipolar) and I also know he's drinking like a fish so I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the state of him. When he was here my stomach was in knots and it was only after he'd left that I realized it was because I was constantly in a state of hypervigilance - just like I used to be when we were married. I don't know if you get what I mean but he wasn't \"thoughtless\", he just doesn't think and I was forever waiting for the other shoe to drop. For instance at the lake at Passy there is a path that goes all the way round the lake. In order to get to the restaurant there is another path that climbs to maybe ten feet about the lower path. Well ex picked up a huge rock to show Charlie how to throw stones into the lake, and we all yelled at him to stop as there was a young family cycling past on the lower path and he could have hit them! Then when he would play with Charlie we had to remind him he is two, not 12! Or he would wind Lenny the horrible cat up to the point he would scratch him. Lenny's a nasty cat anyway and Jordan and Jen watch him like a hawk because of Charlie, but try telling my ex to leave the cat alone and he just gets worse!I've always felt like I was forever running round trying to put out forest fires while he was running behind me with a flame-thrower! For the longest time I figured it was thoughtlessness, but I did once read an article that said this was often deliberate - even if subconsciously - because by keeping you on the back foot they always have the upper hand! Interesting! Like the time after we were divorced when he called me as he was not well, and André and I found him lying in the snow in his underwear in February trying to cool down (lithium and booze again, I reckon), and then refusing to go to the hospital. So the next time he pulled that stunt I sent the ambulance directly to his place and then met it at the hospital. So I sit there, and I sit there and I sit here - and after four hours they come out looking for me because he had suddenly felt better and had done a runner, leaving me sitting in ER like a lemon. I also happened to have plans for that day but .....! Or how about the time he smashed his own car up (drunk) and then a few days later totalled the loaner car from the garage (also drunk) - so two cars in one week!I tried as tactfully as possible to suggest he might want to be more honest with his doctors in the US about his drinking since they \"can't find anything wrong with him\" (he can't eat and is hunched over like a 90 year old), but that was when it came out that he'd actually cancelled his medical insurance through his employer over here when he retired last August! Well he must have seen my eyes pop out on stalks because his insurance was fantastic, cheap, offered worldwide coverage and would be permanently subsidized by his employer and he cancelled it???????? Apparently he is insured with his partner but I asked him what happened if they split, and did it cover him \"over here\" anyway. To which he replied that he \"didn't know\". Oh great, get sick in France - or even worse, in Switzerland - and you don't know if you're covered!!!!So there you have it. While it was fine between us and I'm glad he's gotten to see Charlie again, as soon as that plane took off I felt all the tension drain out of my body and while I don't wish him ill, I'm just so, so, so glad I am no longer his chaos janitor and don't have to deal with his BS anymore!"},
{"title": "Inspired!", "date": "Tuesday 16 May 2023", "text": "It's been a tiring few days yet again. There've been a few fun things and few not so fun things going on (which I may or may not write about later), suffice it to say my ex is still in town. Not that he has done anything untoward but I was \"moithering\" again last night and didn't get to sleep until around 3 a.m.! Maybe I'll write what's bothering me down another time to get those thoughts out of my head! We'll see!On the fun side, we all got together again at Jordan and Jen's for dinner (easier that way for Charlie) and when Charlie saw me he came running over saying \"Nanny camion\" and took me to see his blue truck. So I cooed appreciatively over it for a while and went to sit down, but he wasn't having any of it, grabbed my hand and dragged me over to the blue truck again. Well this happened a couple more times and I finally realized that apparently I was supposed to get on the blue truck and chase him on his red truck!!!!! Of course if I'd sat on that thing I'd be at the hospital right now having broken pieces of plastic removed from my backside, but as he was so insistent I ended up \"chasing\" him crouching as low as my legs and bum would allow. Ha, who says those gym sessions aren't working!After that, since Jen had taught him where his \"nombril\" (belly button) is, I asked him where his \"nombril\" was and he pulled up his shirt and pointed to it. At which point I pressed it and went \"beep, beep\" - which of course he thought was hysterical. It's my own fault, I know, because I bet you can imagine what happened next. Yep he came over and lifted my shirt looking for my \"nombril\"! Thankfully I had an undershirt on but at this point all dignity gets thrown to the wind and he did indeed get to see if my nombril also went \"beep beep\"! In my defence I would add that we hadn't started eating yet! Of course then everyone else had to be checked out too and apparently both papa and uncle's belly buttons also worked, although nobody else's did!Anyway, as I was saying, I couldn't sleep again last night but just as I was finally about to drop off a bloody fly went buzzing right past my nose. And again, and then again, so I knew in the end I'd have to get up and try to \"encourage\" Mr. Fly to go into the TV room. So I open the bedroom door, put the light on in the TV room trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and wait for him to make his escape - which he does and I slam the door shut! Trouble was, I then needed to turn the light off in the TV room so I ever so carefully opened the door, reached my hand up to the switch - and the bloody fly was back in the bedroom again!!! Damn! After a few unsuccessful attempts, my next brainwave was to ever so nonchalantly open the bedroom window in case Mr. Fly needed a breath of fresh air. Rather naively I thought Mr. Indoor Fly would then fly out, but in fact Mr. Outdoor Fly came in for a chinwag with his cousin! Even I had to laugh at this point because it put me in mind of the sketch where comedy genius Tim Conway plays the exhausted salesman trying to get some rest and being tormented by a fly (you can see it here)! Pure genius! In the end I don't know what happened to the Fly brothers because I reckon at that point I was so exhausted I must have passed out!In other news, remember the card group I joined where the average age was 97? Well we had a nice little day out today!And finally, I've got quite a bit of stuff in the fridge that needs using up as I'm tired of wasting food. So I was looking online to see what I might do with potatoes, ham and Brie when all of a sudden the clouds parted, a rainbow formed and I do believe I heard angelic voices singing \"tartiflette\"! How did I not think of that before? Tartiflette - the food of the gods! Now admittedly the traditional recipe uses lardons (I had ham) and a local cheese called Reblochon (I had Brie), but I kinda threw it all together, stuck it in the oven and even if I say so myself, tonight's dinner was simply inspired!But of course mine looked nothing like this!"},
{"title": "Finally back to Holland (well Belgium actually)!", "date": "Sunday 14 May 2023", "text": "If I don't get round to writing up the last part of my trip to Holland in my blog/online diary, I'll probably forget a lot of it, since so much has been happening lately. So on the last day we were set to travel by boat over to spend the night in Antwerp (Belgium). Things didn't exactly go to plan as there was a problem at one of the huge locks which ended up costing us over four hours!!! Then when it was ready to go, obviously the container shipping had to take priority over us. I wasn't really that bothered actually as we were still onboard the boat and got to see some amazing engineering in action. And if we didn't want to watch, we always had our cabins to retreat to!I think they were able to fit six boats/bargesinto the locks at the same time!Fascinating stuff!The only downside, of course, was our late arrival in Antwerp, which meant tearing into the old town on foot and not really having much time to appreciate just what a pretty city it is. Still, you can't have everything in life can you!The catherdral was very impressive!This is a google image as I couldn't get it all in.Guild houses on the Grote Markt.I had to google what guild houses were too.Originally they were used for collecting taxes.So now you know (they must have collecteda lot of taxes though, judging by thesize of the place)!In the evening we had our final dinner on the boat, followed by dancing for those that wanted it. I have a video of one much older lady \"dancing\" (murdering more like) the macarena. She had everyone in stitches and couldn't have cared less about it! As she was alone I got up and waltzed (badly) with her a couple of times and then a man danced with her quite a few times because they were having such a blast! She told me that she had no partner so I figured she was a widow, as she was wearing a wedding ring. But no, her husband was so embarrassed by her he sat out the dancing bit, but even he must have appreciated what good fun she was. I would have put her in her 80s, truth be told, but it turned out she was just 71, so I guess you wouldn't want to urgently need me as an eye witness, would you!The younger woman is trying to keep herfacing the right direction - with not much luck -but she really was the highlight of the evening!So next day it was up early and back on the road for what turned out to be a 15 hour journey, although not all of that was travelling as the driver needed to rest every so many hours. I enjoyed my time and found the architecture beautiful and the engineering amazing, but honestly, it was just too flat for me. As one man said as he was getting off the bus \"isn't it great to be back in the mountains\" and I thoroughly agreed!A goole picture of one of the amazingdikes in the Netherlands!"},
{"title": "Exhausted!", "date": "Friday 5 May 2023", "text": "I haven't even finished up writing about my trip to Holland (the Netherlands!!!) and yet this week has been full on. My ex didn't come over in March for Charlie's second birthday but decided to come now (or this weekend as I thought) - which actually makes more sense. Anyway he turned up last weekend with his niece and her new husband as they are heading down to Italy for a wedding next week. So, I got to see Leslie (and hubbie Jake) for the first time in about 20 years and it has been a real treat - they are so nice! They're all staying with André but Jordan and Jen took the week off and we've been tootling around together. The weather has been glorious (although I think it's scheduled to pour down this weekend) and while we've done the usual tourist circuits we actually did a \"new to me\" trip to Chamonix yesterday, and took the cable car up to the Aiguille du Midi (basically next to the Mont Blanc). Many years ago we took the train up the Mont Blanc to a glacier called the Mer de Glace with my inlaws, but I had never been up to the Aiguille du Midi, even though it's only 40 minutes from home! Mind you it cost €73 per person so maybe that's why I hadn't done it before! Jake was very nervous about taking the cable car and Jen said no way, so she stayed home with Charlie, but the rest of us did it and it was wonderful! At the top you are at 3,842 metres (12,600 feet) and you feel like you are drunk (we weren't!!!)! Well actually we alternated between light-headed and sick to the stomach, and then walking through the tunnels to get to the viewing points we all felt like we were drunk!!! Jake wouldn't go near the edge as he really hates heights, but kudos to him for doing the cable car anyway. We told him we'd take a picture of him doing a thumbs up and photoshop him into all the pictures. It's been fine with my ex. I had them all over to dinner last night and cooked way too much but it was a nice evening anyway. When they left my ex hugged me for so long it was getting embarrassing! Anyway, I'm off over to Jordan and Jen's for fondue now and hope normal service will be resumed shortly!At Cascade de Rouget waterfall!Leslie and Jake at the Horseshoe Gorge!We would have done this (it's called stepping into the void) but the wait was too long!Looking down over Chamonix!Chamonix! It was very quiet (betweenseasons I guess)!Jordan actually worked on thebuilding to the right (it's the town hall)!"},
{"title": "So where did April go????", "date": "Thursday 27 April 2023", "text": "I can't believe it's the end of April already. Well I think of it as end April because my pension gets paid today, as the last working day of the month. I know I went away for a few days but I can't believe April has already come and gone all the same!Since I've been back from Holland (I know I should say the Netherlands as Holland is a region of the Netherlands but ....) it's really weird because when I start watching anything on Youtube I'm consistently seeing ads for the cruise company we travelled with. It's all the more strange to me because we didn't actually book this company - it was done by our local travel agent (GAL Voyages) - so how the algorithm is picking me out for these ads I don't know. That being said, I did pick up their brochure on board and they seem to do some lovely cruises, with the Vietnam and Africa cruises really piquing an interest! But talking of algorithms, lately I've also started getting loads of Youtube video suggestions of hair styling for afro hair which is really odd! I did click on the first video where a stylist was working with ladies suffering some pretty extreme hair loss and working with them to cover it. Okay she used hair extensions and weaves in some cases but the end results were a work of art! One lady who was seriously balding insisted she wanted to use only her own remaining hair, and the stylist created a style for her which was out of this world! And just now I've watched a video of little boy with a huge afro having his hair cut and styled and boy did he look gorgeous by the time the stylist had finished with him (although truth be told, I kinda liked his afro even better)! So maybe there is method to the algorithm's madness as now I'm hooked on afro hair styling videos! That being said, I went to the hairdresser's today to get my decidedly non-afro hair cut and thought I'd come out with my usual little old lady cut, but nope, I'm now sporting a \"wonky\" cut (although I think the technical word is \"asymmetrical\") and I love it. Whether I'll be able to keep it up myself remains to be seen (I doubt it), but who knows, maybe I'll go the whole hog and get it dyed green next time (another one of my madcap ideas)! I also finally got round to downloading a VPN onto my computer but I'm not so sure about it. It's supposed to prevent sites from being able to track me (like sites looking to sell you stuff), but it seems to me that it's actually preventing me from checking in on some of my regular reads (and even my email address!!!) unless I disable it, so I reckon I'm gonna have to delete it unless I can figure it out properly!Anyway, back to our trip. Next stop was the city of Rotterdam and our guide spent some of our travel time telling us more about the Netherlands. One thing that did surprise me a little was that the average wage is not as high as I thought it would be (I always got the impression the Dutch were pretty well off, comparatively speaking). Of course many people make much more than the average wage, but it surprised me nevertheless how relatively low it was - even if it was still higher than France. Another big surprise was that taxation starts at 37% (yeah, I know), but I think there must be an awful lot provided out of that taxation (as in Denmark), like health care, education, etc. Still, that was also a bit of a shock! I must say I enjoyed the boat trip but would not want to go on a big cruise liner. Somehow it's just not my thing, but this boat being small it was easy to hop on and off and I didn't feel so trapped! Maximum capacity was only 180 people, most of whom were French, with about 10 Spaniards also on board, so you can see it wasn't a big boat! I don't know what happened but there was yet again a bit of a cock up and we ended up arriving in Rotterdam later than planned so didn't really have time to explore - which is a shame as some of the architecture looked pretty interesting. It must have been heavily bombed during the war because so much of it was modern, but interestingly modern and not boring modern so, as I said, it was a shame we didn't get much chance to visit!Arriving in Rotterdam!This is a google pic as mine was rubbish!Another google pic as I got a large truck frontand centre of my picture!Early next morning we were up and off to Keukenhof, home of the tulip gardens. Apparently it's only open eight/nine weeks of the year so you can imagine what the car park looked like, but once inside it wasn't bad at all, and there was room to sit and admire the view without feeling like you were in a mass stampede. Not all the flower beds were in bloom yet, but it was still very beautiful, so I'm guessing the rest of this post is likely to be pretty picture heavy!Keukenhof!We had the option of buying bulbs at the gardens or just down the road (the place was surrounded by tulip fields), but in the end I picked up a catalogue and will order something when I've had a chance to go through it as there is no way I could make my mind up with so much to choose from. There was also a very colourful exhibition of paintings by Dutch artist Anja Keijzer which was right up my alley. Just remains to be seen if I can afford any of her work!After that it was back to the boat for the \"gala dinner\" where the chef and his staff exceeded themselves yet again, after which we hit the sack to get some sleep ahead of our departure for Antwerp (Belgium) the next day!If I tried that I'd probably end uphaving to move house!"},
{"title": "Movin' on!", "date": "Tuesday 25 April 2023", "text": "After our visit to the open air museum it was time to move on to the main attraction (for me anyway), which was the city of Amsterdam - and it certainly didn't disappoint! While there is obviously some traffic in Amsterdam, most of its inhabitants use bikes rather than cars, for the simple reason that there is nowhere to park! Bikes are everywhere and you'd better be pretty careful crossing the road because bike lanes are crowded and those bikes move! Our first stop was a guided tour of the diamond quarter, but quite frankly my friend and I weren't interested in that so took ourselves off to visit the flea market nearby (selling pretty much the same tat as they do in Geneva, to be honest). We wandered around for a bit and then sat and waited for the others to get back - which was a good move, as it turns out, because everyone said the people at the diamond place weren't interested in \"the likes of us\", but rather in the people getting out of the Bentleys! Or as one woman said, \"if I actually had €9,000 to spend on a bracelet, I doubt I'd be travelling on a bus tour\"!Amsterdam!Apparently the houses are so narrow becausepeople were initially taxed on the width of theirhomes (just as in England centuries ago people were taxed on the number of windows in their homes - sothey took them out)!!!And of course you can't visit Amsterdam without visiting the red light district, although our small group of women was adamant that we did not want to visit \"the prostitute windows\". This is an area where virtually naked females stand behind glass so that potential clients can \"take their pick\"! Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands and prostitutes are expected to pay tax, although I'm pretty sure they don't pay that much tax as I doubt many johns pay by credit card! Even assuming it's the personal choice of the woman, I find it degrading that they should be on display like meat at a butcher's shop so we decided not to visit that part of the district. That being said, I'm pretty sure some of these young woman are trafficked and not actually prostituting themselves freely, and I well remember seeing the very effective campaign video put out a few years ago by anti-trafficking campaigners (you can see it here if you are interested)!A dance show put on by the young \"window\" women!... with this sign as the finale!We wandered through a few back alleys and happened to pass in front of three \"windows\" off the beaten track, where older, fatter Asian women were standing \"plying their wares\" dressed in next to nothing and looking bored out of their minds, so I guess we did get a sad glimpse of what the main prostitute area is like! There were a few sex shops in these alleys and the goods in the store fronts were eye-popping, with the miniscule \"sexy\" outfits being the least of it! And the smell of the place - I'm surprised we didn't get high just walking around, as weed is neither legal nor illegal, but can be freely smoked in places called \"coffee shops\"!After leaving the red light district (it's pretty small), we took a walk through the flower market with its amazing array of flowers/bulbs. The bulbs were humongous so I can just imagine how big the flowers would grow to be, but I decided against buying anything to lug round with me and save my money for Keukenhof the next day!"},
{"title": "I'm baaaccckkkk!", "date": "Sunday 23 April 2023", "text": "Well for such a short trip I have to say it was pretty exhausting so I'm glad to be back home and able to sit for a while. That being said, it was a good trip generally speaking, but as it was the first time the company had run this trip I'd have to say there was room for improvement too!We travelled yet again with a local bus company that we've used several times before and have always found to be very good. We set off at 6 a.m. for a pretty miserable trip in the pouring rain, arriving at a place called Amnéville - near the Belgian border but still in France - at around 6 p.m., so it was a long day. In reality it wouldn't take nearly that long in a car but obviously our driver had to take regular breaks and we also stopped for a typical French (read \"long\") lunch at mid-day. So we arrived in Amnéville just in time to get settled into our hotel and then head out for dinner. And as ever with this company, they managed to pick out really good restaurants because the food (all inclusive) was  excellent. We didn't have much time to visit the complex where we were staying but it was located in a very well thought out hot springs and amusement park which seemed to cater for all interests!Amnéville resortNext morning we were up and out of there to head west towards The Netherlands where we picked up our boat at a place called Lelystad, cruising through the night to end up at the port of Enkhuizen. The boat was, of necessity, pretty small (you can't cruise down canals in the QEII, after all), but our cabin was nice, the crew were helpful and the food was consistently out of this world! What I hadn't actually realized was that from this point on we would spend every night on the boat and eat all meals on it too and by golly was the food good! The portions weren't big but the menus were so well thought out and cooked it was a real pleasure. Anything you wanted from the bar was also included (yay me) so I barely spent anything at all in the end (just a few souvenirs for the kids) and felt the whole trip was really good value for money!Our boat \"L'Europe\"!Port of EnkhuizenAt Enkhuizen we were met by our local guide who took us on to the fishing village of Volendam which was very pretty - if a little cold and wet! It may (or may not) still be an active fishing village but I suspect most of their income comes from tourism!Volendam!Then it was dash back to the bus for a visit to the Gouda cheese factory and a local clog-making shop (and no, I didn't see much point in buying a pair of clogs), before heading out to the open air museum of Zaanse Schans, where it was again pretty cold - not that that bothered us. It goes with the territory after all! The downside, however, was that we were a bit rushed so I'm thinking that the bus/cruise company might want to rethink some of their itineraries!Windmills at Zaanse Schans!When we got back to our boat I was talking to the guide about the Dutch farmers' party recent victory and she was pretty surprised that an outsider knew about it as their mainstream media had been trying to play it down, of course. As we were talking a couple from our group started heading towards another identical boat to ours when she called them back and explained that it was the wrong boat - \"that was the migrant boat\". If you stopped for a second and looked you could see that it obviously wasn't our boat as it was full of young men just hanging around smoking. Someone made the mistake of calling it a refugee boat and our guide said nope, that was the boat that had been commandeered to house illegal immigrants, not refugees - \"I mean, do you actually see any women and children on that boat?\" You could tell that she was pissed off about the situation and when she mentioned that they were also being given an allowance of €1,000 a month by the Dutch government half our party almost fell off their chairs in shock, outraged that illegal immigrants would be housed, fed and given cash! The same thing is obviously going on in many European countries (although I don't know about the cash part), but I was surprised to read just yesterday that Mark Drakeford, the First Minister for Wales, was trying to push through a similar scheme (where illegals would be given £1,600 per month) but it was squashed by Westminster this week! Then just this afternoon I saw this report about how the army barracks where migrants were being housed in Kent has been wrecked so I'm not surprised people have had enough (you can see the report here)! The trouble is, it takes sympathy and ressources away from genuine refugees who need it most! Greater minds than mine don't seem to be able to solve this issue so I'm sure I don't know what the solution is either!Anyway, I'll write more about the rest of my trip soon, but before I go I just wanted to mention the sad passing yesterday of the inimitable Barry Humphries. Thanks for all the laughs, Edna, and RIP Barry!Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Monday 10 April 2023", "text": "For those of you that celebrate Easter/Passover, I hope you had a lovely time, either with family/friends or just doing your own thing. Jen's mom very kindly invited us to her place for lunch on Sunday and we lucked out because the weather was lovely and we were able to have the windows and doors open! Charlie's foray into Easter egg hunting wasn't exactly a roaring succes as he was more interested in his new bike, but still, it was nice to get together with everyone and be able to sit outside!My gardener came earlier this week for the first cut of the season and everything just looks so nice now. As he'd brought his tractor I asked him if he would cut the island in front of our houses at some point, so he set to and did that too - which means I'm now off the hook for the rest of the season! The menfolk round here generally take it in turns to cut the island but there's no way I'm doing it. Heck I don't even cut my own grass any more so paying the gardener to do it for me leaves me with a clear conscience - and the island looks good too, so win/win!I stayed away from the French news for a few days and boy does it all seem to go mad when I do that! There was an apartment building that collapsed in Marseille a couple of days ago, with a second one also being evacuated. I haven't heard the final death toll from that tragedy yet but I imagine it's still climbing, sadly. Then two days ago there was an avalanche just up the road here that killed six people (two guides and four clients) who were skiing in an area that was marked as only a 2/5 risk for avalanches. So they seemingly were following the guidelines and yet still got caught out! And then just the other day a fire broke out on a ride at Futuroscope (a theme park in western France) where people were trapped on the ride as they couldn't get their seatbelts off. They think it was caused by a lithium battery catching fire, yet again calling into question potential safety issues with electric vehicles. I saw this article (here) back in January, where a Norwegian ferry company has banned electric, hybrid and hydrogen vehicles because of the safety risk, so I'm guessing we won't all be switching to EVs as early as the powers that be would like us to, all the more so given their limited range and difficulties in finding recharging points. My neighbours were just telling me the other day that they drove down to Lyon (about 90 minutes away) a couple of months ago, ran out of battery and had to get the train back, so nah, I think I'll hang on to my old jalopy as long as I can!April Fools came and went, with Jen sending us a picture of a pregnant belly, but I knew it wasn't her (not yet, at least) because just a couple of weeks ago she was as flat as an ironing board (unlike me)! But that reminded me of an April Fools prank that I saw on TV when I was a kid. I actually fell for it, but in my defence I was a very little kid! At the end of the news bulletin they played a short clip showing that year's \"tremendous spaghetti crop\" in Ticino (Switzerland), but since they were having problems bringing the harvest in they were looking to recruit temporary workers to help. Sounded like a great idea to me (and again, I was a very little kid - it was filmed in 1957) and I believe quite a few people actually contacted them about temporary contracts! Ha ha, it must have been a good one if I remember it all these years later (spaghetti harvest in Ticino)! I've been a bit restless recently - you know, thinking of chucking it all in, buying a one-bedroomed apartment and a decent backpack - but at least I wouldn't fall for this gag now second time round!I'm still doing pretty well decluttering and am trying to drop stuff off at the tip every time I go into town and, if possible, do a charity shop run once a week. Last week I actually got rid of a couple of leather carry-on bags that belonged to my brother. They were lovely and had a sentimental value for me, but I know myself well enough to realize that eventually there will come a time where I'm ready to pass these things on and now was the time. I also dropped off a brand new ice-cream maker and a bread machine (used just once), both with the instruction manuals, so I'm hoping someone will get more pleasure out of them than I did! Talking of travel gear, I lugged a suitcase up from the basement today as I'm off to Holland on Saturday. I used to have a list of everything (non-clothes) I needed to take with me (you know, phone charger, adaptor plugs, etc.) but I'm buggered if I know what I did with that list as it's been four years since I went anywhere. So I've drawn up another list on my computer and am adding to it as I think of stuff, and as long as I don't add it to my \"freezer contents list\" by mistake I'm good to go. The other day we received notice to say that the itinerary had to be changed slightly. I think we might get a little less free time in Amsterdam and more time on the cruise, but I'm not sure. Still, as long as I get to wander round Amsterdam I'm good with that! I also have a course on Ayurvedic medicine tomorrow night, which I'm quite excited about as it's something that really interests me, so I'm curious to see how that turns out!Again in the spirit of letting things go, I gave Jen four cake moulds that I'd had for ages. Well obviously I'd had them for ages because they were for a dalmation dog cake, Winnie the Poo, a dinosaur and a lion - and my kids are in their 30s! As it was Charlie's second birthday the other week, Jen had us over for birthday cake and made a lovely brownie cake using the dinosaur mould. It came out perfectly as she obviously greased the mould much better than I did because I remember making a Winnie the Poo cake for one of my kids and it stuck to the pan so badly poor Winnie looked like he'd got a bad case of psoriasis! They'd blown up a bunch of balloons too so Charlie, me and another little one ended up having a few balloon fights. Charlie was strangely obsessed with fighting only using the green balloon, so me being a nasty granny would rush over and grab the green balloon first - at which point he'd throw a hissy fit. Tee hee! But jeez Louise, he's now two years old - you'd think he'd be a bit more mature about it!Anyway, I don't know if I'll get round to posting again before I leave, and I'm pretty sure I won't be posting using my phone (fat fingers), so I hope you all keep well and I'll try to post lots of nice tulip photos if we don't get rained out!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Saturday 1 April 2023", "text": "It's been another pretty decent week here in that I got quite a bit done and the weather was ok-ish. Well ok-ish until two days ago and now we seem to be back in the dark ages. Piddling down rain, howling winds and thunder storms rolling down the valley non-stop. Actually I quite like listening to the storms but the dark and wet I could do without. Every time the sun would break through the clouds for a few minutes I'd think \"great, I'll go work in the garden\" and then it would start pelting down again. So I ended up working in my basement the past few days and slowly but surely I can see a little progress! There is a very large unit on one end of the basement (it's split into three parts) that was left there by the previous owners and where my ex used to collect screws, nuts, bolts and god knows what else. Well I went through that sucker and put like with like - plumbing stuff, nuts and bolts, tools, paint, wallpapering stuff and now it's all sorted and looking infinitely better. I also lugged two more 25 kg buckets of rock solid paint up to the garage so that I can make another trip to the tip sometime this week. They're finally delivering my bathroom stuff on Thursday so I want to clear as much of the garage as possible so I can store all the bathroom fittings and 41 cubic metres of tiles. Exciting stuff - but again I'm not looking forward to the mess!On Wednesday I took a trip out to a big garden centre as André had given me a gift voucher for Christmas and they were having a 15% off sale. It's still an expensive place to shop but man every time I go there I want to throw everything I own away and start over, their stuff is so beautiful! A bit like when I visit IKEA and want to redo my home completely - I mean, their showrooms are so lovely aren't they (well to my mind, anyway)! Walking through the outdoors areas I saw the most beautiful olive trees for sale. They were well established and ran about €1,000 each so even assuming I could get one in my car (I couldn't) there's no way I would buy one. I've always felt that olive trees wouldn't grow well round here but I suppose if they sell them they must do, right? To me it's more of a Provençal thing but maybe not. All I know is that they are beautiful and if I ever move further south you can bet I'll have olive trees galore and to hell with the cost!I specifically went out there on Wednesday because that's one of the days when the big charity shop is open for drop offs and it's not too far from the garden centre. So thinking I had a vague idea how to get there I set off in that general direction, exiting the highway at a place called Lucinges - and started climbing and climbing and climbing with the road getting narrower and narrower and narrower - until I ended up half way up an alp on a goat track which dead-ended in someone's driveway!!! I had to do a 300-point turn relying on the handbrake to stop me demolishing this guy's fence and getting hotter and hotter under the collar until I finally \"did a Muttley\" and made it out of there! Still, at least that was ultimately another pile of stuff out the door!When I got home I got a message from my nephew with a very old picture of my mom and dad, asking if I knew where it was taken (I didn't). He said his brother had joined Ancestry.com and someone had posted a picture of mom and dad and they couldn't figure out who it was. Now there are only four of us siblings left and it was none of us, so I'd be curious to know who posted that picture. They also posted a picture of a gravestone belonging to two of my dad's brothers - Charlie, who died aged 25 (in the 1930s I think) and Billy, who died aged 22 after drinking bleach over a bust up with some girl!!! Dad also had a sister, Cal (the only girl after seven boys) who died aged two after falling down the cellar steps! I know a little of the background but my brother Phil, who died in 2019, would have been able to tell us so much more if he were still alive. That being said, this same nephew also joined whatever that site is that can supposedly tell you your ethnic origins (I don't know how - do they take a blood sample?) and he basically came back a Viking but with no Welsh blood in him, and this despite the fact that three of his four grandparents were Welsh! I'm not so sure about that one, to be honest!In other news, yesterday I took a trip out to a fabric store a little bit off the beaten track for me, since the ladies at sewing club were saying that the assistants at this particular store were far more friendly and helpful than our usual haunts - and indeed they were! One lady spent a good 30 minutes with me picking out fabric for two projects I have in mind and was so helpful that I posted on their FB page to give credit where credit is due! At the check-out I spotted that they were shortly going to be offering appointments to get your sewing machine serviced so I booked mine in for 11 April, and when I asked how much it would cost they told me it was free!! So score there then too, but I suppose having a bunch of women hanging around in your shop waiting to pick up their sewing machines is probably a savvy sales technique too!When I got home I saw I'd received an email from my electricity supplier about \"my revised tariff\" and thought \"oh dear, here we go\", but when I opened the message it turned out to be just a €3 monthly increase in my standing charge, so I can live with that. A couple of my neighbours have asked if my solar panels have made any difference to my electricity costs but to be honest I haven't even gotten round to looking yet. Note to self, I must pick up the instruction manual soon and take a look! I also got an email to say that a game I ordered to play with Charlie should be delivered soon as \"Ji Nan Yi Ming Wang Luo Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si\" had already sent it! Huh? I thought it was coming from France (but that doesn't sound very likely, does it)!And has anyone else been having problems with comments on blogger? For the past week or so I've been finding comments in my spam folder, most of which (although not all) were my own comments dating back ages ago and which I know I had published! I'm also having problems backing up my blog too so I'm thinking it might be time to get my own domain name and move my blog over to that as I don't want to potentially lose it after eight years (eight years??? crikey)!And finally, like quite a few UK bloggers, I was very sorry to hear of the sudden death of comedian Paul O'Grady. Paul found fame some years ago with his alter ego Lily Savage. I can't say I found Lily very funny, to be honest, and I'm not really into drag queens - well except for Dame Edna, and oh British pantomime dames - oh and yes I once went to a drag club in Geneva years ago and had a great time - so maybe I like drag queens more than I thought!The inimitable Dame Edna!Panto's ugly sisters!Paul retired Lily a good few years ago and then went on to host game shows and appear on other media where he gained popularity with his acerbic wit. The other side of Paul was that he was great animal lover (particularly dogs) and worked tirelessly with Battersea Dogs' Home and with his show For the Love of Dogs! But I think where I learned to really appreciate what a kind and gentle man he was was when he shadowed The Salvation Army for a few days, out and about helping the homeless and those down on their luck. He was just lovely to everyone and helped raise quite a lot of money but, tellingly, at the end of the show, when he asked if he would be accepted as one of their \"soldiers\" (I think that's what the Sally Army call them) he was told that they couldn't accept him because he was gay! Says it all really doesn't it! Paul and \"Lily\"!RIP Paul O'Grady! You were a good man!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 27 March 2023", "text": "I had another good week last week - the weather was good, I got a lot done and a whole pile of junk taken down to the tip. I have loads of tubs of paint and other miscellaneous gooey stuff down in the basement which I reckon has been there since we had the whole house painted around 20 years ago. Bit by bit I've lugged it upstairs and taken it to the tip to be disposed of however they dispose of that kind of thing. I've also made a start on dismantling a barbecue that I've had sitting on the back terrace for years and which, even though it has been covered up, has rusted pretty badly. Thinking about the barbecue brings to mind the story of when my ex had moved out and was living with his skank down in town. Every couple of weeks they'd have a playground spat, throw handbags at each other and he'd move back in because \"it's still my house\" - only to move out again about three days later! Well he was back at the house when I was trying to get the barbecue cleaned up and spending about an hour a day after work (I obviously have a thing about spending an hour a day working, don't I) scrubbing that thing to within an inch of its life, all while he sat on his backside and watched me! After about a week it looked pretty good - which was when he turned to me and asked if he could have it for his place! I'd been getting progressively more annoyed at having him sit there watching me work so I flipped on him and yelled that now he wanted it, after he'd watched me scrub it for a week????? Needless to say he didn't get it and I told him to tell his girlfriend to buy her own! Anyhoo, I no longer use it but it has been too heavy for me to move so I've spent the past week bashing away with hammer and screwdriver and gotten it dismantled enough to take to the tip - and very satisfying it is too!I also got word this week that the fittings for my bathrooms have finally shown up so now that I've paid the balance I'm expecting everything to be delivered soon and I can get the plumbers and tiler in. I'm not looking forward to the mess at all, but I'm guessing it'll be worth it in the end! But that reminded me that I needed to get the radiators painted before they showed up, so I set to and slopped around a bunch of paint the other night thinking I'd done a half way decent job - untilllllll I got up the next morning and in the bright light of day saw what it looked like. Oh my word, I reckon Stevie Wonder would have done a better job, I missed so many spots. Still, after a couple of coats on each radiator I'm thinking (hoping) that I've knocked that job off the to do list!Things are still very volatile here in France and not just in Paris. I've got to hand it to Macron, he really does seem to have pissed the entire country off this time. There's another general strike called for tomorrow and he has supposedly been meeting with his cabinet this week so I'll be curious to see what, if anything transpires. On the subject of pensions though, a French news channel had the bright idea of asking semi-celebrities to reveal the amounts of their pensions, although why anyone thought this would be a good idea is beyond me. What I'm seeing is some fairly average (to my eyes) pensions, but of course in the comments people are getting riled up about the injustice of the current reform. I don't know how this helps anyone, or maybe it's just another tactic to wind people up and foster animosity! I'll be damned if I can figure it out!On a more positive note I finally finished the Kaffe Fassett mystery quilt I started about four years ago!!!! It was a mystery quilt in that once a month we would receive a set of fabrics and instructions and after six months (if I remember correctly) information on how to assemble the final quilt. Well I made such a cock-up cutting the fabric that I ended up going rogue and the quilt became so big and cumbersome that I just gave up. Well that is until I started back at sewing in September. So after much blood, sweat and curse words I got the damn thing finished. I reckon it took slightly longer to finish than it did to build the pyramids, but now, at least, I can finally forget about the bloody thing and move on to something more appealing!This is what it was supposed to look like,although the colours may vary!And this is what I ended up with!We had our latest board game evening on Saturday night at Jordan and Jen's place and it was a lot of fun. Then on Sunday they asked if I would look after Charlie for them to spend the day at a spa on Lake Geneva as a wedding anniversary treat. I loved spending the day with him, of course, but man was I beat by the time they got home! And I can hardly believe it but the Munchkin will be two tomorrow! I honestly don't know where the time went as it feels like he has always been a part of the family - and a very much loved part at that!Talking of babies, Max (who was Jordan's previous boss and has been the kids' long term friend and band mate) announced on Saturday that he and his girlfriend were expecting a baby. It kinda surprised me, to be honest, because I didn't see him as the baby type, but more to the point, his girlfriend is the young woman I've mentioned previously who has been wheelchair bound for about 10 years since being in a car accident involving a wild boar! Her legs no longer function and she has what I can only describe as \"crippled\" hands, but there you go, she is pregnant and I'm delighted for them. I'm sure it isn't going to be the easiest of pregnancies and taking care of a baby has got to have its challenges given her circumstances, but she is such a go-getter and positive young woman that I'm sure they will make wonderful parents! Max also mentioned to André at band practice this weekend that he wished he could take Jordan back as an employee, to which Jordan replied that he didn't leave because of the money (although he was paid a pittance) but because of the toxic work atmosphere created by Max's brother and, to a lesser extent, by Max himself. And talking of work, Jordan had an interview with the director where he is working at the moment and they are drawing up a contract this week to take him on as a new employee, rather than employing him through the temp agency. His supervisor told Jordan that he actually went to see the company owner and asked him to take Jordan on as a site foreman because not only was he capable of it but he was a great help as they are working mainly with Polish and Romanian plumbers who generally speak better English than French! Jordan doesn't know what the job offer will look like but either way it has given him a boost to know he is appreciated!At the moment I've got the itchy fingers of someone wanting to pot up seeds when spring is knocking on the door, so my living room is yet again starting to look like a bit of a jungle. Last autumn I planted out leeks, onions and garlic to see if they would survive the winter and so far the leeks look to be doing well. I'd read somewhere about putting the inner tube of a toilet roll around the leeks when they start to grow because it encourages more of a white part to the leek rather than just leaves. So as of right now quite a few of my young leek plants are suitably attired in the latest spring toilet roll fashion and to be honest, while they may look a bit daft, they can't be any worse than some of the stuff at London Fashion Week!And finally, I've discovered a new-to-me Youtube gardener who I'm quite taken with. He lives in London and has the tiny back yard of so many London homes, but by gosh does he get a lot of produce out of it. He's covered in tattoos, which is not something I'm very keen on, but once I took the time to listen to him it turns out he's very funny and informative - and actually quite cute if you watch him \"live\", thus yet again hammering home the ponit that it's never a good idea to judge a book (or a gardener) by its cover!Spicy Moustache Gardener!"},
{"title": "49.3!", "date": "Friday 17 March 2023", "text": "I've had a very productive few days - which thrills me no end! If only I could get it through my brain that it's completely normal not to be uber-productive every day I might not feel so guilty on the lazy days. But hey ho, whaddaya gonna do! I had a vague notion of trying to get to bed by midnight every night but that's been a total fail so far (2 a.m. last night!!)! I guess I may as well knock that one on the head because I don't see it happening, and in any case I'm usually up by 8 a.m. so there seems not much point trying to fight how Mother Nature intended things to run in this house!I managed to get a couple of walks in this week, probably because as I was just talking myself out of going for a walk an email popped into my inbox from Country Walking Magazine - which I subscribed to a couple of years ago yet never read! Oh it's a lovely magazine but it's UK based so while the articles are indeed interesting it's not very relevant to me! I got a walk in down at the lake at Passy and then the next day I did the easy local circuit - the one we used to do during lockdown when we could only leave home for a maximum of an hour a day. Well that is everyone except politicians had to stick to the one hour limit. Rules never have and never will apply to them you see! Anyway I went past the local allotments and stopped for a nose at two men working there but speaking a language I couldn't make out. On the way back I passed a garden where a young lad was playing a competitive game of football all by himself and rattling away non-stop. It tickled me no end! I wonder who won!When I got back I noticed that the celery base that I had stuck in a bowl of water a week ago had started to root, so I planted it and am now pathetically delighted to have a new head of celery growing in my living room! I guess that could be a handy side gig - selling celery at the local market (as long as no-one needed more than one head of celery every three months)! I also got round to dismanteling a little greenhouse that I bought, intending to use it on the balcony (high winds permitting) because every time I tried to move it it fell apart! So then I had the bright idea of glueing the parts together, except I had it on it's side to squirt the glue into the holes when I realized I might well have ended up glueing it to the balcony on its side!!!! Luckily I got it upright and now have it at the end of my balcony, up against my bedroom wall and hopefully secure enough to withstand high winds through the good graces of a couple of bungy straps! I also spent a couple of hours in my (very small) veggie plot today cleaning it up - it feels so good to be working outside again!In other news, I've mentioned before a very large website that I began following (still do occasionally) when my husband left. It talks about dealing with infidelity and in many cases with narcissistic personalities. I'm not on there so much any more as I feel it was there when I needed it and it's time to move on, but I was asked last week if I'd become one of the moderators on their FB group! I told her I'd give it some thought but in the end I had to be honest with her and say that I often snoozed the group for a while as I don't want to get dragged into thinking about \"that time\" any more. She was very nice about it, but I'm glad I made the decision that I did! I don't need the extra responsibility (or aggravation)!I had a lovely surprise message from a close colleague of mine last week where she told me that she'd resigned (she must be early 40s - if that) as she has been offered a very good job at the Asian Central Bank in the Philippines! I knew she'd been frustrated for quite some time. Frankly she was probably too intelligent for our HR department so during her time with me she learned our HR rules and regs pretty much inside out and studied HR law in her spare time - although there can't have been much spare time as a married mom of two young kids. So hats off to her - I'm delighted for her! On a slightly less spectacular but equally happy-making note, Jen told me that her boss had mentioned to her the other week that they might (just might) be able to take her on permanently in September. She always knew the job was just temporary but she likes them very much, says they are very human and it's so darn convenient time and distance-wise. Fingers crossed there then! And then just today Jordan called her to say that the company he is working for through the temporary agency would like to take him on too! He's going in Monday to talk to them and is in a pretty good negotiating position because (a) the temping agency obviously costs them a lot of money and (b) you can't get plumbers here for love nor money - hence he's working with 20 Romanian plumbers! Again, fingers crossed! Jordan and Jen were married four years yesterday so as of today he can apply for French citizenship and it is more or less automatic - he just has to submit his paperwork! I'm going over there tomorrow to go shopping with Jen and since I now have two beautifully sorted freezers (plus a complete list of contents) I decided on the spur of the moment to make a batch of hummus and flat breads to take over, plus a chicken and mushroom pie. I tell ya, I'm so pleased with my nice clean freezers I feel like putting a sofa down in the basement (it's unfinished) and next time someone comes over just casually opening and shutting the doors to see if they notice! I know, little things please little minds, right!Annnndddd the ongoing uproar over Macron's proposed pension reform bill has, I think, reached its pinnacle! I watched a programme on it last night and it is much more complicated than just raising the pension age - which is something he would prefer to do rather than, say, increase taxes on big earners/companies! Anyway, the bill went through the National Assembly and on to the Senate - which voted for it but with some amendments, one of which was the abolition of most of the 42 special pension regimes, although oddly enough not the special regime which allows Senators themselves to maintain the current more favourable conditions! Macron's party do not have an absolute majority and would therefore most likely lose the vote when this reform goes back to the National Assembly, so they have yet again (for the eleventh time????) invoked Article 49.3 - which allows the government to pass a reform/bill/amendment without a vote! Eleven times since Elisabeth Borne was nominated Prime Minister in May last year, that is! So the country is in uproar and a vote of no confidence has been put forward today - which will be voted on on Monday - and if passed the pension reform bill will be dropped and I believe the Government has to resign! I don't know what will happen (what deals will be made behind closed doors), but this is to my mind one of the most contentious situations I have seen in France in over 30 years of living here - and there've been a few!And finally, WAY TO GO THE DUTCH FARMERS! The Rutte Government has been pushing \"net zero\" policies for some time now, one of which was to drastically reduce the use of nitrogen fertilizers in Dutch farming (Netherlands is the world's second biggest exporter of food apparently). So 3,000 Dutch farmers were going to be offered XXX amount for their land, and if they refused their farms would be expropriated! So a land grab on the pretext of \"saving the world from death by cow farts\"! Well the Dutch farmers have been protesting for months now and in yesterday's provincial elections, the BBB Party (the farmers' party) won a landslide victory and are now the Netherlands' biggest party! Of course, as I said above, deals are often made by minority parties behind closed doors, but this news is fantastic. Well done the Dutch farmers, and well done the Dutch people who supported them!The Dutch farmers' protest!Edited to add: after I published this I just saw Neil McCoy-Ward's video and he talks about the situations in France and the Netherlands for the first ten minutes, if you're interested (here)!"},
{"title": "Better late than never!", "date": "Friday 3 March 2023", "text": "I had an ok week this week - not exactly over-productive but not bad either. I did manage a walk from Thyez to Cluses with my friend, stopping in Cluses for lunch - so that probably negated any calorie burn-off but it was nice just to be out in the sunshine. One thing that surprised me yet again, though, is that at the restaurant we had to pull up the menu via the QR code on the table!!!!! That's the second time in two weeks that that has happened. I don't know if this is the norm now or maybe it's just that I don't get out so much. I guess in a way it's a saving for the restaurant, but at least they did have physical menus too. Still, I'm finding all this new-fangled stuff very strange! I also made it to yoga and the gym (which is still very namby-pamby) so hopefully I will start getting into more of a rhythm soon!I still haven't finished painting my bathrooms - I can't be arsed to be honest - but there's not much left to do so I'm aiming to get the walls and the radiators finished this week. Still no word on when the bathroom fittings will arrive, although hopefully it won't be too much longer (not that I'm looking forward to the mess though)! I mentioned in a previous post that I'd gone out and bought quite a bit of stuff from the freezer place, only to have to face up to what a hideous state my two upright freezers in the basement were in. So over a period of about five hours with scraper and hairdryer I've managed to get both freezers defrosted and - I'm ashamed to say - threw out five 30 litre trash bags of very old stuff! It's shameful actually because (a) I should never have let them get into that state and (b) throwing away food is just bad, but at least they're done now! Still, I'm finally getting to use up all those old, tatty clothes that I always kept for \"someday when I'm going to be doing some serious painting/sorting\"!Last Thursday I drove into Geneva to have dinner with a former colleague, and while it's always lovely to see him, gosh I really don't miss that commute, even if going on former experience, traffic was just \"normal\"!Jordan and Jen took a few days off and drove with Jen's mom up to see grandma and grandpap in Lorraine (northern France). They were thrilled to see Charlie, of course, but Jen said he's started with the terrible twos (he'll be two on 28 March) and his favourite answer seems to be \"non\" at the moment! When they got back we had our latest board game evening at Jen's mom's and while we weren't very many, we played a couple of games that I really enjoyed (not too French oriented) and I actually won one (yay me)!André is off to Thailand for work on Sunday and, as I mentioned before, he's flying business class with Emirates (jammy bugger). Or, as he puts it, \"free champagne and a full length bed\"! He seems to be looking at about a six hour flight to Abu Dhabi, a few hours layover, then around another six hour flight to Bangkok, so I'm betting he'll sleep most of the way. Both my kids (and Charlie) could sleep for Britain so I'm sure it'll be no hardship. He's going to take a few extra days after the conference to explore Bangkok and sit by the swimming pool, so maybe if he gets to start travelling for work a little he might feel more settled and less inclined to \"chuck it all in and live on a sail boat\" which - never having sailed before in his life (although he's planning to learn this summer) - doesn't sound like the best thought out plan to me, but who am I to say! Just thinking about Thailand though is giving me itchy feet to travel somewhere more long haul next spring! Time to give that some thought, I think!And finally, last night five of us got to use the Christmas present I bought for everyone - a ticket to the theatre in Geneva to see The Lion King! It was a bit hit and miss at the beginning because Jordan and Jen were coming straight from work and I think Jordan got a shock at just how bad rush hour traffic in Geneva is. My friend and I drove to the border and caught the bus and André, being André, went to work, stopped in at the pub after work and then had to run down to the theatre to get here before the performance started but only after I'd called him telling him he'd better not be late! Before the performance started I thought I'd better go to the loo so put my ticket in my coat pocket, came out of the ladies' - and couldn't find my bloody ticket! As I dashed back into the ladies' room a young girl asked me if I was looking for my ticket because she'd picked it up in the corrider! Phew - and here's me telling André not to make us late! Then when I saw the stage I realized that it wasn't - as I had thought - the Broadway stage performance, but rather the Elton John/Hans Zimmer musical performance. I was disappointed, and a little worried that the others would be too, but what could I do? And then the artists walked on stage and started singing in German and I thought \"oh sh*t, this is going to be a disaster\"! But it turns out they only sang a few tidbits in German and then the rest was either in English or whatever African language the rest of the songs were in - and they were brilliant! There was a huge animated screen behind the orchestra, the music was loud and full of energy, Jen was bopping around, the boys were mesmerized by the orchestra (the drummer in particular - Jordan's a drummer) and my friend and I were singing along like a pair of right old Derby and Joans! The conductor was Stephen Ellery and he was bouncing all over the stage, obviously enjoying himself tremendously, and after picking up a sax played along to Can You Feel The Love Tonight!Stephen ElleryWe all thoroughly enjoyed it, and, having watched a little of the Broadway show, I think I actually preferred this version. It always amazes me how many talented people there are out there! As we left I reminded Jordan of the time when as a young kid he'd looked at me and said how lucky I was to have such beautiful hair. Huh??? And then he said \"yeah, you look just like Simba in The Lion King! Hey, I'll take compliments where I can get them! And then André and Jen got into arguing about when the film was originally released (1994 if you're wondering) and André got it right because he remembers when I picked him up from school one day and held out a video (or DVD - who knows) of the film and he ran over and hugged me, he was so happy. I don't remember that at all, but it's good to know isn't it!Anyhow, with the years my hair seems to be getting darker oddly enough so I no longer look like Simba, but those aforementioned itchy feet of mine have got me thinking about maybe Thailand, or Mexico - or how about Botswana in the spring? A wimba wap, a wimba wap, in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight ....!Elton John/Hans Zimmer's The Lion King!"},
{"title": "Artificial intelligence!", "date": "Tuesday 21 February 2023", "text": "I've been trying to stay away from the news again these past few days (it's been over a year since I turned my TV on), but still dreadful current events make their way through. There was another earthquake in the Turkey/Syria region the other day (those poor people), the devastating cyclone on New Zealand's North Island, and then the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, where the powers that be decided to blow up the deadly chemical spill from about 50 carriages and then told the locals it was \"safe to return to their homes and even drink the water\" only three days later! Yeah, sure, if my neighbourhood looked liks this I'm sure I'd be dashing back!East Palestine, OhioThis picture was taken by a passenger ina plane that happened to be flying overheadat that moment (can you even begin toimagine how scary that must have been)!Whenever I see a news event like this I google it to see where it is and realized that East Palestine is only 45 miles away from my MIL's home just outside Pittsburgh! So yeah, I don't care what the Governor is saying, I'm pretty sure I'd be drinking bottled water (at the very least) from now on!In more upbeat news (for me, at least), yoga started back up on Monday and I learned that we would be doing exercises to \"encourage spring's rising energy\", including breathing exercises which would help anyone who suffers from allergies! The physical exercises were tough but good (I sense she's upping the ante a little), but those breathing exercises!!! Crikey! I've always been a bit of a sceptic but my bloody nose ran like a dripping tap all day after leaving class! I also managed to get in another walk down at the lake at Passy and while it was better than the last time, the far, shaded side of the lake was still icy and slushy so I came back feeling great but looking like I'd just done a tough mudder! And remember I mentioned previously that on a whim I'd bought Japanese foot patches that \"detoxify the body\", well since I'm still finding them absolutely great and really good for relieving aching feet, I gave some to my neighbour today when she was complaining about pains in her feet. I'll be curious to see if they work for her too, but either way, I'll definitely be buying more!I also decided to bite the bullet and have booked a trip to Mallorca (Spain) for September - which will be the first time I've been away since my brother's death in January 2019. Well that's not strictly true as we're going to Holland in April, but I'm definitely looking forward to Mallorca! My friend and I are also off to pay for another day trip to Turin's market in June and I offered my (unhappy) neighbour to come with us as a way of getting away from her husband for a bit. I'm still working on that and trying to get her to join our Monday night sewing club as I know she would really enjoy it. I fear she'll be a hard nut to crack but I can but try!In other news (and any gents out there you might want to skip this bit), I decided that it was about time I bought mself some new underwear (bras, specifically) but had no idea what my size is. So I went onto the Triumph site and was somewhat intrigued to see that using \"artificial intelligence\" you can scan their QR code, do something resembling the highland fling and in theory it will then tell you what your bra size is!!!!!! Soooooo, the site has you strip down to your bra, turn your camera on (sounds kinky doesn't it but it was definitely not a pretty sight) and then position your entire body between two specific lines - though why the AI needs to be able to also see your feet in order to estimate your boob size is beyond me. I mean, I've heard people claim that foot size can be an indicator of the size of another appendage (though not a female one), but boobs???? So I'm standing there (in my underwear and praying the neighbour wouldn't walk through my back garden right now) and the mechanical voice has you raise your arms and then turn slowly through 360° - looking something like this, only nowhere near as cute!Then you have to wait while it whirrs and caclulates - and apparently I need to buy a size \"xy16-41z\"! Yeah, that sounds about right! Would you believe I did the highland fling five times and still didn't know what size to buy so ended up deciding the best thing would be to go into town and try a few on! Artificial intelligence - pfft!Mind you, the other day I decided I needed to make up some home-made washing liquid and fabric softener, and while the fabric softener works wonderfully, every time I've tried making the washing liquid I end up with something akin to a solid brick of soap. I finally went through the instructions one last time and realized when I converted X cups through to X ounces and on to X grams I'd managed to quadruple the amount of savon de Marseille (soap flakes) so it's no wonder I couldn't pour the bloody stuff out of the bottle! So now I'm starting to rethink which is worse - artificial intelligence or mine!Going off on another tangent, the past couple of weeks I've been watching Clarkson's Farm on Amazon Prime (see series 1 here), and tonight I finished series 2 (here) and have absolutely loved it. He's a straight-talking, no-nonsense, absolute non-farmer - sometimes controversial - but the show was a hoot and in a relatively short period of time he has been able to highlight some of the many difficulties facing British farmers (and also what a bunch of jobsworths East Oxfordshire District Council are)! There's apparently going to be a series 3 next year and I'll definitely be watching that!Anyway, what with all the painting, decluttering, yoga-ing and walking, the other day I decided that I would give cooking a miss for a while and just buy a bunch of fairly (al)ready meals from a wonderful frozen food place near here. And of course I went slightly nuts because although what I bought is pretty good, I don't have space in the freezer for it!!!! Yeah, I know, it's like when you go to IKEA and buy an entire bedroom set expecting to get it in the back of your Mini Cooper! So add \"empty freezers\" to my task list, just ahead of finish painting the bathrooms before the plumbers get here and take a carload of stuff to the charity shop. Again, artificial intelligence or mine? The jury's out on that one!And finally, talking of IKEA, I saw this the other day and somehow I just knew where they were coming from!"},
{"title": "Plodding along!", "date": "Tuesday 7 February 2023", "text": "The weather these past few days has yet again been lovely - in my opinion at least. Cold, of course, but sunny and that's when I start thinking about spring and all the seeds I'm going to be planting (and killing) in my garden shortly. I was in LIDL last week and stopped to look at the veggie/flower seeds on display and got chatting to an older gent, who was doing the same and telling me how much he was looking forward to getting back out in the garden! I laughed and said that I was too but in reality I think I spend way too much money and time to get those \"free\" veggies and plants from my garden. Ain't that the truth! We chatted for a little while and he told me to pick up a couple of packets of zinnias as they seem to do really well in this climate! I tend to plant most of my veg in a few raised beds at the top of my garden and don't actually have much decent soil for flowers, but I'll give it a shot and see if they actually do turn out well under my regime of total neglect!On Saturday Jen arranged for a few of us to meet up for dinner at a Lebanese restaurant in Cluses. As I was about to get into my car I heard a cracking sound and dived back under my porch just in time for a fair sized dump of snow to fall off the roof right where I was standing. My first thought was that it would have been quite funny if I had gotten clobbered but when I saw the solid sheets of ice that fell, I'd say I had a lucky escape as they would have hit like razor blades!I was chatting with André over dinner and he was telling me that his work trip to Istanbul has been cancelled (although it was cancelled before the earthquakes) and he would now be going to Bangkok in March instead. He leaves on the Sunday and the conference finishes on the Friday, so he's going to ask for a week's leave in order to spend some time in Thailand. He's been before and loves it, and the jammy devil is flying business class with Emirates so I think he's really looking forward to it! He also told me he'd met a young woman who, it turns out, is Portuguese and works at the UN. They've been out for drinks a few times and he really likes her, but she doesn't like the UN so who knows what - if anything - will happen there! Still I'm glad for him that he's met someone he likes after the bitter blow that was his very much unexpected and unwanted divorce!The neighbours a few doors up are in the process of moving out as the young woman who owns the house is selling it. When we first moved in that house was owned by M. Lesoeur, a divorcé with two teenage kids called Diane and Vincent. Vincent was 17 and as soon as he turned 18 he got his driving licence, bought a motorbike - and was killed a week later in a motorbike accident! Dad moved out and Diane has been renting the place out ever since - well until now, that is! The neighbours seem to have overlapped leaving this place with moving into their next place as they are taking their time to move (and seem to have loads of friends helping), but seeing all that work yet again makes me determined to keep getting rid of as much stuff as I can!I've actually been on a roll again this week, spending every day painting in the bathrooms before the plumbers/tiler come (in early March, all being well) and I've also been either down in the basement sorting stuff for the tip or pulling kitchen cupboards out and throwing anything that's way out of date! I suppose I'll crash and burn in a couple of days, as that would seem to be my pattern, but even though there is loads more to do, I actually feel like I'm starting just slightly to break the back of this stuff!In other news I would guess there is unbridled panic in some quarters where now bankrupt FTX (Sam Bankman-Fried) are demanding the return of donations made by Bankman-Fried to \"numerous political figures and action groups\" prior to FTX's bankruptcy in November last year (see here). Then tonight I started watching the Netflix series on Bernie Madoff. I'd always heard he ran a massive ponzi scheme but didn't know much more about it than that, so I'm interested to learn more about the whole fiasco! While I know many of the Madoff victims were smaller investors who were scammed out of relatively modest nest-eggs, boy am I glad I don't move in those kinds of circles!And finally, seeing the horrific pictures coming out of Turkey and Syria after yesterday's devastating earthquakes, it hammers home just what is important in this life, and it sure as heck isn't the Bernie Madoffs and the Bankman-Frieds of this world. (And T'Pol, I really hope that by now you've gotten word of your family and that they are safe)!"},
{"title": "You vill eat zee bugs!", "date": "Tuesday 31 January 2023", "text": "This week has been pretty nice - cold of course, but lovely sunshine (and no more snow, for the time being). There were 12 of us at my place on Saturday night for our latest board game evening and as ever, I'm still pretty surprised that we're still going. I thought it would fizzle out before now to be honest, but nope, it seems everyone is just as keen to keep going! We played a game a bit reminiscent of a visual \"Chinese Whispers\" (although in French it's the \"Arab telephone\"), where you would be given a word to draw, then the next person had to describe it in words, and the next person had to draw something based on that description. It was pretty easy to play but it gave us quite a few laughs - although not as many laughs as we had with my new Amazon candles!I mentioned before that one corner of my living room is quite dark because the plug sockets in that corner are naff so I don't have a light there. So with that in mind I bought three battery-operated candles from Amazon that I could leave on the coffee table if ever we are sitting down there. They also gave me a chance to play with Charlie by showing him how to blow on the candles and they would light up or turn off (all depending on where I held the remote control of course)! Well he was pretty taken with it for a while, and then a little later I saw Jen's friend, Julien, over there repeatedly blowing on the candles. I assumed he was playing with Charlie but when I realized the babe was behind me, I went over and asked him what he was doing and he told me he was trying to figure them out. At that point I burst out laughing and showed him the remote control! He was pretty embarrassed .... that is until we were all sitting at the table and I put one of the candles in front of Charlie again to keep him occupied. And that was when Isabelle picked it up and started blowing on it - and then her daughter did the same and they couldn't figure it out either! Isabelle's husband was cracking up laughing because he could see me messing with the remote, and when they finally cottoned on she started laughing and couldn't stop. She has a very infectious laugh and I think it's been a long time since we've all lost it like that, so I can highly recommend those candles (if your friends are maybe a bit slow on the uptake and/or alcohol might be involved)!They were something like this!Jordan is still working up at Flaine where it is -18°C during the day (-4°F). He says while it's not too bad, it'll be a lot better when they put the windows in the hotel - I'll bet! He's still enjoying it though and what with the extra money they're paying him to pick up the Romanian plumbers in town he told me he's now doubling the salary he was making when he worked with Max. Add to that the fact that he's not paying for petrol and I'd guess he can count another €400/month just for that, so I'm really pleased for him!I'm still plodding on with my decluttering and cleaning (always easier when you've pitched a load of stuff), but while I was vacuuming in the end bedroom the other day it brought to mind a story a colleague told me when I first arrived in Geneva. At the time she was dating a young physicist who was working at CERN (the European nuclear research place - think Hadron Collider) and Manfried, being basically lazy, told her that he reckoned he'd figured out a way to \"zap\" the dust out of his apartment without dusting! So he ran a wire over most of the surfaces with the intention of running an electric current through it - which would then, theoretically, attract all the dust away from his furniture and onto the wire. It ended up leaving wire-shaped burn marks all over his furniture. They broke up not long after that (and thankfully I think he had nothing to do with the Hadron Collider)! I got quite a big job sorted in the kitchen too the other day when I pulled all my herbs and spices out. Man oh man, do I have a lot. I guess every time I was looking for ground cumin and couldn't find it I went out and bought another packet from the Chinese store! I ended up covered in all kinds of exotic spices and smelling like a curry house but at least that is done and sorted!On Monday I had my last yoga lesson for two weeks as the yoga teacher's kids are on mid-term (ski) break until 20 February. Two weeks ago we did a class that centred around balance and boy did I hate it. While I know balance is extremely important, particularly as we get older, I was hopping round that place like a drunken pirate with a wooden leg! Yesterday's class worked on the lower back - which was great - but crikey you realize just how easy it isn't when you try to do some of that stuff. And talking of balance, I decided to take myself off to the lake at Passy for a walk today, but what I hadn't realized is that the path around the lake is still extremely icy so after walking up to the \"beach\" I decided to turn round and go back as I really don't want to go flying again and maybe break something. It was very cold but still stunning, all the same!And what do you think about the EU's latest \"offering\" where certain crushed up bugs/insects have now been approved for inclusion in food products!!!!! I first read about it here and if I remember right, it was going into effect on 24 January. Since then at least a few other media outlets have picked it up and several of the better MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) are also raising the issue (thank you the wonderful Virginie Joron). There are a few really good MEPs (Christine Anderson of Germany, Cristian Terhes of Romania) and a few others whose names I can't remember and thank goodness for them, because otherwise we'd be left with people like the Greek MEP who had hundreds of thousands of euros in cash in a carrier bag in her apartment and can't for the life of her think how it got there (she's now in jail I believe)! Anyway, it would seem that certain bugs (crickets, mealworms etc.) have now been approved for grinding up into a kind of flour and included in food products. They're mainly destined for junk food like cookies, crisps, frozen pizza and ready meals, etc. but will also be included in certain pasta and bread producs under their latin names, of course! I'm off shopping tomorrow so I'll definitely be taking my glasses with me and using my Yuka app (I'll be curious to see if it picks up \"ground crickets\"). I'll let you know, but bloody hell, what on earth will they come up with next!Yuka app!And finally, for no other reason than I just discovered them (better late than never), I've included a video by an Irish trio called Foil, Arms and Hog who I think are hilarious! Take away \"mammy's\" Irish accent and give her a Welsh one and you've got me and my mom going out clothes shopping - which thankfully didn't happen too often!"},
{"title": "Crikey!", "date": "Friday 20 January 2023", "text": "It's all go again here and boy has it been a weird few days. I went to sewing on Monday evening and we were all chatting (some of us do more chatting than sewing - that would be me) and I commented to Patricia that she didn't look too well (she's the lady whose son is now disabled after falling downstairs and landing on his head)! She's been off work quite some time with an arm/shoulder injury and as she works in a factory and does sewing on the side, I imagine there might be a few financial worries there too! Well she sat down and kinda burst out that she was going to ask her doctor to test her for Alzheimer's! Yikes, I wasn't expecting that! She's 58 and told me that not only is she becoming extremely forgetful but that sometimes she can be driving and have to stop because she doesn't know where she is - and that's on familiar roads! Wow, what can you say to that? I think we've all gone upstairs and then couldn't remember why we'd gone there, but to be driving on familiar roads and suddenly not know where you are would be more frightening! I hope for her sake it's the stress of her current situation rather than anything more serious. Heck I remember once mentioning to my doctor at work that I was starting to worry about that too, but since she knew my home situation she told me that stress and lack of sleep are extremely toxic to your mental health. Turns out she was right!I mentioned in my last post the very heavy snow fall we've had here the past few days and \"how much fun it is\" digging out. Well I can see my friend's driveway from my front door and I noticed on Monday that she hadn't dug out. Nothing wrong with that if she wasn't intending to go anywhere. Then on Tuesday the same thing - again, no problem - but I did notice that there was a very large dump of snow directly in front of her car, as though it had melted off the hood and was starting to build up. Then the following day the same thing, so when I got home that evening I sent her a FB message calling her a lazy bugger! No response. I sent her a text message. Again, no response, so I called but ended up getting her voice mail! As it was nearly 11 pm already I sent a message to her sister in Spain and asked her if she had spoken to her lately. About an hour later she replied that she'd spoken to her the day before so she was probably all right. My friend didn't respond until the next morning when she told me she'd turned her phone off so I told her next time to at least check it before she went to bed because she'd almost had a couple of French gendarmes rappelling in through her bedroom window that night!My brother-in-law was in hospital on Monday for a hip replacement and I could hardly believe it when he was up and walking in the afternoon and home the next day! He's still in quite a bit of pain, which was to be expected, but crikey, isn't it amazing what they can do today!Then on Thursday there was a general strike in France with about two million people protesting (mainly in Paris) against Macron's reform of the pension system and anti-Macron generally. This strike was planned ages ago but Macron, the Interior Minister, the Minister for the Economy and the Transport Minister went to Spain for the ever-so-important \"Friendship Treaty\" between the two countries! Given that the biggest sector affected by the strikes was the transport sector, makes you wonder if the choice of the French delegation to Spain wasn't just a little bit suspect! Anyway, some schools were closed and since Charlie's daycare was closed Jen asked me if I'd have him for the day!It was -9°C (15°F) when I scraped god knows how many inches of ice off my car at 8 a.m. and gingerly drove through the village to get to our local town. Once I hit town though it really wasn't bad going. In town I stopped to let a young lad on a driving lesson pull out. It must have been one of his first lessons because he took the traffic island almost as wide as I was taking bends when I had shrunk five inches last week! But poor bugger, first lesson and you're driving in town in 10 inches of snow! Which reminds me of André's first lesson when the young instructor took him into the mountains in the snow! André was a cocky bugger (aren't they all at that age) and he said it was great, so no harm done!So I had the babe all day and we had an absolute blast. After his nap \"we\" decided to play hide-and-seek and then we had to jump out and scare each other. Well of course he always hid in the same place - behind his bedroom door - but he must have been having a \"bit of a wind problem\" because he kept farting up a storm and saying \"oh pardon\" (\"oh excuse me\") every time. Needless to say he found me more often than I found him but at one point we were laughing so hard we were crying! God love him!On the good news side, I mentioned before that Jordan had been working with a group of Romanian plumbers who went home for three weeks over Christmas. Turns out the company has a contract with a Romanian company to bring these guys over and find and pay for their accommodation to do plumbing work. Well I guess the ski resort where they were working (and staying) needs the accommodation during the ski season, so the Romanians are now staying further down the mountain in a place called Cluses. So Jordan's boss asked him if he would volunteer to be a driver, and when he said yes (it's only five minutes out of his way), the boss rented a 9-seater bus and Jordan is now getting an extra €400 a month for picking them up and getting them up to the ski resort!I drove home (gingerly) after looking after the babe, but the roads weren't too bad considering it never made it above freezing all day. So feeling proud of myself I parked the car, got out - and went \"arse over tit\" on the ice! I wasn't hurt (except for my pride, I guess) but even I thought it must have looked pretty funny (if anyone had been around) as I kinda did a \"running on the spot\" thing before my pratfall!And finally, around 8 a.m. this morning I heard the most humongous bang and instantly thought my solar panels had come off the roof. When I went outside to check I found half the neighbourhood doing the same thing but nobody knew what it was. I kinda thought it might have been an earth tremor but turns out a tanker carrying propane had caught fire and exploded just 10 km from here! It was lifted into the air and debris crushed a car one kilometre away! Thankfully the driver was able to get out and there was just one person injured (although seriously, I believe). The explosion happened in the village where Jordan and Jen lived before they moved to St. Jeoire, but still only about five km from both their and André's places. Considering this is on a major access road for those travelling into Geneva and it was rush hour, it's a miracle there weren't more injuries - or even deaths!For the time being the snow has stopped and the sun is shining and everything is absolutely beautiful! So I thought I'd share a couple of photos published on FB by the Département de la Haute Savoie (the State of Haute Savoie) yesterday, although the first two photos are mine (spot the difference between an iPhone and a real photographer!The view from my place!The view from Jordan's balcony!The rest are from the Département de la Haute Savoie!"},
{"title": "Quite the workout!", "date": "Tuesday 17 January 2023", "text": "I was offline again for most of last week because yet again I felt like I needed to break the online habit in order to get more done around here. Trouble with that was I still don't seem to be able to pace myself and suddenly think I'm going to declutter the whole house, get out walking every day, take care of Charlie and a million other things all in one week. Well that didn't quite work out as planned, so I \"crashed\" for a few days and did pretty much bugger all! Oh I'd been working really well before that and did get a lot done but I really hate that I still don't seem to be able to pace myself better - or maybe it's just that I'm no longer 25 (probably that, right?)!Oh and before I forget, since I was again offline for a while, Sam I was glad to read that you had a wonderful time with your kids, even if your son's flying \"adventures\" weren't optimal!Anyway I took some time out and tried to stay away from the computer for a while, although what with all the gardening videos starting to pop up on Youtube I wasn't always successful. I did get round to reading a book I must have had hanging around for ages, but it seemed quite appropriate (even if it's somewhat dated) to read it in January!I think I must have gotten rid of about 40 books last week, most of which were beautiful but I finally had to admit that I was never going to get round to reading them. Five of them were on the Normandy landings which I guess my ex bought when we were in Normandy about 20 years ago and as it felt kinda \"shameful\" not to read them I decided to keep just one and donate the others, my reasoning being I'm not here to curate any more of his stuff! I think it's a bit like not being able to get rid of a bible, with the guilt factor being pretty strong even though I'm not religious!I watched a few new-to-me Youtube videos today and have discovered a couple of UK news programmes where they talk about current events but can be so funny and irreverant at times! They were talking about various space exploration programmes and one item I hadn't heard of was how the UK Government seemingly \"convinced\" taxpayers to fund a Virgin mission to Mars (and how ridiculous that is given these very difficult times), but when the one commentator said \"I think it made it as far as Brighton\" I just cracked up!The guys came and installed my solar panels last Tuesday so that might have contributed to my fatigue levels, but they were very efficient and in about six hours they were done. All three were Kosovan and told me they travel all over France installing panels. Then the other night I heard a couple of terrific bangs and realized there was a massive thunder storm coming down the valley - and praying the solar guys had done a really good job fixing those things to the roof - seemingly they had. And I was saying to them that it was starting to get serious in the resorts, what with the lack of snow and how I felt sorry for them! Mind you, this cartoon did make me laugh!And then of course Monday night happened and we got about eight inches of snow dumped on us, followed by about another four inches today, so guess who got to get a real workout and shovel about 10 inches of snow off three driveways!!!! My two sets of immediate neighbours are pretty good about whoever gets out there first just does the three driveways or we do it together - there's not an awful lot to do to be honest - but today that stuff was heavy! My immediate neighbour didn't look very well to me last time I saw him and I was pretty sure the others were away but thought I'd just do the whole lot and get it over with. Mind you, by the time I'd finished even I didn't want to be downwind of myself! And of course it's started snowing again this evening!After I'd taken a shower and sat down to recuperate a bit I received a rather nice text from my ex telling me that he and his mom loved the photo albums of Charlie I'd made for them and that it was very thoughtful of me! I guess I really wasn't expecting that but maybe it's more than just the snow that's finally starting to thaw!"},
{"title": "They're just tiles, right? Well no they're not, as it turns out!", "date": "Wednesday 4 January 2023", "text": "Happy New Year everyone. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves, however you chose to celebrate! For me, I stayed home alone because frankly I don't like new year's celebrations and would rather be off the roads in any case. I did contemplate opening a bottle of wine to celebrate but then thought \"nah, why bother\", so I got to spend new year's eve reading and enjoying the silence until midnight. Local fireworks were probably more intense than usual but they only lasted a few minutes. I mean, who can afford a 15 minute firework display anyway! The odd thing lately, though, is that I'm finding I could sleep for Britain if it were an Olympic event. I mean, I went to bed around 1.30 a.m. on New Year's Day (which is a pretty usual bedtime for me) and woke up around 11 a.m. - and there was no booze involved! For a couple of days now I've slept till around 10 a.m., which is just unheard of for me! I guess I'm turning into a marmotte (like Charlie) then! Still, with life starting to pick back up again, I suppose it'll soon sort itself out!Talking of \"home alone\", the other day I received a bank letter for André as he obviously hasn't gotten round to changing his address for some things. He asked me to open it and turns out it was his new Swiss bank card so I told him I'd drop it off at his place next time I was in the area. Well I stopped off on the way to look after Charlie on Wednesday and let myself in to leave it on the table, rather than in his mail box. He was in Geneva and told me \"not to mind the state of his place\", but in reality it was fine except he'd had a few mates over the prevous night so I knew what I'd find ready for the recycling bin! With that in mind I'd prepared a little something at home, which I left taped in the kitchen on the way out!I promise you, this is nothingcompared to what I was expectingto find!Talking of André, he was telling me that he has been tasked with setting up a meeting for his unit in Istanbul in February. I'm not sure what all it entails but I told him he'd better get very precise terms of reference and find out exactly what he will be responsible for beforehand, as well as a name of someone he can coordinate with in Istanbul. He is very junior so frankly it doesn't make sense to me to have him responsible for this, but I guess he'll find out more in due course. Heck we had a huge conference task force which was responsible for booking flights/visas, setting up conference facilities, recruiting interpreters and so on, so I'm thinking there's got to be more than just him for this event, even if it is a relatively small meeting. I'd love to go with him \"to help out\" as I love Istanbul, but then when you go on these things you're there to work, not sightsee!Jumping from the rooster to the donkey (as they say over here), it's now been a year since I turned my television on and I haven't missed it at all! The computer - now that's another matter altogether and in fact one of my \"resolutions\" (most likely the only one) is to not get bogged down on the computer as soon as I get up. I get so much more done if I limit my time online in the morning that I really want to pull the plug on that bad habit. In the evening it doesn't really bother me, but to waste so much time in the mornings when there is so much I could be doing is just silly!That being said, the other day I spotted a Jimmy Kimmel clip on Youtube which I thought was hilarious! I have never liked these one man monologue guest shows and the few that I have watched have confirmed that they just don't appeal to me! But in these clips I see that Jimmy and his cousin Sal are forever pranking his elderly Aunt Chippy (who is now over 80 years old)! And she is a hoot! Oh, she's feisty as hell and has a mouth like a dockworker but the other night I must have sat for over an hour watching the various ways they've pranked her over time. One time they had her house painted lime green while she was out. Another time he brought her a brand new car and had it put in her living room! Then shortly after all covid restrictions were lifted he invited her to watch one of his shows in Las Vegas, but beforehand she \"had to have a medical, just in case\"! How the actors kept a straight face I don't know but boy was she hot when she realized what was going on! But so far the best I've seen was when he \"tricked her\" into zip-lining off the 12-storey building where his show was taking place - and she would have been almost 80 at the time! The affection that their family seem to have for each other is just lovely, and Aunt Chippy is a hoot - if you don't mind bad language! And now I want to be Aunt Chippy when I grow up!Jimmy with Aunt Chippy and Guillermo!The other day I was giving André a ride home and as we went round the bend to pull into his parking lot he blithely commented that I could \"get a Mack truck between me and the kerb\", I took it so wide! Well yeah, I know that, but as I explained to him, all of a sudden I felt like I couldn't see the right hand side of my car and didn't want to bounce off the kerb! So when we parked he took one look at my seat and suggested I \"move it up out of the reclining position\" so that I didn't have to drive lying down! What?? While I know we shrink with age, I thought it weird that I seemed to have shrunk about five inches in six months and to be honest it was starting to bother me. Turns out one of my kids must have driven my car, and while I'd pulled the seat forward again afterwards I hadn't set the back in the upright position so no wonder I couldn't see the bloody right wing of my car! Huh, and here's me thinking I'd started shrinking faster than Aunt Chippy!Talking of cars, it kinda tickled me (though not really) to read that there was huge disruption in parts of the UK over Christmas with people taking their electric cars to travel long distances to visit family and then getting stuck waiting as much as three hours at charging points to recharge their batteries! I guess that's what you get when they try to push \"eco-vehicles\" onto the public when the infrastructure isn't ready!And again in the UK, I saw that the UK border force went on strike for whatever reason - pay I imagine - so the military were called in to take over. Well apparently they did a fantastic job with people singing their praises, particularly at airports, saying how efficient they'd been. I guess the moral there is before you decide to go on strike you'd better make damn sure you're indispensable first!I think I mentioned in my last post that we'd lost one of Jen's Christmas presents. Well I searched high and low this week and decided to take down my Christmas decorations and pull out drawers and move furniture to try and get this place cleaned up at the same time as looking for the envelope (it turned up). And I've been doing really well, spending maybe an hour or sometimes two every day in a concerted effort to clean and/or declutter - and it's been great. So great in fact that I took a car full of stuff to the charity shop today - and yet there's still loads more that can go when I've got the time to sort it! I'm flitting from one room to the other, as is my want, but it's amazing how much better everywhere already looks just by spending a few hours at a time. I also submitted another medical bill to my insurance company via phone app on Sunday and just 45 minutes later I got a message back to say I'd been reimbursed! Apart from providing excellent coverage, I can't sing the praises of this company enough. Talk about efficient!Oh and thank you to all the ladies who sent me Christmas cards via Anne's card swap. And Jan (in Santa Ana), yes I've been to the States. I actually lived in the States for four years (D.C. and Pittsburgh) as my ex is American, but when I was offered a job back in Switzerland in 1989 we both jumped at the chance to move back!Talkng of new year's resolutions, while I think not wasting my mornings on the computer has got to be number one, I have indeed signed back up for the Walk 1,000 Miles Challenge as I'm hoping it will push me to get out walking more than I did last year. That being said, I also logged back into Myfitnesspal - a site I've used in the past for recipes and inspiration. Oh, I doubt very much I will be counting calories as I just don't have that kind of discipline, but when I logged back in the other day for the first time in about a year, I see that I'm actually down nine pounds as compared to this time last year! So I guess the trick is to ignore all dietary advice and just keep doing whatever I feel like!And finally, wouldn't you know they're coming to install my solar panels on Tuesday - the same day as I've booked my car in for its contrôle technique (the MOT or vehicle safety check). Still, I'm sure they can work without me being home for about an hour. I mean, it's not like I'll be getting up on the roof or anything, is it! Then yesterday I went with Jordan to order all the fittings to redo my two bathrooms. I had a pretty good idea what I wanted anyway, but I really valued the sales lady's help (she obviously knew her stuff) and I'm so glad Jordan was with me to talk the \"plumbing\" talk! My French is good, obviously, but half this stuff I don't know in English, let alone French. One thing I finally got through my thick skull though is TILES! Tiles are tiles right? Well not in French they're not. Oh I know that roof tiles are tuiles, and floor tiles are carrelage but I could never get through my brain what faïence were. Turns out faïence are wall tiles and on many occasion I've mixed things up a bit so thankfully Jordan was there to explain to the nice (confused) lady that no, I didn't in fact want the pretty mosaic tiles I'd picked out for the roof, they are going on the floor because they are carrelage! I tell ya, I came out of there almost €10,000 lighter and totally exhausted - but not as knackered as that poor sales lady must have been. Still, at least she'll be making good commission!"},
{"title": "And so time moves on!", "date": "Monday 26 December 2022", "text": "Greetings earthlings (which is what I'm told Santa's elves say). I've been offline again for a few days so missed some of your recent posts (but am hopefully all caught up now)! I'm glad everyone seems to have had a good Christmas and is looking forward to the new year. Oh and I wanted to say to Ms Moon - I'm so glad Mr. M's latest ER escapade turned out ok (I had missed that post while offline)! I also want to mention that I spotted a few comments in my spam folder the other day so I apologize if anyone thought I was ignoring them - well anyone except \"Rehana\" who seems to be trolling his/her away round blog world again!As for me, I guess not much is new although the past few weeks have treated me kindly! I bumped into the newest member of our sewing club at the market just before Christmas and she was rhapsodizing about how happy she is to have found our group. She's an older lady and a novice at sewing but is so enthusiastic and told me that she had never met such a friendly group and was having such fun. It's nice to hear, isn't it - and I get exactly what she means about our group. We all seem to have found \"our gang\" and are indeed very, very friendly and welcoming!On the good news side I got word from the French authorities that they will reimburse me €2,000 (of the €4,500 cost) when I get my fire insert installed on 16 March. They do this in order to encourage people to get rid of their open chimneys, so while I won't have to demolish my fireplace (I wouldn't have anyway as I like it), by getting the insert it effectively puts the open chimney out of commission. That's surely better than a poke in the eye with a wet fish, right?On the not so good news side, I haven't done nearly as well with my walking this year and don't really know why. Maybe I just lost my oomph, but I know the excruciatingly hot summer didn't help. Anyway, I've pretty much limped my way to around 900 miles for 2022. I really want to do better in 2023 so I'm going to sign back up to the FB group in order to keep my mind focussed!This next I mention for no particular reason, but I've yet again been getting quite a few \"hallo dearest, I'm the dying widow of ..... and would like to leave you $10 million in my will\" or \"this is UPS Wisconsin and we're having trouble delivering your parcel\" (not surprising really, considering where I live!) and I inevitably respond by telling them to \"go shove it where the sun don't shine\" and then block. Well the other day I got a strange message from new-to-me email address \"movasin\" and was just ready to do the same when I took a closer look and it turned out to be the bill from my gynae (whose name is Sina Movarekhi). Damn, I'm glad I didn't have an attack of trigger finger on that one!Then last week I went to our retirees' association lunch and was delighted to end up sitting next to a few of my favourite retirees (there are some everyone tries to avoid like the plague, of course)! Anyway, I ended up sitting next to Tony - who I was supposed to be going to André Rieu's Zurich concert with pre-pandemic (\"for a dirty weekend\" (not), as we put it) and we talked about looking up his latest dates now that he's touring again. Well it turns out Zurich is sold out already so it doesn't look like it will be this year for us, but for some reason I also spotted that my favourite comedian, Peter Kay, is back touring after taking a few years away \"for personal reasons\" and I'm delighted! All of his gigs so far are in the UK (although I know he'd sell out Geneva), so I'm debating asking my sister if she wants to book a date on his new tour to go see him together. I watched 18 minutes of him on Youtube this morning and he had me in stiches as his insight into life in Britain is absolutely spot on!Peter Kay!On the Christmas front, Papa Noël again visited our village earlier this week, but I guess Rudolph was having a rest pre-Christmas because yet again his arrival was somewhat unconventional!I also bumped into Stan and his wife for the first time in ages and was pleased to see him looking well, even though his wife quietly told me that his health was still very much up and down!With Stan and his wife, Martine!On Christmas Eve we were invited up to Jordan and Jen's but Jen told us to wear something warm as we were \"going somewhere first\" - well that is if the landslide she had heard about hadn't blocked our route! Turns out we ended up at the ski resort of Samoëns, which is one of my favourite little towns,(I've written about it a few times already - Samoëns), so that was a nice surprise. We were there to see Papa Noël coming through (again), but this time his sleigh was being drawn by a rather beautiful shire horse. Everyone complied with the request to stay away from the horse and parents were very good at standing back and letting all the little kids go to the front. But wouldn't you know it, I held up my phone to start taking photos and the bloody battery died! Damn! But at least we got to see him for real, although to be honest Charlie was pretty non-plussed (he's still little as yet). After that they let off fireworks in the Botanic Gardens, and while the display was short it was very, very good! I heard an awful lot of English spoken - not sure if they were tourists here for the skiing or imports like me - and even a bit of Welsh so that was nice!Samoëns (just before my phone died on me)!Christmas Day was at my place, with Jen's mom making a wonderful sauerkraut lunch - a speciality of her region. I think we all hit it out of the ball park with our gifts this year - me especially with Jordan's self-heating coat. He was thrilled and couldn't wait to get the battery charged to try it, although he was a bit concerned that Jen might steal it from him (no chance) as he knew she would love it too, even if it was too big for her! I bought several gifts for everyone but at one point Jen was scrambling about looking for an envelope I had given her (a gift voucher to a craft shop), which seemed to have gotten lost in the fray - and which actually made me think of this quote from Very British Problems!At one point Charlie was bouncing along one of the couches and Jen's mom smacked the sofa hard while playing with him. Well I'm ashamed to say a dust cloud flew off that thing and when Charlie emerged from it he looked like something out of The Hound of The Baskervilles! Talk about embarrassing! So this evening I have had my very heavy couches pulled out, scrubbed down and vacuumed thoroughly and yet I still didn't find Jen's voucher. As I moved the heaviest couch out I noticed a plug socket on the back of it??? Say what? Since when has my couch had a plug socket? Well it turns out it doesn't but it had been pushed up so hard against that wall that an old, unused socket cover had stuck to the back of it (I guess it really was time for a good clean then, right?)! Then I spent the next 30 minutes trying to put it all back together again but I now seemingly have one large cushion too many! Ha, so now I'm trying to find a picture of my couches to find out how they go back together. How dumb is that!Both my kids are pretty funny and while I'm used to them, they often have Jen's mom in stitches. Anyway, André came out with this one last evening and we all burst out laughing!\"What are the three things an American can just never say?\"I'M SORRY\"\"YOU WERE RIGHT\" AND ...... \"WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE!\"While the first two are obviously not true, the last one is pretty spot on, in my opinion! So after my epic ramblings (you can see why I don't post often, can't you), I hope you have a lovely New Year's Eve and that 2023 is kind to all of us! Meilleurs Voeux - or Namaste from France!"},
{"title": "How bloody sad!", "date": "Monday 12 December 2022", "text": "It's been a strange sort of week this past week. After the big snow dump the other day I spent some time outside shovelling. Not a lot, to be honest, but it's so much easier to get it cleared when it's fresh rather than wait until it's frozen solid! When I'd finished I closed up the garage, walked through the front door and \"poof\" - no bloody electricity! I knew immediately that it wasn't anything to do with my house because you get that \"pop\" sound when a fuse blows. No, I reckon this was a local problem, most likely heavy snow bringing down some cables. Who knows! It was already getting dark and if you remember I posted recently about buying six magnetic LED lights and installing them at various spots around my home. So I went round and flicked four of them on and viola (as no-one here in France says), let there be light! Damn I felt invincible, a bit like a cross between Bear Grylls and Ray Mears! I'd even made a point on the first of the month to ensure they were fully charged! How's that for smug. I knew I'd be ok as my stove top is gas rather than electric, but I figured bread and cheese would do for dinner anyway. The roads were clear this morningbut we're expecting more snow starting tonight!So I was bundled up reading on my sofa with a magnetic light behind me when my sister called to thank me for their anniversary card. She and my BIL celebrated 50 years of marriage on 9 December and went away to Dublin for four days as a treat. She said Dublin was bitterly cold and wet (I'm not sure that ever really bothers the Brits) but they had a wonderful time anyway. A wonderful time, that is except for the Albanian illegals! Their taxi driver was telling them that they fly in to Dublin, dump their passports and any other ID and then take off running. Parts of Dublin are now practically overrun and particularly dangerous because of knife crime and just generally filthy. I see what's going on on the south east coast of England with the illegals coming over from France by dinghy (though not all are Albanians), but hadn't realized they were actually flying into Ireland and doing the same over there. Albania is not in the EU and so while they have every right to enter EU countries they are not supposed to stay more than three months. Well good luck with that! I see the new Swedish government has just informed Brussels that (a) they will no longer be spending the EU-required percentage of GDP on foreign aid, and (b) they will automatically refuse asylum requests from anyone found to be Albanian on the grounds that Albania is not at war! Damn, talk about importing more problems!As I was finishing up snow clearing my neighbours pulled in and as fate would have it, they also just \"celebrated\" their 50th wedding anniversary, having gotten married the exact same day and year as my sister and BIL. As she got out the car I wished her a happy anniversary and she \"shushed me\" and told me not to mention it! He's pretty deaf anyway but she told me later that, as she knew would happen, he hadn't wished her a happy anniversary and, in fact, hadn't spoken to her all day! How sad is that!In other news, I'm still making (admittedly very slow) progress on sorting and getting rid of stuff. The other day I came across a bunch of cards and going through them I found a birthday card from Steve (who died about three years ago) and Brian (who I met in Turkey and I'm guessing died about the same time), from my brother and his wife (both also now dead) and my friend H, who died in Australia almost a year ago now! I finally felt able to get rid of most of the cards but have hung onto those few cards for the time being until I might feel able to get rid of them too!I also showed a bit more enthusiasm in the kitchen this week and made \"chocolate crinkle cookies\" (a complete disaster, they would make better frisbees) and a very unusual parnsip and apple soup (from \"Oh Crumbs!\" blog) which was surprisingly good! Then last night I was at a bit of a loss so decided to flick through Netflix to see if anything good was on. Turns out there wasn't so I ended up watching a Norwegian film called Troll and my goodness, I don't know if it was meant to be a comedy or what, but it was bloody awful, even if the special effects were halfway decent! When I see something like that I often wonder if the actors - assuming they become famous later- are embarrassed by it or if that's just par for the course! Heck I believe Courtney Cox advertised tampax before finding fame on Friends!Troll!Yesterday I had some running around to do so decided to stop in at the local library to drop off my books. I wondered about the road up to the library, what with all the snow, but it was ok getting up there. However getting out of there was another matter altogether! The two main routes out of the old town are cobbled stone and steep so as the one had been blocked off I followed the car in front of me over to the other exit. However, I hadn't seen the \"diversion\" signs and he and I ended up blocked on a little back street in the old town with seemingly no way to get out! In the end we decided to take a one way street the wrong way - well it was about 10 metres the wrong way - and we were able to get out that way and follow a few other cars down through the fields back into town! Yikes, I don't think I'll do that again and it certainly put paid to any quaint idea I might have about moving into the old town!Where Jordan and Jen live there are three young families on their floor, each with a young child. The youngest is Charlie and the oldest is Tia, who is a year older, and the three families often get together for pizza and play dates. Anyway, dad next door is a volunteer firefighter so the three Munchkins got to sit in a fire truck the other day before going up the mountain to go sledding! Jen said they had a blast!On the bad news side, I was sad to hear Céline Dion's dreadful news that she has been diagnosed with \"stiff person syndrome\", an incurable auto-immune disease with a dreadful prognosis! I'd heard of it before but ....! It must be awful to be diagnosed with any kind of illness, especially since she has young children, but how sad and frightening for her. And to think I almost got to see her in Nice a few years ago, except my ex did his usual and staggered home sh*t-faced at 4 a.m. and it was too late for us to leave for Nice! She's bravely talking about being excited to get back to singing again but honestly, I don't see it myself! I wish her luck though, as goodness knows she's going to need it!And finally, my nephew sent me the press release about the six little kids that had fallen into the water at Babbs Mill lake in Birmingham. At the time of writing, three had died (8, 10 and 12 I believe), a six year old is in critical condition in hospital, and two more are missing! Bloody hell! I have written briefly about Babbs Mill before (here). It's about 200 yards away from where I grew up and we used to play down there all the time, although it wasn't so much a lake back then as just the filthy River Cole. Apparently adults were calling out to the kids not to go near the water but somehow they all ended up on the ice and then disaster struck. It's sad any time, of course, but so near Christmas - I don't know how anyone could ever get over such a tragedy! My heart breaks for all the families involved!My house was where the red flag is -48 Dunton Road. As you can imagine, we kidswould always be either playing in the woodsor down at the lake!"},
{"title": "Bugger!", "date": "Thursday 8 December 2022", "text": "As so often seems to happen, I ran out of steam last weekend so ended up taking a couple of days off from being Bizzy Lizzie! It wasn't too bad though as I still got a lot done! On Friday I picked Jen and Charlie up from the Ford garage and they spent the day here while her car was being worked on. Since she loves putting Christmas decorations up and I hate it, we traded - I cooked and played with Charlie and she got my tree decorated, so we're all happy! I made a rather good split pea and ham soup for lunch - which was a darn sight better than the butternut squash soup I made the other day - or maybe the problem is that I just don't actually like butternut squash! I guess that begs the question \"why buy it\", right? Don't know really, but I do keep trying!That's the nice thing about autumn and winter though, isn't it. There's not much that can't be improved by making \"bottom of the fridge\" soup or quiche! That being said, it's so mild here it's unbelievable. Facebook keeps reminding me that \"on this day xxx years ago\" the back garden was covered in snow, and while the snow line is creeping ever closer, so far we've mainly just had sunshine and what I would consider above average temperatures! Long may it last!EDITED TO ADD: WE GOT EIGHT INCHES OF SNOW LAST NIGHT AND IT'S STILL COMING DOWN. I GUESS SNOW-SHOVELLING IS GOOD FOR THE BINGO WINGS TOO!Jordan is still working up at Flaine (altitude 1,600 metres) and was saying that they have to put snow chains on every morning and evening. Sooner him than me! I remember one time years ago it had snowed overnight and as I was going grocery shopping my friend asked if she could come with me. So the two of us spent the best part of an hour farting around trying to get snow chains on my car - and this despite the fact that the bird in the adverts manages it in about 10 minutes in a pink cashmere sweater and with immaculate false nails (my eye!!!). So we rolled about in the snow for an hour and finally got the bloody chains in place, turned right out of our little subdivision and about 30 metres down the road the snow had all melted!!!! Anyway, all that to say that Jen was talking about Jordan wanting to buy a Milwaukee self-heating jacket. I'd never heard of them but seemingly you insert a battery (shaped like a stick of dynamite) into the jacket and it heats the entire thing up for xxx number of hours! How neat is that! So of course I went online and two days later both the jacket and the rechargeable batteries had arrived! I'd already got all my Christmas shopping done but what the heck!At yoga on Monday we worked on the \"salute the moon\" set of exercises (as opposed to \"salute the sun\") and boy did I feel like I'd been hit by a truck afterwards! Since I was on a roll I also went to the gym for a short-ish workout on the old bingo wings and now I'm discovering aches in places I didn't even know I had places!Then on Tuesday evening I went to a course at the library in a neighbouring village on how to make your own cleaning products. While it was good, as Jen said, it seemed to call for quite a lot of different items. So the next day I went online and found a recipe for homemade fabric softener - which cost me about 40 centimes to make and gives my laundry a pretty nice smell too!While I was at sewing club the other week the Mayor of the village that gives us the use of their village hall (and gives us a small subsidy) stopped by to say hallo as he was coming from a meeting in the same building. I got chatting to him and what a nice guy he is. One of the ladies mentioned that I'd just driven to Thonon to pick up a new serger and he told me to \"remember to put in for my mileage\". Huh? I had no intention of asking for petrol money but he said they actually had money in the accounts and to make sure I put in for it. When I checked out the mileage, turns out I was owed almost €40, so I'm glad he was kind enough to mention it! I was all the more glad I put in for it yesterday, though, when I received a speeding ticket for €45 related to my trip to Thonon! I don't use that road often and had forgotten that there are radars all along it, and while I was only 8 km over the limit I still got done! Don't suppose the accounts would run to covering that huh - nah, didn't think so! Oh well, no good deed goes unpunished, as they say!Then on Monday afternoon I had another appointment at the gynae's. I'm having to go every three months at the moment but it's nothing he nor I are particularly worried about - just something he wants to keep an eye on for a year! As I was about to leave I mentioned my recent mammogram (I go every two years) and he asked when I'd had it done as he hadn't received anything. When I said about six-eight weeks ago he was steaming mad, saying that he didn't know what was going on with that clinic but mine wasn't the first mamo that he hadn't received and that it was unacceptable! I told him the doctor had told me that everything was fine, but as he rightly said, if things hadn't been fine we had just wasted two months when he could have been following up on it. He was right of course, but then - rather strangely, I thought - he said he didn't know about me, but he was finding that in his profession at the moment the \"I don't give a shit\" attitude was becoming all too prevalent! The weird thing is I had to agree with him! Not because I'd been on the receiving end of poor treatment myself - not at all - but I've been seeing more and more people commenting about poor attitudes and service in the medical field! How funny that he should say that! Anyway, his office is in the centre of Geneva and I always park in the underground car park that serves the hospital and I hate it! This time half the lights were turned off and even if it was with a view to saving on electricity, I felt very uncomfortable down five floors in the dark on my own! Then, I hate pulling out of that car park because I find the winding exit ramp so tight! And I'm sure I'm not the only one because while Europeans generally tend to drive smaller cars due to our petrol prices, not everyone drives a mini either! And wouldn't you know it, as I was pulling out, for the first time ever I heard a screeching sound of concrete against metal! Bugger! When I got home I took at look at my car and it doesn't appear too bad. It seems I didn't hit the wall as much as scrape my low-slung Ford along the sidewalk leading out of the parking lot! But again, \"damn and bugger it\"!On a more positive note, I received the annual cost-of-living adjustment notice from our Pension Fund and while it's a measly 3.3%, I guess that's better than a poke in the eye with a wet fish! The 3.3% represents the cost-of-living increase (average, I guess) in Switzerland because even though I live in France I take my pension in Swiss francs. Interestingly, I saw that had I been taking my pension in euros I would have gotten around 8.5% (France), with the highest quoted being Germany at nearly 10%!!!!! But the swings and roundabouts part of it is that the Swiss franc is so strong compared to the euro at the moment it all more or less evens out in the end!And again on a positive note, my friend sent me a message to say that GAL Voyages (who we've travelled with a lot) sent her a notice to say that the trip to Holland to see the tulips was back on for April and would we like to pre-book (since that was the trip we had to cancel due to the pandemic), so we're going in to town tomorrow to reserve. From memory we'll be driving up to Belgium and then over to Amsterdam for a few days, on to Keukenhof to see the tulips and then on a cruise for a few days before heading back home! We've always been very happy with this company and I'm about ready for a vacation after three years without! Now if they put the Corsica trip on again this year as well I think I'll be in heaven!KeukenhofAnd finally, a thank you to Bobi in Maryland for my Christmas card (in Anne's Christmas card exchange). It came today!"},
{"title": "Had a good week this week!", "date": "Sunday 27 November 2022", "text": "I have no idea why but for some reason this week has felt like a really good one! I got a lot done that has been hanging over my head for ages but it hasn't felt like a chore. I don't know, maybe I just paced myself a bit better. I know what really helped, though, is getting back to yoga on Monday morning! I've missed a couple of weeks, what with having fuel delivered one week and then my car breaking down, but if there's one thing that sets me up for the week it's yoga - and that despite the fact that I have to force myself to go there! This week there was a new-to-me older lady in our group and I had a hard time trying to figure out what was going on with her. She was a tiny little dot of a woman who has obviously done yoga before, but I'm not sure if she'd maybe had a stroke or had dementia because while she could do the exercises easily, she seemed somewhat confused and was difficult to understand. That being said, our teacher was patience personnified and from what I gathered from the lady herself, she intends to continue - and good for her!On Tuesday my car was back in the garage (a planned appointment) for new brakes, so after dropping it off I caught the little bone-shaker mini bus back home. By car it takes 10 minutes, on foot I could probably do it in about 50 minutes, but for €1.50 I got a 30-minute scenic ride round some of the local hamlets before being dropped off at the church in my village. With nowhere to go I felt in the mood to do some baking, so since I get on well with Thiery at Ford, I made peppermint brownies to take with me when I went to pick my car up later that evening. To be honest I was lazy and took the bus back down to town even though I could easily have walked, but as it looked like rain I decided to give walking a miss this time. I got chatting to the driver who, it turned out, was the same age as me and also retired (but still driving for the bus company?). Anyway, he was asking me if I liked walking in the mountains, so I said I did but hadn't done nearly enough of it this year, and I was probably pretty foolish for going on my own. He commented that if I didn't have health issues it shouldn't be a problem, but when I pointed out that anyone could twist an ankle or fall he ended up agreeing with me that it probably wasn't a good idea to go solo - and would I like to go walking with him one day??? Say what? I'm not sure what I said, exactly, and in any case, since we already have snow in the mountains, now would not be a good time to start. Anyway he said he regularly drives this mini bus and if I change my mind to get in touch!About 15 mintues into the journey, \"Jessica\" got on the bus! I know her name was Jessica because she was on her phone constantly (and very loudly) the entire journey. Turns out Jessica needs new glasses and has an appointment mid-December. Then she wasn't sure what to make for dinner and seemingly balled her mom out for not walking the dog yet! It beats me why people have to have these kinds of conversations in confined spaces and at such volume! Oh I understand if the phone rings and you get caught out, or if it's an emergency, but I will never understand why people can't keep these conversations for when they are alone so that the rest of the world doesn't have to know the intimate details of their lives! When I was still working you would occasionally get someone like that on the bus to the border and the entire bus got to know their business, but to be fair it wasn't very often! I guess there's nowt so queer as folk, is there!On Wednesday I managed to talk myself into going to the gym for the first time in about six weeks! Oh I was desperately trying to think of an excuse for why I shouldn't go but as I couldn't come up with anything, off I trotted and again I like it very much once I'm there. There were only three of us in the entire upper floor weight room so it's not like you actually have to wait to use any of the machines. Well that's maybe not strictly true because shortly after I arrived a man came upstairs and sat on one of the machines - and then proceeded to look at his phone for the next hour! He never moved once, and then just as I was about to leave, he picked up his towel and left! That must have been quite the work-out!And remember I mentioned that I was going to make up a photo album of old photos for my sister? Well I got that done this week and sent it off for processing - and then 24 hours later my album was sitting in my mail box when I got home! Talk about efficient! It's not the greatest album because, as I say, it was made up mainly of very old black and white photos, but I'm delighted with it and I'm pretty sure my sister will be too. One of the oldest photos was of my great-grandmother on my mom's side holding my brother Phil - which I guess was taken around 1943 and which has come out reasonably well, so I'm pleased with that!Phil, mom, granddad and great-grandma!When I was at sewing club the other week, Chantal mentioned that she thought Patricia (our sewing teacher) wasn't doing too well at the moment and what did I think about stopping out to see her? This is the lady whose son fell down the stairs, landed on his head and who is now mentally disabled as a result. Patricia works in a factory during the day but depends on her sewing in the evenings to make up her salary - except that she currently has problems with her shoulder and arm and despite being on sick leave she can't even take advantage of the time off to catch up with her sewing. So Chantal asked if a couple of us would like to drive down to Patricia's under false pretext on Thurdsday just to stop in for a chat. And that's what we did. I bought flowers, Bernadette baked a couple of cakes and Chantal brought a bottle of wine and we spent a couple of hours helping Patricia with a few odd jobs before cracking open that bottle! You know how occasionally you meet someone who is just nice - well I reckon that's Chantal. She's very thoughtful and always one of the first to pitch in and help out, and I know Patricia was very touched by our visit!Then on Friday I had to drive out to Thonon to pick up a serger (a fancy sewing machine, for the uninitiated) for our club and while Thonon is beautiful I hate driving out there because it's 50 km of small, traffic-filled roads and bottlenecks. And to think my neighbour drove beyond Thonon to Evian (where the bottled water comes from) every day for over 10 years for his job! I'm not surprised he was thrilled to be able to retire early - leaving home at 4.30 a.m. for years has got to get old very quickly! I gave myself plenty of time as the sewing machine guy - while nice - is chronically late and I still ended up sitting on a wall outside his shop for half an hour waiting for him to show up. Still, it's all sorted now and I drove back via St. Jeoire so I got to see Charlie for a couple of hours afterwards, thus making the hassle all worthwhile!ThononAnd finally, I've gotten such a lot done this week I'm really happy with it. I've been trying to set myself an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon to work in the house and either in the garden or the garage and it's been really productive. I guess I might be panicking slightly at the thought of 41 square metres of tiling plus fittings being dumped in my garage sometime soon in order for them to start work on my bathrooms! Still, through slogging away just a little bit every day I've got my bedroom completely sorted (eeew, the dust bunnies when I moved the bed) and a whole load of stuff taken to the charity shop! Where on earth does it all come from though? And then tonight I spent an hour \"putting the garden to bed\", and while I was doing that a paraglider drifted out from under the clouds on the mountain and landed in the field at the back of my house! How cool is that? I guess that's one way to avoid the traffic jams isn't it!He landed a couple of secondsafter I took this picture!"},
{"title": "The tortoise and the hare!", "date": "Saturday 19 November 2022", "text": "Well I have to say I am dead impressed with the way the breakdown company handled my situation the other day when my car wouldn't start! I was a bit worried, truth be told, because for over 30 years I have kept up my coverage with a Swiss company called TCS and just a few months ago I finally cancelled it because the guy at my French bank told me that I was covered for everything just the same under my French insurance. So only ever having used TCS two times in 30+ years, what happens - I break down pretty much as soon as I cancel them! I tried charging my battery for over 24 hours but nothing gave so on Monday morning I called the number on the French site. I was immediately instructed to press a different key for \"is anyone injured\", \"are you on a motorway\", \"is it urgent\" and I just hate that stuff. But, within about 90 seconds I received a text message with a link to follow in order to set up an appointment to have someone come out. And yet again, in under two minutes I had someone on the phone. I told him it wasn't urgent as I was parked in my driveway so at 1.30 p.m. that afternoon they sent out \"the jolly green giant\" (except he wasn't green, but was definitely very jolly) and in less than five minutes he had turbo charged my battery with his rocket booster and all was fixed! When I told him my battery was almost seven years old he just laughed and said to think myself lucky as it didn't really owe me anything did it! I was just so glad, though, that I hadn't set off to Jordan and Jen's that night and broken down on some lonely back road in the middle of nowhere. I pointed out to Mr. Giant where the mice had been gnawing away but luckily they hadn't chewed through any wiring - just the rubber tubing!Looks like they've been making theirnest in the foam under the hood!Lunch was apparently also included!Anyway, I had already called Ford that morning and they ordered in a battery for me, so just a few hours later (and several hundred euros lighter), I was set to go! As we were invited over to Jordan and Jen's for dinner on the Saturday night, Jen's mom very kindly picked me up and dropped me back home, and while yes, it was kind of her, I absolutely hate riding with her. She is one of those people who rides the coat tails of the car in front with a \"can't you go any faster than that\"? and \"hey grandad if you can't hack it get off the road\"! And I hate it! Even her partner was telling her to chill as we were in no rush but there was nothing doing - that's just the way she drives. She can handle her car, thankfully, because as she was riding \"grandpa's\" bumper he suddenly put on his left turn signal and she had to slam the brakes on hard to avoid him! I tell ya, I'm so glad to have my own car back, although I suppose in all honesty she would probably go just as nuts having to ride with me, wouldn't she!I spent a couple of hours the other day catching up on paperwork. I'm usually pretty hot on that stuff as I hate being disorganised, but I guess it got the better of me for a while. I think I mentioned before that the Swiss are very much into QR codes and online banking (naturally, I suppose). Heck they haven't used cheques since 2003 so you'd better be somewhat computer literate if you have a Swiss bank account - as I do where my pension is paid! Just recently my doctor's bills have been arriving with a QR code and you either use that or you type in all the relevant info yet again in order to pay your bill. I don't pay my bills via my phone, simply because I find the screen too small, and I figured the QR code wouldn't work on my computer but whaddayaknow - I held the bill up to the camera on my clunky old computer and it scanned the payment details into my bank account for payment! Talk about impressive! It was certainly a lot easier than typing in 20-digit reference numbers every time! So I guess you can, occasionally, teach old dogs new tricks then! I also spent some time deleting blogs from my favourites list, which has streamlined my reading list quite a bit. Not that I didn't like those blogs, it's just that some had stopped posting, some I had moved on from, and others, well no way in heck was I ever going to be able to go back to the beginning and read their entire blog - even though I obviously liked the blog enough to save it in the first place! That being said I'm still saving a few new ones, but I really don't want my favourites list to get quite as long again!Heading off on another tangent, since I like the photo album I have made of Charlie, I thought it would be nice to go through the old black and white photos I have of my family and make an album for my sister and me! Years ago when I was home in England I asked my mom if I could take the shoebox full of old photos and she said no problem. I mean, who was ever going to look at them stuffed in a shoebox right? Well my other sister (who lives in Denmark) heard me ask for them and then threw a strop about how \"she had always wanted those pictures too\" and she was going to take them. I called BS, knowing full well that she only wanted them because I had asked for them. I guess even at that age I was smart enough - or just knew this sister well enough - to keep my mouth shut and see if she \"wanted them so badly\" that she would remember to take them back to Denmark with her. She didn't of course so I took them and made up several family albums - which pleased my mom and dad no end when they came out here one Christmas. It's been kinda nice selecting and editing (as far as possible) photos of when my parents were young, and now that I've gotten them as sorted as they will ever be, I reckon another hour or so and I can create the old family album as a keepsake. It's odd too that just an hour ago, the daughter of my \"English\" sister contacted me asking if I had any old photos of her mom and dad as it's their 50th wedding anniversary next month and she wants to make them an album. I had just the one wedding photo and none of my BIL as a child, of course, but she's going to have a rummage in their loft when they fly off to Dublin next week for their anniversary trip! Wise minds think alike, I guess!Jen's job at the daycare came to an end (she was doing a maternity leave replacement) and she has now gotten a part-time office job with the small company that has been servicing my heating system for the past 32 years. I like this company very much as I find them very professional, and apparently when they found out she was married to Jordan they asked him to come in and speak to them as they would like to employ him. They've \"known\" him since he was born, in the sense that they've been coming to the house that long and he would always have his nose into what they were doing with the boiler. It would be good money - better than he's making now in fact - but he said he really doesn't want to go back to servicing boilers and would rather be doing real plumbing work. He's also making more money than before so they can apparently still make it financially - even with Jen going part-time - and now Jen gets to spend more time with Charlie and they're both happy!I took my books back to the library-with-the-beautiful view last week and I have to say I really love that place - not just the library but the whole old town. It's very small but the tower and walls are medieval and have such a great atmosphere. In fact, when you drive out of there you drive through an archway in the town walls that are just about wide enough to get your car through! It's a lovely part of town!My house is in the distance,at the foot of those mountains!And finally, I had another plumbing company come by last Tuesday to give me a quote for my bathrooms, and at the same time Benoit, the mason, stopped in to check whether it would be possible for me to have a wood-burning fire insert installed into my fireplace. It seems that it should be an easy job for him to take out a few of the tiles in order to give extra height for them to install the insert so things are looking good (finally) on that score. When we were down in my basement checking where the fresh air inlet was for the fireplace, he noticed Jordan's old drum set in the corner and asked if \"Max\" would be willing to sell it to him for his son. Somehow my kids had been invited over to Benoit's place for a BBQ a few years ago and he had got it into his head that \"Max\" was my son. I told him I would check with Jordan, who said to just give it to him. So Benoit is delighted, I'm going to get the masonry work done for free and I should be able to heat my home this winter once all is said and done, power cut or no power cut! It's been like pulling teeth trying to coordinate masons/plumbers/tilers/fireplace installers, but seems it might just be true - maybe the tortoise does get there in the end!"},
{"title": "Is it just me or is the world going crazy?", "date": "Sunday 13 November 2022", "text": "I've been offline again for a few days as I have a lot going on here at the moment and felt I needed a bit of a break again, so apologies for not commenting much on your blogs. But is it just me or does the world seem to be going (even more) crazy right now? I mean just recently 150+ poor young people out celebrating Halloween in Korea were crushed to death and then the same day a suspension bridge in India collapsed, again while people were celebrating and around the same number of people were killed over there - and that's not to mention all those who were injured!Then you've got all those eejits protesting \"stop oil\" and bringing London's roads to a standstill (thereby preventing essential services from getting through in some cases) or throwing tomato soup at priceless paintings and then glueing their hands to the floor!!!! Or how about the idiot that threw eggs at King Charles \"in the name of climate change\" and then started a Go-Fund-Me because he is facing a fine of £5,000 plus legal fees and potentially six months in prison (he won't go to prison). But when the Go-Fund-Me people found out what it was for they cancelled it. Tee hee, he might need to get a job stacking shelves somewhere I reckon. But seriously, the guy must have a peanut where his brain should be - I mean, have you seen the price of eggs? Conversely, it was quite satisfying to read about another bunch of eejits in Germany who glued their hands to the floor of a car museum adjoining a Volkswagen dealership and what did the Germans do? They turned the lights and the heating off and went home! They did have a security guard doing the rounds though, but it was quite comical to see the protesters complaining that they weren't brought food and water and were not even given a bucket to piss in! Hats off to that Volkswagen dealership, is all I can say. Karma at its finest!And then we had dear old Trevor Noah sticking his tuppence worth in in a sneering monologue saying how the Brits didn't want Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister \"because of the colour of his skin\"! Damn, since when did everything have to be about skin colour Trevor? He based his comments on the fact that one man (who actually turned out to be of Indian origin himself) had called in to a radio show to complain about Sunak. Well things blew up and Noah was, I hope, left in no doubt what most Brits think of him. Actually, I'm pretty sure the people complaining about Sunak weren't overly fond of having a second unelected Prime Minister foisted on them in six weeks and might just have wanted the opportunity to vote in a General Election (not that I'm sure the results would be any better but who knows)! While there are undoubtedly racists in the UK just like everywhere else, dammit we have a Christian King, a Hindu Prime Minister, a Jewish Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Justice, a Buddhist Home Secretary and a Muslim Mayor of London. The only prerequisite for any of those offices would be that they have to be British, but then I guess that makes us all xenophobes, right Trev? I hear Noah was funny once but since he's leaving The Daily Show (did he jump or was he pushed?) to go back to comedy, maybe if he practices real hard he could be funny a second time too! Just sayin'!A few photographs - if anyone cares!KingPrime MinisterDeputy PMHome OfficeInternational Trade - and one to watch, I think/hope!Until recently - HealthFinances - until October 2022Mayor of LondonFormer PM andChief Buffoon!Don't people have enough to worry about without this kind of shit-stirring? On a positive note, I was pleased to see that Heinz and Morrisons (a UK supermarket) - along the lines of the organization Grateful Together - have started a scheme, at least during the school holidays, where anyone can go into a Morrisons cafeteria and \"ask for Henry\" and they will be offered a warm drink and food free of charge, no questions asked! I just hope Morrisons are smart enough not to post someone whose actual name is Henry in the cafeteria for the duration of the scheme. Poor bugger, he would probably be driven nuts!On a different note, the other night I happened to notice that the film Still Alice was playing on Netflix. I read the book some time ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, and I have to say that the film almost lived up to the book - which is rare! It's the story of a successful academic (wonderfully played by the lovely Julianne Moore) who learns that she has early onset dementia at the age of 50 and how it affects her and her family's lives! It was very thought-provoking actually because I suppose we all think we've got plenty of time left but in the end none of us actually knows that. I mean, tomorrow is promised to no-one is it! And then I spotted that series five of The Crown has started playing so watched a couple of episodes. I loved the first four series, not so much for the drama but more because so many of the names I heard growing up as a kid I was now able to slot into their places in history. For instance, it was how I learned that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson actually stepped down because he had dementia! As to the latest series, well I'm having a hard time deciding who is more wooden (while aiming for \"stoic\", I suppose) - Imelda Staunton (so far) as the Queen or Jonny Lee Miller as John Major! That being said, Elizabeth Debicki as Diana does a good job and absolutely nails her voice, which is all the more commendable since she is Australian. Diana was tall but Elizabeth is even taller - 1.9m or 6 ft 2!!! - so I'm guessing many of the male actors weren't too keen to stand next to her when she is wearing heels! There's been a lot of talk about how much of it is fictitious and how they should just drop it (they do put a disclaimer at the beginning), but then if some of the people featured don't like being portrayed badly in parts, maybe they should have behaved better in the first place!And finally, tomorrow should be another \"interesting\" day, money-wise. Heck I just paid €1,800 for 1,000 litres of fuel, €600 to have new tyres put on my car (and it has to go back in next week for new brakes) and then yesterday, as I was about to go out, my bloody car wouldn't start. Flat battery (so I thought) but looking under the hood it would seem that a flippin' family of fouine (that's weasels in English but I'm more inclined to think it's field mice, having found two dead ones by my front door) have made a cosy home for themselves in the engine and dined out on a few hoses in there. So I'll have to call my breakdown service first thing and take it from there! I read online that rodents don't like the smell of peppermint, so as I was fiddling about under the hood I dropped peppermint oil everywhere I could think of and then sprayed the whole thing down with peppermint infused water - just as my neighbour came out to find out what was going on and who probably now thinks I'm officially mad! I wish I'd told him it was Chanel No. 5! We'll see what happens tomorrow, I guess!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Saturday 29 October 2022", "text": "I don't know about you but I'm finding the times we're living in very strange and unsettled right now! I mean, in the UK Liz Truss lasted 45 days as Prime Minister before being ousted and Rishi Sunak installed in her place. Anyone taking bets on how long he'll last? Not very long (is my humble, uneducated opinion). I've seen a few comments that the UK might be headed for a general election before Christmas but who knows. I don't think there's much appetite for the Labour Party either so who can guess how well the new Reform Party might do in the current situation. One thing's for sure, with Sunak and his wife jointly being worth around one billion pounds I'm not sure how \"in tune\" he's going to be with ordinary people. Heck he was previously Chancellor (Finances) under Boris Johnson and I remember him taking a phone-in call from a woman asking how she was supposed to cope in the current financial situation with two children. This dunderhead said something about \"understanding\" how she felt as he had two children himself - yeah, and a billion pounds in the bank! What's more, it's pretty interesting to note that he also has (had? until recently?) a US green card and his wife is (was?) registered as fiscally resident in India for tax purposes. Makes you wonder how much he'll really have his finger on the pulse of the nation right?Talking of politics, I haven't been paying attention to the US mid-terms (we've got enough crap of our own going on over here), but I did happen to catch a few minutes of the John Fetterman/Dr. Oz debate in Pennsylvania the other night and it was painful! I've never liked Dr. Oz - found him too smarmy - but I know nothing of either his or John Fetterman's politics. What was so excruciating though was watching Fetterman (who is recovering from a stroke) struggling to even sound coherent! And again, I know he's recovering from a stroke but I'm just wondering if it would even have been possible to forego this debate under the circumstances? I suppose given that the result of the PA race could end up being pretty decisive in the Senate, maybe not, but uuggghhh, that was a train wreck debate to watch!On Tuesday I drove in to Geneva for my bi-annual mammogram - that's always a pleasure isn't it ladies!!! Actually the exam doesn't bother me at all whereas the parking situation at the clinic is such a pain! It was the clinic where Jordan was born 30 years ago and since then they've expanded it to about twice the size - but did nothing about the parking lot. So you go round and round looking for a parking space and if you do spot one you end up with about two inches either side of your car to get out! I actually had to scoot over to the passenger side and squeeze out there - I would have been so pissed off if I'd had to climb back in through the trunk! I was thinking that next time I'll park at the border and just walk but that would easily be a 45-60 minute walk. We'll have to see, next time, I guess. As I say, the actual exam doesn't bother me but I always have this warped-mind thing going on praying that the fire alarm doesn't go off just when you've got your boob jammed in the waffle-maker! Or, as I said to my sister years ago, you're securely locked in that thing but relieved when the guy with the white coat walks in - and then pulls over a ladder and starts painting the walls! Yeah, I'm weird like that! Anyway, I had another scan after that and got the results straight away (no problem) so that was good. After that I decided to head straight back out to the lake at Passy to take advantage of the glorious weather so the day wasn't a total loss! I received the bill (475 Swiss francs, thank you very much) two days ago so thought I'd take a few minutes this afternoon to submit it to my insurance company via phone app. About 10 minutes after I'd sent it I realized I'd forgotten to include the prescription so clicked back on the app to edit my claim and would you believe it, it had already been settled! Now that's service!I called my ex-MIL on 19 October for her birthday and chatted with her for about an hour! I mentioned previously that when my former BIL woke up to find his girlfriend dead in bed next to him, he ended up moving back in with MIL. I knew it would be a disaster and frankly didn't think she should be dealing with him at almost 90 years of age, but my ex-SIL wouldn't take him, nor would my ex-husband - which is funny because years ago he talked about \"bringing M over to France to 'straighten him out'\"! Ha, what a joke - even moreso since the French would never have given him a resident's permit and I would have filed for divorce on the spot. Heck if I thought my husband was bad, this BIL is 10 times worse! Anyway, he was being harrassed from Alabama by his gf's oldest daughter about something - keys to the abandoned rental property and car in Pittsburgh I think. BIL still had the keys and wanted to hand them over to a lawyer but he was getting threatening messages and phone calls from the daughter saying she was going to have someone come over to \"sort him out\"! Hell, who needs that at 89? So in the end my MIL and BIL went to the local police to file a restraining order. MIL said the cop was really good, picked up the phone and called the daughter in Alabama and told her to have her attorney contact him (the cop) and he would personally hand over the keys to him. Daughter said she would do that within the week - and sure enough six months later they've never heard from her! Yeah, these are the kinds of people my brother-in-law brings into your life! Anyway, BIL can't drive and ended up moving nearer to town (and the local bars) into an unheated, no-AC room with some guy to the tune of $650/month in rent. I told my MIL I hadn't lived in the States for many years but that sounded hellish expensive to me and she agreed - it is! So at least she's got him out of the house but is now left with all his crap in her basement and my ex-husband is bringing stuff over and dumping it in her garage too! Say what? He's got his own house and garage but he's junking up hers now too! I laughed and told her I'd still got quite a bit of his crap from when I had to empty his rental in 2015 so I guess he's just \"spreadin' the joy\"!I had the bright idea of making an online photo album of Charlie for Jen for Christmas (they print it and send it to you as a hardback album) so set to and got that done a couple of nights ago. Then I thought Ammy (ex-MIL) would like one too as she's never met Charlie so I ordered a few copies - and then thought \"don't be a jerk\" and ordered one for my ex-husband too. He's only met Charlie once so even though I was initially not going to get him one I thought that would be mean. They should be here by Tuesday so I'm hoping they'll turn out nice. Then I thought that would be a great way to sort through all my old family photos so as soon as I get myself organized I'm going to try to compile a couple and make a copy for my sister too. It'd be one way of sorting through the photo clutter since I know I would never look at them if they are just online! Genius!On Thursday my card club had a group lunch (there were 24 of us) before playing cards and it was really nice! I looked round and thought how a comedian could eaves-drop on this lot and it would be comedic gold - not making fun of them, but because they were such a hoot! Oh the average age, seriously, would appear to be nearing 80 but it was so interesting to listen to them talking about this area and where the best hikes were and so on. The bodies might no longer be so willing but their minds sure were with it and I had a really nice time!After that I went into La Roche and joined the library-with-the-beautiful-view. It's located right next to a medieval tower in the old town and as I was walking up there I was thinking to myself how I would love to live around there. But then again it would be all hills, old buildings and steps, so while it looks beautiful it wouldn't be practical as time marches on!Tour des Comtes de GenèveJen's job at the daycare comes to an end on Monday. She knew it was only temporary as it was to cover a maternity leave, so she'll be looking for work next week. I think she's leaning towards having her nursing degree recognized in Switzerland - which will take six months - so in the meantime she'll take anything. They're recruiting at the supermarket about 300 yards away from their place so that looks like it could be a good option (and for the same money as at the daycare)! Jordan is working on a new hotel going up at the ski resort of Flaine which has to be delivered by December 2023. He gets along with the young foreman, who stops by in the compay van and picks him up every day, so if both of them could get away with having no commuting expenses for a few months it would be something to factor into their budget - a definite plus right now!Flaine ski resort. I think it's ugly - a purpose-built resort with no character but hey, he's not there to ski!I had Charlie again on Friday and while he was coughing a bit he was a hoot, if an exhausting \"hoot\"! I took him out for 90 minutes and then we read and played at home for the rest of the day. I had grabbed their big Halloween spider who then went on to \"steal\" Charlie's doodoo (the nasty piece of rag he carries with him everywhere - a bit like Linus' security blanket). Anyway spider wanted the doodoo so Charlie and I were playing hide and seek when Jen walked in. She was laughing and I told her we'd had a great day but he had worn me out! She looked at me and asked if it really was that way round - just who was exhausting who (or \"whom\", if you're posh)! She might have a point!Linus!And finally, I see Elon Musk has bought Twitter and Facebook/Meta has lost $677 billion so far this year! It's all go isn't it!"},
{"title": "What do PayPal and Andy M have in common?", "date": "Monday 17 October 2022", "text": "I'm sure everyone has heard by now about PayPal's recent own goal - a bit like Andy M. from Halifax Bank who I wrote about recently (Andy scores an own goal - apparently he was indeed fired)! If you haven't heard, about 10 days ago PayPal apparently issued revised terms and conditions which now included a clause whereby they could fine you $2,500 for \"promoting misinformation\". The main problem, however, was that PayPal couldn't or wouldn't define \"misinformation\" - it was going to be left up to them to decide! I don't have a PayPal account. I started to set one up years ago because I thought I might need it one day, but when they asked for my bank details I cancelled the set-up. What struck me though was if PayPal is seemingly just a means of making purchases and payments, what kind of \"misinformation\" are they expecting to have access to? Anyway, the reaction was almost instantaneous, people were in uproar, and started closing their accounts at such a speed that PayPal must have wondered what hit them!!! In the space of less than a week PayPal lost over $6 billion - and is still dropping like a lead balloon! Panic-stricken, PayPal then started backpedaling as fast as their little legs would allow them and issued a statement to the effect that inserting that clause had \"been an accident\" (yeah right, - I wonder if they will now pay all their customers $2,500 for their own \"misinformation\" then). But from what I saw on social media, even though they issued the retraction, people were still closing their accounts because they were so outraged! The latest I saw was that PayPal are now offering people $15 not to close their accounts (as opposed to robbing them of $2,500???) but people are continuing to close their accounts. I wonder which bright spark thought up that marketing strategy - and if he might now be looking for another job - just like Andy!The guy came the other day to look into the possibility of installing an insert into my fireplace. I wasn't very hopeful because two other companies had already told me my chimney wasn't wide enough to install a wood-burner and I won't be demolishing my fireplace/chimney to install anything. But this young man was actually hopeful that their smallest insert might work. And would you believe it, it was short 1cm needed vertically to accommodate it!!! Bugger!!! But then I had the bright idea of suggesting we take some of the tiles out from the base of the fireplace and maybe that might help - and he thinks it might! So I have a call in to the mason and hopefully he can come over soon and we can work something out. And all this because open fireplaces are no longer legal in France! Mind you, if we get power cuts I'll be using my fireplace regardless! While he was here the doorbell rang and it was two Jehovah's Witnesses, who I always make short work of by telling them up front that I'm not interested. At least they respect that but I have to admit it was one of the few positives of the pandemic that we didn't get the door-to-door JWs for two years! Then the doorbell went again and it was a young man from a real estate agency asking if I knew of anyone who might be selling locally. Good luck with that round here, because there is way more demand than supply! But as he was about to leave he asked me if I was Jordan's mom and when I said yes, he told me that he was Johann T and he and Jordan had played rugby together many moons ago! While I remember the young lad I obviously didn't recognize him because it was almost 20 years later and he was almost completely bald! I guess even though it's entirely normal, I'm still shocked to see young men losing their hair, probably because no men in either my or my ex's family lost their hair. Heck, I'm 64 and haven't got a grey hair in my head either (dad lived to 85 and no grey), so again, I have to admit I was shocked to see such a young lad almost bald. Not that it meant he wasn't a good-looking young man of course, but I guess my kids will eventually be happy to have the genes that they got!On a completely different tack, I went to my Thursday afternoon card club last week and when I saw the organizer, Janine, I apologized for not coming the previous week saying that as Charlie's daycare was closed I had to take care of him. She said not to worry as people just turned up as and when they could. I ended up playing with her and another, older gent called Marcel who had also been absent the previous week because he'd had to go for a fitting for his false teeth! I started laughing and told him we'd got all stages of life covered with our absences then, me with the daycare problems and him with his false teeth fittings! And that brought to mind a story told to me by a friend many years ago. She had a relative who got her first job working in an old people's home. One of her first tasks was to make sure all their false teeth were cleaned and sterilised so she went round and collected them all up without taking the time to label each set! She said they spent hours trying to reunite 20+ pairs of false teeth with their owners - a mistake she never made twice!Janine (the lady responsible for the card club) has one of those unfortunate faces that make it look like she's always scowling (rudely called a \"resting bitch face\", I guess). She has always been pleasant to me so I know that's not the real her - I guess her wrinkles just settled into a scowl over time. Anyway, I'm slowly starting to pick up the game of Tarot again. Oh I still have tons to learn but I'm not quite the absolute beginner I was a couple of weeks ago. Nearing 6 o'clock we'd come to the last game of the afternoon and as I'd been dealt a pretty good hand I thought \"what the hell\" and decided to take up the challenge to play against the other two (Janine and Marcel) together. I played cautiously at first but as the game went on I have to admit I was playing a blinder. Well that was until they came to their final card and Janine looked at me and said \"how come you've still got six cards left\"????? Ha, when you take up the attacking challenge you get handed what they call le chien, which is six cards which now belong to you sight-unseen, and against which you have to throw six of your own cards away. Trouble is, I'd obviously forgotten to throw six cards away so it's no wonder I was playing such a blinder. Well Janine and Marcel starting giggling, him with a whistle through the gap in his mouth where his false teeth will shortly be fitted, and Janine - well she was laughing so hard she was crying! Even later as we were putting tables and chairs away, every time she looked at me she burst out laughing. So I guess a \"resting bitch face\" is a good reason not to judge a book by its cover!Talking of teeth, I went to the dentist the other day and while I never need any work I explained to her that I was having a hard time flossing around the bridge that I have in my lower teeth so she suggested I buy a waterjet flosser - which I duly went out and did. There are basically only two buttons - one to select the mode (slow, pulse, steady) and then the on/off button. As a flosser it would appear to work very well except I wish I could get it through my head that I need to put the damn thing in my mouth before turning it on! Still, the windows now won't need cleaning for quite some time, I guess!I spoke to Jordan the other day and he told me he'd finally heard back from the temp agency in Switzerland - who had a ton of work for him but couldn't offer him any because \"he's not European\"! I thought that might happen actually, so I told him to ask the guy which continent he thought Britain was located on, but nah, he'll pass! He said the guy was really nice but since the right to work agreement had been signed between Switzerland and the European Union, Jordan no longer qualifies through his British passport! He wasn't too bothered actually though because in March they will have been married four years and after four years of marriage he can get French citizenship automatically! Jen seemed to think that their time in a registered civil partnership also counted (I'm not sure about that), but he was saying that he has all the required documents already from when we had to apply for our residents' permits! In any case, he's pretty happy where he is in France at the moment as the latest young boss is much nicer.  He's earning more money than when he worked with Max, and doesn't mind missing out on the commute from hell into Geneva over the winter. So we'll see. He's reassured that the guy told him they had tons of work though and to get back to him as soon as he gets his citizenship!And finally, when I was looking after Charlie again on Friday he was a bit off colour after having one of his shots. Jen asked me to try to keep him awake as long as possible after his lunch so when he began to wilt I decided to go all ninja and build him a \"den\" (consisting of two chairs and a large blanket). It was a great success - so much so that I'd give you the specifications for the design but I'm thinking I might try to patent it! Once we'd played hide and seek for a while, I took two cushions off the sofa, put them inside the den - and we were both lying in there pretending to snore when his dad walked in! He'd taken a few hours off to do some running around but I reckon the scene that greeted him has confirmed that he thinks grandma is now officially certifiable!"},
{"title": "A mishmash!", "date": "Wednesday 12 October 2022", "text": "They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results! So I guess on those grounds I'm probably certifiable!!! If only I could learn to pace myself I wouldn't have the \"crash and burn for a week\" followed by the blahs because I overdid it again. As I've said before, I only have myself to blame but until I get it through my thick skull that everything doesn't have to be done today, I guess I'm doomed!I was chatting to André at his place the other day and he was watching a vlog about a US family who had sold up completely in Texas and had been living on their catamaran (with their young kids) for the past few years. And he was telling me that he and his friend Matthias were thinking (more like day-dreaming) of doing the same thing - which actually made me laugh because (a) he doesn't know how to sail and (b) he gets motion sick just driving up the mountain! Buuuuuttttt, while I would push him to think long and hard about it, I would never be the one to try to talk him out of it. What right would I have anyway? I mean, I left a good-ish job and lovely boyfriend in England when I was 21 to move to Switzerland (definitely a great move). Then I resigned in 1983 to spend six months backpacking round Bali and Australia (again, another great move). The downside of that move, however, was then having to go back to work (again in Switzerland) in January 1984! Oh don't get me wrong, I was very grateful that my employer took me back but it was very hard to get back to the daily grind after all that freedom! Anyway he told me that he and Matthias were going to take sailing lessons on Lake Geneva to get their initial permits and was dumbounded when I told him I got mine in 1980. Yeah, in the five years that I lived as a single girl in Geneva I never spent even one single evening at home - I was always out! Not that I was always out partying, of course, but one of the things I did was take sailing lessons and I loved it! Oh I doubt that my permit would still be valid after all these years and I'm pretty sure I would never want to live full-time on a sail boat anyway but yep, I got the same thrill out of sailing as I did when I first took downhill skiing lessons! I'm a crap skier too, BTW, but the enthusiasm was always there!I'm just thinking that now might be the best time to prepare and look into all this but not to do it, given the crazy situation the entire world seems to find itself in right now. On the other hand, isn't it often better to have given it a shot than to live with regrets? A lady at my sewing club finally came back to club last week after four months of hospitalisation and convalescence for a brain tumour they discovered (in May, I think). Then there's my sewing teacher's son who had just gotten his own apartment at the age of 26 (I think he's 35 now) when he was dashing down the stairs, fell and landed on his head, pushing part of his skull into his brain. She managed to keep him at home until very recently but was telling me the other night at dinner that they had had to place him in a secure institution for all their safety, given his unpredictability and furious rages! Then today I bumped into my other neighbours who I hadn't seen for a while. I knew they were off to Morocco at some point so hadn't really noticed their absence, but she was telling me that they had both been really ill with covid two weeks ago and were having a hard time recuperating - and this after both having four shots! They honestly can't say where they think they got it! I wish they'd reached out to me for any help they might need because I'm at home and could have pitched in. That being said, they have two adult children locally so I guess they didn't really need me did they! So yep, it's strange times we're going through and in any case no-one knows what tomorrow may hold, so who am I to try to discourage André?I got both my water and electric bills this week and both have gone down again, so I'm pleased with that. Add to that that \"the guy\" is coming tomorrow to see if it would be possible to install a fire insert into my fireplace (fingers crossed) and then the solar panels should be fitted within the next month, it's all go again at the moment. To add to the current energy crises everyone seems to be going through at the moment, here in France we've got strikes blocking oil refineries so people are having to queue up at petrol stations - that is if they are fortunate enough to find one that has petrol! But again, we're so lucky to be just 25 minutes from Switzerland so at least we can make a trip over the border if needs be! So yep, things are tough at the moment. I was in LIDL last week and a rather handsome young man was working the cash register and I started thinking \"I really hope you're only doing this as a stop-gap to make a bit of money\" because to my mind LIDL shouldn't be his final destination. Not that I'm knocking shop-workers of course - hell I did it myself for five years while I was studying - but it is so mind-numbingly boring! As I watched him I realized I kinda expected him to be sullen because of that, but not a bit of it. He was chatty and friendly to everyone. And then I realized how many delivery drivers we have stopping round here every day - you know, Amazon, UPS, whoever. Boy do those guys work hard, but again are invariably polite and friendly, even if they probably don't feel like it!Then the other day I stopped in at the very small library in Amancy to join up, even though I already have so many of my own books to read I'll probably never get them all read in my lifetime - I just wanted to support their efforts. So out of a total of - oh, I don't know - a whopping five books in English, you can imagine how thrilled I was to pick up a copy of The Road to Little Dribbling by Bill Bryson, whose writing I love! I saw the film version of his book A Walk in the Woods and didn't like it at all, but his writing I find just lovely. So I'm thinking I will also go into town and join the much bigger library (i.e. about the size of four cupboards instead of two) to have a wander round there and sit and enjoy the view. Maybe even walk there and back a few times as I really need to buck up my walking. I've written about this library before - it has the most spectacular view from the reading room, so would be well worth joining!The view from the reading room!I was looking after Charlie again on Friday and managed to get a great video of the two of us cracking up laughing. He now says papa and mama so I'm pushing him to say nana! In actual fact I think he was trying to say banana, because that's his favourite fruit, but I'll take that as a win for me! Anyway we were both laughing away so I showed him the video of \"the little boy laughing\" and he was pressing the buttons and so on - and somehow he's buggered up the apps on my phone. I guess that'll teach me to let him get too close to my phone, right?My American friend here in France sent me a message from London the other day to say that her daughter had just given birth and included proud nana photos! Mom is American and French, and dad is Pakistani and Colombian, and since the baby was born in London he's also entitled to British citizenship. Heck he'll need a backpack to carry all those passports around with him! They had a scare a couple of days after they took him home though as the baby started \"frothing at the mouth\" (that's how she described it to me). As he was so little they called the emergency services, who were there within five minutes, and everything was fine in the end, thank goodness. But talk about \"jammy\" (as we used to say in England) - look at the view from her daughter's hospital room. Yep, the Houses of Parliament!So while life is very much up and down for most people, I have nothing to complain about and I know it! I worked outside for an hour in the garden and if there's one way to make your house feel \"too hot\" (it's definitely not), then that would be to get outside for a while. It certainly chases away those blahs!"},
{"title": "Busy, busy, busy!", "date": "Tuesday 27 September 2022", "text": "Crikey, it's a feast or a famine sometimes isn't it! One week I'm sitting here doing nothing at all and then the next week I'm running around like a \"blue-arsed fly\" (one of my dad's quaint expressions)!Monday morning as usual was my weekly yoga class, and on Monday evening the ladies from the sewing club had planned for us all to have dinner together before sewing starts up as we hadn't been able to make the end-of-year get together. You know how sometimes you go to these things but kinda wished you didn't have to - well that was me Monday evening. But I'm so glad I went as the food and service were excellent and I had a really great time! They are nice bunch, very friendly and we had a good laugh - which is something of a miracle considering what some of those ladies have been going through lately! One lady who I went walking with pre-covid lost her husband suddenly in his sleep last year at the age of 53 to a suspected heart attack. They were estranged and living apart, but were friendly enough. I met him and he was a handsome man and apparently in good health until ....! So you can imagine what a shock it was for her and her boys. As a result of his death his two sons received a small pay-out from a life insurance policy of around €40,000 each, but she started telling me what living hell she has been going through with her youngest son because of it! She was leaving for a long weekend in New York (she's there now) and her sister-in-law, who had organised everything, asked her for a small amount of money (less than €500) towards part of the payment. When she went to her bank her cash withdrawal was refused because - as she found out when she went inside - over 17,000 Swiss francs had been taken from her bank account in the last few weeks! I think she told me this was a disbursement from her Swiss pension and she hadn't looked at that account for a while, so she was more than stunned to find that the money had been taken - and more importantly that it had been taken by her younger son! It turns out that when they were clearing out his dad's house, the son had asked for her bank card to put petrol in his car, must have memorized her pin number and then stole her card at a later date! What didn't make sense though was that he had just received €40,000 from his dad, but when she mentioned that he had just met a young Romanian woman online everything clicked right into place (just like my former BIL who got milked out of every penny by a Russian woman he met online a few years ago)! Oh the Romanian and her son had definitely met up, as she discovered when she found out that he had gone to a fancy nightclub in Geneva and paid SF 1,200 for a bottle of champagne, SF 600 for a bottle of whiskey, and spent a small fortune on a night in a swanky Geneva hotel! And of course, as soon as his money evaporated so did the Romanian girl - who couldn't have seen that coming! What's worrying my friend though, is that the sale of dad's house is due to go through this week and sonny and his brother are due to inherit around €100,000 each from the sale of the land (which belonged to his dad's family) and the three of them will then also inherit from the sale of the house! She's desperate to slow down the sale until they can get his money put into something secure like a small apartment for him, but since he turned 21 last week there's not much she can do if he decides to blow through the whole lot yet again! Geez, what a nightmare - I feel so sorry for her!On Tuesday I decided it was time to start walking again now that the weather has cooled down, so took myself off to the lake at Passy to do a couple of circuits and it was lovely! At the beach end I stopped and chatted to an older lady who was sitting in a deckchair in her swimsuit debating whether to go in for a swim. I told her I was going to do another circuit and would check up on her on the second round - and yep, there she was swimming. Ha, I thought I was brave just walking so I can't imagine what it would take to actually get into that water!The lake at Passy - beautiful but freezing!Then on Wednesday night the retirees' association organised our first cocktail in over two years and again it was really nice to see some of the old familiar faces. And so many of them haven't aged at all!!! When I first joined my organization in 1980 I had an appointment with Hugo G, who explained to me all about the pension plan. He retired in 1992 at age 60, which would make him 90 now - and he hasn't changed a bit! I guess there's a lot to be said for retirement then!On Thursday I dashed around to get my grocery shopping done because I've yet again signed up for something else - a card game afternoon from 2 pm to 6 pm! I was glad I'd looked at some of the grocery flyers because I'm now on a hair-brained scheme to try out planting potatoes, garlic, onions etc. over winter in plastic laundry baskets, since I don't have enough raised beds! Anyway, LIDL were selling them for €4 so I picked up four of them, and then when I went on to my usual supermarket (LIDL doesn't sell everything I want, obviously), the very same baskets were selling for €10!!!! Anyway, I have two planted up already so I will be curious to see how (if?) they work out. Oh and isn't it lovely to see the clementines/tangerines on sale in the farmers' markets - a real sign that autumn has well and truly arrived! As I was heading home I spotted a cyclist and was trying to figure out which side of my car he was going to cycle on so gave him a wide berth just in case. After I'd passed him he caught up with me a little way along and stopped and tapped on my passenger-side window. Now I'm ready to read him the riot act about how I'd left him plenty of room, when he leaned in through the window with a big grin and said \"hi Anna\"! Turns out it was Stan's son, Sam - you know, the young man who competed in this year's winter Olympics! He'd recognized my car so boy, am I glad I didn't run my mouth off!Later that afternoon I made my way to the new-to-me card game club because I've always wanted to get back into playing belote and tarot (I haven't played in 40 years). There were about 20 people there and I would guess the average age was around 80, so I felt like a spring chick when someone called me a \"young 'un\"! They were a nice crowd and I've always liked older people anyway, so age wasn't a problem for me. The old guy I was sitting next to playing tarot shouted at me quite early on for playing the wrong card, but then I realized he was a bit shouty with everyone so I explained to him that I was trying to pick the game back up after so many years and could he help me? After that he was as nice as pie! Turns out it was his birthday and he had brought in wine and cake for their break, but I have to admit I got quite a shock when they all stood up to go over to the drinks table and saw how many of them couldn't stand up straight! We called it dowager's hump in my day and I think it can be caused by osteoporosis (and many other things, most likely), but it made me realize just how difficult life can be for those that are afflicted by it! So with that in mind I also stopped off at the gym for my first weight session in about six months! It was a bit namby-pamby but I guess you have to start somewhere, don't you!My kids told me that one of my ex-husband's cousins and her husband were in Paris for her 60th birthday and were coming down to Haute Savoie for the week-end to meet up and would I like to get together with them? Well of course I would. I didn't know Pam particularly well but I always liked her. She was what I would consider somewhat reserved so it was a surprise to meet her outgoing, uber-friendly husband, John! He was originally from Brazil but had spent most of his life in the U.S., so I guess the Brazilian blood explains some of his party-animal side! On Saturday night the kids invited us all over for raclette to celebrate my birthday (64 - yikes) and I liked Pam and John instantly. Then on Sunday morning we went to the farmers' market in Annecy - which was still beautiful despite the drizzly weather (they loved it), and then off up the mountains to the lake at Les Confins (again, they were enthralled by the cowbells), and then a quick walk around La Clusaz before heading back to Jordan and Jen's for pizza. Charlie was on fine form and they both obviously like kids so he got to enjoy showing off for everyone. They left back for Paris on Monday morning, where John has booked dinner and a show at the Moulin Rouge for Pam's 60th birthday tomorrow! They were so taken with France (and Haute Savoie in particular) that I feel sure we'll be seeing more of them (and with pleasure - they were great fun)!Pam and John in Annecy!And finally, I've mentioned before that I follow a blog about narcissism - less so now than before, but I still sometimes check to see what's going on there. Anyway, one of the ladies wrote how, at 64 and after 42 years of marriage, her husband had left her for a \"bright young thang\" and that while she initially had a hard time recovering from the shock, she was beginning to rebuild a life for herself. This is what she wrote that tickled me no end as it's so evocative!\"But in an attempt to work around those limitations I recently joined a gospel choir. And by gospel choir I mean eight elderly white people singing rather dull 1970s middle-of-the-road pop songs slightly off-key in a damp Welsh church, led by a pianist with delusional aspirations towards Britain's Got Talent, who makes his endless disappointment in us very evident 🤣 It's good fun though, and I'm making new friends there.\"And the Brits on that site all chimed in \"Vicar of Dibley\"! How very true to form we are!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 18 September 2022", "text": "It looks like autumn is well and truly on it's way. The weather is still gorgeous but considerably cooler and nippy in the mornings, so much so that I decided to put a duvet back on my bed today when I changed the sheets, rather than sleeping with just a sheet. And you know what, I welcome it! I find summer so draining that spring and autumn are definite favourites. Even winter is doable (just as well really right?) - anything rather than that dreadful heat! Blogger Sam in Minnesota mentioned the other day that she was going to try to refrain from putting her heating on until November!!! A fine aim indeed and one that it would be nice to replicate over here, but in all honesty I don't really see being able to hang on that long but hey, why not give it a shot!Talking of heating the house, when I was dropping garden cuttings off at the recycling centre the other day I noticed that there was a fireplace/wood burning stove place right next door to it that I'd never noticed before. Now if you remember I'd been to two places about getting a wood burner inserted into my fireplace since open fireplaces are now illegal here. To be honest I've only used the fireplace once in 12 years anyway (when we had a power cut), but I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to look into it just in case. On both occasions they told me they were unable to help me, something to do with the width of the opening at the top of my chimney, so I just dropped the idea since, as I say, I don't really use the thing. But on the off chance, I dropped into this new place the other day, explained my problem and she said \"well why don't you just get an insert rather than a stove\"? and I was flabbergasted. If it's really that easy (and that's a big \"if\"), why didn't the other people mention this to me? I guess I shouldn't count my chickens until they're hatched but they are sending someone out to take a look mid-October so fingers crossed it'll work out this time! I thought my friend was smart when she had her wood-burner installed in that it is purely a wood-burner and not electric powered because, as my other neighbour was saying, if we get long power cuts her own wood burner will be down because it also uses electricity. In the event of a long power cut I would use my fireplace anyway (and to hell with the law, but don't tell anyone)! So we'll see what they have to say, but if I can get that done it'll be another positive in my book!On the entertainment side of things, I finally got round to watching The Dallas Buyers' Club the other day and boy was it good. I don't know why I never bothered watching it when it first came out, but I have to say Matthew McConaughey was excellent (as was Jared Leto), but it's stunning what he (they?) did to their bodies in order to be able to play HIV/AIDS-infected patients! I've never seen him in anything else so it was a pleasure to realize that he's not just a pretty face! I also finished reading a book by Joanne Harris called Blackberry Wine and enjoyed that too, so I guess I'm on a roll at the moment. I like Joanne Harris' books (Chocolat probably being her most famous), which tend to be set in a fictitious town in France and always include some kind of magic or spells - they are an unusual read!I don't know what was going on the other day but while I was sitting reading a helicopter was flying overhead constantly for about 30 minutes non-stop. I don't think it was search and rescue because (I believe) their helictopters are red, but who knows!You might just be able to make it out(badly circled in blue) just above the white house!And remember I was saying in a recent post how I was trying to stop wasting so much time on social media, well I don't know what happened in the last week but I am getting absolutely bombarded on FB with \"suggestions for you\", it's really weird. Things like a post by Radio Humberside, something about an obscure football club somewhere, a vintage car club ... you name it, it's being suggested as something I might like. I was so p....d off that I managed to bash out a message to FB asking what the heck was going on. Oh I doubt they'll do anything about it, but after deleting 20 such consecutive \"suggestions\" in a row (and still counting) I decided that as soon as I saw a \"suggestions for you\" post I would log out of FB - and viola (as they don't say over here), I don't waste nearly as much time on FB anymore, so thank you FB!Yoga started back up last Monday and while I never actually want to make the effort to go I positively floated out of there after an 8-10 week break, so much so that I drove straight to the gym where I was enrolled pre-covid and have paid back up for a year's membership! Now I just have to start motivating myself to go again, but I'm sure it'll pick back up once I get in the swing of things! Then the other day I got a phone call from the company my friend and I did quite a few trips with pre-covid saying that they had had two cancellations for their upcoming trip to Corsica and would we like to sign up? Damn, my friend will still be away in Spain over those dates so I guess we'll have to give it a miss this time around. But it did get me to thinking I might wait until Christmas and book a \"solos\" trip somewhere for around March/April, depending on the situation then. I'm thinking maybe South Africa or Mexico but who knows where (and even if) I'll end up. Still, it's nice to be thinking about travelling again after so long! I don't enjoy travelling on my own, but am perfectly fine travelling with a group of people I don't know. My friend, however, loves to travel on her own and has been posting pictures of her trip to the South of France recently and it looks beautiful. She is also a very talented, creative person and posted a picture of some painting on silk that she had just done! I'm green with envy at her talent!Isn't she talented!And talking of talent, the community association of Amancy (where our sewing club is) had their open day on Saturday morning to showcase the various classes/clubs that are available. As president of the sewing club I set up our stand and some of the ladies brought in their creations so that we could display them as a backdrop. To be honest the Mairie had really done a poor job advertising this event so there was very little attendance - but at least for our sewing club that wasn't such a problem as we are pretty much full anyway (lack of space). We just felt we needed to show up in support of the Mairie which makes the premises available to us free of charge and gives us a small sum towards running the club!We got one or two potential new members but I ended up enrolling in a Thursday afternoon \"leisure time\" club where the 20-30 members play card games, principally belote or tarot, so yay me! I played both these games in my mid-twenties when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we and friends of his would sometimes pull an all-nighter in order to finish a game. In fact it was in order to get back into these card games that I first went to the gaming evening in town about five years ago. The problem was though that they were already pretty well-established groups, so that was how my neighbour and I decided to set up our own board game evenings - which have surprised me by the fact that we are still going and that we have more people asking to join! In fact we had our lastest board game evening at Valérie's house just this Saturday. She lives at 1,200 metres (almost 4,000 feet) and it was cold up there Saturday night - but it is such a beautiful spot. We played one game which I thought was going to be a bit naff but ended up being a real hit with everyone so you never know what you're going to get. Next time will be at Jordan and Jen's place (so they can put Charlie to bed) and we've all been asked to dress up for Hallowe'en!Valérie sent round a message beforehand asking if anyone was interested in buying half a lamb as her neighbours are small-holders and were selling organic lamb raised in the pasture behind them. I was the only one interested but in the end it was just too much meat (and too little freezer space). Valérie already had extra lamb in her freezer so she sold me the most beautiful leg of lamb from her own order which I cooked today. It was hellish expensive but good quality, and in any case I'm happy to support local producers as and when I can. There's way too much meat on that leg for me but I was thinking I'll make a rogan josh (lamb curry) to take over to the kids when I keep Charlie on Friday and put any leftovers in the freezer!When I signed up to get solar panels, I was told that they were hoping to install them sometime in October so I thought I would request a transfer of the balance I will owe from my credit union in order to have it ready as and when. I have to say I was pretty surprised, though, when I got an automated form to fill in to indicate what I wanted this money for!!! What the flip???? My first reaction was to tell them to mind their own business but soon thought the better of that - but how long has this been going on? When I was still working and paying off my mortgage, once a year I would request 33,000 Swiss francs in order to put down extra on my mortgage and they never asked what that money was for. But now I request SF8,400 and I'm supposed to tell them what it's for??? Geez Louise, you'd think it was their money! Oh I got the money within 24 hours but really???And finally, the Queen's funeral is tomorrow, which frankly is a good thing in my opinion as it's time to move on. Heads of State have been arriving from all over the world so I can't even begin to imagine what security will be like tomorrow. There's been an outpouring from the majority of the British public, mainly I think out of respect for how devoted to duty and stoic she was. As for Charles, well, we'll see - to my mind the jury's out on that one as yet. But - and this is a big \"but\" - not everyone has felt that way about the Queen's death or indeed about the monarchy in general and that is absolutely their prerogative. They have every right to their opinions of course, but one lady - a fish and chip shop owner in Scotland - took it a step further and posted a celebratory video of herself with champagne basically crowing that the Queen had finally died. Again, as I say, she has every right to her opinion - free country and all that - but given that many of the locals did not agree with the way she behaved and that the woman had to be escorted from her premises for her own safety, I have to say I'm wondering where exactly was her brain when she embarked on her new business model. As one bright spark commented - \"she'll never sell another chip again, I reckon\"!"},
{"title": "Been offline again!", "date": "Saturday 10 September 2022", "text": "I took a few days away from the computer again last week so I apologize for my lack of comments on your blogs recently. Yet again I realize I'm spending way too much time online and while for the most part I don't have anywhere to be, I'm aware what a time suck it is. Heck, I unplugged the television in January and haven't plugged it back in since so I obviously haven't missed that, and while I don't want to get off social media/reading online news permanently, I really want to cut it right back, so apologies again for my lack of commenting!After deciding I was going to \"go offline\", the other day I ordered some seeds that I wanted from a well-known gardening catalogue here in France and then added to my basket a small greenhouse for either the balcony or my upstairs bedroom (yes, I might put a greenhouse up there as it's a sun trap). But then I had the bright idea of looking up the same greenhouse on other websites and bloomin' hell, the one from the seed catalogue was €50 and the exact same thing at the local DIY store was €26!!! So as you can imagine, I'm going to be doing a bit more shopping around if I decide to buy anything else like that! This was the same DIY store where I bought my generator a few months ago, and while it was already assembled, of course, the handles and wheels needed to be put on it, so I got Jordan to do that for me this weekend while he was over! So I'm ready to go if (when) we get any power cuts. Actually we always get power cuts anyway (a 23-hour power cut just before Jordan's wedding springs to mind), but who knows what the situation will be like this winter, so I'm glad that's sorted!Last weekend was a busy one for me so I was pretty tired this week - guess I need to pace myself better, but then you can't always choose can you. Heck if I was still married, 29th August would have been my husband's 60th birthday, 30th August was André's 35th birthday, and 31st August would have been my 37th wedding anniversary, so thank God I only had one event to deal with! As it was I kept Charlie on Friday as usual, but the kids had asked me if I could keep him in the evening too as they had booked dinner at a really fancy restaurant. Actually this was the caterer that did their wedding, and in order to get a reservation at his restaurant they reserved it three years ago - at the time of their wedding! I knew it was going to be a long evening! Charlie was as good as gold all day but of course he's a human dynamo too so it's always tiring. I got him down to sleep easily (it's not just me he wears out, obviously), but around midnight he started coughing and crying and I thought he was going to choke so I went in and picked him up. And that was that until mom and dad came home at 1.30 a.m. when they found him sitting on my lap wide awake reading a book! Still he wasn't difficult to put down again and I got home around 2.30 a.m., although I must admit I'm starting to get more uneasy about driving around at night, (a) because of the wild animals and (b) because the Eastern European licenced cars that always seem to \"break down\" in deserted spots and try to flag you down are back again - if they ever left! I know many of the places where these Mercedes \"break down\" so try to avoid them, but whichever way I go home from Jordan and Jen's place, I always have to go through isolated areas. The unfortunate thing is, these cars are always licenced in either Bulgaria or Romania - which does nothing to help with feelings of animosity towards perfectly innocent people from these countries, as you might imagine!Then on Saturday I had people over for André's 35th birthday. It was a lovely evening, I made way too much food, of course, and my fridge is now bursting at the seams with leftovers that I have to figure out what to do with. I bought a ton of cheese for the cheese platter and since I don't really eat cheese I think I might drive over to the kids tomorrow and drop that off at least!André with his favouritenephew!Jordan and Jen stayed overnight because the next day we had our neighbourhood clean-up, where everyone spends about an hour tidying up our little island, which is then an excuse to all get together for a knees-up! It's always good fun and particularly appreciated this year after so long being kept apart!But since I've had a few quieter days to rest, I really must get back to cleaning/decluttering this place. For some time now I've noticed a smell which I haven't been able to pin down. I've always got the windows and doors open in this weather but as soon as I closed up for the evening the smell would come back. Well I finally figured it out yesterday when I looked on the shelf just above my kitchen sink and realized the smell was coming from the two whole heads of garlic nestled up there. Thank God for that - at least it's my garage that stinks now and not the house!Oh and just because ... I spotted this picture of Annecy the other day, taken I think from the Haute Savoie Tourism website, so decided to post it because it's just pretty. Actually Annecy is so beautiful it's difficult to take a bad picture of it, but here goes anyway!Taken from the Pont des Amours(Lovers' Bridge) in Annecy!And I see Bojo used his final days in office to give the British people the benefit of his wisdom on how to make it through what are undoubtedly going to be some very difficult times financially. You see, assuming you have an old electric kettle that gets caked up with limescale, if you spend £20 on a new kettle you can knock a whopping great £10 a year off your electric bill!!! Wow, thank God he pointed that out! So with electric bills going up to potentially £7,000, using Bojo's tried and tested money-saving tip, next year's electric bill will only be £6,990! The man's a genius with his finger on the pulse of the lives of the British people - I don't know why on earth we don't keep him!On a more positive note, the new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has already said she will be introducing measures to cap energy bills (or is that just electric bills?) at £2,500 I believe, so that's a start. Whether she'll be any better than Bojo remains to be seen but at least she doesn't come over as a condescending dipshit!And finally I'm so glad that Liz Truss was able to meet the Queen in Balmoral and be officially invited to form a government - just a day or so before the Queen died! I see people using the word \"shocked\" to hear of the Queen's death but I can't help thinking there's got to be a better word than \"shocked\" to describe your feelings about the death of a 96 year old woman! I guess so many people thought she was invincible and would always be here because she always has been here, or at least as far as I'm concerned anyway. She was a class act and I think Charles will have his work cut out to follow that - although he has already promised to keep his nose out of politics, so that's a start! Apart from the many lovely tributes to her though, I thought it was nice to hear all the stories about her wonderful sense of humour. This one particularly tickled me and happened when she was out walking in the highlands near Balmoral with only her long-time security officer to accompany her. What a lovely memory for him!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Wednesday 31 August 2022", "text": "Finally the weather broke last week, and while we've had some rain and the temperatures have dropped to between 25-30°C it's still lovely out - and a real pleasure to feel some oomph coming back! I generally feel bleh in the summer so I don't know why it always takes me by surprise! I felt like I had no energy or motivation to do anything other than sit on my butt but hopefully that will change now!Mist settling over the mountains behind my house.Scenes like this always make me think of my mom'svillage in North Wales!It's nice to be sleeping better with the cooler weather, although I've noticed my feet have been \"restless\" in bed - which I put down to being on them so much. Then the other day I spotted an advert for \"detox patches\" for the feet - I guess related to reflexology - advertising patches for \"ionic foot detox and Meridian therapy\" (containing various medicinal herbs etc.), claiming they could ease tension in the feet, help you sleep better and detox the body! The write-ups on Amazon were a bit \"iffy\" but for €20 for a 100 I thought \"what the hell\" and bought them. And would you believe it, by jove I think they're working for me! Now I wouldn't know if they're \"detoxing my body\", but when I woke up the next morning the aching was gone and that restless, heavy feeling seems to be kept at bay. Now it may be a load of old codswallop but since I'm interested in this kind of thing anyway, I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot - and I'm actually pleased with the results!While I was on Amazon I also bought two 3-packs of Moston LED rechargeable lights since I reckon we're going to be in for a few power cuts this winter (we always get them), and thought I should get better prepared and not rely on the crappy flashlights in my drawer. I charged all six last night, put three in strategic places upstairs, one in the kitchen and two on the cellar steps/basement - and I'm delighted with them! I've made a note to myself to make sure I keep them charged, but what a good purchase they turned out to be!Moston LED rechargeable lights!Jordan had last week off as he wanted to do some final running around before going back to work and use the remaining few days of leave to redo their balcony. He took up the horrible wooden flooring and laid concrete tiling, redid the railings and set up a BBQ/fridge area. He did a great job of it, although I'm sure having Charlie help made it so much easier!That's not their balcony - he's justpreparing stuff there!I drove into Geneva last week to have lunch with a friend and crikey is that place all dug up! I was really glad I know Geneva well, having lived there for five years, because half the roads are blocked off and you're pretty much left to your own devices to figure out how to get around!So with my new \"zen\" energy starting to come back I've slowly been decluttering inside the house and working on the raised beds in my garden in order to prepare for any autumn planting I might want to have a go at (lofty aims I feel, but who knows)! I attacked a couple of drawers the other day and they took ages to sort because one was full of receipts that I wanted to look at and the other was full of jewellery and odds and sods that needed to be gone through. I actually found a fitbit in an unopened box which I reckon I must have bought while the last one was on its last legs and then never gave any more thought to it. (Note to self, the walking is not going that well this year so it's time to put that fitbit to good use, methinks)! I also paired up and sorted tons of junk jewellery (I think the polite word is \"costume jewellery\", but we all know what I'm talking about) and boy did I have loads of pairs of dangly earrings - which probably looked quite nice when I still had a neck, but now - not so much! So off to the charity shop they'll be going!In the garden, the damson bush has only produced about a dozen measly damsons this year, but the peach tree has gone nuts - I guess it likes the prolonged heat! The peaches aren't exactly eating quality, but are perfect for jam-making, so yesterday I cut a load up and set to making peach jam. Only problem was, I went and sat down outside to read \"for a minute\", forgot the jam and now I've got a jar of what can only be described as a solid, burnt, orange brick!In other news, I got quite a shock last week when my oldest nephew (the son of the brother in Wales who died a couple of years ago), called me to say that his younger brother was in hospital after having a stroke. Say what???? The guy is only 52, doesn't smoke, hardly drinks and has a job that keeps him physically fit! The good news is that as it was a relatively minor stroke he was only in hospital a couple of days and they think they can handle it with blood thinners, but to say it was a shock all round would be an understatement! The oldest brother went down to visit this weekend and they drove past the house where I grew up before coming to Geneva at age 21. Now I thought they were going to demolish those houses but apparently they've been done up and the estate renovated quite a bit. The junior and infants' school used to back onto our garden, so if I was ever late for school I just climbed over the fence! Well apparently the school sports fields have completely gone and been replaced by new school buildings while about 200 metres down the road (where the filthy old River Cole runs), it's been done up and looks pretty nice now! The down side is that in the article my nephew sent me they were talking about still having to fish shopping trolleys and wheely bins out of the lake! Maybe it's not just England, but I have no idea why people can't respect these places - I certainly don't see that kind of behaviour in France where I live! But to destroy and pollute something that was intended to give pleasure is just beyond me!Babbs Mill LakeAnd finally, for some years I've been following a blog dealing with narcissism. It fascinates me, having had the misfortune of working with the narcissism poster girl. I'm not on there very often now but occasionally pop in to see what's going on. Well one lady wrote about how the cheating narc she had once been married to got a job with Zambian Airlines after their divorce. He was a flight attendant but she described his uniform as \"all gold braid and chains\" and which wouldn't look out of place on a five-star general! Anyway, she and the children were living in a small mining village in Yorkshire and one time her ex came to visit the children. She described him as a man who wouldn't walk 20 metres if he could drive it, but the first night he got all dressed up in his \"military uniform\" and found a pretext to walk the mile into the village twice in the same evening! Knowing a little about \"dour\" Yorkshire people (Steve was a Yorkshireman) and having seen a few episodes of Last of the Summer Wine, the visual she described tickled me to bits!Last of the Summer Wine!"},
{"title": "That was nasty!!!!!", "date": "Sunday 21 August 2022", "text": "I've been offline again for a while because quite frankly there's not been much going on (well, not in my part of the world anyway). Oh apart from the exciting stuff like getting Jordan's US passport application sent off and his US taxes prepared (he is severely dyslexic so I'm happy to do it)! We'll see how long it takes to get his passport back and I'm not worried about being late for the IRS. He earns a pittance and at least he files, right! On Friday I kept Charlie for a few hours for him to do some running around and must have left around 5.30 p.m. - and that was when the heavens opened, the drought decided to end and the most awful storm hit out of nowhere. I'm usually quite level-headed but it was that nasty I was starting to get scared. Grey sky, sleeting grey rain, grey walls on both sides of the highway at the worst part where it was just single lane traffic. I thought briefly about stopping but then reckoned I'd get slammed by someone unable to see coming from behind, so I crawled along with my hazards on as slowly as I dared - and somehow made it out of there! But I just saw on the news that Paris, London and Spain (Menorca, I think) also got hammered, and of course where there are underground rail networks they are the first to get flooded! I haven't heard of anywhere else but I'm sure they can't have been the only places. I'm just glad I made it home all right!La Roche held it's annual Blue Grass festival a few days ago and luckily the bad weather held off for that. The musicians come from all over the world and are so talented it's incredible! I believe it was originally only meant to be a one-time thing but it was such a success that it's now held every year and is very popular!Another \"roaring success\" (depending on your point of view) would seem to be a grass roots scheme that has started up in the UK in protest at the massive increases in energy prices scheduled from October. As I understand it, energy prices were capped up until now but that cap will be increased horrendously come October - and all the while the energy companies are announcing record profits! I first heard about it from a US vlogger who described it as \"Don't Pay UK\", thinking that people were being told not to pay their bills. Turns out that's not the case at all - people are being encouraged to cancel their direct debits which allow the energy companies to debit whatever they like in the name of \"estimated bills\". One Scottish lady vlogged about a young man she worked with who had just bought his first place. The electricity company quoted him a direct debit amount of £56/month (if I remember correctly), then a few minutes later raised that to £86, then thirty minutes later to £150 and a few days later to £250/month!!! He was totally panicked so this lady told  him to cancel his direct debit and call his actual consumption in every month and pay that way. Now I have heard that the energy companies give a reduced rate for direct debits but those kinds of increases are just insane. As far as I know 108,000 people have so far followed suit and they are hoping to have a million people on board by October! Damn, what complete and utter madness! I think I read that Germany's electricity prices are going to go up by 23% and France's by just 4% (France kept it's nuclear power plants running), but to see these projected price hikes in the UK - well I think they could have a revolution on their hands soon!But as I say, not much has been happening here and I haven't been going out much because it's still too hot, so I was at home this afternoon when the most God-awful argument broke out next door! Worse than anything I have heard in the 30+ years I've lived here. Their daughter was there (I presume come for lunch with her husband and daughter) and eventually got it calmed down enough for the wife to jump in her car and disappear for a few hours. Damn, that used to be us - we were the neighbourhood \"entertainment\" for so many years. I can tell you, I don't miss that at all but I feel desperately sorry for a couple who so obviously can't stand each other but yet are seemingly trapped together!Finally, just because I spotted it this afternoon, I thought I'd post this Spike Milligan clip from years ago. It's making fun of the Irish - but then nobody does that better than the Irish themselves. I just love their sense of humour and Milligan was Anglo-Irish anyway, so no offence meant! Oddly enough years ago when I was young I didn't find him funny in the least and now, like so many things, I can see how clever he actually was. And a fitting story to remember him by - apparently he had \"see, I told you I was ill\" inscribed on his tombstone!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Saturday 6 August 2022", "text": "Well the weather finally broke just a little and we had a mild storm last night for about an hour. It brought the temperatures down slightly today but the ground was so dry I doubt it did any real good, that is unless it rains again soon - which doesn't seem to be on the cards right now!It's been so hot (38°C/100°F yesterday) that yet again I haven't felt like doing much, although on Monday I did manage to make a trip to the tip and also to drop some stuff off at the big charity shop. Since I was out that way anyway I took the back road over to Jordan and Jen's place to check in on Leni, The Horrible Cat! Their neighbours are taking care of him while they're gone but I thought I could take a book and read for an hour or so, in order to open up the place and give him some time on the balcony. In the end I spent 90 minutes there and he seemed glad to get some fresh air, although you wouldn't know it because he still treats me with complete disdain!I mentioned some time ago that I had received an email from \"the gendarmerie in Paris\" indicating that they had evidence that I'd been looking at child pornography and to call them pronto if I didn't want the matter to go any further\". Well I saw an article in Le Parisien this week where one of their reporters followed up on these scammers and was told he could \"pay an immediate fine of €7,000 if he didn't want the matter to be taken any further\". So he called them back pleading poverty and they kindly offered to let him pay an immediate amount of €3,000 (with the balance to be paid later) and gave him the bank account details where it should be paid. So they tracked down the female owner of the bank account and as a result up to 100 arrests were made! Well done that reporter! I suppose it begs the question why someone would pay anything to these bastards if they were completely innocent, but I can actually see that some people might be confused or just frightened thinking they might accidentally have landed on a site like that - I don't know really, but all I can say is that I'm glad at least some of them got caught. Now if they could just catch the slimeballs who are \"holding my parcel until I make a payment\" or the people from McAfee (whose email address reads something like xsajksdkfjasdfasdfjdj182@asdfkdfj.com) and let them know that I haven't used McAfee ever so no, my coverage isn't about to run out, I would be really grateful!In other news, I called my fuel supplier this week to order 800 litres of fuel and thought the lady was very decent when she asked if I could hang on until I needed to order at least 1,000 litres because I'd get a better rate! It's expensive either way you look at it, but I thought it was kind of her to mention that. She also told me that the price of fuel is currently going down so to keep an eye on the price at the pump and try to time my order in accordance with that! Huh, there are some nice people about aren't there!I don't know if any of you play Words With Friends but if you do, you'll probably have noticed that after every second play you have to sit through advertising blurb before you can continue. Well I noticed this week that the advertising at the moment seems to consist entirely of a sales pitch for the game Family Farm Adventure and I just realized how awful it is! In one scene a young woman runs in to show her partner her positive pregnancy test and next thing you know he's physically throwing her out of their home into the snow! Then in another scene Mr. Macho is just about to hit his partner (for whatever reason) when the dog jumps up and bites him on the arm! Damn, I hadn't noticed it before, but I can tell you I'm mad as hell to see that these game developers think that kind of crap is a good idea for a game! So guess who's going to be writing them a stinking review!!!And talking of abusive AHs, I saw a book review of My Daddy Is A Hero - the story of Chris Watts, the murderous pig who killed his pregnant wife and two very young daughters! I've only gotten to the part where they have just discovered the bodies but the book is written to ask the question \"are psychopaths made or born?\" - which is why I bought it in the first place. That is something that really interests me - but how that monster could murder his entire family because of his infatuation with a skank is beyond me - or probably beyond most of us, I suspect!In other news Jordan and Jen left Brittany today and are heading south for a few days, and André - as far as I know - is now in Slovenia and they will be making their way back to France via Bulgaria next week. It's all right for some isn't it! That being said, I'm going to check out a few of the \"solos\" holidays available between now and Christmas and see if there are any European trips I could join up with by driving to meet the group. I've got the travel itch starting up again!And finally, my friend spotted that there was a pottery market taking place this weekend up at Grand Bornand - which is about 30 minutes from here. Since we both fancied a trip out despite the heat, we headed up there yesterday morning, knowing full well we would most likely ding the bank cards pretty hard but ,,,,! Well the market was pretty small so it didn't take long to wander round but their stuff was beautiful. I spotted a large salad bowl that I fell in love with and intended to go back and buy it after lunch, but my friend trotted over there and bought it for me as an early birthday present (she'll be in Spain for the next two months)!!! Did I need it? Not in the slightest! Do I love it? Absolutely! How lucky am I?I just love this sculpture!Made out of recycling materials!"},
{"title": "Ooof!", "date": "Friday 29 July 2022", "text": "I have been offline for a few days because, well frankly not much has been happening anyway. I don't like the bleh feeling I have at the moment, but when I think about it, I always get like this in the heat of the summer, and boy have we been having a humdinger this year! I don't know for certain but I would guess it hasn't rained for about a month, and we've so far had temperatures as high as 36°C (97°F) round here, bearing in mind that most homes don't have AC! Oh a few people are putting in AC in maybe one room now, but whole house AC, nope! I haven't done it because until we hit 36° I was able to cope with it, you know, by keeping shutters shut and opening strategic windows to create an air flow, so in the end it hasn't been so bad - even if I hate the heat. And to think I was once considering retiring to Spain in order to retire earlier! Ha, the joke would have been on me wouldn't it! Today as there was \"a 90% chance of rain\" I was almost jumping for joy. And then it happened, all 15 minutes of light drizzle and we were back to where we started. Still, at least for a few days it should be down around 30° so I'll take that!As in so many countries there have been massive wildfires breaking out in France (in the Gironde they have lost over 20,000 hectares so far). They're also breaking out in other southern départements too, although in one case a volunteer fireman has been arrested for arson! What the flip!!! What kind of lunatic does that? I sure as hell don't know!Moving on, I had to laugh the other day because I've been watching a British journalist/Youtuber for some time now and I've come to realize he's a bit of a Mrs. Malaprop, not only mispronouncing words on occasion, but sometimes using a completely wrong word. I've often thought \"oh he'll cut that and rerecord it\", but nope, he just plows on - and I find it pretty great! When I actually looked up the origins of Mrs. Malaprop (Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1775 play The Rivals, apparently), I came across this quote which was attributed to Mike Tyson - although I'm not sure I'd have laughed at him!That put me in mind of an incident 20+ years ago where I worked. There was a massive negotiation taking place regarding our pension fund. I was in the thick of it - as a grunt, not as anyone important - but it did mean I got a ringside view of what was going on. Anyway, when the negotiation was finally successfully concluded, the big boss - who was Italian - called the staff to a meeting to announce the outcome. I was sitting opposite my friend when, with all the innate theatricality of an Italian, he stated that \"it was the most difficult negotiation in which I have NEVER participated\"! Of course English wasn't his first language but I looked at my friend and we both had to put our heads down to prevent from bursting out laughing!On another note, Youtube randomly suggested to me a video about the demolition of slums in the late 1950s in Birmingham, England (where I was born) in order to replace the many insalubrious homes that were either just old or had been bomb damaged during the war. I had always heard that Birmingham City Council were (and still are, apparently) very proactive and even if some of the high-rise flats were later demolished, I still remember moving out of our house in the city centre into the new \"posh place with two toilets\", even though I was only three years old when we moved. I honestly didn't recognize much (if anything) from the video but when I sent it to my sister, my BIL knew most of the places shown as he had been a young copper on foot patrol in that area for many, many years! What's weird though is that dad came from inner city Birmingham and mom came from the prettiest little village in Snowdonia National Park (North Wales) and travelling between the two as I was growing up was surreal - but then as mom said, there was no work in North Wales and you had to go where the work was!From my memory, these places look \"posh\"compared to where I was born!Moving on again, I recently received notice that I would shortly be getting the breakdown of my annual electric bill and so far my consumption is down 44%. Yay me, and yay André for moving out. Likewise, my last three water bills went from a consumption of 43 cubic metres, to 51 cubic metres - to 14 cubic metres! Again yay me and thank you André! Mind you, given how energy bills are increasing it's probably just as well that my consumption has been going down, isn't it!Then the other day I noticed that things had been kinda quiet round at my neighbours, so when I heard her out in the garden this morning I stopped round to see if they were okay. She told me that she had ended up at the emergency room because she'd taken a drink of water and hadn't noticed that there was a wasp in her glass - which promptly went on to sting her in the mouth! Since she is allergic to wasp stings, her face swelled up immediately, the only saving grace being, I guess, that it had stung her on the inside of her cheek and not at the back of her throat! She's okay now, thank goodness, but I'd say that was a close call!And finally, we had our latest board game evening on Saturday and it was again a really nice time, playing a game that for once interested me called I Know!The next day Jordan and Jen set off for three weeks in Brittany, staying with Jen's friend and then moving on to Jen's grandparents! From the pictures/videos they are sending they are having a wonderful time at the beach and it's nowhere near as hot as here! Then this Sunday André and three friends are heading for Slovenia via Switzerland by car, and will figure out a way back depending on where the almost Europe-wide farmers' protests are located (in support of the Dutch farmers) blocking the main highways! I hope they all have a good time, and hopefully with the cooler weather I can get some decluttering and maybe even some walking done too, as I'm failing miserably at that so far this year!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 13 July 2022", "text": "When I got up the other morning the internet was down (shock, horror). First thing I do when I get up is read the news with a cup of tea in my hand, so you can imagine this was seriously going to mess with my day! Oh, I could still get the internet on my phone but I really don't like reading on that so after about 15 minutes of piddling around I gave up. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how your day suddenly becomes about four hours longer! I think I'm pretty aware how much time I waste on the computer but even so, the fact that I went out and got a week's worth of grocery shopping done and the internet hadn't even been restored by the time I got back really brought home to me how much time I waste! I reckon if I could knock that on the head and get to bed by midnight I'd score a whole extra eight hours a day!My friend is having her balcony rebuilt by the same young man that did mine five years ago. He does excellent work, is very friendly and he and my kids apparently have a couple of friends in common, one of them being Max. Anyway, when I stopped to check my mailbox, he wandered over to me and asked if it was correct that Jordan was a plumber/heating engineer. When I said it was, he handed me his card saying that he routinely gets clients asking if he knows any reputable plumbers and to have Jordan give him a call if he's interested. So I explained to him that at the moment, Jordan's biggest problem is lack of tools (that stuff is expensive), but he said not to worry as he had pretty much everything Jordan could need! How nice of him! And talking of Max, Jordan told me he sent him a message the other day to say that he (Max) hoped they would remain friends despite everything, that he realized just how much work Jordan had voluntarily put in when Max was renovating his farmhouse (he was over there most weekends), and that if he ever needed to borrow tools to work on his own place to just let him know! Wow, that was nice wasn't it - now if only his brother hadn't been such an AH to work with!Things at work are going fine for Jordan. He's been at a different site these past couple of weeks and said the site manager is a bit of a jerk (he said the heaviest tool he's seen him pick up so far is a pencil!!!) but that the other guys are nice enough. There are three Romanians and a Polish guy on site, and while the Romanians kept themselves pretty much to themselves, he and the Polish guy got along well. Then, when the Romanians realized that he wasn't in fact French they started asking him to translate English words into French for them - and now they all get along just fine! The temp agency also said they want to extend his contract for another month but he told them he'll be taking leave come August and then they could see what happens after that. That's not a problem apparently!I had Charlie again on Friday and as it was really hot, after a trip to the farmers' market I went to a bar and sat outside in the shade with a bottle of Perrier water. He loves drinking out of bottles, so he had the other clients cracking up every time he took a slug of my Perrier and then made the funniest faces when the bubbles went up his nose. And again, I have to say just how much I like their town as it has everything you could need right on your doorstep within easy walking distance - something that is very much lacking in my little village! It was a bit of a pain in the butt on Tuesday for them though as the main road was blocked off all day when the Tour de France came through town - but since that only happens once every few years, I'm sure they weren't too put out!The clock tower in St. JeoireThen on Saturday a group of us neighbours were invited to my favourite neighbours' daughter's house for lunch. It was scorching hot, they have a pool, and a wonderful time was had by everyone. The husband next door had his legs operated on yet again this week, but the surgeon has told him they can't put any more stents in his veins as they are \"too far gone\" now, so he is looking at by-pass surgery in the near future. And to be honest, he looks dreadful, terribly thin and stooped now - much older than his 74 years. His wife was telling me that he now struggles to get up the stairs and while he is talking about building an extension onto the house, she's talking about selling up, him taking his share of the proceeds and she'll move back to the west coast of France! Doesn't sound great does it!I like both the son and the daughter from next door very much, so again I was shocked when the son and his wife arrived to see how gaunt and tired he looked at just 45! He works in catering for a large company in Geneva and when the pandemic hit they laid off four of the seven employees. In the meantime the company expanded and now they can't get staff back to keep up with demand, so he's working 14 hour days, servicing cocktails in the evenings, and he looks dreadful. He asked me if there was any way André could get him in where he works, but how do you let somebody down gently and explain that he doesn't really have the relevant skills for where André works. Years ago my organization outsourced the guards, then the messengers, followed by the catering and most of the IT staff so the trend really is leaning heavily towards outsourcing (although to be fair to my employer, they never laid anyone off - anyone who wanted to stay was found alternative employment). I really hope he can find something else as it does seem to be a buyers' market at the moment - companies are crying out for staff and are not able to find them!While I was there I got a message from my American friend who lives in Annecy. She was mortified a couple of months ago at having to \"uninvite\" me to her son's destination wedding in Spain because I'm not vaccinated and there would be medically fragile people there. I was perfectly fine with that because hey, it's their wedding, and in any case, I didn't want the hassle of the ever-changing rules and restrictions regarding foreign travel and covid. Well as it turns out, the entire wedding party (with one exception) came down with covid, including her very pregnant daughter and the daughter's FIL who had a liver transplant earlier this year. Thankfully it seems everyone is fine now, but I wonder how many of those guests unknowingly jumped on planes back home before they knew they were covid-positive. Either way, I wouldn't have fancied the idea of trying to find accommodation and/or rebook flights because so many of the flights were cancelled anyway due to staffing shortages. I'm relieved that everyone was ok in the end, but also so glad I was already uninvited, for obvious reasons!The young salesman came by on Wednesday to give me the info on solar panel installation (strictly speaking, photovoltaic panels) and I've gone ahead and signed up. It's weird because the cost and the projected savings would seem to align exactly with what my sister in England is experiencing, so that's reassuring. It's going to cost me €12,000 to install and he reckons that at today's prices I should knock around €1,000/year off my bill, without taking into account what I can sell back to the grid. So it occurred to me I'd have to live another 12 years to get my money's worth out of it - although I hardly think I'll be on my deathbed yelling \"damn, I wish I hadn't had those solar panels installed\", do you!I also took an executive decision this week regarding money I am holding as the treasurer of our little second-hand book store at work. There were just three of us handling the logistics of this bookshop so a while ago I sent a message to the other two saying that I thought it was madness for me to be sitting here with €1,000 in the kitty for over two years when the local food bank was crying out for help, and did they mind if I took €300 and made a donation? Well I got a \"greetings from Peru\" message from one lady and the other guy didn't respond at all, so on Tuesday, when I took my usual crate of food down to the food bank, I also handed over €300 in cash to them (I got a receipt of course - not my money). Still I don't think anyone will object, I just wish I could have gotten a \"go ahead\" first!And finally, I see Bojo finally got his \"et tu Brutus\" moment, after being stabbed in the back by his own MPs. It probably should have happened ages ago but I don't think anyone is surprised. The problem now is who will replace him, and while I didn't like him playing the buffoon on the international stage, I'm not sure if any of the potential candidates will, in reality, be any better! That being said, I don't know much about British politics so was interested to look up some of the names involved and again, while I don't know this lady or her politics, when I first listened to her speak I was very impressed with her poise and how articulate she seems!Kemi BadenochCan you imagine if she got in as Prime Minister - wouldn't that just upset the apple cart of the old boys' network!!!! Oh, and I just had to post this - a letter from Bojo's former tutor to his father regarding Boris!Martin Hammond, who was Johnson’s housemaster and taught him classics, spotted early on that the prime minister showcased a certain irresponsibility and inattention to facts.Writing of him in a school report in April 1982, he said: “Boris really has adopted a disgracefully cavalier attitude to his classical studies . . . Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility (and surprised at the same time that he was not appointed Captain of the School for next half): I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.”So yeah, hopefully things could be achanging in the entitled old boys' network. Macron got his a$$$ handed to him in the legislative elections last month, and while he still has a relative majority in the National Assembly he no longer has an absolute majority, and so will have to actually negotiate instead of just having his legislation rubber-stamped from now on!At the G7 summit in Madrid recently. Divulging \"confidential\" information regarding Middle Eastern oil production?Macron: Oh my goodness, are those cameras?Biden: Who the hell was that!"},
{"title": "Andy scores an own goal!", "date": "Sunday 3 July 2022", "text": "For some reason I felt a bit meh last week (better now), so only got the bare necessities done as I wasn't motivated to do much more. Being retired I have the luxury to do that, of course, but I was really annoyed at myself because I ended up wasting a fair amount of fresh fruit and veg that I'd bought the previous week because I was just too lazy to do anything with it. I think part of the problem is that I get carried away when I see all the beautiful produce and think \"oh I'll make this, and then I'll make that\" and I go into fresh food overload. Since I also tend to go grocery shopping just once a week I have this compulsion that I must buy all the ingredients for everything I might want to cook just in case. Well that blew up in my face last week and I'm annoyed as hell at myself! If I don't shop at the farmers' markets I go to a wonderful shop called Fresh which, as the name would imply, only sells fresh stuff. It's the kind of place where you're just bursting for someone to take a look in your shopping trolley so you can feel smugly self-satisfied because it's full of \"virtue\", whereas in fact anyone shopping in that store has the same kind of shopping cart because they just don't sell junk. It's all fresh fruit, veg, meat etc. with nothing pre-packaged and it's lovely!So then I had the bright idea that maybe if some of my shopping choices were taken away from me I might get inventive and actually use up some of the stuff I bought. I've seen UK bloggers talking about buying \"no waste\" boxes for a couple of pounds - boxes where you have no idea what you'll get but it's heavily discounted because the store needs to get rid of it. In fact France passed a law in January (of 2021 I think) whereby supermarkets are no longer allowed to throw perfectly good food away - they have to make arrangements with soup kitchens or other outlets to take this stuff - or they can offer it to the public at heavily discounted prices. I'd seen a couple of these at LIDL once or twice but they looked a bit mangy, whereas some of the UK bloggers do really well with these boxes. Out of curiosity I googled the Too Good To Go app and bingo, they do the same thing here too - only it's called anti-gaspillage - no waste here - and lo and behold there are maybe five places locally that use this app to sell off goods that are nearing their sell-by date. To be honest I'm not interested in buying bread/pastries because I don't really eat that stuff, although I suppose if I had room in the freezer it might be worth freezing the bread. There are a couple of the health food stores that also do it, and then I spotted a new-to-me store that had no waste boxes available for €6, so I decided to give it a shot. I signed up for one, paid my €6 and had to go into town the next day to pick it up. As I said, this shop is new to me and I was delighted when I found it was an organic bring-your-own-container place, although honestly, I'm not totally sure my little town is big enough to support four of these places. Still, the lady was very nice and went into the back to bring out what she had put aside for me. Now I was expecting maybe a bit of fruit and veg but when I got it home and unwrapped it it contained: 1kg of rice flour, 1kg of semolina, bee pollen (????), organic chicken bouillon and sun-dried tomatoes! Not what I was expecting at all, and when I think back to the UK bloggers planning a whole week's menu around their surprise box I had to laugh because unless I want to eat sun-dried tomatoes cooked in organic chicken stock for the whole week, I'm buggered! Still, as I actually shop in these kinds of places, I was very pleased with what I received and I certainly got more than my money's worth - it was just not what I expected! A local supermarket also recently offered a last-minute no-waste box but I couldn't be bothered to drive down there to check it out. I might do so next time because I'm sure the food bank would be more than glad to receive the packaged/canned goods (if any)! While I can see that prices are rising, at the moment it's not so in-your-face - except, that is, when I went to buy my weekly treat of a Starbucks coffee. Crikey, they used to sell for €2, then they went up to around €2.10 - and then this week they were asking €3.10!!! Sod that, I'm not paying an extra 50% for a Starbucks coffee - they can go off in the freezer for all I care!Someone mentioned that as a result of her no-waste box she'd decided to cook Jack Monroe's \"sort-of paella\" so I decided to give that a shot too. It wasn't bad actually, but I would use less tomato if I make it again. But it was good to get back on Jack's site as it was a blog I read quite some time ago when she first hit the scene. Yes Jack is a woman! I remember reading her blog A Girl Called Jack years ago and admired her very much. She was (is?) a single mother who, if I remember correctly, had worked as a fire department despatcher before her son was born. When she tried to go back to the fire department on the night shift in order to accommodate her child-care needs they refused and she ended up unemployed and broke. She was at great pains to point out that while she did not live with her son's father, he was still very much involved with his son, but at one point she found herself with empty cupboards and completely skint. It was at this point that she wrote Hunger Hurts - which kinda took off and fame sort of found her. She is an ardent and articulate supporter of the working poor and did not hesitate to take on MPs who paid lip service to helping but then did bugger all about it. The trolling and hate she received took a toll on her but to this day she continues to fight for the less fortunate in society! Jack MonroeOn a completely different note, four of us and two kiddos took a trip out to a place called Le Grand Parc d'Andilly today, which despite the fact that it is only 30-45 minutes from my home, is a total new one for me and it was lovely! It's a fantasy land with giants and elves and goblins set in so many acres of woodland. The website doesn't do it justice because it was so much better than I expected and even if it really is for little kids, I had a great time over the almost seven hours we spent there!Telling the story of Ebeneezer Scroogeand A Christmas CarolTree-top walkways!Elf houses built into the trees!The magic owls!My friend on the giant's rocking horse!Thankfully the giant was still sleeping!At elf school!Sitting in the shade \"at the beach\"!The woodcutter's house!I can't believe I've known about this place for years but never been before. I guess I was thinking it's just for kids (it is) but there really was so much to do and take in that we could easily have spent another couple of hours there if it hadn't been so hot!And finally, how about that Andy guy then? For those of you who haven't heard of Andy, Halifax Bank in the UK recently decided to spend a fair amount of money to \"urge their customers to declare their gender pronouns\"!Frankly anyone that wants to wear this kind of name badgeshould feel free to do so but if Halifax obliged me to do sofor my job, I would not be pleased at all! What's more, I know if I had to have dealings with \"Gemma\", I'd spend allmy time transfixed by her chest!Well apparently quite a few of their customers felt that Halifax's money could be better spent and wrote in saying that as a bank they would rather that money be spent keeping rural branches open, or maybe lowering their interest rates. To which Andy, from Customer (non)Service replied that customers should feel free to close their accounts if they didn't like it. So that's what they did - in their thousands! One man wrote that he had closed a £450,000 investment with them and some quoted as many as 10,000 other customers followed suit!Whatever you think about this issue, I'd say Andy has quite a bit to learn about how to address sensitive issues with customers wouldn't you. Anyone want to take a bet on whether Andy still has a job or is now joining the ranks of the unemployed?"},
{"title": "How not to resign!", "date": "Tuesday 28 June 2022", "text": "Monday was the last day of sewing club for the year and as you know, even though I was the president I couldn't go for many months because of the passe sanitaire! All's good now (for how long?) but in any case, since I've lost the enjoyment of sewing (even though I like the group very much), I went in last week with the intention of telling them that they would have to find someone to take over. One lady mentioned that she was taking in a clafoutis (a kind of tart), so I took in a bottle of red and thought I'd stop and have a chat with them. Then Cynthia showed up with her five month old grandson so no-one actually got any sewing done anyway, and I ended up walking out of there still being the president for next year! That didn't go quite as planned did it! Unlike when Jordan resigned the other week - done and dusted in a couple of minutes!Last week there were quite a few things that I wanted at our local supermarket that they seemed to be out of (computer paper being one of them) so I was curious to see if it was just this supermarket or more generalized. I ended up going to a much smaller and nicer supermarket in the next village to mine and they had everything I wanted. A bonus point is that whenever I go to this place they are never crowded, even on a Saturday, so I think it might be worth switching - although I'm so used to the other supermarket that it might take some adjustment. After that I thought \"to hell with it\" and took a drive down to Annecy to the big hypermarket there, where I always treat myself to lunch, and of course they were fully stocked, so I'm thinking it might be just this one particular chain. That morning we had a power cut which started at around 6 a.m. and when I got back from Annecy at 4 p.m. the electric had only just come back on - so a 10 hour power cut!!!! Yikes, wouldn't want that in the winter!Which brings me to my next question. This afternoon a rather handsome young man came knocking on our doors trying to sell heat pumps (not interested, I just got a new heating system) and solar panels. I know they're not cheap and you take a few years to get your money back but my sister in England loves theirs and we get so much more sun than they do, of course. In fact I'm very lucky with the positioning of my house because I get the sun all day long, so I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts, particularly given the fact that apparently all energy costs are going to go up and up and up? I have the money to pay cash as I won't take out credit for this, but would be curious to hear if you have any thoughts?On a totally different note, I went to my dentist's for a check-up the other week and when I got my bill I submitted it to my insurance at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon via the app on my phone. At 9 p.m. I got a message from them to say I'd been reimbursed!!! Talk about efficient huh! Then last week I went for a long overdue eye check up. I think the last one I had was in Switzerland near my work about five years ago and I'm pretty sure she's retired, so I got an appointment at the same place Jordan and Jen went just down the road from here. In Switzerland I paid about CHF 240 and here I've just paid €41 for the same thing, and given that the Swiss franc and the euro are pretty much 1:1 at the moment I was stunned! I'll be keeping my gynae and my dentist in Switzerland because I've been with them for years and I like them, but I think if I need anything else I'll look around in France in future! I'm sure the insurance company would be grateful too!And finally, getting back to the subject of resigning, Jordan finished work on Friday but even though he was off on Monday he asked if I'd have Charlie on Monday for a few hours (he is only in the crèche Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays) so he could run around. No problem of course. Then this morning he had to stop back in at work to sign some more papers and pick up his pay cheque, and then just before lunch stopped in at an employment agency to sign up for temporary work. About an hour later he sent me a voice mail he received from them to say he starts work tomorrow and she will have long term contracts for him any time he wants! I'm delighted for him because, as he admitted himself, it boosted his confidence no end. He even told me that he went into plumbing because if he lost his job he wanted to know that the work would come to him rather than him having to go out looking for it! Smart move! He then had a follow-up appointment with the employment agency lady this afternoon and I was pretty impressed with the complete dossier he had put together for her. He didn't know how much the salary would be but in any case they are obliged to pay more than he was earning with Max because there is no job security of course! So great news, he knows he can get work any time he needs it. In fact he wants to work in France for the next month and then in August they will be taking a couple of weeks off, and after that he's going to start seriously looking in Geneva. Either way, if he will be making more than with Max they're set, but I'm so, so pleased for them both - their relief is palpable, even though we all knew he could do it!"},
{"title": "Busy again, but damn I'm tired!", "date": "Sunday 12 June 2022", "text": "Damn, I was tired last week, I guess things started catching up to me. I know so much of it was to do with getting over the birthday party I had here and putting everything back to rights, but I guess I also have to admit that I am 63 and have to start realizing that I don't have the energy I had when I was younger, right? That doesn't stop me half the time but ...! For instance, the day before the party when I was trying to get everything set up, I took one look at the back lawn and thought \"oh no, I can't let it go like that\"! My gardener usually stops by approximately every two weeks - it very much depends on his schedule and the weather, of course. But my lawn looked terrible so I took a deep breath and wandered over to my neighbour's to ask if I could borrow the new, battery-operated lawnmower that their son had bought them for Christmas. I still have a very good lawnmower in my garage but I haven't used it for a couple of years and that thing is heavy! Well their lawnmower was a delight, pretty lightweight and I got the lawn cut in about 45 minutes. The downside was that the battery only lasts about 15 minutes so I had to use three batteries just to get my piddly little lawn cut! I think if I ever had to go back to cutting my own grass for some ungodly reason I'd get one of those things, though I really have no intention of ever going there! And then, of course, I noticed that the peonies - while beautiful when in full bloom - were making a real mess now that they were wilting, so out came the secateurs and I got those and the rose bushes done too! So I guess there's a reason I was tired, right?What I hadn't really given much thought to last week was that this Saturday I had volunteered to host our monthly boardgame evening, so here we go again. This time it was easier, of course, because we were only 10 and we've now gotten it down to a pretty fine art, but still, while it was a lovely evening I was really tired today too. I had set up Charlie's birthday present (twin tents with an interconnecting tunnel filled with 100 plastic balls!), but when we went to let him get into it we discovered that there were wasps and creepy-crawlies inside, making that an absolute no-go. So then I had the fun task of picking up 100 plastic balls (seriously, why does any kid need one hundred of those things?) and realized he'd probably be just as happy with about 10 balls in a plastic tub - and he was. Well no, in fact, he was even happier, singing to himself and then turning round to make sure we were all watching as he \"made his cake\"! He really was enjoying himself!Someone noticed the veggie plants on my balcony and pointed out that there was now a rather nice looking courgette hanging from the balcony where the plant had wound itself back round the railings, so I ran upstairs and \"harvested\" my first courgette. But seriously, can you imagine sitting on someone's terrace having a nice glass of wine and getting hit on the bonce by a courgette???? We started off having an apéro and eating outside, but by around 9 p.m. some were getting chilly so we moved indoors where we played a few games, with the intention of having Charlie sleep until it was time to go home - but he was having none of it! He slept maybe 30 minutes and that was it - he wanted to be with us! So I spent most of the evening quite happily playing with him while they played their games but I don't quite know how he managed to stay up till 1 a.m. on so little sleep. He's got me beat, I can tell you!Everyone helped clean up before they left, but of course there's always stuff to do the next day, isn't there. I paced myself better today and worked a bit, then sat and read for a while, then worked a bit, and so on, and in the end it got done. In fact, Isabelle (my neighbour) sat on my tatty old sunbed yesterday and said she could absolutely see why I spend so much time sitting on the terrace as it's just perfect. It has the house's best view and sitting on the sunbed under the balcony out of the sun is just heaven. I swear if we'd gone quiet for a few minutes she would have fallen asleep! I mentioned to her that if she would like a couple of lettuces I had growing on my terrace in my plant pots to come over and get them because I couldn't eat them all, even taking into account that the slugs and snails had had their fill. When she said she'd be over in about 15 minutes I thought \"right, that's it, let's get those bloody mattresses into the car before she comes\"! You see I'd been to IKEA the week before and bought two new mattresses for my bed and still had the old ones to get rid of. They weren't terrible but every so often I like to get new ones to freshen everything up. Having wandered round (been trapped in?) IKEA for a couple of hours I was amazed at the price of some of that stuff. I don't have any problem sleeping (except when my mind is whirring) so don't need special mattresses or pillows, but crikey, the price of some of that stuff!!!!! My bed takes two 80cm x 200 cm mattresses so that's what I needed to get into my car in 15 minutes to take to the recycling tomorrow. So being nothing if not innovative, I decided to throw the buggers out my bathroom window rather than try to lug them down the stairs! Worked a treat and I now have them both in my car ready for tomorrow - and about a six inch nose space between my seat and the windscreen!Jordan and Jen mentioned that they were going out with their neighbours today, either to Les Lindarets (the goat village I've written about before), or to the Parc de Merlet (which I don't know), so I might take myself off this week to visit the Merlet in the hopes of discovering somewhere new!Charlie at Les Lindarets. He wasn't the leastbit scared (which was good, as they can bequite aggressive)!Then today the Critérium du Dauphiné (bike race) came through this area, cycling up to the Plâteau de Solaison and my only thought was \"oh my God\"! I've written about hiking at the Plâteau de Solaison before and that climb is nasty! I don't know how they do it (but then I guess they're not 63 either, are they)?So all in all, it's been nice having a quieter day today. As I was sat in the back garden I heard a birthday party at the neighbours, with lots of kids squealing and playing in an above-ground pool. That's a real treat and will never bother me - it's what kids do!Oh, and the big news is ... Jordan's been having a hard time with Max (but more particularly his brother, Arnaud) for some time. The other day Arnaud complained that a radiator Jordan had installed under a window was off by one centimetre. Jordan explained to him that he'd had to follow the plans rather than the positioning of the window because that's where the relevant piping was. Then an electrician who was also working on the site walked over and pointed out to Arnaud that the last four radiators he (Arnaud) had installed were the same because he, also, had had to follow the plans, and in any case, who could spot a 1 cm difference? Basically Arnaud told the electrician to f..... off because \"Jordan was just a waste of money\"! I've been hearing some of the stuff that has been going on over the months and it has really been getting to Jordan, so this week was the last straw. Even more disgusting though are the so-called \"jokes\" about Charlie's parentage!!!! and Jordan has had enough. So he's drafted his letter and when he gets to work tomorrow he'll be giving them the requisite two weeks' notice and handing in his resignation! Let's see how many \"squared up\" radiators you get done all on your own then, shall we Arnaud? He's got nothing to go to but there should be plenty of temporary work (have you ever met an unemployed plumber? Plumbers are like hen's teeth!) and since's André's neighbour came back to him again to say to get Jordan to give him his cv (done) as he's got people asking in Switzerland, it looks like things could be all change in the next few weeks! I'll let you know more as and when!"},
{"title": "Brilliant!", "date": "Wednesday 8 June 2022", "text": "I didn't get to watch all of the platinum jubilee celebrations but what I did see was wonderful - and even the ubiquitous British weather cooperated. I can only think Adam Lambert has nerves of steel to pull off a performance in front of that crowd (and the guy didn't even win American Idol????)! Still, it's a once in a lifetime event - or not even that since she was only 26 when she ascended to the throne. Not likely to happen again is it. Queen Victoria reigned for 63 years so now they've got 70 years to beat. Just a shame Freddy M didn't live to see it!"},
{"title": "I'm so lucky, lucky, lucky!", "date": "Sunday 5 June 2022", "text": "So we had Jordan's surprise 30th birthday at my house yesterday, but damn were we lucky! The weather this week has been so up and down and on Friday it rained and right now it's pouring down hail storms!!! But yesterday the gods smiled on us and it was wonderful. No rain and about 30°C all day! What more could I ask for?At a guess I think we were 30 to eat and maybe 50 dropping in for a drink. I'd done all my shopping by Thursday and Jen and her mom came over the day before to help set up, with Jen lying to Jordan about going to work, and four hours later we'd pretty much got it all done. I have to admit I stress over this stuff but everyone showed up and hid behind my neighbours' hedges until he arrived (said neighbours who had been wonderful about lending me chairs/tables etc.) and it all worked out great!Max showed up with his girlfriend, Elise, who is quadraplegic (following an accident with wild boars), and then had a problem with the wheelchair ramp on his van. I sent André out to help but seriously??? You send out a guy who doesn't know the top end of a screwdriver from the bottom? But we got it sorted and everyone was hidden out behind the neighbours' hedges when Jordan arrived. He thought we were heading out to the village restaurant but nope, we had about 30 people à table and maybe another 20 stopping by for an apéro! And yes I'm knackered but dammit, I'm so so happy that I have all the people that I love so close to me!"},
{"title": "A busy week!", "date": "Wednesday 1 June 2022", "text": "Sunday was Mother's Day here in France and Jordan and Jen had both us grandmas over for lunch followed by board games, which was a really nice way to spend a couple of hours together. Then Tuesday was Jordan's 30th birthday so Jen invited a few friends round for a suprise get together and then he thinks we're all going to lunch in the restaurant in my village on Saturday as my birthday gift. Well that's not quite true because Saturday is the day I'm hosting about 30 of his friends at my place for a surprise get together. I think we're on track to have everything ready so all I can do at this point is pray for good weather. Earlier this week they were forecasting a 90% chance of rain on Saturday but as the week is going on that percentage is going down and down so I'm desperately hoping it drops right down to zero rain because with those kinds of numbers we really need to be outside. Still, if it rains, it rains and I guess we'll just have to make the best of it. At least it's forecast to be warm, so that's a positive!Teaching Charlie to play guitar on his 30th birthday!On Wednesday night on his way home from work Jordan was passing a truck on the motorway when his car lost all power. Luckily he was just able to pull it over onto the hard shoulder before losing power completely. The upshot of a very long evening saw him getting towed to the Ford garage and me heading out to pick him up at 10 p.m., with a subsequent call from Ford the next day to say that his car was a complete goner - a nice birthday present right! So this week we've been playing musical cars with them either taking my car or me running one or the other of them around, until this coming Monday when Jen's mom will (hopefully) get her new car and they will be buying her old car off her! All good fun, right?The past week has seen glorious weather here with perfect-ish temperatures (for me at least) in the region of 25-30°C. I had to laugh though because while we've been getting 30°C (86°F) my sister has been getting 40°C (104°F) in Spain (yuck), while my brother in England said he was getting 13°C (55°F) and rain! I reckon that's not \"climate change\" though - it seems to me to be pretty much par for the course as far as I can see! Still my peonies and roses have come up a treat with this perfect weather!In other news, last week someone in our retirees' group sent round an email asking people resident in France who had taken a lump sum where they stood for tax purposes in regards to the lump sum. I knew exactly what she was getting at because if you remember I had a big kurfuffle when I retired around whether or not I had to pay an extra 7.5% tax on my lump sum to pay into the French health care system (sécurité sociale). Thankfully in the end it all worked out for me and I didn't have to pay the additional tax because never having worked in France, I'm not covered under the sécurité sociale. But I was just waiting for my former colleague-from-hell to answer the email throwing my name out there as the \"expert\" on this matter. You may remember that when she was going back and forth with the tax people on this issue a couple of years ago she forwarded my tax information to them by way of example. Anyway, so far so good, but I'm keeping an eagle eye out on that email thread just in case!With all the noise recently about how many subscribers Netflix have been losing, I have to say I'm still getting my money's worth out of them (Amazon Prime, not so much) and have just finished watching The Lincoln Lawyer, which I enjoyed very much. When I'm watching a particular series I tend to look up the cast to find out who the actors are and I was somewhat surprised to see that Matthew McConaughey played the lead role because the actor looked nothing like him. Now I've never actually seen Matthew McConaughey in anything so just thought I was probably thinking of the wrong person, but as the series went on, while the actor's English was perfect, I realized that he also had a slight Spanish accent. This confused me because I was pretty sure McConaughey is American born and bred, so I looked it up again and found that McConaughey had played the lead role in the movie, whereas Mexican actor, Manuel García-Rulfo played the main role in the series. As I say, I enjoyed it very much, so much so that I've downloaded the book, although I admit García-Rulfo being very easy on the eye may have had a bearing on my enjoyment of the series (I obviously have a type)!Manuel García-RulfoAnd did anyone see the push-back that the WHO got just last week after the attempt to introduce a Treaty on Pandemic Response? Wow! If not, in a nutshell, in January 2022 the Biden Administration introduced a motion to basically have WHO member states cede their sovereign powers to the WHO in the event of another pandemic (monkeypox, Marburg??). As it currently stands, WHO can only make recommendations in connection with a pandemic, but these amendments would give WHO authority re future pandemics and the way to deal with them, and their instructions would basically be binding on all signatory countries!!! I'm obviously paraphrasing here, but I can't understand why any sovereign nation would want to hand over such powers to unelected bureaucrats? Well there was such strong push back that the U.S. submitted watered down proposals, which should not even be discussed at WHO (yet) because under WHO's own rules, any such proposals have to be tabled at least four months before the meeting. Anyway, Botswana got up and made a statement on behalf of 47 African nations pushing back on these proposals, followed by similar statements by Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran and Malaysia. The upshot is that these countries, in response to huge public pressure, have demanded that negotiations be pushed back to at least 2024, by which time countries will hopefully have had time to adequately debate such proposals! Thank God for public pressure eh!In other news, earlier this week I got a message from Amazon basically saying my kindle is so old that as from August Amazon will no longer be supporting this version of kindle. I was pissed off because I don't really want to have to buy another kindle just because of planned obsolescence, but nor do I want to start reading on my phone because it wears the battery down. In the end, since I still want to have a kindle available for when I travel, I went online and picked out a cheap kindle, put it in my Amazon basket - and then left it there. Sure enough, two days later I went back online and the price had dropped by €20 (???) so I went ahead and ordered it, although it still sticks in my craw having to replace a perfectly good (in my opinion) kindle!And finally, another group of unelecteds met in Davos last week at the meeting of the World Economic Forum. I watched some of the shorter clips about what was going on there but I find the whole thing more than irritating. Klaus Schwab set up the WEF about 40 years ago and WEF have been training \"young global leaders\" ever since (Merkel, Gates, Putin, Blair, Macron, Trudeau, Ardern). The clip below was filmed in 2017 but it gives you an idea of the reach that WEF has!Young Global Leaders - WikipediaOne clip I did see, although I can't remember who it was and can't be arsed to look it up, was someone talking about how his company was close to perfecting an app that would allow you to \"calculate your carbon footprint\". So if, say, you drive your car instead of taking the bus it would calculate your foot print, but if you walked instead of taking the bus, it would show a more \"acceptable\" carbon footprint. There was even talk about how it could track your eating habits and \"notify\" you of any bad habits and your need to improve them!!!!! It's all very 1984-ish, isn't it! But I wonder how many of the Davos clique were calculating their carbon footprints as they sped away in their motorcades back to the private jets waiting to whisk them back home! Not many, I suspect!"},
{"title": "Vegans and snails!", "date": "Sunday 22 May 2022", "text": "About 18 months ago I was introduced to a new-to-me vegan restaurant just up the road from here. I've always been interested in vegetarianism/veganism so was delighted to find that their food was actually very, very good! Then of course the pandemic intervened and this restaurant chose to no longer do in-house dining because they refused to ask for people's vaccine passports - so it was take-out only! Anyway, everything opened back up for us a couple of months ago and I saw on their website that they were offering cookery courses, so I signed up and went to my first one yesterday and it was wonderful! I'd been to a vegan class in Geneva a couple of years ago and it was a real disappointment, but this one was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! The lady lives and breathes veganism/organic food/holistic medicine and is such an interesting woman. For the first 30 minutes we talked about why we were interested in it. She said that right from a very young age she felt such empathy with animals that she couldn't force herself to eat meat so vegetarianism came naturally, followed by veganism as she got older! It's a lovely place where they give yoga classes, and reiki and massage therapy, in addition to the restaurant side of things. There were four other ladies, all very interesting too. One lady \"talks to animals, plants, trees, etc.\" and was very into all that stuff, and while she's obviously free to believe what she wants I just wished she'd talked a little less! That being said we were all different but all very accepting of those differences too. In fact, the lady I liked the most has a small farm in the mountains where she and her husband raise animals for meat and the \"tree hugger lady\" didn't bat an eyelid at it!On the menu were chilled courgette and cucumber soup, carrot and olive cake and the most delicious uncooked lemon tart (made using avocado as the \"mousse\")! Everything was really good and our teacher told us how and why she used the different flours and vegetable milks/creams, etc. Chilled courgette and cucumber soup!Olive and carrot cake!No cook lemon tart!(The photos aren't very good becauseI'd already put it all in containersto take home when I thought to take photos)!It was such a good time that I was disappointed to learn that they were selling up and moving to Vendée in September!!! When I asked her what they were going to do in Vendée she said she had no idea but as somewhat of a nomad, every few years she felt the need to move on and she knew something would turn up for her when she got there! Apparently her grandmother had been a true gypsy so I guess that is where she got her wanderlust from! Since I'm anything but a gypsy I kind of admire her, but will be very sorry to see her and her little restaurant go! I don't know if you've seen the film Chocolat but she reminds me very much of the main protagonist in that film. That being said, the book is so much better than the film (of course), all the more so because in the film it's the local Mayor that falls under the spell of the travelling gypsy woman, whereas in the book it's the local priest, which makes it that much more \"juicy\"!Thankfully there are a few very good health food stores round here but when I asked her where she preferred to shop she mentioned a new Ecoquartier which had been built up the road in Bonneville, on the site of the old hospital. Now I'd never heard of this place so this morning I took a trip out there to check it out. The store was, indeed, lovely and afterwards I stopped in the little coffee shop next door for a drink (and yeah, a meringue cake too), but it did strike me that for an ecoquartier there was an awful lot of concrete! As I was only 10 minutes away from Jordan and Jen's I bought a couple of pastries and stopped over there as I wanted to discuss something with Jen. Since Charlie is only in daycare Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Jen's mom and I take care of him the other two days, with me doing Friday as I want to continue my Monday morning yoga classes. When we were sorting out our schedules though, Jen's mom had a whole list of Mondays where she couldn't take Charlie (she has a boyfriend who lives 90 minutes away and goes to his place, and then they are going on holiday soon for two weeks). Fair enough, I worked my schedule to suit her and cancelled a few yoga classes - except this morning she sent me a message to say she was coming home early from the boyfriend's and could now take Charlie tomorrow instead. While I don't mind accommodating her, I don't want to be forever on the receiving end of moving plans around after they've been agreed, so I wanted to ask Jen what suited her best. I'd planned to miss yoga and have Charlie at my house tomorrow and have set up his little swimming pool, but now that's been changed and we're back to our normal schedule. I don't know, maybe I'm being unreasonable but I don't like making plans and then having them switched at the last minute, especially if I've made my own plans! Anyway, it got sorted, and then Jen asked me if I wanted to go to visit a snail farm with her and Charlie as they had an open day and it was only 10 minutes away? A snail farm, ehhhh, no thank you, I'm not shoving those things in my mouth! Well in the end we all went and it was a fun way to spend a few hours (not that Charlie cared that much but he was very interested in everyone around him). Oh, and there was no snail eating either. It was just the owner showing how he \"cultivated\" 200,000 snails a year for the local market. He was good fun and put on a 50 minute show for the kids all about snails. \"How do you wake up a snail\"? \"You shout at him\"! Nope, they're deaf, they're also pretty much blind (unless you get to within a couple mm of them), and so the best way to wake them up is to water them (and of course the kids got a good watering too). Then he asked what snails eat and cracked up when one little boy shouted \"ketchup\"! The really interesting part was when he showed the kids how strong snails are, capable of moving 100 times their own weight - which he proved by attaching a toy car to a snail's shell and they watched it pull the car up the slope. As I say, it was a good show, and afterwards we had a wander round the other stands set up in his field (selling honey, wine, jewellery, etc.), had a quick beer and then headed back home!See the toy car \"tow truck\"!On the way home I stopped to fill my car up. While I was there a young lad on a scooter asked if I could change a €20 note for two tens as he wanted to put €10 in his scooter. I knew I hadn't got any change so told him I'd fill his scooter up for him. Crikey, you'd think I'd given him the world, he was so grateful!When I got home I went round the salad plants I've got potted up on my garden wall, picking off slugs and snails before they could do too much damage. Oddly enough it seems that the best deterrent has been the smashed up egg shells I've got scattered round a couple of pots, so I'll be keeping any and all egg shells in future - or at least until this growing season ends. I had to laugh when I went to throw some stuff in my compost bin though, because some time ago I'd dumped a whole bunch of potato peelings in there - and now it looks like I've got a compost bin full of spuds! I'll have to wait till I dig them up but from what I'm seeing right now I needn't have wasted my time planting potato seedlings in my raised beds if all it was going to take was to drop the peel in the compost bin!Just as I was starting to think about dinner there was a knock at my door and my neighbour walked in with about 10 bottles. Here's me thinking we were in for a good time tonight, so I was disappointed when she asked if she could fill them up with water as their water heater had blown and they were having to empty the tank to fix it! It ended up with her very embarrassed daughter coming over to my place for a shower, although when I offered to give them my spare key they said they'd be ok as they were hoping to fix it by tomorrow. While I wish I'd already gotten my bloody bathrooms done, I was so glad I'd made the effort to clean all the upstairs rooms thoroughly this week. I guess it's just like your mom used to say - always wear clean underpants because you just never know!And finally, I don't know if I'd mentioned before but I decided to start using my lovely sunny balcony as a place to put my other home grown veg hopefuls since I never use it. So far I've got 11 rather nice looking plants out there (tomatoes, courgettes, hot peppers) and you know what, there's not a single slug/snail on them. So it would seem, that planting them on a first floor balcony is an even better slug deterrent than scattering crushed egg shells round your plants. Beat that ya buggers!"},
{"title": "Yikes!", "date": "Friday 20 May 2022", "text": "Jen asked me if I could look after Charlie pretty much all day today as she was having to do a split shift to cover for absences. No problem, of course, but getting up at 5.30 a.m. to get there for 7 a.m. was a bit of a shock to the system. Still he was as good as gold and when I sensed he was getting a bit tired, but still too early for a nap (in my opinion), we walked up to the farmers' market in their little town and then stopped off at the park for about 30 minutes afterwards. He loved it as there were loads of kids there today and he got to crawl over (not quite walking yet) to so many of his new best friends and \"chat\"! After that it was back home for his nap and it was only then that I got to check out what was going on on FB! Crikey, there was a massive explosion right next to Geneva airport today! First I heard was that it was the UPS terminal at the airport, but it was later confirmed to be a building that was being built for asylum seekers right near the airport. No-one was hurt, thankfully, but I have to admit that my first thought was \"hmmm, a building for asylum seekers\", and then the next thought was simply \"I'm glad I won't be sitting in that traffic\"! Still, it wouldn't be the first time a building being either built or renovated has gone up in smoke in Geneva! It made me laugh though when I read in the Geneva news that \"traffic was only slightly affected\"! You've gotta hand it to the Swiss!Tomorrow I have a cookery class at the excellent vegan restaurant near here. Their food really is very good and I'm intrigued to see what we will be cooking. Will let you know in my next post!And, you wouldn't believe it but something that must have been the size of a flying cow has just left me a \"gift\" on my brand new velux in the TV room. There's just no respect sometimes is there!"},
{"title": "Wow!", "date": "Thursday 19 May 2022", "text": "I took a trip out to our large, local charity shop last week to drop of some stuff (not enough - I need to do better) and have a look around. As I was almost there a cyclist came belting round a bend, down a hill and on the wrong side of the road! He wasn't a lycra fettishist, just an old fart on a bike, but thank God I spotted him before he got to me. The guy behind me wasn't quite so lucky though as he had to swerve like crazy to miss the idiot! Damn, do some people have a death wish or what? This charity store isn't much cop, to be honest, but they don't do too badly for baby items and I was able to pick up a lightweight, collapsible stroller to keep at my house for just €10 - whereas they run anywhere from €80-€100! So score there then!On the way home I stopped back off at the garden centre to pick up a couple more of the 7' wooden stakes and a couple of tomato plants. The old guy behind me at the check-out made me laugh though when he said \"hon, you've got some high hopes for those tomato plants, haven't you\"? Although actually no I don't. My \"build my own greenhouse\" idea is a roaring flop so that will all have to be taken down, I guess. In all honesty, given the amount I've spent on my \"organic gardening\" idea so far, I'd probably just be better off buying it all from the health food shop and to hell with it! Still, every spring I get this madcap idea how \"this year it's going to be better\" and then it mostly goes tits up (if you'll forgive the expression)!Jen had an interview today for the director position at another local crèche (she was upfront with her current employers about it). I don't know how she did as yet, but if she was lucky enough to get it it would basically just mean a transfer from her nursing job at the psychiatric hospital (where she worked before she had Charlie), on the same pay grade and with all her time in grade respected, so fingers crossed!Then last week I got a reminder email from the people who prepare my French taxes asking where my paperwork was. I told them I'd been waiting for them to send me the link to the Legal Pilot that we used last time but nope, this time they were using Swisstransfer - and what a wonderful system it is. I'd already prepared my paperwork anyway, but using Swisstransfer it literally took me two minutes to upload everything, type in their email and they'd received it. The difference is that once the document is sent, other than my own copy the email/file then disappears permanently. Clever huh! I would guess these people handle some pretty big tax declarations and can't take the risk of having people's personal tax information possibly being hacked!On another positive note I recently received my latest water bill so I yet again sent André a message saying \"thank you for moving out\", because my water bill is now only about a third of what it used to be! And then, I got a phone call on my mobile from \"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes\" - which is this region - and while I don't normally pick up on numbers I don't recognize, this time I did and it was my bank/insurance company wanting to review my various insurances. My first thought, of course, was \"here we go\", but nope he suggested that as my car is now 11 years old I probably didn't need fully comp (I had no idea it was still on fully comp), the insurance amount for renewal of home contents was waayyyy overvalued so all in all I've knocked about €60 off my monthly bill for that, in addition to the €40 a month that I was being charged by my telephone provider for a wifi box I no longer owned. The one place I wouldn't go was my accident/sickness insurance because I have excellent worldwide coverage through my former employer, but all in all I did pretty well from that phone call!  Add to that the euro is dropping like crazy at the moment so that gives my Swiss franc denominated pension more bang for my buck, so I'm well pleased!And finally, the windows guys showed up today to install the three velux windows I'd ordered a couple of months back and man did they work hard. It was scorching hot and they were up and down my stairs and had those babies installed in just five hours. The only thing missing is the blackout screen for the large velux in my TV room, which is on back order, but I'm so pleased with the rest as those rotting windows were starting to get on my nerves. Now if I can just get my bathrooms started .....! But I think I'm going to have to go with someone other than Jordan as he is working all hours God sends at the moment so he's fine with my looking for someone else - although goodness knows I won't be looking forward to the mess when they start that! I think it's time to do some serious decluttering before even thinking about all that!"},

{"title": "It's been a while!", "date": "Monday 2 May 2022", "text": "I've been offline completely for a few days again as I felt I needed to take a break for a little while - I find it does me a lot of good. In fact I've actually just realized that I unplugged the TV about three months ago when the guy came to look at replacing my windows and I haven't plugged it back in since, so I guess I might not need that either!I did watch a brief Youtube video recently though where a Canadian immigrant (from Tanzania, I think) filmed around his local area pointing out how no-one was outside and saying that in his country everyone was always outside chatting and so on. Of course a huge part of that is if you live in a cold country you're hardly gonna be sitting on your doorstep chatting are you, but I got the point he was trying to make. When I was very young, before the council demolished our homes and moved us into new homes, I vaguely remember the women sitting outside chatting while the kids played \"in the square\". That happened also to a certain extent in our new home too, but much of that seems to have gone now, and I think it's a darn shame because you lose that sense of community! Oh I get it that nowadays most families have both parents working outside the home so who has the time to sit outside and chat, right? But it was brought home to me today when I bumped into a neighbour at the mailbox (she lives a little way away from me) and we had quite a bit of catching up to do. She asked if I thought we'd be having our neighbourhood clean-up/shindig this year and I told her I'd already spoken to the Chairman of our Homeowners' Association and yep, we'd be doing it. Of course winter and covid put the knackers on so much so I think we're all looking forward to meeting up again and having a chat and a drink on the little island in front of our homes. She also told me that the people at number five had moved out and I was quite shocked as I hadn't known. Now to be fair they had always been a very discreet couple but over the years the wife had gotten sicker and sicker (diabetes, I think, but at the time I had thought it was dementia) and so many years ago refused to leave her home at all, which meant that the husband had to do everything, including taking care of her. I barely knew him but had heard a little of what he was going through and my respect for him was enormous. So to hear the wife has now been moved into a care home in a village not far from here and he has found a small apartment nearby makes me so happy for him, as it can't have been easy these past few years, even if their two children visited regularly!In other news, I decided to take a run out today as I wanted to drop off my recycling and get a baguette from our little local bakery, but I got quite a shock when I pulled into the next village to find that the bakery has gone out of business!!! They've been there the 30+ years that I've lived here and the place was absolutely picture-perfect. In fact I remember when Steve visited a few years ago he commented that it looked absolutely how he had pictured it in his mind! It saddens me to think of the two local corner stores that have also gone out of business recently due to the arrival of a much larger chain store a couple of years ago, but it is a conundrum because I guess we all like the efficiency and pricing of places like Amazon (and Walmart, I'm led to believe) and yet we know that they are putting small mom and pop stores out of business and, from what I hear, don't treat their staff particularly well either! How can the little people ever hope to compete?Charlie looks to be as fit as a fiddle again now, after his bout with conjunctivis/an ear infection/roseola and chickenpox! But when the roseola didn't seem to be going away a couple of weeks ago they ended up at the emergency room on the Sunday night and it turns out the poor little thing is actually allergic to the antibiotics the doctor had given him for the ear infection!!! Still, I suppose you have to find out one way or another and it's good to know, right!My sister headed off to their house in Spain 10 days ago and after she'd arrived safely I found out they'd actually had an accident on the way to the port in England. Apparently a motorbike had come belting up the line of traffic crawling it's way to the port, spotted an oncoming vehicle and screeched back into his lane taking half the backside of my sister's car with it. My sister and the man in the car behind started directing traffic, while my BIL tended to the motorcyclist. The ambulance arrived pretty quickly and as he was apparently not badly injured they were able to continue their journey in their smashed up car and made it in time to catch the ferry. Thankfully the car behind them had a dashcam so it will all be taken care of by the motorcyclist's insurance, but since then I've been thinking it might be a good idea to get front and back dashcams too, because if you're ever unfortunate enough to have a need for them they must be a godsend!I had yoga Monday morning and while we were waiting for a few more people to arrive our teacher was saying that after two months with her Ukranian guests, she really was looking forward to having them leave while they could still part on good terms! One couple had found jobs and gotten an apartment and the other three were moving into a large house that had been provided by the local commune. Frankly I think our teacher is a saint but she said it was even enough to try her patience as they got up late, started cooking lunch around 4 p.m., were noisy and went to bed very late. She also said that nobody took any notice of the fact that a household that size could only run if everyone pitched in and helped with the housework, so, as I say, she will be very glad when they move out! One man fell off his bike last week and was going to have his shoulder operated on the following day so she was already thanking her lucky stars that she had gotten his medical coverage sorted out immediately upon arrival! I have another friend who had taken in three Ukranians and when I asked him how it was going he just said \"tricky\", so I left it at that. Two of the ladies at our sewing club said the same thing, so while I think it was very altruistic to have done what they did, it hasn't been the roaring success that so many imagined, going by what people are saying!The other Sunday Jen and I took Charlie up to a vide-grenier in a local town, although I think calling it a town is a bit of a misnomer because it's more like just one street! Still, it was warm and sunny and we had a nice few hours out. At one point Jen stopped to buy churros but when she spotted that they were €6 for 10 she walked away. Apparently they used to be around €2/€2.5 so I guess the price of the frying oil has really gone through the roof! They had a few fair-type things for the kids and an oompa loompa band which fascinated Charlie, so it turned out to be a nice way to get out of the house for a few hours!And finally, I got this hairbrained idea into my head that I was going to build my own makeshift greenhouse! I know, mad right! So I went out to the garden centre and bought myself two pointed stakes about 4' long and two more about 7' long (I looked like I was going pole vaulting when I carried them to the car). So here's me thinking I can just \"tap\" them into my rock solid garden with a lump hammer! Well of course that didn't work, so I got the sack of cement out that I just happened to have handy and gently dabbed a little cement around the base of each stake. After leaving it to set for a few hours I went back out to check on them and the bloody things had fallen over (I guess one of the neighbours sneezed) because I'd cemented them to the grass!!! So there was nothing to do for it but to start digging four holes, load them back up with cement and pray. It's not ideal but it's definitely an improvement. Then I placed cardboard down inside the confines and have started fixing (\"fixing\" being another loose term for what it actually looks like) chicken wire around the outside. I've yet to finish it but the whole thing looks so saggy even I have to laugh. In my mind's eye I knew exactly what I wanted but apparently my mind's eye might need new glasses! If I ever get it finished I'll take a photo of it - I'm pretty sure it'll give you a good laugh!"},
{"title": "And the good news is ...!", "date": "Saturday 23 April 2022", "text": "I'm coming to realize lately how much I appreciate having days/weeks with nothing planned. I still seem to get plenty done but it's been at my own pace and as and when I feel like it. There's no yoga for the next two weeks due to the Easter holidays, so I decided I wanted to get in at least one walk (done, 10 km Thyez to Cluses) and one session at the gym this week (also done). I wasn't feeling too enthusiastic about the gym but by the time I got off the bike after 45 minutes I thought I may as well \"give it some wellie\" (as we say back home) and ended up really enjoying myself, on top of having the whole upper floor of the gym to myself!I continue to play the old head game of setting my timer for an hour and just getting on and doing something - anything - and by gum it seems to be working. Maybe I've found my groove because I've gotten so much done this week in one-hour chunks and, more importantly, I've actually enjoyed it! The other day I got my French tax papers ready to send off, and then went online to set up my account with the local water authority on their new site. Just like the French naturalisation site, however, the water board site wasn't working so I decided to leave it a few days and bingo, I got that done this morning. I wasn't so lucky with the naturalisation site though because their newfangled site is still not working - or maybe it's just that they don't want any more of us becoming French! Who knows! Still, not to worry, it'll all come right on the night I suppose. So since I couldn't get that ticked off my invisible to-do list, I set to and scrubbed the large balcony at the back of my house for the first time in ages and it looks pretty good. I actually don't know what the point was in installing these balconys when they built the houses because I don't know anyone that uses them. I suppose a more pertinent question would be why don't I use mine because it has the best view, looking out over the farm and the mountains! I suppose it could be because I like to sit under the balcony in the shade rather than on the balcony getting burned to a crisp. Still, it's a great place to dry my washing, and I'm even thinking I might put one of my small greenhouses out there to grow some of my warm weather veggies. I'd have to think about how to secure it though because right now there's a storm blowing and the wind can and does howl round that corner!While I was out there scrubbing I noticed a little hedgehog moseying around on my back terrace. I thought it was unusual because they're usually nocturnal, but nope there he was, all curled up having a snooze. It eventually struck me that he might be sick so I put some water out for him and decided I'd shovel him up with my snow shovel if and when he kicked the bucket. But he didn't 'cos when I went out there to do the deed he was sniffing around by my back door! I deliberately went out and stood quite close to him but as that didn't seem to phase him at all, I went back into the house and came out and scattered some crushed up cereal to see what he would do. And guess what, turns out hedgehogs like Special K!I also finally got through varnishing the bathroom unit after I realized the paint chipped easily if I didn't varnish it. I haven't done a very good job but I'm happy with it and it's 100% better than it was! Just got to get the rest done now!Before - God I can't believe I put upwith that for so long!After - I'm rather pleased with this!I've also got quite a bit done in the garden/seedling department, even if my living room still resembles a jungle as I can't plant out yet. The other day when I was checking on my tomato seedlings I noticed that several pots had something else sprouting in addition to the tomato plants. Then it hit me that I had just been dumping in whatever half-decomposed compost I happened to have handy when I was repotting and some of the potato peelings had started to sprout! Heck at this rate I might be able to grow an entire salad in one pot!I got chatting to my neighbour earlier this week and she asked me if I had heard about the Ferme des Chenevifs (the cheese-makers just up the road). Turns out that a couple of their cows had tested positive (for what, I don't know) and the entire herd had been slaughtered and they have now closed up shop!! Damn, that is so sad! I barely eat cheese so I wouldn't have known about it, but they were a small, family-owned business and poof just like that everything they had worked for is gone! I just hope they were well compensated for their loss!Two weeks ago saw the first round of the French elections. In order to stand you have to have the support of at least 500 French mayors. There were three candidates who I thought were excellent but who weren't able to stand because of lack of mayoral support (there's a whole fishy backstory to this), but one who did get to run was a former Macron crony named Valérie Pecresse - the richest of all the people running! She was an abysmal candidate who came over as totally phony and so, of course, hardly got any votes. The thing is, she had put €5 million of her own personal money into the €7 million campaign funds, but under an unknown-to-me ruling for French elections, any candidate who polls less than 5% of the votes can not request reimbursement of monies spent from their party's campaign funds. Pecresse polled just 4.8% (she was convinced she was going to win) so is out €5 million of her own money and then had the nerve to go on television asking people to send money to help her recoup her losses!!!!!! It was quite funny (to me at least) because a whole bunch of people mailed in cheques for €1 and an opposition candidate offered to lend her his Peugeot 308! But seriously, the nerve of her, asking \"the plebs\" to help make up her losses when they will never have one-tenth of what she has if they work their entire lives! Needless to say my cheque is not in the mail!I've been reading in the news that Netflix has apparently lost thousands of subscribers in the last couple of months as people, for whatever reason, are turning against them. (Could it be that nobody could give a sh*t about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's angst and the documentary Netflix is paying them millions to film)? I have to say, though, that I'm definitely getting my money's worth out of Netflix even if I won't be watching the Ginger Whinger's documentary! The past couple of nights I've stayed up late to watch the documentary on arch paedophile Jimmy Savile and it truly was stomach-turning. I remember as a young girl thinking I didn't like that creep and then one day my mom said the same thing. Oh there were rumours about him floating about for years, apparently, but since he raised millions for charity - in particular for Stoke Mandeville spinal injuries unit - the guy must have felt untouchable. Indeed he certainly seemed to be just that! When some of the victims were finally able to get their stories out (with the aid of an intrepid investigative reporter), they numbered in their hundreds - 400, in fact, according to the documentary - and while the pervert seemed to prefer young girls, he wasn't averse to assaulting young boys either, the youngest being a five year old! While \"justice\" (if you can call it that) was served in the end, it's just a shame that the bastard had already died when that justice was dished up!Pervert-in-chief, Jimmy Savile!Poor Charlie has been sick again! (again???)? It started off with conjunctivitis and an ear infection. When he got over that Jen reckoned chickenpox was on its way because they have an outbreak at the crèche. Well it turns out the rash all over his body was actually roseola, but, not to miss out, he then started a couple of days ago with chickenpox blisters. Poor little soul! That being said, he's actually fine, not miserable at all, and I guess we can only thank the powers that be that all these childhood illnesses have hit him while Jen's been at home and able to take care of him. I went over yesterday to see him and Jen was all bubbly because guess what? She's got a job! She'd been on parental leave until 31 March and was then suspended (along with the other 70,000 medical staff) for refusing the jab. She said the lady in HR was really nice about it and said she would have done the same if she could find another job but .... In fact, she told Jen that their small local hospital is now short 80 nurses because of the vaccine mandate and they are struggling! Anyway, Jen has applied for five jobs outside of nursing and last week went for an interview at a crèche just down the road. She said she loved the place and the atmosphere was great and she found out two days ago that they wanted to offer her the job - oh, and can you start on Wednesday? They were also happy to accommodate her need to start later (she needs to get Charlie to his own crèche first) because she could do the 7 p.m. closing instead - something the others didn't want to do. The pay is pretty abysmal compared to what she was earning as a nurse but she reckons they can manage financially. Also (and I think this is extremely positive), the woman told her that she understood that she will have been applying for other, higher-paying jobs (she has - she's waiting to hear back from the other four) and so offered her a trial three-month contract to see how she liked it and how it worked out for them! That, to my mind, is a definite plus in that it shows that this lady is human. And so, my blogging friends, for the first time in over a year I saw Jen really smile and all that pent up tension fade away! Who knows what will happen because if Marine Le Pen gets in on Sunday she has already stated that she will reinstate all the medical staff that have been suspended because of the vax mandate. Sadly I don't think she will get in because Napoleon's backers' pockets are just too deep, but who knows. So what that means is that I will be taking care of Charlie on Fridays and Jen is going to ask her mom to have him on Mondays (my yoga day), although she did say she didn't think her mom could manage a whole day so who knows if I will get roped in for Monday afternoons too. We'll see how it works out but I'm delighted for Jen and know she will not only enjoy her new job but she will be good at it (it's in a day care centre and she loves kids)!AAAAAANNNNNDDDD (you thought I'd finished didn't you), the other day André spoke to his neighbour who works in Geneva in a hardware store selling plumbing supplies to professionals and asked him if he knew of any openings through his contacts. The guy told him the plumbers he dealt with couldn't find qualified plumbers to work for them for love nor money and to have Jordan get a résumé to him as soon as possible. So if this works out for Jordan he will be raking it in compared to what he is earning now. Minimum wage in Geneva (unskilled) is already almost three times what he's making now so as a qualified plumber who knows what that figure might be! So there you have it, a hopefully positive update on the roller-coaster ride that has been our norm for the last year. Fingers and toes duly crossed!"},
{"title": "It's been a while!", "date": "Monday 18 April 2022", "text": "I see it's over two weeks since I posted but even though I've been somewhat busy, things haven't been that exciting so I guess there was not much to report really! I fell into a bit of a slump for a few days the other week and got very little done, but I've come to realize if I allow myself that slump it only takes a short while for the energy to get going again. I've always known I'm a tortoise rather than a hare, so I guess it's best to go with your natural flow, isn't it!So what's new, apart from the fact that my ex has been and gone. As I said previously I didn't think he looked very well when he arrived, but that could initially have been put down to jet leg. As time went on however (he was here three weeks), I thought that he looked less and less well, and on his last day here I thought he looked terrible! That being said, things between us were fine, there were a few run-ins with my sons, but at least he has now met Charlie and seen his boys for the first time in three years. There's a whole other back story too, which I may or may not write about in time, but when I was talking to my sister this weekend and I went on a breathless rant for what seemed like about 30 minutes (but probably wasn't), I realized I  haven't done that since we split up! I guess it goes to show where my stress came from, right?Jen's grandparents had come down for Charlie's birthday so one day we all took a trip into Geneva to visit the Natural History Museum (something Jen's grandparents enjoy very much, apparently). We spent a couple of hours in there, but to be honest when you see some of those sea creatures wouldn't it make you wonder why on earth you ever set foot in the ocean again! There was one exhibit which I can only describe as looking like a huge, fat squid and boy if I ever came across that in the ocean I think I would faint (although I expect the squid might feel the same way looking at me in a swimsuit)!On my ex's last day we met up over at Jordan and Jen's place for lunch and then sat in the little park belonging to their apartment building waiting for Jordan to finish work. The babe explored his new surroundings, André played guitar and my ex pretty much slept for about three hours lying in the grass. Jen and I each had a bottle of Tourtel lemonade and at one point I looked over at Charlie only to see him playing with an empty bottle. What on earth the neighbours thought seeing us giving \"beer\" to him goodness only knows!Other than that I've been pottering around and it's been quite satisfying to be slowly moving things forward in chunks of about a couple of hours work a day. André had given me a €100 gift card for a large garden centre near here so I headed out there one afternoon, fretting slightly because what if I didn't spend the whole €100? Would they give me a credit for the difference? Ha! What a joke! Since when could I not spend €100 in that place? I felt a bit daft at one point, though, because I've been looking for a watering can with a \"daisy-thingy\" spout for ages but could never find one. I mean, ages and yet while I was in the garden centre I picked up a whole bunch, looked inside one of them and there was the detachable head! Well of course, they put them inside the watering can so as not to lose them! I swear if I had half a brain I'd be dangerous!Picture of a watering can - just in case!Continuing on the gardening theme, I saw a youtube video claiming to show you \"how to easily cultivate coriander (cilantro) seeds\". Basically he soaked the seeds in water, crushed them slightly, wrapped them in cloth and put them away in a warm, dark place for three days. All well and good so far, of course, but do you think I can remember where I hid them? Nope, almost a week later I still haven't found them so I'm kinda waiting for yet another triffid to start making it's way along the shelves and out the door of some cupboard or other soon!I'm not sure what's going on with the farm since the farmer died, but I was delighted to see the other day that there are now goats, sheep and about a dozen cows out in the fields behind me. But given that they have the whole mountainside to themselves, I can't help but wonder why the cows all huddle together in one spot!I was also delighted to see that our village is going to hold its first village fête in four years this year. They were doing some rebuilding work at the community hall for the first two years and then of course covid intervened, but I can only imagine how everyone will be looking forward to it this year. It is very rural, something akin to la France profonde, very sociable and it remains one of the most popular village fêtes around!My friend and I went out to our first vide-grenier last week-end, both of us dreading buying more junk that we didn't need (we didn't), but it was so lovely to be out and about again after so long. It was gloriously sunny but by golly the wind was fierce on that plâteau so we stayed just long enough to have a wander and then hightailed it back to the warmth of the car!When I got back I was sitting watching my latest Netflix goodie (Anatomy of a Scandal) when the bloody phone went at 11.15 p.m.! I'm getting more and more of these telemarketers and I know it's randomized computer dialing, but do they really think they're going to get any money out of me at that time of night? I don't answer, of course, and they never leave a message, but still, time to unplug the landline at night, methinks!And finally, I talked briefly over Easter with a friend who is going through a very unpleasant divorce. So unpleasant, in fact, that she found out he had placed what seems to be voice-activated recorders in her home - which is her home that she bought before marriage! Man oh man, there are so many ways you can be spied upon it's unreal. But that brings to mind a story on a site that I follow where one lady discovered that her soon-to-be-ex had placed a GPS tracking device in her car, after he'd run off with his mistress but before their divorce was finalized. So she got her own back on him (and probably drove him mad in the process) by getting her neighbour to place it in his car until the divorce was final. He was a travelling salesman!"},
{"title": "Oh dear!", "date": "Saturday 2 April 2022", "text": "Someone on FB traffic alerts posted a meme to the effect \"ha ha to those that took their snow tyres off last week\" - and boy was it appropriate! It started snowing yesterday evening, snowing all night and day to leave about an eight inch dump on my car by yesterday morning. The roads didn't look too bad but since I didn't have to go out I thought I may as well stay home. Then this morning I set off to meet up with Jen to go to a bourse for children's stuff as she was looking for a child gate and me - well I just wanted to play with Charlie and drive him nuts (it worked)! I pushed all the snow off my car with a large broom and the roads were pretty much ok - or at least until I got almost to their place and my rear end (the car, not me) spun out on a sheet of black ice as I was going round a traffic island. It shook me up a bit but all was hunky dory in the end when I got the car straightened up, so no harm done. When I got to Jordan and Jen's place I mentioned that I would stop up at André's place afterwards as I had received another letter from the bank for him, and that was when Jordan mentioned that dad hadn't made it to Portugal on Friday as planned and that things were maybe a little \"tense\" up there! Oh dear, so a leopard doesn't change it's spots then. I might write more about it tomorrow but again, did I ever mention how glad I am to be divorced?Out my window when the snow started yesterday evening!About 30 minutes up the road from here, in the ski resortof La Clusaz!"},
{"title": "Who's been a busy bee then?", "date": "Thursday 31 March 2022", "text": "Maybe it's because there's a hint of spring in the air but I finally got a burst of energy again this week and got so much done that had been bugging me for ages! Do you know what I mean by the \"eternal invisible to-do list\"? The things you need/want to get around to doing but just never seem to get there? Well I decided to start putting the list down on paper and trying to knock a couple of them out every day. I mean, seriously, most of them only take a few minutes anyway, right? So I've been quite a busy bee this week and it feels pretty good. (At this point I was going to post an audio of Arthur Askey singing Busy Bee but thought the better of it - although I'm definitely showing my age with that one)!My mobile phone bill has been bugging me for quite some time because when I signed up for a new contract (and got my iPhone 11 for €9) about nine months ago, the contract I agreed to was for around €40/month, which was pretty much what I was paying before. But, every month that damn bill would come in and I would be out over €80!!!, and while I'm not obsessive about it I make sure any extra-EU calls (to the UK or the US) are always made via wifi so I couldn't understand why I was still clocking up an €80+ monthly phone bill! Eventually I pulled up my contract online and saw that I was being billed the €40 for my current contract and then another €40 for a different mobile line. So I promptly called them up, sat through God-knows how many \"press 1 for ...., press 2 for ...., para español marque el número ....\" and finally got through to a real person! I explained my problem to her and asked what that other mobile number was and she said it was the additional number that was linked to my previous 4G wifi contract (as opposed to my new ADSL line wifi)! Say what? I mailed that box back to them about nine months ago (which she acknowledged), but apparently since I hadn't actually asked for them to cancel the contract, I was still paying the extra €40/month, even though I didn't have the equipment! Lordy, lordy, while she was very helpful and cancelled the contract there and then, I do feel it's just another hoop you have to jump through so that they can keep billing you. Not that €40 is that much money, but it sure was bugging the hell out of me!I also got a bit of varnishing done in my large bathroom as I was finding that my paint job on the made-to-measure unit chipped rather easily. So now I'm having to empty everything yet again and go over the paint job with varnish I luckily just happened to have in my basement. I'm not doing such a great job but I've come to realize that I really am a \"good enough\" kinda person, so I guess perfectionism really isn't going to be the death of me!Then I got a load of veggie seeds planted and \"housed\" behind the sofa in my very sunny living room and man those things are going wild - they look like triffids at this point! I'm praying I haven't jumped the gun and planted them too early since we really shouldn't plant out here before mid-May because of the risk of frost, so if you don't hear from me ever again it will probably be because I have been murdered by a triffid making it's way upstairs and strangling me in my sleep!In it's day (1962), that was a pretty good film!Then it was time to get the pressure sprayer out, and while I enjoy the actual washing bit, I just hate setting the darn thing up and moving everything out the way, although I have to admit my back terrace looks so much better now - or at least until we get the next sand dump from the Sahara! I also finally got myself booked onto a vegan cookery course at the vegan restaurant up the road. While I doubt I would ever go vegan (vegetarian possibly), the food at this place is just wonderful so I'm thinking it can't hurt to learn how to make some of their dishes, even if they only turn out half as good as in the restaurant!On the exercise front I went to the gym twice last week and added in two machines that I have always liked and cut out one machine which I think is too hard on my knees. And again, the place is virtually empty every time I go so I will definitely sign back up when my contract expires shortly. At yoga lately she has been teaching us the \"Five Tibetans\" postures. While I frankly don't understand much about the theory, they are movements designed to stimulate energy (just as the sap in plants/trees begins to rise again in the spring), and while they haven't been my favourite exercises, I can definitely feel a difference compared to the previous postures we have been working on! But isn't it great when you've go so much to learn that everything is a novel experience!The \"Five Tibetans\" postures (I don't look anything like this)!I also finally got off my backside and took myself down to the lake at Passy for a walk earlier this week - which was just as well because it's piddling down here now and I think they've even forecast snow in the next couple of days!The Mont Blanc!Then on Tuesday night I dropped my car off at Ford for them to take off my winter tyres (ha, ha, there's snow forecast this weekend) and put new summer tyres on. I was bloody lazy though because I could have walked back home in about an hour, but as it was all uphill I chickened out and caught the bone-rattling minibus service back home, on the pretext of figuring out exactly which villages it stops at! When I got there Thiery (the Ford guy) was telling me how busy they are (I thought he looked tired) but they couldn't order any new cars for stock at the moment because most of their steering wheels come from Ukraine! I guess you don't realize how interdependent we all are until something like this happens! On a positive note, I at least managed the one hour walk back down there on Wednesday to pick my car up!My ex arrived from the States on Sunday in time for Charlie's first birthday. He was due in to Geneva at 7.30 a.m. (I bet that pleased André, who definitely likes his sleep), but the flight was delayed and he only arrived at 10 a.m. Still, he got to meet Charlie later that day and he's just as dotty about him as I imagined he would be. Monday was Charlie's birthday (I know, where oh where has the year gone?), so we were all invited over to Jordan and Jen's for a fondue. I stopped in at Maison Janin to buy a couple of desserts and man is that place a gold mine. It was heaving with so many people buying bread, sandwiches, coffee and desserts, I can't even begin to imagine how much money they must rake in in a day!Maison Janin!Things were fine with my ex (who I haven't seen in three years), but to be honest I didn't think he looked too well - although that might just have been jetlag! Charlie is not yet walking - although I sense we're getting closer every day - but man oh man has he got a mouth on him. He's an incredibly happy little boy but the decibels in that room with his \"singing\" were quite something! Still, I'd rather him like that than quiet and subdued!And finally, I went grocery shopping today and since I go to a lot of farmers' markets I generally shop with cash because I would say at least 50% of the stalls don't take card payments. I don't mind at all as I think it's important to keep cash circulating and not go totally digital, but I must have excelled myself today by walking out of there with just two cents left out of the cash in my wallet. Don't spend it all at once right?"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 23 March 2022", "text": "Progress on all the stuff I want to tackle round here is very slow but at least it is making some forward momentum. Jordan had to come back to my place to replace the piping underneath the sinks in the large bathroom as he wasn't happy with it. As he was doing whatever it is he does, he asked what kind of screwdrivers I had because he needed to poke a hole in the one piece of piping, so I suggested he might prefer to use my soldering iron instead! \"You have a soldering iron\"? Ha, yes I do, I bought it the other week because I'm starting in on my annual \"let's grow fruit and vegetables in weird containers\" kick, so I bought it to poke drainage holes in the large plastic jugs/buckets etc. that I'm hoping to use once we can plant outside. Actually I've already got one bucket out in the garden with peas in (I read they're fine to plant out already) and so far they're going great guns. Jordan was actually late getting here because traffic was all backed up on his way through Marignier - which was how he came to tell me that they are laying huge underground piping which will link Marignier to Cluses (about 10 km) in preparation for hooking it up to a kind of power station that will be used to burn trash and supply heat using the generated steam. That's a round about way of saying that they've started an ambitious project to turn our trash into energy, and I think that's great!I've always been interested in \"alternative technology\" and different ways of doing things (hence growing lettuces up my cherry tree in plastic bottles a few years ago (the neighbours brought their friends round to have a look)! Many moons ago, when I was pregnant with André, we went to see family in North Wales and my cousin took us to visit the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth - I found it fascinating. I've just looked up their website and they've obviously made great strides over the last 35 years since my visit so I would love to go again!Centre for Alternative Technology, Machynlleth!Then the other night I was watching Youtube videos on gardening when up popped a video about a lady's fabulous garden in the Ecovillage in Findhorn, Scotland! So of course I had to head over there and take a look and found another great place that I would like to visit sometime. At Findhorn they used to use enormous vats to distil whiskey - I mean seriously huge vats - and some of those vats were turned into living quarters after they had outlived their usefulness in the whiskey business. Imagine that, living in a whiskey vat. I wonder if they have detectors to indicate if you might be running the risk of suffocation by whiskey fumes?Ecovillage, Findhorn!Like the UK, we also got hammered last week by the wind and rain carrying sand from Africa and leaving our cars filthy and my velux windows looking like someone had been stabbed to death on them. I got the car cleaned up pretty easily but the windows are quite another matter and look dreadful still!I also managed to get to the gym twice this past week and thoroughly enjoyed myself. As always, it seems to me if I go in the middle of the day I can pretty much have the upper floor (the weight room) to myself so what's not to like? No hassle and no-one to witness my pathetic efforts!I also went to IKEA, Geneva, twice this week and for someone trying to declutter I guess that doesn't make much sense. Actually I went with Jen and her mom and got to have a good look round at bathroom installations. I think I've made up my mind on the wash basin and unit I want for the smaller bathroom. Jordan told me I can buy what I want at IKEA but not the nuts and bolts because he always says that the hardware in these places is crap and he will provide that stuff or get it from where the professionals get it. I'm happy to oblige as he'll be installing it after all!Since last Monday France has (finally) lifted 99% of its covid restrictions. We no longer have to wear masks everywhere indoors (with the exception of hospitals, etc.) and no pass is required to go to cinemas, restaurants, museums or to sit on a café terrace and have a coffee! Hallelujah, what it feels like to be free! Because of that on Saturday Jen and I were able to go to a bourse in her small town. I've finally figured out that a bourse is like a vide-grenier/car boot/garage sale but concentrating on one particular range of items. In this case it was children's stuff - clothes, toys, books etc., all second-hand, and we came out of there with a fair few items of clothing and books for Charlie for when he's around two years old. Jen had put a few items in the sale and ended up selling for €108 so she was well pleased. But how times have changed! All sellers were given their own identification code, and as each item was sold the seller's QR code was scanned and they could keep track of sales as the day went on. A QR code for a vide-grenier? Bloody hell, they've got QR codes for everything now, haven't they!I was delighted to see that British/Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was finally released from Iran after being held for six years on \"spying charges\". There has since been somewhat of a backlash after she gave a press conference in which she was less than gracious about those that secured her release. Whatever the truth of it all, I have to say she has an absolute diamond of a husband because he has worked tirelessly these last six years to keep her name in the spotlight - even going on hunger strike at one point - so I wish them nothing but good things going forward!Nazanin and Richard Ratcliffe and their daughter!And finally, we had our first board game evening in goodness knows how long last Saturday up at André's place and it was really fun. It gave everyone a chance to see his new place and to meet Charlie, if they hadn't already done so - and we had a really good time!We split into two groups to play two different games as we were just too big a group to play all together. The game we played involved getting your team to say a particular word - first by using as many words as you like to describe it, second time round the table by using just one word, and third time round by miming the word. At one point André was trying to get his team mate, Fabrice, to say the word chevreuil!Chevreuil - a doe!Trouble is, André must have got hold of the wrong end of the stick and ended up doing a wonderful impersonation of an ecureuil - I'm guessing beer may have been involved!Ecureuil - a squirrel!Poor Fabrice, I'm not sure how he was ever going to guess \"doe\" with André doing his award-worthy impression of a squirrel! Somehow that tickled me to bits and I got a severe fit of the giggles afterwards, which was of course infectious and we all ended up roaring! My ex arrives here Sunday morning to meet Charlie for the first time and will be staying with André for three weeks, as he will be on leave. While he's looking forward to seeing his dad they stand a chance of clashing too (his dad can be bloody hard work), but André said if that happens he'll just drive him down to Jordan and Jen's and abandon him, so he's got it all worked out, just in case! Fingers crossed that it all goes well - I'm sure it will!"},

{"title": "Curating stuff!", "date": "Monday 14 March 2022", "text": "I took a short break from the news/social media this week and I have to admit it did me the world of good. I can never stay away too long but a fews days' break seems to do me so much good. Not that the horrid stuff goes away, of course, but it gives my mind a rest to turn it all off, however briefly!The French elections are getting ever closer and I just saw tonight that two of the more prominent candidates have announced an agreement between their parties to try to oust Napoleon. The French have this weird (to my mind) election process where in order to even stand for election you have to have confirmed support from X number of French mayors. Florian Philippot has been out campaigning solidly for about a year now and I like him very much, but he didn't get enough mayoral support and cannot stand. So he has gotten together with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan (who will be running) to forge an alliance based on five campaign promises and they announced it in a large press conference tonight. Of course the other candidates don't get anywhere near the air time that Macron gets, so while I'm afraid it is almost a done deal that Macron will get back in (he has backers with deep pockets), I would love to see Dupont-Aignan make it through to the second round and maybe people would see that there is an alternative to Macron and vote him in! I don't go in for political debates much but those two working together would be my idea of a pretty darn good team!On Thursday I drove André back down to Valence to pick up his new car and he is thrilled with it. It's definitely very nippy and everyone is suitably impressed, but when I filled my car back up with petrol when I got back - ouch! It's now at almost $10/gallon so I would think anyone that doesn't have to do the km will definitely avoid it. I just pity those that can't avoid it, although there is (and has been for some time) a big push to get people car-pooling so maybe some good will come out of this price hike!I finished watching the Netflix series Inventing Anna last week and yet again it kinda blows my mind how seemingly easily some people can fool others! It's the true story (although embellished I would guess) of Anna Sorokin who claimed she was a German heiress and convinced not only friends and acquaintances to fund her lavish lifestyle but also big-name banks. She was 26 when she started her antics in the US and to be honest I didn't feel that the actress pulled it off as she just came across as a rather silly young girl who thought prancing around in a short skirt would make people fall for her lies. Well more fool me, I guess, because that seems to be exactly what happened. Then the other day I watched an interview with the real Anna Sorokin and boy did she come over as an extremely arrogant, smug young woman - you know, with a face you'd just like to punch. More surprising to me is that she was no great looker either. I mean, if she had been some stunning beauty I could maybe have understood the appeal but I guess it just goes to show that if you have the self-confidence or chutzpah to try it, you might just pull it off!Anna SorokinSpring is definitely in the air now and with that come all my grandiose plans for a massive veggie garden - which of course probably won't pan out because I go off the boil too easily. That being said, I'm already watching gardening videos on my computer and just discovered a young English woman called Emma Bailey and am really enjoying her channel. She comes over as a bit dippy and a real giggler but it's such fun to watch her as opposed to the obnoxious Ms Sorokin!Oh and I almost forgot to mention, Jen asked me the other day if she could throw a surprise 30th birthday party for Jordan at my place on 4 June. Of course I said yes, only to find out afterwards that I'll be hosting about 50 people if they all come!!!! Yikes, pray for good weather won't you! She and her friends will organize it all but will need my house and garden to host everyone. So the first thing I did was get myself a child gate to put across the back garage door - which is right next to the rather nasty cellar steps! There will potentially be five or six very young children at the party and those cellar steps have always given me nightmares whenever young children are around. That being said, Jordan and Jen came over on Saturday for Jordan to install my new bathroom sinks. In the meantime I spent my time on my hands and knees chasing Charlie (he's still not walking) and both grandma and Munchkin were exhausted at the end of the day. On the plus side, Jen had Charlie climb down my internal stairs for the first time very slowly on his belly, to a great round of applause when he finally got to the bottom. Judging by the smile on his face you'd think he'd just carried out a moon landing!Having that party lined up means I really want to start getting rid of stuff - I just have way too much of it and the other night I was thinking \"do you really want to spend the rest of your life curating stuff which, for the most part, has no real value to you\"? So you store, dust and curate this stuff and then hopefully one day you will consider it \"done\". But what if that's the day you keel over dead having spent your lifetime curating crap and for what? I don't know, I think it's probably true that as we get older we start to realize we don't need all this stuff and it's really just another millstone around our necks - or am I wrong?I think this hit home even more today as a friend from work sent me a message to ask if I'd heard that H had died in Australia? I hadn't, as it turned out, but H and I were friends, went out walking together occasionally or to the theatre and she and I shared an office for a couple of years in HR. She used to handle the job vacancies and very often people would try to get information out of her about what was going on with a particular vacancy. She was very professional and never discussed it with anyone, certainly never said anything to me about it, but in any case I was never interested anyway. But, I do remember her bursting out laughing one time and she just went \"oh the poor sod\". When I asked her what was so funny she mentioned that an external candidate had applied both for the position of Chief Economist and also for the vacancy for a delivery driver! Not the same skill set I would think but ....!My kids adored H because when they were pretty young they would catch the train from school and meet me in the office to go home and she was always messing around with them. She would rib on them and they would make fun of her appalling French accent because despite many years living in Geneva she never mastered French or the accent for the limited French she did have. She didn't have children of her own (I don't think she wanted them), but was always great fun with the kids. While I wasn't her closest friend we were still good friends and at only a few years older than me it came as something of a shock this morning to hear about her relatively sudden death. As she always said \"it's hard to fly like an eagle when you're surrounded by a bunch of turkeys\"! RIP Chookie, my old mate!"},
{"title": "So silly!", "date": "Saturday 5 March 2022", "text": "My niece just posted on FB a \"Siegfried and Joy\" video filmed in Germany. It is really silly - a kinda \"failed magicians\" gag à la Tommy Cooper, for those of you in the U.K. It was totally daft but it made a me smile, as I have the same juvenile sense of humour as she does! I've mentioned before that I love Gary Larsen. Indeed I bought the complete set of his works about 15 years ago (expensive) and also bought both my sons a set for Christmas 2021. When I told my niece how much her post made me laugh she mentioned The Gods Must Be Crazy film that she'd seen at my place over 20 years ago. She'd loved that so much that she went out and bought it for herself! Gosh I remember seeing that as a new release in Lyon in 1981 and my then boyfriend was on the floor of the cinema laughing. The first 10 minutes I remember thinking \"what the heck ....\" but afterwards it really kicked in and was just so silly. It was a low-budget film originally made in Afrikaans but it was such a success they had to go back and redo it in English. I actually bought the DVD in both English and French (had to get separate DVDs at the time) but I think it's probably on Youtube now too. If you don't enjoy \"silly\", I wouldn't bother, but if you do .... well, it's a hoot!"},
{"title": "Like mother, like son!", "date": "Wednesday 2 March 2022", "text": "André's car finally died a death last week. His dad had actually bought it new in 2009 and André bought it off him when dad moved back to the States in 2015. He loved that car but as he'd put quite a bit of money into it in 2021 I guess even he knew this latest breakdown was one too many. I think it's a 2009 Ford Mondeo Break but I'm not totally sure, and I don't really know the km on it because it had to have a totally new engine about seven years ago because his dad seemingly didn't believe in putting oil in it! Oh well, at least André got pleasure out of it for a few years. He called me middle of last week to say that he'd seen a car that he fancied on France's central database and what did I think of the price? Ha, as if I know anything about what constitutes a good deal! The only thing I told him is not to buy new because I reckon they depreciate about 10% as soon as you drive them off the lot! He told me that he had a zoom meeting with the bank on Friday to see about a loan and in the meantime I pulled up the bank's web page (we use the same bank), and without logging in I used their loan calculator to get a rough idea of how much he could expect to pay. Just to reiterate, I didn't log on to their site, I just used their calculator - as that's relevant to what happened a couple of days later. Anyway, the car he was interested in was in Valence (about 250 km from here) so I told him I would be happy to drive him down there on Saturday if he set an appointment up with the dealer. As the bank approved his loan on the Friday already, he needed to go there on Saturday morning to sign, so we agreed that I would pick him up and we'd head out straight after the bank. I got to his place around 9.30 a.m. and called to say I was outside. So he goes \"so am I\". Me: \"no you're not, I'm by the entrance\". Him: \"yes I am and no you're not\"! Say what? Turns out he'd sent me a text message (to which I'd replied \"ok\") saying that he'd come over to my place on his motorbike and we could leave from here. Ha, I was just about to get in the shower when he sent that message and didn't have my glasses on so I replied \"ok\" to us going together, but hadn't seen or been able to decipher the bit about him coming over here! Oh well, it worked out in the end, he signed the loan paperwork and by 10.30 we were heading out of my village. We'd only gone about 100 metres when my mobile went and although I don't usually answer to numbers I don't recognize, for some reason I stopped and picked this one up, and it was the bank saying that they'd seen I'd been looking at loan calculations yesterday and could they help? Say what? I hadn't logged on to their site and yet they still knew I'd been using their loan calculator! I've always known Big Brother is watching but I really never thought it was that bad! Seriously?Traffic wasn't too bad considering it was a Saturday, and change-over day for the skiers, so when we got to within 50 km of Valence we pulled off at a motorway rest stop to get something to eat and boy was it crowded. André said he reckoned the restaurant should have asked for our vaccine passports but that place was heaving and they wouldn't have had a snowflake's chance in hell of scanning anyone's pass even if they'd wanted too - but nobody tried anyway! We must have been about 50 people lined up one on top of the other waiting to order, and maybe 200 people in there all in all - so much for social distancing right? Anyway, all's well that ends well, André fell in love with the car right there and then and in a few days we will be driving back down there to pick it up. So when I say he's just like me, I mean that we both make our minds up pretty much instantly. Heck he bought his apartment without even seeing it as it wasn't built yet - he just knew he liked the area and the floor plan, and look how well that worked out. And I'm the same, I knew instantly that I liked the house I'm in now, I can pick out shoes/clothes/glasses in about five seconds flat and pretty much tend to always go for the first thing that catches my eye anyway. Actually since I will hopefully be getting my bathrooms started soon (more on that in another post), I've been looking at tiling for the floor and walls and think I know what I'm going to buy already, after looking online for about 30 minutes!What's more we had a really good time driving down there, yacking non-stop about anything and everything and it was great. I felt like I had lost my son to a certain extent at the end of my marriage because although it was my husband laying into me (hell, André would be the one dragging him off me most of the time), I think the fact that his dad would later burst into tears did a number on André and that was where I lost him. He told me once \"you're strong and dad isn't\" and while that's true, I felt it also cost me my relationship with my son as he felt he needed to \"be there\" for his dad. Thankfully that ended when my ex moved back to the States in 2015. Now, though, we have a great relationship and I'm really happy about that!In fact just yesterday he called me to ask where I bought my tea bags as he had run out (the good quality ones we get in the UK, not the crappy Lipton stuff they drink over here). I told him where I buy them but also said he should be careful because if the Brits found out he'd let his stock of tea bags run out they might have to take his citizenship away! You can never be too careful these days! I usually buy them at the Chinese store up the road (they sell everything) and just pick them up when I see them (they're not always available), so I told him I would bring him some over on my way to the gym later. Well, when I got there, the weather was glorious and we ended up sitting on his balcony having a beer and putting the world to rights - as you do - so guess who didn't make it to the gym after all - yeah, me!Talking of unwanted phone calls, I had a call on my mobile today from a Paris number. Like an idiot I picked it up and it was someone trying to get me to set up a monthly donation of €40 to Douleurs Sans Frontières (Pain Without Borders). I guess they're a bit like Doctors Without Borders but I'd never heard of them. Sadly I won't have anything to do with Doctors Without Borders since the day many years ago the then top guy (Bernard Kouchner) crashed his DWB-provided porsche!!!! He may well have co-founded a wonderful organisation, but I didn't like him much to begin with because he was forever falling to his knees \"in distress\" (great photo op) at some of the awful sites he visited and I just found him to be way too theatrical! Shame really, as I'm sure they do wonderful work! Anyway, I digress! As this bird was pushing very hard to get me to set up a monthly donation I told her that as I was sitting in front of my computer I was just going to look up how much their CEO's salary was and I would let her know. I didn't find it out, as it happens, but I told her I have my own preferred local charities (true) and was able to get her off the line eventually! Then tonight I got yet another bloody phone call on my landline at 8.45 p.m.!!! It's a number that routinely calls me without leaving a message, but seriously? They are calling at 8.45 p.m. and think they're going to get a good reaction?And finally, poor Charlie has been sick again. Man oh man has that little boy been hammered during his first year! I know, of course, it's because of the day care but he really does seem to have been through the wringer. Jen managed to get an appointment with an out-of-hours doctor as she thought he had chickenpox, but it turned out to be hand, foot and mouth disease again! Say what? This was what he had when he was about five months old and was seriously miserable - much, much worse than covid, which he just sailed through. And we all thought it was a \"one and done\" but apparently not. Seeing where he got those blisters though (hands, feet, chin and mouth), it was quite obviously hand, foot and mouth again! I went over to help Jen out as the poor little guy was just miserable and wanted to be in someone's arms as much as possible - and then, two days later, he was over it again! The little boy next door also had it (same day care) so the neighbour was going through the same thing at the same time. Still, he's good now and as Tuesday was Carnaval (Mardi Gras) they asked the parents to dress the kids up. You know the character Where's Wally (in the UK), or Where's Waldo (in the US)? Well in France it's Where's Charlie so Jen's choice of outfit for the babe was a no-brainer! Not that he probably could care less, but I'm so glad he was well enough to go back to the crèche on Tuesday as they had a \"special surprise\" for all the children. And since we're all getting together as a family again on Sunday at Jordan and Jen's place for lunch and a board game afternoon, I'm sure there will be plenty of willing arms to spoil him rotten!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Sunday 20 February 2022", "text": "I got a call from the fuel people last week to say that they would be delivering on Wednesday morning \"somewhere between 7 and 10 a.m.\", so I rolled out of bed at 6 a.m. to get showered and dressed so he wouldn't catch me in my jimjams if I was the first delivery that morning! Damn was it cold! When I went outside to move my car so he could pull his truck onto my driveway, it was pitch black and freezing and once again it brought home to me how eternally grateful I am not to have to do that any more to go to work!!!! I always get a quote on the price per litre before they deliver and since fuel is what I would call a \"miscellaneous\" expense (rather than a monthly recurring expense) I keep track of those kinds of bills to know where I stand. But get this, I just so happened to order 1,300 litres of fuel back in June and again ordered 1,300 litres this time. In June my bill was €998 and this latest bill for the same quantity was €1,506!!!! Now I know there's always a price difference when ordering in summer as opposed to in winter but damn, that's a 50% price increase whichever way you look at it!In other news, I had offered to Jordan to start getting the paperwork together for Charlie's US citizenship, since I know Jordan hates this kind of thing and in any case I have the time. When I looked on the US government website how to go about registering him, as I had a question I shot an email off to the consulate in Strasbourg. About a week later I got a response relative to a \"US citizen child who routinely lives outside of the US\" and directing me to a completely different link. I don't think it should be too difficult but they are asking for more information about my ex, as the American citizen grandparent. Well he's supposed to be coming over in March to meet Charlie so I gave Jordan a list of papers to ask his dad to scan before he heads over here. I have a scan of his passport (and maybe also his birth certificate) but as they also ask for proof of periods spent residing in the US I told him to ask his dad to either scan his latest tax returns or go to a notary and get some kind of attestation. My heart always sinks a little when I have to count on my ex to do something because so many times he would screw up and not do it \"because he forgot\" or because .... well who knows why! I used to refer to myself as his chaos janitor (but no more thank God), so I hope he doesn't let us down on this! And talking of family State-side, Jordan was telling me that things are not working out well at all now that the brother, M, has moved back in with grandma. That's no surprise to me, as I mentioned before, but I genuinely feel so, so sorry for her to be dealing with M and having to be his chaos janitor at her advanced age!I must have been on something of a roll because after that I started trying to upload more paperwork onto the new site in connection with my request for French citizenship - and that was a collosal fail! My resident's permit has three different numbers on it and when I try to create an account it doesn't accept any of the numbers. Then when I try to go back into the old system (as they told me I could), I couldn't get any further than where I left off 18 months ago. So I contacted the Prefecture responsible for naturalisation requests and at first they tried to tell me it was because \"my personal situation must have changed in the last 18 months\". When I told them that I had divorced 10 years ago but other than that the only change to my status was that I had to apply for my resident's permit after Brexit, so I didn't really know what else to try. In the end they got back to me and said it was a \"bug\" they were aware of and were working on. I hope that's true because I'm getting nowhere fast right now!On a positive note, Switzerland lifted 99% of covid restrictions on 17 February, the only remaining restrictions still in force being a requirement to wear a mask on public transport and in medical facilities. No problem there! No more having to show a pass to go to the cinema, the restaurant, to a hotel - nowhere! Thank God! France are tiptoeing around possibly lifting a few restrictions on 15 March, but I think the pressure is on now as more and more countries in Europe are doing away with the restrictions altogether. And of course we have elections coming up mid-April so I reckon he will have no choice but to declare that he's personally beaten covid and could we all just go and vote him back into office next month please!Saturday morning I went to the market in St. Pierre as I wanted to try to catch the lady who makes the wicker baskets. As luck would have it she was there so I bought myself a new \"I'm off to the farmers' market\" basket, my current one being 12 years old and starting to show some wear and tear. We got chatting and she was telling me how hard things have been for her during the pandemic as she was not allowed to work for three straight months, so she is another person who will be more than glad when all these restrictions are lifted. After that I met Jen at a vide-grenier (jumble sale) where we picked up a few next-size-up clothes for Charlie for next to nothing. When I got home I decided to walk back into the village to try out our one and only restaurant, which is under new ownership. It used to be called La Fertire, but the (brave) new owners spent a couple of months renovating it, putting in a whole new menu and changed the name to The Variant (!!). Good luck to them. I'm not sure I would want to sink money into a restaurant venture in the current climate. The food was good I have to say and nobody asked me for my pass (although they should have), but I think I prefer the more traditional local cuisine rather than the fancier stuff they are offering. Either way the place was full yesterday lunchtime and I hope it works out for them!Jen's mom drove up north last week to pick up her dad (grandpap) as she had work she wanted doing in her new apartment and, from what Jen told me, grandpap and grandma need \"some time apart\" as they have been getting under each other's skin recently! Grandpap is a pretty sociable chap (unlike grandma, who is - shall we say - \"difficult\") and he very kindly invited us to a restaurant for lunch today so we could all meet up. Despite being way past his nap time, Charlie was an absolute sweetheart, flirting outrageously with a much older lady at the next table and has grandpap absolutely smitten. I tell ya, when the little ones are good it is an absolute pleasure!And finally, I got \"smart\" this week and instead of wasting hours sitting watching stuff on my computer first thing in the morning, I picked out a longer video every day and decided to do some yoga while watching it. I have never been one for \"meditation\" - indeed I usually end up making my shopping list when our teacher tries to get us to \"concentrate\", so it really didn't bother me to do the exercises while watching/listening to a programme. I felt so good after each session that on Thursday I decided to go back to the gym after goodness knows how many months. It must be nearly a year, since first the gyms were all closed during the various lockdowns and then, not having the pass, I wasn't allowed to go anyway. So with some trepidation I went and I loved it. There was just one man downstairs and another man in the weight room upstairs so I virtually had the place to myself. I took my time and started back up with the programme my trainer had set up for me many moons ago. And it was wonderful! I thought I would pay for it the next day but it really was pretty much ok. Oh I had a few aches in the ol' bingo wings, but other than that, nope, nothing, nada! Maybe it's the fact that spring is just around the corner, but I'm hoping/planning to go back again tomorrow and to start going twice a week thereafter. I'm sure it'll do me the world of good after so long. Who knows, maybe I'll be looking like Miss Ernestine by Christmas (but I wouldn't put money on it)!Ernestine Shepherd, aged 85!"},
{"title": "Damn!", "date": "Tuesday 15 February 2022", "text": "Here's me telling Ms Moon the other day how I routinely save posts regularly so I don't lose them, and blow me but I've just written a whole post, saved it repeatedly as I went along when damn we had a power surge and I lost the whole lot!  That'll teach me to be smug, I guess!So what was I saying? Hmm, well not much has been going on here to be honest. We had a glorious week last week but this week is looking to be pretty cruddy weather-wise so I guess spring isn't here yet! Jen and her mom took Charlie swimming on Sunday and he absolutely adored it. Then it was back home to prepare a fondue as they had invited us all over for lunch, followed by a board game afternoon. Everyone reckoned Charlie would be out of it after his swimming date, but not a bit of it. He was tearing around \"playing football\" with his dad and his uncle (I have the sweetest video) until one minute he was there and the next minute he'd crashed! While we were chatting Jen mentioned that Samuel had another race in Beijing that afternoon and while we watched out for him, sadly he didn't make it through to the finals. He's still something of a local celebrity over here and very much a winner in all our minds though! Then Jordan mentioned that Daniel, Samuel's younger brother, had switched rugby clubs recently. Jordan and Daniel had played rugby together since they were little but while Jordan dropped out eventually after one broken collarbone too many, Daniel kept going, proved himself to be pretty talented and has played professional rugby for about nine years now! Apparently he recently transferred from Toulon to premier league, Pau, and, would you believe it, their players earn between €25,000 and €45,000 per month! Yes, per month! And I'm delighted for him! I know a rugby career is not long, all the more so if they get injured, but I'm pretty sure Daniel has his head screwed soundly on his shoulders and will manage that money sensibly!Daniel Ikpefan!I see Macron was doing his statesman bit last week when he flew to Russia to see Putin - who promptly chewed him up and spat him out, as is his want! By all accounts Macron refused to take the Russian covid test, preferring to take one provided by his own doctor, so there were no handshakes, no photo ops sitting side-by-side, and they ended up \"negotiating\" over a table that wouldn't have been out of place in Buckingham Palace!\"Would you pass the salt please darling?\"As I'm pretty much a late bird, I've been getting my money's worth out of my Amazon Prime and Netflix subscriptions lately. The other night I watched The Tinder Swindler, which was a documentary narrated by three rather beautiful young women who were conned out of a lot of money. They never got their money back but the Dutch lady at the end was rather funny and managed to get some small revenge on him, although after spending just a short time in prison for a con committed in Israel, he's now apparently back out running around doing whatever it is con artists do!After that I watched The Puppet Master which, again, depicted the true life events inflicted by another fraudster on totally innocent (but maybe guillible?) young people. Set in the 1970s in England, he told them he was a British agent who had infiltrated the IRA (Irish Republican Army) but they were on to him so he/they needed to go on the run, holing up in \"safe house\" after \"safe house\". Why they felt the need to go on the run when they had done nothing wrong is beyond me, but I guess many of these fraudsters are so good at what they do that people lose all sense of reason! He would have them call family begging for money to \"help him escape\" and literally robbed them of thousands of ££££ and years of their lives. Sadly, he is also still at liberty, vehemently denying he ever did anything wrong!Then last night I finally finished the second series of Succession, and I have to say it has grown on me, after a somewhat bumpy start. I had never heard of Brian Cox but he does a sterling job of playing the domineering family patriarch. I have more of a problem with the prodigal son as the camera seems to be forever panning in to him whispering, stuttering or walking round with a face that looks like a melted candle, but I'll stick with it and watch the third series! So you can see, I wasn't lying when I said there truly isn't much going on here right now!\"Kendal Roy\" in Succession!And fnally I reckon I'm in for an expensive few months. I had a guy come in last week about replacing the three velux windows that are going rotten and I know I have to get a couple of new tyres when I take my car back in to get my snow tyres taken off. Then I realized that I might need to think about ordering more heating fuel as I don't like to let the tank get to less than half full. Ouch, 1,300 litres at today's prices - yeah, ouch! I used to order fuel through a cooperative based out of CERN (the European Nuclear Research agency just across the lake from here - you know, home of the Hadron Collider), but they have closed down their office there so now I order direct from the fuel people, but (hopefully) they are still giving me CERN-cooperative prices. They just called to say that they would be delivering tomorrow morning from 7 a.m. onwards - yikes - so I told her I hoped the driver wouldn't mind letting himself in 'cos I'm pretty sure I'll still be in my pjs at that time of the morning! I guess I'm not used to early morning starts any more, what with all the late night TV I'm watching!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Thursday 10 February 2022", "text": "After a couple of weeks of being lazy as heck, I finally found my \"oomph\" coming back last week, thank goodness. I hate being lazy but I suppose it is winter and maybe it's not such a bad thing to just \"chill\" sometimes. I reverted to my old stand-by of setting the timer on my phone for an hour and it really has helped me get back to being somewhat productive. It's amazing what you can get done in an hour - or even 30 minutes - if you just set your mind to it! So I've been moving furniture (eeww, all that dust) and sorting and cleaning, and while there's still tons to do it feels good to see some progress. Or even just to know that there's progress because I cleaned behind that furniture!!!!Jen told me the other day that she wanted to try and pick her English back up and asked if I would help her. No problem there, although while my grammar is good (our teachers were really strict), sometimes, when it's your native tongue, it's not always easy to explain why you say things a certain way. I also don't have the mind set of a teacher or communicator, but the other day we went through a few exercises and I was able to help her practice. Actually I think she will pick it up more and more as Charlie starts babbling too! She told me that while it can only ever be an advantage for her to speak English, she has been thinking about it more and more because if Macron gets back in and remains hell bent on his \"Great Dictator\" trajectory, they might start giving serious consideration to leaving France - even though that's not what they want to do! How sad is that! She has a couple of months left on parental leave but last week she met up with her director and a few colleagues for lunch. She took Charlie with her for 15 minutes and then Jordan went and picked him up so she could stay longer and chat. Before her maternity leave the unit was supposed to comprise 12 nurses but they were only eight, so already stretched. Two nurses resigned after the vaccine mandate was introduced and of course Jen went on maternity/parental leave, so they were down to just five. Now with the booster being mandated by 15 February, three more nurses are refusing to take it and a fourth is only considering it - so that leaves one nurse out of unit of 12! I guess if this continues she won't even have a job to go back to as they will have to shut the unit - hence the thoughts about leaving France! The irony is that France suspended 70,000 healthcare workers for refusing the vaccine mandate in a field that was already short staffed. Now many more are refusing the third jab so who knows where this is going! The even greater irony is that her hospital has asked staff who have tested positive for covid but are asymptomatic to come in to work! The world has gone totally mad! I certainly don't want them to leave, of course, but the situation in France at the moment is, I guess, just a question of waiting to see who blinks first! On a slightly happier note, both grandmas and André are invited over for a fondue on Sunday, to be followed by a few board games. Jen was telling me that as she is an only child and her mom is an only child, she loves that my family have always been very family-oriented and she wants Charlie to have the same experience (how lovely is that)!Then I was chatting with my friend the other day about maybe taking a few days to go up to that roller coaster/railway in June when it opens and she is totally up for it. There seems to be a lot to do in that area but when I looked at the prices of hotels nearby - crikey - I had forgotten how expensive Switzerland is!!! Still, I haven't been anywhere for three years so who's counting! My friend then told me that she'd been chatting with another neighbour who said that she'd been in her car leaving the supermarket parking lot the other day when a woman tapped on her window asking for directions. The woman drew her attention for a few minutes and then an accomplice (not sure if it was a man or a woman) opened the passenger door and stole her purse!!!! Now I know this has always happened but I would be in big schtuck if my purse was snatched because - money aside - I usually have my passport and resident's permit in there, as well as credit cards and so on. But ladies, we all do it don't we - handbag plonked down on the passenger seat! Anyway, when I went shopping yesterday I just took a bum-bag with me, but I can't say I like it! I guess some people will do anything rather than work though, right?In other news, on 6 February Queen Elizabeth celebrated her Platinum Jubilee - i.e. 70 years on the throne - and I saw a news item that really tickled me. Somewhere (in China I guess), a company had been churning out (unofficial) commemorative mugs, but had unfortunately gotten the English wrong, so now they have a whole bunch of mugs for sale with \"in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jublee\"! Ha, I would love one of those if I can get my hands on one!And finally, when I was over at Jordan and Jen's the other day Jordan asked if I had spoken to his dad lately. I told him that I don't call him but I call Ammy (grandma) a couple of times a year. My ex has a brother who must be around 53 now. He was recognized as (slightly) mentally disabled many years ago and receives a small disability allowance. I'm not sure how well he can read and I know he has difficulties with money and so on, but many years ago, in his 20s, he had a job cleaning at Walmart, social services found him a small place (that he kept spotlessly clean) and he had a social worker to help him manage his finances and other administrative matters. It was a nice little set-up! Now my ex was hot-headed, but this brother was my ex on steroids, so mom and dad had to back away from trying to \"help\" him and let social services take over as he was forever cussing them out and could be very intimidating. Oh they saw him every week and he was invited to all the family get-togethers but they had to let social services handle him and that stinking temper of his. Anyway, one day he (yet again) decided that his manager at work \"wasn't gonna tell him what to do\" and stormed out - and I'm pretty sure he hasn't worked since (so that would be around 20 years now)! Around that time he got together with K (who may or may not have been special needs - I don't know as I never met her), but she had been married and had three grown up kids. Trouble was, M and K can only be described as \"bringing the worst out in each other\" and they ended up moving in with her grandparents as neither of them were working. Then social services intervened and took grandma out of there as the place was filthy (dixit my ex-MIL), so that left grandpa paying the rent and M and K pretty much living in a doss house, spending half their time at the bar or wherever it was they went each day. Anyway, last week M woke up to find that an apparently healthy K had died in her sleep at the age of 53! To say it was a shock would be an understatement, I guess. I don't know what the upshot of it all was but as they weren't married and he didn't get along with her kids I'm not even sure if he will ever know what happened. Anyway, my ex spent all last weekend ferrying M's stuff out of there and back up to grandma's, and man oh man, that is NOT going to work. They have been talking about having him start job hunting, but both grandma and my ex live out in the boonies and M doesn't drive. Eighty-six year old grandma and M living at home together will be a disaster (she once told me she is actually afraid of him), so where does that leave everybody? They have a sister who lives nearer to the city but I'm pretty sure she's not going to want to have M moving in with her and her family either. What a bloody mess! Years ago my ex told me he was \"thinking about having M come over here to France and move in with us so he could 'sort him out'\"! What a joke, my ex couldn't sort his own life out let alone M's. I pointed out to my ex that M had no right of abode in France, no skills, would have no income or health insurance and he didn't speak French so what on earth made him think the French would give him a visa! I also told him straight up that if he tried to bring M over here I would take the kids and leave - so that thankfully put paid to that hare-brained scheme! Hell he was in his 20s, had a job, medical insurance and an apartment and we were supposed to take him away from all that in order to \"sort him out\"???? But again, what a bloody mess! I don't envy any of them trying to deal with him, but I have to admit that I am selfishly so eternally grateful not to have to deal with this new situation!"},

Man I have got to give this a shot (it's not even that far away)! And while I have a valid \"covid pass\" for Switzerland, I've just heard that the Swiss are lifting restrictions on 17 February!

{"title": "Fingers crossed!", "date": "Tuesday 1 February 2022", "text": "I'm still plodding on reading the Robert Kennedy Jr. book at the moment - I'd guess I'm about 75% of the way through it. It isn't an easy read and while some chapters kinda blow my mind, others feel like I'm wading through molasses. But, the reason I bring it up here is because - well I don't know if you remember but when I first mentioned that I didn't intend to get the covid vax it was because I had ended up in hospital after having a violent reaction to a Hep B vax in my 20s. It was so long ago that I actually don't remember if I was in any pain but I do remember that my entire face and body were covered in what looked like blood-filled blisters. They released me from hospital after 24 hours because my boyfriend at the time was a doctor and knew what to keep an eye out for, but to say it wasn't a romantic getaway would be an understatement! When I got back home I spoke to my own doctor about what had happened and he said \"oh, it was probably a reaction to the adjuvant\" (not that I had any idea what an adjuvant was)! Anyway, the upshot of that experience was that I haven't taken a vaccine since. I mention the Kennedy book again here because in the chapter I'm currently reading he mentions that thimerosal (sp?) - which was basically ethylmercury and highly toxic - was used as an adjuvant in the Hep B vaccine (and others) at the time. I read somewhere that it's use was eventually banned in paediatric vaccines in western countries from 1986 (but couldn't find the reference again), and drastically reduced in adult vaccines in the west from 1993. I had my shot in 1983 (as a precursor to my six-month trip around Australia), so I'm now wondering if my reaction was due to mercury intoxication. Huh, makes you wonder right! Either way, it wasn't fun!In other news, I keep getting pop-ups in my email and on my FB page offering special deals for the kind of solos holidays I used to go on pre-pandemic. After spending the evening in Les Gets the other week I realized how much I had missed getting away, and in particular getting away to the mountains in the winter, so I think I might take a look at what is on offer by way of a skiing holiday locally and possibly treat myself to a few days away. Of course the situation here is so up and down with this bloody pass that nothing might come of it, but it's nice to dream a little and maybe look forward to what I should be able to do when this whole pass situation gets dropped - as it will have to eventually. In fact André sent me a message this morning to say that he had had a zoom meeting with work this morning and his Director (who, given his job, should be in the know), was saying that the Swiss are considering dropping the whole vaccine passport issue maybe as early as mid-February. From his mouth to God's ears (and to Macron's - who just thinks he's God)!But talking of Youtube or FB making suggestions based on what you've recently looked at (Big Brother really is watching you, ya see), tonight Youtube suggested a post by a French Canadian who went off on the most amazing rant about Justin Trudeau. The rant aside, by god it was something else trying to follow his accent - I just loved it! I guess I'm more used to French African accents than French Canadian accents, but to listen to a full throttle Quebecois rant tickled me to bits - more for the accent than the content!Then the other night I decided to attack one of my wasgij puzzles (jigsaw puzzle - backwards), so I put on the final series of After Life, for a binge watch. I'm not a particular fan of Ricky Gervais but I kinda enjoyed the first two series. The third (and final) series? I'm not so sure. While I don't mind bad language I just found the crude characters way too vulgar in the last series. That being said, I enjoyed it but think it was right to end it after that! Just my opinion though!And finally, there was an article in the local newspaper this week about Stan's son, Samuel, who will be representing Nigeria in cross-country skiing at the upcoming winter Olympics. I think he was a possible selection candidate for France a few years ago but sadly fell and broke his shoulder, thus putting paid to any chance of competing for France. So Samuel applied for and was granted Nigerian citizenship (in addition to his French citizenship) and will now quite possibly constitute the entire Nigerian team and flag bearer at the opening ceremony. He is a lovely kid (as are all Stan's children), and oh how I would love to see him make the podium. My fingers and toes are crossed so hard I may well freeze in this position and never walk again. Please, please, please - go Sam!"},
{"title": "Could do better!", "date": "Sunday 23 January 2022", "text": "I don't know what's come over me lately but I've been as lazy as hell and I don't like it one bit! I just can't be arsed to do much of anything right now. Oh I cook because I need to eat, and I keep things tidy (enough) but when I consider how much time I have I'm amazed at how little I'm getting done at the moment. I mean, I bought the paint to repaint the bathroom unit (love the colour), but I've only been plodding along at the rate of about an hour a day. I never was one to knuckle down and \"just get the damn thing done\" anyway as I prefer to potter, but to take this long to empty and paint a single unit? Seriously???? My bad habit is to get up and start listening to the news/podcasts while eating breakfast - and then I go down that bloody rabbit hole and before I know it three hours have flown by. So I have to admit I felt like one of the Enigma code breakers at Bletchley Park the other day when I realized I could actually take the computer into the bathroom and listen to podcasts while I am painting!!! I know, it's genius isn't it! I don't know why I've been so lazy lately but I'm hoping I can shake myself out of it soon because there really is so much I could be getting on with. Or maybe it's just that I don't have enough to do. That's possible too. I always preferred it at work when I had tons to do because I believe you get lazy if you don't have enough to do, probably because in my case I'm not particularly driven! That being said, I went and picked up the new, not so exciting sinks for my bathroom and Jordan will come over and instal them when he gets a chance. Actually I wouldn't mind asking him if he wants me to start removing the tiling from around the bath before he takes that out. There's no hurry but the more I can do myself, the less he will have to do when the time comes!For Christmas this year, Jen's mom's boyfriend very kindly bought us all tickets to visit Alta Lumina up at a place called Les Gets (pronounce \"lay jay\"). Well actually he had bought them for last year but what with covid lockdowns and curfews we couldn't go. So yesterday we made up for lost time and the six of us (plus Charlie) headed up to Les Gets for 5 p.m. Now Les Gets is at 2,000 metres above sea level (that's over 6,500 feet) and although the weather has been glorious it was obviously going to be pretty cold up there. It sure was - turns out it was -5°C (23°F) - so I knew I'd have to be careful about what to wear as the visit involved a 45 minute light show outside in the forest. Luckily I hit it just right as I had on really good quality boots and socks, a pair of my ex's old long johns and sweat pants, and then about five layers on top with a heavy duty winter jacket. And it was perfect! Not too hot, not too cold - so much so that I didn't even wear my hat and gloves. We all looked a bit like the Michelin Man, of course, and I'm pretty sure none of us could have blown our noses if we wanted to (because you can't bend your arm at the elbow), but it really was just perfect. I tell you though, with the starting point being at the bottom of a very mild slope, I puffed up that thing just enough to realize that I have to get back out and start walking again - I'm so out of shape! Oh there was heavy snow, I had on layers of clothing and it was uphill and ... - nah, I've got nothing - I'm just out of shape!Jordan had Charlie strapped to his front, obviously all dressed up for the cold with a big blanket over the top and he loved it, although not enough to prevent him from falling asleep by the time we got to the end!They had braziers at the entrance while we waited- and very welcome they were too!The music man setting off in hishot air balloon!When we came out the sky was just spectacular (the photo doesn't do it justice). It was cold and clear and crisp and just so stunning - I wished I knew so much more about the stars. Jordan had an app on his phone so we were able to identify so much but it really is something I wish I knew more about!Afterwards we were all invited back to Jordan and Jen's (so they could put the baby to bed), Jen's mom had very kindly prepared tartiflette (my favourite meal),  and we ended up playing board games until just after midnight. I got home at 1 a.m. and went to bed at 3 a.m. Ha, there's life in the ol' girl yet!And finally, Scarlet I popped over to your blog after you left a comment on here and am I ever pea green with envy at your talent! I wanted to leave a message but I see you have disabled comments. Either way, you are one very talented lady!"},
{"title": "Well that's a relief!", "date": "Thursday 20 January 2022", "text": "A few days ago I received an email from my American friend (who lives here in France), sending me a copy of yet another article on just how safe these covid jabs are. Now I know she did this from the goodness of her heart but the difference between where we stand on this issue is actually a chasm. She was lining up to get her third jab and I'm bound and determined never to get the first. Anyway, poor M, she caught me on a bad day!My kids are getting more and more pressure from so-called friends to get jabbed, despite the fact that they both recovered from covid at the end of November. Jordan's boss is not only his friend but they play in the same band together (they've known each other since they were about 15), but even he keeps making snide remarks about getting jabbed (he has also made other more crude remarks about Charlie's paternity - by way of a joke - but if I get my hands on him making that kind of \"joke\", I will rip his balls off)! Anyway he must have made one \"joke\" too many at band practice the other week because André hauled back and ripped into him. He told him EXACTLY what he thought of him and what a louse he thought he was when we all had covid. OK, nobody cares about the adults - we're all adults and we made our choices - but André let Max know EXACTLY what he thought of him as a so-called friend who couldn't even be arsed to call Jordan to find out how his seven-month old baby was after catching covid (perfectly fine, as it turned out, but Max didn't know that)! And with that, André walked out of practice. So yeah, you might say there have been a few tensions building up!Then André was telling me last night that his friend spent 15 hours at the hospital last weekend with his gf - who is obese, a former drug addict (so not in the best of health) and who also has lupus. They spent 15 hours at the hospital after a lupus flare up and when André called to find out how she was his \"friend\" managed to call André a c*nt for not being vaccinated! Oh he knows it was tiredness and pressure, but André hasn't seen them for about six weeks and they live in Geneva, so André wasn't sure how it was his fault that the gf ended up in hospital. And as he said, anyone without a pass sanitaire has been unable to go anywhere these last six months so how the hell are we the ones spreading this virus?Anyway, all that to say that when my friend sent me that article I blew a gasket and drafted a \"both barrels\" response. Thankfully I toned it right back down but to say it was direct would be an understatement. And I felt terrible after I sent it, but I also had no intention of recalling it - a \"let the chips fall where they may\" kinda thing! Oh I knew I would calm down eventually and in any case I had every intention of contacting her on Sunday before she goes into hospital on Monday for a hip operation. Anyway, she just contacted me to say that my email had gone into the trash folder but \"message received\"! And I felt like a real heel! So I wrote back to her and said that she should have left it in the trash folder, because that was where it deserved to be. I told her I didn't apologize for the content as I always say what I mean, but my diplomacy (or lack thereof) would probably have scored me a 1/10! I told her that I apologized for letting her have it with both barrels (even though watered down), I wished her good luck for Monday and promised not to ever write again when I'm fired up. And just like that we're friends again (although she was probably always too gracious to fall out over something like that). Just me being an asshole, I guess. I will always apologize when I'm in the wrong - rarely for content because I don't write or say things I don't mean - but I could definitely have done better on that one!"},
{"title": "Wow, it's started!", "date": "Wednesday 19 January 2022", "text": "I'd heard quite some time ago that legal challenges were being prepared in connection with the handling of the covid situation - the vaccine mandates, mandatory mask-wearing, pcr tests, vaccine passports, etc. Reiner Fuellmich is one of the many prominent lawyers who has been working round the clock on these cases. In an interview he gave while in Poland last year he stated that legal proceedings had already been filed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (the German-speaking European countries), but indicated that there were obviously many, many more challenges being filed. More recently groups from four European countries filed with the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Three of those were apparently rejected on technicalities, but the British case was accepted on 6 December and therefore given a file number. (On a side note, Dr. Mike Yeadon, former VP and Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer is one of the signatories to the complaint - I believe it's 44 pages long)!As I understand it (and this is just my understanding), by virtue of the fact that they have a dossier number from The Hague, the British complainants were able to take their evidence to the British police where they now have a UK dossier number, and are therefore \"requiring\" that all vaccination centres in the UK be shut down immediately and treated as crime scenes. There are videos already on the internet of citizens taking this information either to police stations or vaccination centres in order to have these centres closed down and the vaccines seized as evidence. I think this started around 15 January so I guess it will have to come out in the press sooner rather than later - they can't keep it hidden forever!  There are already quite a few videos online if you are interested, but they all have a prepared script, giving the UK and International Criminal Court dossier numbers and the complaints contained therein. I guess we'll have to see how this pans out! https://www.bitchute.com/video/3tuVcmlNJiS4/"},
{"title": "Last man standing!", "date": "Sunday 16 January 2022", "text": "Crikey, what a week it's been! As was expected, my favourite neighbour's mom died about 10 days ago. She was 93 years old and it was, as I say, expected, but the sad thing is she died a day or two before my neighbour got there. While I guess these things happen, I'm sure relations next door won't be improved one iota by the fact that they had to wait to leave until after a doctor's appointment for him, since, as I've mentioned before, he walked out of the hospital before his operation last time because he was \"pissed off at having to wait\"!I then heard that the farmer had also died (pancreatic cancer). I only found out after the funeral but I would have gone if I had known. He was definitely \"a character\". His son died about four months ago and never had any intention of taking over the farm anyway, so I'm assuming the girls will sell up. I thought I saw him about 10 days ago, but it was obviously someone else taking care of the animals. I don't know what will happen but I already miss the sound of the goat bells in the upper field and, of course, the beautiful donkeys in the field at the back of my house!After that I heard that a former colleague of mine had died at the age of 78. She had been ill for a few years, so again it was expected, but I do remember her fondly as I took over her job in HR when she retired and had nothing but respect for her professionalism. A funny story she told me - although not funny at the time - she was English and married to an Italian from Naples. One time when they went to Naples to see family, they were staying in a hotel and as it was hot they had the window cracked just a little. When they woke up the next morning they found they had been robbed during the night! Apparently the thieves had pumped sleeping gas into the room through the crack in the window and must have had a small child go in and take their valuables! The police reckoned they were followed to the hotel since they had Swiss plates. You would have thought, being a native, that he would have known better about sleeping with the window open, but she said it was a hard lesson well learned!Then my friend sent me a FB message regarding her return trip from Spain today (I was to pick her up at the airport) and told me that her cousin in England had just been found dead at home at the age of 60. They were thinking it might have been a diabetic coma but the family have asked for an autopsy so that they can be sure. I didn't know him, but 60 still seems young to me to be dying so suddenly! Anyway, my friend had a PCR test booked for the day before her flight and wouldn't you know it but it came back positive - despite the fact that she had no symptoms whatsoever! So flight cancelled, pick-up cancelled and she's stuck in Spain for at least the next 10 days, not only because of having to isolate but also because it will depend on when she can get a flight out. Mind you, being \"stuck\" in Spain doesn't strike me as such an awful thing to have to endure, although having to isolate would be a pain. On the positive side, she and her sister own their home over there so she won't be running up horrendous bills, except for extending the cat's stay in the cattery!Moving swiftly on, Jordan showed up at the depot for work last Monday to find no-one there to open up. Max has been off for a while as he broke his arm skiing and as Jordan waited for his brother to show up, he found out that A, the brother, was also off sick after throwing up violently all night (it only lasted a day though). So that left Jordan stuck with no way to get into the depot or load up the van. The two apprentices were also off with covid - one quite seriously (although better now), and the other just a mild case, like Jordan's, so Jordan was well and truly on his own. When Max's dad showed up to open up they had already agreed that Jordan needed to have a key to the depot and they are apparently getting him his own van - so some good news came out of it. On the down side, instead of asking him to head to the site near me where he has been working for a couple of months, Max asked him to go to the Chamonix site as it was more urgent. Jordan told me he had no idea what he was supposed to be doing up there so he just picked up the jack hammer and started \"jackhammering\"!Also last week Max's gf 's dad had to be helicoptered off the mountain when he'd been out skiing (turns out he had injured his back - hence the helicopter, but it was not as serious as initially thought), and then the gf broke her own arm while out skiing - this being the young disabled woman in a wheelchair. I know, she goes skiing???? More power to her but I'm sure she could have done without breaking her arm! So Max and his gf only have one pair of hands between them at the moment. Somehow I don't think I'll be going skiing much in the future, and for good reason!I stopped in to see the Munchkin this week and he was on fine form, but when I left there it was already starting to get dark and the fog was horrendous! As I got up nearer to home I was so grateful that I knew the roads because I could barely see 10 feet in front of me. No street lights, winding mountain roads and even a couple of idiots out running - wouldn't you think they'd wear reflective jackets if they wanted to stay safe????On the positive side, I finally got an email from the French authorities for me to upload the rest of my documents regarding my citizenship request - just 30 months after I started! So I had a look at it this afternoon as I already have all the documents, but bugger me if my bloody scanner has stopped working. After a couple of hours doing other stuff I decided to just give up for today and then luckily googled \"the best scanning app to download onto an iPhone\". And that was when I found out that iPhone has a handy little app buried in the \"notes\" section that allows you to scan documents into your notes and save them. Old dog, new tricks I guess!And finally, after the horrible fog we've had, this weekend has been just beautiful, so Jordan and Jen decided to take Charlie on his first sledding outing with their neighbours, who have a little boy about six months older than Charlie. The weather was glorious, the skiing crowds haven't started to arrive yet and Charlie and his buddy had a whale of a time!Charlie's hidden under a huge snow jacketand of course his orange binky!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Saturday 8 January 2022", "text": "Things on the home improvement front look like they might be starting to move around here. By that I mean that hopefully I'll be able to start working on my bathrooms soon, as goodness knows they're in dire need of a facelift/total makeover! I found out the other week that Jordan had bought himself tools in order to do a side job that weekend for a friend. He was always up for working side gigs but as a plumber you need tools to fit every eventuality and while he can borrow some from work if Max and his brother aren't using them, if you have to buy them yourself they are expensive when you're starting out! Anyway someone had asked him to move a couple of radiators and I think it bought home to him how much more money he can make working for himself than working for Max. He's happy enough working for Max and has learned an awful lot, but as a trained plumber/heating engineer he knows there is so much more work for him out there if he wants to work for himself. Goodness knows people are crying out for tradesmen! So I asked if he would come with me to pick out a couple of bathroom sinks for my larger bathroom and install them as a way to make a start on the bathroom renovations. I figured the large mirror above the sinks could stay, and as the unit was made to measure I would keep it - it just needed repainting. Unfortunately I'm going to have to stick with more or less the same sinks as I already have if I don't want him cutting into the made-to-measure unit, so I ordered them and then went out and bought a lovely charcoal grey paint for the unit. It is already such a great improvement over the insipid grey/pink colour it was before, I wonder why I didn't do it 10 years ago! We figured he would take out the bath in the large bathroom and install a douche italienne (an \"Italian shower\"? - a large, doorless, walk in shower), then get rid of the shower in the smaller bathroom, replace it with a hand basin and install a new toilet that doesn't look like it's seen service on a building site for 10 years. With that I'm good to go - all I need is a tiler! I had a couple of names/recommendations and apparently the young Kosovan tiler that did work for my neighbours is up for it so it looks like things might finally start to move on my crappy bathrooms!Talking of my neighbours, Jordan asked me if I would watch Charlie for a few hours this afternoon as he wanted to go to band practice and Jen was helping her mom clean the house she has just sold before she hands over the keys. Of course it was a pleasure to have the Munchkin as he really is an easy (and fun) baby to have around. I had shovelled snow and put down salt earlier today as we'd had quite a snow fall last night, and I was watching out the window for them to arrive when I spotted a wisp of cigarette smoke coming from by my neighbour's front door. So I leaned out the window and told her that I'd spotted her but not to worry as I wouldn't tell anyone. This is my favourite neighbour (with the \"difficult\" husband), who had quit smoking three years ago when she ended up hospitalised with pneumonia. For some time now she's been back to smoking a couple a day \"when she's stressed\" so I asked if everything was all right. Turns out it isn't because her mom is 93 and they just called from the nursing home 800 km away to say that they might want to get there sooner rather than later because they felt the end was near. So she's packing and wanting to set off immediately but they can't go until Wednesday because her husband has medical appointments this Tuesday. Turns out he finally got his legs operated on on Monday (after messing the hospital around on more than one occasion and walking out the last time before they could operate because he was pissed off at having to hang around when the surgeon got delayed)! Yeah, that guy! Well he went in on Sunday, was operated on on Monday and called his daughter to come and get him Monday afternoon, without waiting for the doctor's go-ahead! Thankfully she told him off as there was no way he was leaving hospital yet again \"against medical advice\" and said he would just have to wait until the next day and the all clear from the surgeon! Then he apparently found out on Tuesday morning that he was cleared to leave and called his wife at six in the morning to come and get him! The guy is nuts, because even if he knew at 6 a.m. that he was going home that day he would still have to wait until the admissions office opened up later to do the necessary paperwork. But how selfish is that anyway, to wake someone up at 6 a.m.? The more I think about it the more I guess he was so used to being \"important\" at work all those years that he seems to think he's still important, when in fact he's just another nobody like the rest of us!Jen came to pick Charlie up around 5 p.m. and after he had eaten she was getting his stuff together when there was a knock at the door and it was my neighbour (the wife) asking if Jen could move her car as they were going out (Jen's car was sticking out slightly). So Jen said to just \"give me a minute while I get Charlie's coat on\" and my neighbour said \"well the sooner the better because he's getting pissed off as he wants to leave right now!\" Wow, now I knew this wasn't her being difficult it was him. They were only going over to their son's for a visit so an extra minute or two was neither here nor there while Jen got the babe ready, but nope, there he was sitting in the car revving the engine making his point (whatever that was)! And this from the guy who routinely parks in my driveway in front of my garage!!! I was pissed off at first but then I just thought \"oh to hell with him, he's just a miserable man who can't deal with no longer being king of the dung heap\"! Sad though, isn't it, but at least I don't have to live with him!Maybe I'm so zen because I went back to yoga on Monday for the first time in seven weeks (what with missing classes because of catching covid and then the Christmas break). I tell ya, by the time I walked out of there I was going to sell up and move to an ashram, that's how great I felt after what was, to be honest, just a namby-pamby warm-up class! Even if I never feel like going beforehand, I'm so glad to be back at class!You may or may not have heard, but Macron is turning the screws even more now as he intends to swap the pass sanitaire for the pass vaccinal on 15 January. What that means is that we are moving from having a valid pass by virtue of being (now) triple-vaxed, having a negative covid test or having recovered from covid (so that's me), to them only accepting triple-vaxed and no longer accepting the negative test, although those of us that have recovered from covid within the last six months still get to keep the pass. It's madness because to my mind, if you are going to force people to show a pass to go anywhere (sieg heil, Mr. Macron), (say, to a restaurant, or a bar, or a café, or a library, or a cinema, or .....), surely it would be better to have to show a negative test rather than proof of vaccination, which frankly proves nothing? When they introduced this legislation some bright spark (the Prime Minister) stated that not only did you have to show the pass vaccinal to enter a bar, but you could not stand at the bar and have a drink, you had to sit down - because apparently the virus only circulates over four feet off the ground. Also, you are no longer allowed to eat or drink anything on long-distance transport, nor will you be allowed to eat or drink in the cinema! I guess you can imagine the memes that have been flying round after that one! Anyway, not having the pass is the reason I haven't been to a restaurant (or anywhere else) in about six months, but then of course it was possible for all that to change (not that it did) once I recovered from covid and got the pass. That was how I was able to meet with friends in a restaurant in Geneva just before Christmas. Not that the restaurant owner asked for my pass but at least I had it! Anyway, André asked me if I had downloaded the Swiss app before I went to Geneva and when I said no he said \"well you ought to\", because when I downloaded the Swiss covid app and uploaded my French \"recovery from covid QR code\", I see that in Switzerland it's valid for a year!!! And I'm tickled pink because while my French pass is valid for six months (or probably even less time in the future once they start pushing the fourth jab on people after three months), the Swiss recognize natural immunity for a year! But please God tell me we won't still be on this merry-go-round a year from now!!!Pre-covid, I would very occasionally meet up with friends in Geneva for lunch (about once a month) and went to the cinema there to watch a film in English maybe twice a year - if that - but since I have been a social leper for the past six months, and haven't been able to go anywhere, I subscribed to Amazon Prime and Netflix - and I honestly don't see why I would bother going to a cinema in Geneva again, paying $25 a ticket, when I've been able to watch whatever I want for the past six months for about $15/month!And finally, talking of movies, I started watching the new Leonardo di Caprio movie, Don't Look Up, the other night. My first thoughts were \"oh this isn't for me\", but when I read the background to it I realized just how clever it really was (I should have known, what with it being directed by Adam MacKay)! It's about a pair of astronomers/scientists who discover that a massive meteor, capable of destroying the entire planet, is headed for earth and how they desperately try to get the powers that be to take action. It's got an all star cast with Meryl Streep not being particularly stretched to play a US president who seems to be only \"in it for the glory\", and Jonah Hill as her equally disinterested Chief of Staff. The cast were all brilliant, of course, but for me Mark Rylance playing Peter Isherwell, the insane, megalomaniac tech billionaire with dollar signs for eyes, well he just stole the show. As I say, if you believe it, it's a metaphor for a massive catastrophe coming to destroy the earth, with the brave scientists trying to get everyone to put their damn phones down and \"look up\" to see the danger they are facing, while the powers that be are holding rallies with the slogan \"don't look up\" so they can pull a fast one on everyone while making themselves richer and richer! I won't give away the ending but it was very clever and I actually ended up quite enjoying it. A clever plot, great acting and a not-so-subtle metaphor!"},
{"title": "Happy new year!", "date": "Friday 31 December 2021", "text": "I've been off-line for a few days (like most of us, I suspect) as there were things that needed doing, like family to see and food to eat, but first of all I'd like to thank all the lovely lady bloggers who sent me Christmas cards. It's such fun to get a Christmas card from half way around the world (mine were all from the US this year), but to those who received cards from me, I have to apologize for my handwriting. I think we started learning beautiful cursive writing pretty young - and then somehow someone forgot lesson two! Oh I write in cursive of course (I'm not that bad) but I have to admit my hand-writing is dreadful, so sorry about that!Christmas Eve we had a small \"raclette evening\" at Jordan and Jen's (which I suspect will be where most of their festivities will be held while the babe is so small). There were only six of us plus the babe and it was really nice. After dinner we played a board game (can't remember the name), but I have to admit that I tend to zone out a bit after a while so I usually offer to take care of the babe (well that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it)! It's hard to explain but we obviously play games in French so it can be a bit like asking a French person to mime \"Cheech and Chong\", or an American to mime \"Eric and Ernie\" (or anyone non-French to mime \"Louis de Funes\" - you have to have been brought up in the culture), so I guess you can see why my mind tends to wander. Or maybe we should stick to card games - now there's a thought! That being said, I used to zone out a bit playing Trivial Pursuit when I lived in the States because I know bugger all about baseball or American football (or Cheech and Chong, for that matter). Anyhoo, one time I decided I was going to cheat next time so spent a while memorising questions and answers for \"the time when\". Anyway, I can't remember what the question was now, but I remember the answer was Sandy Koufax - and I almost gave my father-in-law a coronary when I gave the Koufax answer to a question about baseball!Getting home that night wasn't much fun though as it had frozen pretty hard by the time I left (the parking lot was dreadful) and I wasn't looking forward to the drive home. Basically you can go one way round the mountain through a place called Findrol (which is an accident black spot even on a good day), or you can go \"the other way\" down the Giffre valley which is well known for accidents involving deer and wild boar! Well actually you can go over the mountain past André's place but that goes back down the mountain on the side of a ravine so I decided to give that a miss! It seemed to me that everyone was taking it carefully on the way home though and thankfully I didn't run into any \"strays\". Once I got back down to Bonneville it was back up another mountain again to where I live (and where, again, you have to look out for the animals). There was a guy behind me most of the way from Bonneville to home and I thought I was holding a good speed, but when I got to my turn off point he blasted his horn and yelled something which I'm pretty sure wasn't Merry Christmas so I reckon I might have been driving a bit too slow for him, don't you (although that could just be female intuition)! Still I did get a little schadenfreude when the eejit hit a spot of black ice about 100 metres away and bounced merrily over the sidewalk a couple of times until he managed to get the car back under control!Christmas Day was at my place and again there were just five of us plus the babe. I can't believe he's already nine months old and has had his first Christmas! I kept my kids' high chair all these years but when I dragged it up from the basement to clean it I couldn't find the table part for love nor money! I know I wouldn't have thrown it away and just kept the chair but .... Still, it worked out well enough as it was the perfect height for him to sit at the table with us and throw green beans around with gay abandon! Of course presents meant nothing to him but he got an awful lot of pleasure trying to eat the wrapping paper and any empty box he could get his hands on! I thought Jen was very good though because she made a point of saying that she really didn't want him to be spoiled (neither do I) and how did we feel about giving just a few presents in future and sewing gift bags instead of buying wrapping paper? I'm all for it - though I'm not sure how Jordan and André feel about the \"sewing\" part!The next day Jen sent me a notice from their local Mairie. Apparently there had been a very strong smell in the surrounding area and along the river Giffre that had entailed around 100 firemen being called out looking for a gas leak, so they called André and asked if they could move in with him for a couple of nights if necessary. I told André they could come here but he'd have to have Leni the Horrible Cat! It wasn't necessary in the end but the smell did linger for a couple of days and everyone was asked to check their fuel tanks for a possible leak. I'm not sure what happened but I think it's been sorted now (or at least I hope so)!Jen's mom very kindly invited me to her new place (she moved in two weeks ago) to spend NYE with her and her boyfriend, Fabrice, as she didn't want me to be alone. I thought it best to be honest and thanked her for her invite but told her that I genuinely dislike NYE and dislike being on the roads even more. That's when she said \"but my friend Niko will be here too\" and the dreadful thought occurred to me that she might be trying to set me up with Niko. Ehhhh, no thanks. I've met Niko and I'm definitely not interested, any more than I'm interested in being set up with anyone, thank you very much! So I'll be spending NYE all on my lonesome (and very happy about it too), while Jordan and Jen are having a couple of friends over and André is going to a friend's in Geneva and spending the night!On another note, I'm now 14 lbs down (and very happy about it) as I still haven't really got my sense of smell or taste back. I had to laugh on Wednesday when I went grocery shopping because I walked out of the shop having paid just €14 for my groceries (I usually spend around €100), but nothing seemed to appeal to me. I'm guessing I'll start putting weight back on soon enough and goodness knows I'd like to be interested in cooking again, but in the meantime bread and cheese seems to be the extent of my culinary expertise at the moment. Mind you, I'm sure Weight Watchers is probably an infinitely preferable alternative to weight loss from catching covid! And to think of all that walking I did and got absolutely nowhere with the weight loss (1,200 miles in 2021 - definitely needs improvement)!My nephew sent me an email the other day (after I'd been whinging about the state of British politics) giving me the name of a book - whose author he knew slightly - and which was quite a best-seller, telling me that it might give me a better understanding of just how dire all three political parties now are in the UK! I'll have to look it back up again when I've finished my current read!Wow! I've almost gotten a repetitive stress injury from bookmarkingpages and I'm only on chapter 3!The book is hard-going and a bit like wading through molasses but occasionally I like to really get my teeth into something like this. I had hoped to get it in hard copy but apparently it's only sold in electronic format because at the end of each chapter there's a \"QR code\" where you can update your copy for more up-to-date information!After a couple of hours of wading through that I decided I needed something a bit more light-hearted (ya don't say!) and ended up watching Being The Ricardos - the Lucille Ball/Desi Arnaz story - and I really enjoyed it. Man, they were a firey couple, but so well-suited - when they weren't scratching each other's eyes out. For some reason many people don't seem to like Nicole Kidman but I thought she was very good, and as for Javier Bardem (who played Desi), well that man could just stand there and not say a word and I'd be happy - but he actually can act!And finally, I was chatting with my sister on Christmas Day and we got to talking about just how hard mom had it on Christmas Day (in particular) and wondering how on earth she managed with all those kids, that tiny kitchen, three pots and pans basically, and no appliances! We had a good laugh but I had to ask her if she thought maybe we were glorifying the past and oddly enough she said \"no, I don't think we are. We were much poorer but I actually think we were maybe happier\"! And I tend to think she was right!So on that note, I'll wish you all a happy new year and hopefully 2022 will be kinder to us all!"},
{"title": "Time to change jobs?", "date": "Monday 20 December 2021", "text": "I got an email this morning from the Direction Nationale de la Gendarmerie in Paris because apparently I'd been \"caught looking at child pornography\" on my computer. They kindly gave me 72 hours to respond to their email with all justification as to why they shouldn't go ahead and prosecute me! I guess it makes a change from the widow of the former Director of Finances at the World Bank in Ouagadougou who wants to put $10 million in my bank account right? I know I shouldn't, but more and more I write back to these jerks and tell them exactly where they can shove a cactus - and then I block them! I guess it might get me into trouble one day if I fire that off to the wrong person, but since I've never looked at child pornography I'd guess I'm pretty safe on this one! Which reminds me of my brief foray into online dating in 2010 after my husband left (and yay me, I'll be divorced 10 years next week)! As a woman of a certain age you do tend to get some guy who looks like a gorilla sending you his picture with the caption \"I'm just what you need\"! I guess they think all divorced women over the age of 50 are just gagging for it, right, and while it never happened to me I knew of other women who received unsollicited dick pics. An Irish friend of mine replied to one such gem with \"that looks like a penis, only smaller\", but I did see a text message which I thought was pretty good and saved just in case - although thankfully that never happened to me! Still, if it could get rid of World Bank widows and accusations of looking at child pornography I'm up for most things!Oh and I meant to write about the North Shropshire by-election last week but somehow it slipped my mind. Wow and just wow! The Tories (Conservatives) have held the North Shropshire seat for almost 200 years so I guess you could say it was considered a safe Tory seat - until now! It came up for grabs when Bojo's crony, Owen Paterson, had to step down in a cash-for-influence scandal and I guess the Tories were so confident it was a safe seat that they ran a candidate who wasn't even from the local area and didn't know anything about it. So the seat went to the Liberal Democrats with a fairly convincing majority - and the Conservatives are running pretty scared, what with all Johnson's screw-ups in the last few weeks/months/forevers! Not that I think it will make much of a difference in the long run because there seems to be no front-runner candidate to replace Johnson - and no real opposition from either the Labour Party or the Lib Dems! God helps us, but it's the same thing here in France. Macron has not, as yet, declared as a candidate for next year's Presidential election and yet the other night he was on TV for over two hours patting himself on the back so hard for all his \"achievements\" he almost dislocated his shoulder - a move that pissed off the declared candidates because as a candidate they are all bound to have an equal amount of air time - and yet Macron, as an as yet non-candidate, is getting to use the airwaves as long as he wants! The elections will take place in spring but I have no real hope that we will get rid of him. I think it will be either him or his female clone, Valérie Pecresse, that will get in because they've got the big money behind them. It's sad as there are other candidates (and I know who I would vote for if I only had a vote - which I don't), but I suspect they won't be able to counter the deep pockets of Macron's backers! It's just awful to think we might be looking at another five years of more of the same - or even worse!And finally, I met André at Ford this afternoon as he was dropping off his car to get winter tyres put on. When we got back to the house he told me that he'd just learned that yet another colleague had dropped dead last week of a sudden heart attack!!!!! Wow, if people were unsettled before I can only begin to imagine how they are feeling right now! Time to look for another job maybe?"},
{"title": "A brief period of being almost normal!", "date": "Sunday 19 December 2021", "text": "I posted some time ago how a pass sanitaire was introduced into France about six months ago allowing unfettered movement only to those who had been double-vaxed, those who could show a negative PCR test less than 72 hours old, or those who had recovered from covid within the last six months. This pass was supposed to be in place until 15 November. Well we all know how that works because - in no particular order the pass was extended until 31 July 2022 (beyond the mandate of the current president????), the PCR test validity was cut back from 72 hours, to 48 hours and now stands at 24 hours and \"fully vaccinated\" is now taken to mean triple-vaxed (or however many more shots can be inserted into the definition of \"fully vaccinated\" before this house of cards comes tumbling down)! Those without the pass are not allowed into restaurants, bars, cafés, theatres, gyms, museums, on long distance transport or into hospitals for routine medical appointments! Hold on to that last bit as this is important because of what follows!I went grocery shopping on Monday and bumped into J, who used to be the sewing teacher about five years ago when I joined sewing club. I think she's 78 years old - in any case, nearer 80 than 70 - and after I'd pulled my mask down so that she recognized me, we got to catching up on how she/we'd been over the past five years. I always liked J as I think she is a kind, gentle soul (who liked to practice her English on me)! Anyway, she remarked that I'd lost weight so I told her I'd not long gotten over covid and had lost my appetite, and that was when she told me she'd recently gotten over covid too, even though she'd been double-vaxed. Turns out she had pretty much the same experience as I did in that, while it wasn't pleasant, it really was no big deal and other than the tiredness, the symptoms were pretty much done and dusted in about four days. Then she told me that she had lost weight, though not because of covid, but because she had been having problems with her oesophagus and the doctors wanted her to go to the hospital in Thonon for more tests. She told me she was afraid it might be cancer as her throat kept closing up - but wanted to avoid her mind going down that rabbit hole if possible, as she was really worried!Anyway, about a month ago this government, in its wisdom, decided that \"fully vaxed\" for anyone over 65 would now mean two shots and a booster before 15 January, otherwise the pass sanitaire would be deactivated! So everyone 65 and over was \"invited\" to get their booster shot and while initially it had to be done no more than six months after the second shot, it was then brought down to no more than five months after the second shot, and has now been brought down to no more than four months after the second shot! Oh, and that \"invitation\" has now been expanded to include anyone over 18! The last figures I saw showed around 400,000 people over the age of 65 had \"politely declined\" the government's invitation to get the booster shot since they were told \"two and done\" and are not at all happy to hear that \"two and done\" never actually meant that! This third mandatory shot seems to be making a fair few people rethink their stance on this issue, but who knows what they will decide to do in a few weeks' time - I honestly don't know!Anyhow, back to J. She was telling me she does not want to get the third shot because she was so ill after the second, so I said but \"if you've recovered from covid your pass is valid for at least another six months anyway\"! Not so, apparently, since the third, booster shot apparently trumps the fact that she has recently recovered from covid! So all that is to say that she cannot go for the tests she needs at the hospital without that booster shot - oh and because the powers that be have now decided that they will no longer accept PCR testing either! Damn those bastards, what is this, Nazi Germany where you have to show a pass to see a doctor? This lady played by the rules and she is still being screwed over by being denied treatment because of decisions made by Pinnochio and his henchmen! At this she started to cry so I leaned over and hugged her - I mean, what else could I do? So now I'm fully expecting the Thought Control Police to be tracking me down via cc-tv for \"intimate contact outside my mind control bubble\"! Sorry folks, but can you see why I get so mad!!!!Actually it will be interesting to see what happens with the \"recently recovered\" (which would include me) and the pass sanitaire! I mentioned before that my neighbours got covid around the same time as I did. The kids (16 and 19) sailed through it, the husband never contracted it, and Isa had pretty much the same experience as I did. I took a parcel in for them the other day and she was saying she was happy that she could put off getting her booster shot now that she'd got the \"recently recovered\" pass, but since she's in the same situation as J, above, I'll be curious to see how the overlords treat her!Another lady from sewing club's partner is much older than her and recently contracted covid also (she never got it), so I called to find out how he was doing. She laughed and said after his 10-day self-isolation he had gone off cross-country skiing as he was just fine (thank God)! So there you have it, a group of people who have all recently had covid and, for us anyway, we've all had the same, fairly mild experience (all the others were vaxed, I would add)! I actually don't know whether I had Delta or Omicron, but if it was Omicron hopefully it might prove true that while Omicron is pretty contagious it's much less serious!In other news André heard that his colleague who died suddenly (age 37) last month had had a heart attack and people are still pretty shaken up about it! What sad and weird times we're living in right!Since I finally have a pass sanitaire (although for how much longer if they are now changing the rules? - oh what it feels like to be \"briefly\" normal), I was able to join a few colleagues at a restaurant in Geneva last week. While I was waiting for them to show up a retired Indian colleague came and sat with me and we got chatting about retirement and kids and so on. I had worked for her father-in-law when I first came to Geneva and while he definitely had his issues he was very kind to me and I thought well of him. She was telling me she would like to visit family in India but the situation being what it is there is no way she would even attempt it right now. So I commented that despite a fairly catastrophic start to the pandemic (because of their sheer population size), India seemed to have managed this pandemic well! At that she said that as far as far as she was concerned, Modi (their PM) was an angel, and had it been anyone else they would have been in big trouble! Isn't it nice to hear someone say how their elected politicians seem to have got it right!So who knows \"what sauce they will eat us with next\" (that's a French expression). As from January they are going to present a draft law to take the PCR test component out of the pass sanitaire definitively, but goodness knows where that leaves me as a \"recently recovered\"! I do see people baulking at this third shot though, even more so since the Health Minister is already talking about a fourth!!!! Who knows, maybe this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back! Either that or pushing the jabs on kids (with the attendant pass sanitaire being dependent on it for those over age 11) - that could well do it where people say \"no more\"! Oh and about 10 minutes ago I just read where the PM was in a vaccination centre set up for children in Le Mans (in the north of France) yesterday and they've just found out that they accidentally administered adult doses to six children while he was there! I tell ya, if I had a bottle of wine to hand right now ...  but I don't, which is probably a good thing!In an effort to try to cheer myself up, the other night I watched The Greatest Showman on streaming. While it was good (and Hugh Jackman is gorgeous), when I found myself fast-forwarding through the song and dance bits I knew it wasn't really for me. Still, at least I tried right?And I finally finished the book Wintering (I flit from book to book) and I think I get what she was trying to say. At the very least she went through a depression - if not a breakdown - and the book describes how she \"gave herself permission\" to practice self-care and lick her wounds, as it turns out during winter. Her basic premise is that animals give themselves permission to hibernate and just take care of themselves during winter so maybe we would do well to follow suit and allow ourselves time to heal and just \"be\" occasionally! Something to think about in these dark times perhaps!"},
{"title": "Bloodsuckers!", "date": "Sunday 12 December 2021", "text": "You'll be glad to hear that the post title has nothing to do with Boris Johnson for once (although it's pretty appropriate, all the same)! No, the other day quite by chance I stumbled across a Youtube interview with a man called Randy Rush, who won $50 million (Canadian) in 2015 and has seemingly used that money to benefit many individuals and charitable causes. Google describes him as \"an author and social justice advocate\". Whether that's true or not, he certainly came over as a very likeable man. He wrote a book called 13 Billion To One describing his megawin, and while I've downloaded a sample I haven't actually gotten round to reading it yet. More interesting to me, though, is another book he wrote called Bloodsuckers. It is the story of how a couple called Jeremy and Amy Crawford - a couple he knew through Jeremy's father before he won the money - used him and his money in one of their many \"marketing opportunities\". According to Mr. Rush, this couple were con artists of the highest order and he outlines their various rackets in great detail going back as far as he can! They created businesses, pyramid schemes, luxury magazines that never published an issue and conned mainly \"little people\" out of money they could ill afford to lose. When Randy won the big one they must have felt they'd hit the jackpot and, I believe, did indeed con him out of a significant amount of money. I haven't finished the book yet but I understand he got some of it back and wrote this book to set the record straight and hopefully bring them down (if that hasn't already happened)! As I say, I haven't finished the book yet but it is just amazing the bare-faced lies this couple told to ordinary folk and got away with for so long! I'm not sure which televangelist it was that begged his stool pigeons to \"send however many dollars you can because otherwise I fear God will call me home\" (apparently God called him to prison instead)! It's a bit dry as a book, mainly just detailing the cons, but I go to bed to read most nights and think whaaattttt????? I probably shouldn't still be surprised that this BS exists - but I am!It took a while but I'm finally feeling my energy coming back after covid and sinusitis. I'll whisper this but I think I may also be over the sinusitis too - but don't tell anyone as I don't want to jinx it! So with that I've started putting up my Christmas tree/decorations - something I hate doing actually - but needs must. I guess it says more about me that I prefer taking them down than putting them up, although I really do enjoy it when it's all decorated!And remember my writing a while ago about collecting stamps from the local supermarket in order to buy bath towels at what turns out to be about half price. I lucked out when a gent handed me a whole packet of stamps so ordered grey and white (they only had those two colours) bath towels and hand towels for André and Jordan and Jen. Well I got a message from the supermarket to say that my order was finally in, but when I stopped in to pick them up yesterday the lady apologized and said that the truck had got stuck and only the grey towels had come through and did I want to wait? I told her I'd wait as it was easier to pick up the whole order in one go, but I had to laugh at the lack of tenacity - true grit, if you like - of the white towels seeing as how they just wimped out while the grey towels made it through!I mentioned earlier that one of the side effects (of covid?/sinusitis?) was that I lost my sense of taste and smell. I have to agree that something might have been off with my sense of taste because I made two different soups this week and I reckon both of them were capable of either blowing my brains out with the chili in them or sending my blood pressure through the roof with the amount of salt I used!Then yesterday I finally got to see the Munchkin. I'd put it off for a couple of days because of the snow but yesterday I decided to go over there and take the shorter, mountain route as I really think I was starting to become a wimp re driving on the snow. I'm glad I did because it was fine! Okay, you don't go belting round any bends if you've got any sense, but the road was ploughed and very driveable so I'm glad I didn't wimp out on that one. When I got there Charlie had just woken up from a really long sleep. Jen asked if I would hold him while she got on with some stuff but mentioned that he'd been a bit lethargic as he'd been constipated for a couple of days. No problem, we just sat and watched mom going about her business, when all of a sudden there was a humongous \"ripping\" sound and I reckon Charlie suddenly didn't feel quite so lethargic any more! One thing it did confirm to me, though, is that my sense of smell has very definitely come back! Ah, God love 'im!"},

It snowed overnight and while it's calmed down a bit now we're due more snow continuing until tomorrow morning. After that it's forecast nice weather so hopefully it'll melt! Still, there's one thing to be said about shovelling snow - it lets off steam, which is good for both my sinuses and my temper tantrum from yesterday! Down the road from here!Out front - the plough had been round first thing though!Out back - they weren't bothered!And I know I've posted this before, but I needed to change the thoughts clattering round in my head so had a bit of a binge-watch of Only Fools And Horses! \"Play it nice an' cool son, nice an' cool!\""},

I'm much calmer now thankfully - but then I haven't finished writing either have I?So the latest example of Boris Johnson's assholery to hit the fan stands a chance, in my humble opinion, of being the one that brings the arrogant bastard down - eventually. Let's hope so, is all I can say! The problem is, he's far from being the only one who thinks he gets to dictate the rules but that they only apply to \"the little people\"!There's a leaked video doing the rounds of Macron and a whole bunch of people having an unmasked, non-socially-distanced knees-up at the Elysée Palace recently (I can't be arsed to go looking for the link, but believe me it's out there)! Then I wrote a post recently about how the French PM had come down with covid - goodness knows where he caught it, but masking up and social distancing weren't his forte either!Castex and the French Minister of the Interior recently!Then what about California Governor Gavin Newsom who, while exhorting people to keep socially distant and wear masks, was caught out with his wife and a whole bunch of other people at the fancy French Laundry restaurant! See, the rules don't apply to them do they!And of course they definitely don't apply to Boris Johnson and his cronies - never have, never will! Johnson likes to play the \"loveable buffoon\" but he's actually a callous prick who once set light to a £50 note in front of a homeless man! Yeah, loveable buffoon my arse!Then there's the rest of them - in no particular order:Matt Hancock, the then Health Minister, not keeping at all socially distant recently with his side-piece, something which eventually cost him his marriage and his job!Matt HancockOr what about ol' chipmunk cheeks, Michael Gove, who flew to Portugal to watch the football and then claimed he \"didn't have to self-isolate\" on his return because he'd suddenly become part of a never-before-heard-of trial to see how people travelling overseas got on if they didn't self-isolate!Chipmunk Cheeks GoveOr there was \"My Brains Are Too Big For My Head\" former Johnson \"bestie\" who \"thought there was something wrong with his eyes\" so got in his car and drove 100 miles to \"test them out\" (as you do) while the country was in strict lockdown!Dominic CummingsOr how about Hooray Henry in Chief, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who inherited £180 million when his father died (do any of them ever get anywhere on merit?). There's a video of him somewhere around the age of 14 speaking with an accent like he's got a poker up his arse while being driven to school in a Rolls-Royce! This is the genius whose solution to the U.K.'s truck driver shortage was to make the test easier by \"cutting out the part of the test where they had to reverse\"!!! No kidding, that was the solution poker arse came up with????? And of course, the only time Rees-Mogg was ever seen \"socially-distancing\" was when he felt it appropriate to have a lie down when Parliament was in session!Jacob Rees-MoggAnyway, what bought this rant on is that a couple of days ago news/videos were leaked of (I think) three Christmas parties that were held at No. 10 (Downing Street - the home of the Prime Minister) this time last year while the whole country was in strict lockdown. People were banned from having contact with anyone outside their immediate bubble, they couldn't be with their loved ones in hospital or as they were dying alone in nursing homes. And then of course they were obliged to have \"zoom funerals\". What the bloody hell is a \"zoom funeral\"? - where all but immediate family were prevented from seeing off their loved ones in person!!!! On a side note I'm glad both my mom and brother died before this shit happened because I can't even begin to imagine how devastating it would have been for them (and us) to have them die alone!So back to the plot. Boris Johnson and the current Mrs. Johnson (they say when you marry your mistress you create a vacancy and he does have form!) live in the apartment above the PM's offices at No. 10 Downing Street, where last year definitely two, if not three, parties were held. Last week E.T.'s big brother, Sajid Javid, categorically denied that any parties had taken place - categorically!Sajid Javid, the new Health MinisterThings then started to go pear-shaped and Dominic Raab - ah yes, Dominic Raab ... He used to be the Foreign Minister who once, when talking about increasing covid cases in Réunion (which is French) made some comment words to the effect that \"wouldn't it be terrible if they got on the metro in Paris and the numbers exploded\" and someone had to explain to the poor dolt that Réunion is an island in the Indian Ocean so the likelihood of them catching the Paris metro was little to none! Anyway, after he categorically refused to come back off his fancy holiday when they started withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, leaving some poor underling in the British Ambassador's office to get as many British citizens out of there as possible, Dominic Raab was transferred to the new position of Justice Secretary????? Just a couple of days ago Raab said he \"had no knowledge of any parties going on at No. 10, but if they did (what? they were banned!!!!) he was certain protocols had been followed! Say what? Then he tried to say that as it happened a year ago the police wouldn't look into it as it was \"old news\". Again, say what??? They are still prosecuting the plebs at the moment for holding parties last year, and if there was any doubt in Raab's mind that parties actually took place at No. 10, why didn't he ask the police officers who are permanently stationed outside the front door?Dominic Raab - light's on, nobody's home!Anyway, as rumblings got louder and leaked videos found their way into the public domain, not a single Conservative Minister was available to talk to mainstream media. Apparently Javid was scheduled to be intereviewed by one media channel but pulled out because there's not one of them that can find a single pathetic excuse for what happened at No. 10!So why is this all coming to light now, after a year? Well it's obviously politically motivated. Someone waited until Bojo was flailing more than usual and leaked the videos the day before Prime Minister's Question Time (PMQs) so that he'd have less time to come up with an excuse! Oh he tried to bluster his way through it of course, saying that \"he had no idea this was going on\" (he lives in the flat above the office and didn't hear 50+ people having a party???) but he would ask one of his flakies to \"look into it\" and he would take \"appropriate action\"! What's the betting more leaked video comes out actually showing him at one of the parties? Not saying it will, but I think that's where I'd put my money!Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour Party, is a lawyer and a smart man, and he, and the Scottish MP, Ian Blackford (and others) did a good job of pinning down Johnson who was squirming like bait on a hook. And oddly enough, while it was expected that Conservative MPs would avoid PMQs, they didn't and it was they that were yelling out \"hypocrite\" as Johnson was denying all knowledge of any parties! (On a side note, the former leader of the Labour Party was Jeremy Corbyn, who was so unpalatable as a leader that Johnson was elected to power because there was basically no opposition. My nephew is a life-long Labour supporter and works in the Labour Party archives and I think even he has hope for Labour at the next election)!You might not want to watch the whole video, but if you do, Ant and Dec (see 15 seconds) are two British comedians who picked up on the brewing storm even before the papers published anything. At 1.40 minutes you see Allegra Stratton, a Johnson adviser, and a whole bunch of other people a couple of days after one of the parties joking about how they would respond to questions if \"it ever got out\", and at 2.30 minutes you have Mr. Poker Up His Arse, Jacob Rees-Mogg laughing and joking about what a \"jolly jape\" they were all having and \"of course they were all socially-distanced because they only had to be two inches apart didn't they\"?Allegra Stratton has already been thrown under the bus and has resigned, but methinks Boris will have to order a whole new fleet of buses for all the other people he will throw under the bus while he desperately tries to cling to power!Today, as I was leaving home to drive to Annecy I drove past the village primary school, where a whole bunch of little kids were running around outside playing with masks on, thus solidifying the idea that the rules only apply to \"the little people\"!Rant over, I'm going to bed!"},
{"title": "A good move!", "date": "Monday 6 December 2021", "text": "I wish I'd thought to take a picture from my balcony first thing this morning, as the sun was shining, it had snowed heavily overnight and the farmer had his sheep in the field behind my house and it was all so pretty, with the sheep looking like miniature snowmen - albeit horizontal snowmen!And no surprise here, but I've spent the last however many days at home until today as while I was over covid (three negative tests, including the last one today) I was still really, really tired - which seems to be one of the most common side-effects! Then on Friday morning I woke up with a pain in my ear and a blocked nose and somehow managed to have contracted sinusitis! Damn, I haven't had so much as a cold in years and this year I'm definitely making up for it! I expect it's got a lot to do with being run down actually as I had no energy and decided to spend however long I needed just sitting on the sofa reading. I also had no appetite (still don't really) and on a positive note I am down 10 lbs this morning from when I tested positive for covid! I was still drinking gallons, mind, but I just couldn't be bothered to eat (another common side effect apparently). Anyway, in view of the sinusitis I thought I'd better get back to the saline solution and the ginger and honey tea so I'm kinda hoping it'll be gone in a day or two! I knew I'd seen somewhere that someone mentioned dabbing the inside of the ear with a drop of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect it and I'm hoping that will have helped also (or maybe I'll just go totally deaf - who knows)! When I spoke to Jen on zoom she told me that she'd seen a home remedy of someone cooking an onion (in a microwave), wrapping it in a cloth and placing it on the ear and while I'm sure it works (I believe onions and garlic, in particular, have wonderful healing properties), I could just imagine the neighbour letting herself into my home and finding me passed out on the sofa with an onion in my ear!Ms Moon mentioned today that she'd had the sweetest dream last night and all I can say is lucky her, as I had yet another nightmare about my ex-husband. It's always him (not that I get nightmares very often) and I think I read somewhere that they can occur when the body is overheated or run down. Could be true because when I get them it's usually early morning, which is when I tend to feel too hot. Anyway, last night \"he\" had yet again come into my house while I was out and rearranged my entire kitchen - moved the oven, switched everything around in the cupboards and so on. And then \"a friend of his\" came over and I couldn't get either of them to leave. They don't last long but I think it tends to prove that my ex can still bother me (even if only subconsciously) if I have to think about him for any reason! He did, indeed, have a Drunken Asshole Friend/drinking buddy (DAF) who was a complete waste of space, always wanting to go out drinking in Geneva and perpetually broke - but then DAF was a single guy who rented a room in Geneva (when he managed to pay the rent) and had the rest of his salary to go out boozing with my husband. While none of this excuses my husband's behaviour, this particular DAF definitely intruded into my family life and was the biggest pain in the butt!I remember his employer was contacted by a court in Germany for non-payment of debts over there and I ended up spending my entire weekend drafting letters to his creditors offering for him to pay lesser amounts if they would accept it. With two young kids and a full-time job, I mean, it's not like I had anything better to do, right? Came to find out many months later that he never even bothered to mail the letters! Then one weekend he was yet again sleeping off a hangover at our house when my husband came to me and asked if I would drive into town and buy DAF a carton of cigarettes - it had to be me as DAF had no money and ex-asshat had no driving licence! What a pair of winners those two were - a real pair of Chuckle Brothers. So folks, I guess if you ever want dating/lifestyle advice you know who not to come to!In other news the Munchkin has finally figured out how to crawl forwards and since Jen has put me to shame and actually got her Christmas tree up I guess she's gonna have to watch out now! I stopped in at the pharmacy to get some more saline solution today so then decided to head off on my first outing in goodness knows how long. I knew a walk would be the best thing to get rid of the cobwebs and gunk in my head and it certainly helped! I walked around the lake at Thyez, which was only a 30 minute walk and just five minutes from Jordan and Jen's place, but I thought better of stopping in as I didn't want to pass my sinusitis (or anything else) on to them after they've had a rough few weeks! I guess I'll have to wait a few more days to see the Munchkin and his forward-motion crawling achievements!And finally, I saw that someone had recommended the Netflix film Red Notice so I decided to give it a shot last night. Frankly starring Dwayne Johnson didn't really do it for me as I figured it would be all \"bang, bang, you're dead\" and him walking through 1,000 bullets with just a scratch on his cheek (I was right), but after I made it through the first couple of minutes I have to say I enjoyed it. It was, of course, ridiculous and silly but Ryan Reynolds (who I didn't know) and The Rock played the silly dialogue to the hilt and I ended up enjoying it. So I guess you really shouldn't judge a book (or a film) by it's cover, should you!"},
{"title": "Negative!", "date": "Tuesday 30 November 2021", "text": "It's two weeks today since I tested positive for covid so the kids and I did another test yesterday and we've all come back negative so that's good. We were told we only had to self-isolate for 10 days as long as we didn't have a temperature (I never did anyway) but since I had nowhere to be I decided to give it two full weeks and just stay home. That was probably a good idea because I have been pretty tired but feel I might be turning a corner on that too now! Funnily enough, right at the beginning of covid, my trainer at the gym was one of the first people I know to get it (March 2020) and when I saw him last I asked how it had been and he just said exhausted for two weeks. Now he's a youngster and extremely fit - everything I'm not - but I have to agree on the tiredness part. And, I lost my appetite (another common symptom apparently), although I've always drunk gallons so I wasn't too worried about that! One thing I am looking forward to though is going down to the lake at Passy (on my own) for a good walk to get rid of the cobwebs cluttering up my brain for the last couple of weeks!That being said, we got our first snow dump on Monday - quite a lot of it in fact - so going anywhere didn't have much appeal anyway. And then 24 hours later all the excitement has calmed down and we can enjoy the snow and the bright sunshine once again. While I'm always more careful on the snow, I have to admit I just love this weather and will be glad to get back out and about again. I obviously don't do too well being cooped up!"},
{"title": "Guess what!", "date": "Thursday 25 November 2021", "text": "Remember my saying a couple of posts ago how I'd spent a few days helping out with Charlie when he was cranky as hell and Jen was exhausted? Well I was cried on, dribbled on, puked on and pooped on but eventually we got there, although not before Jen had taken him to the doctor's who confirmed rhino-pharangitis (or whatever that is in English). Jen kept blasting saline solution up his nose (much to his disgust), thereby managing to prevent him from getting gunk on his chest and in about four days he was over it. Well Sunday night I got a message from Jen to say that they'd just received notification from the crèche saying they would be closed this week as one of the babies in Charlie's group has covid! Needless to say Jordan, Jen and the babe got tested Monday morning and all three of them came up positive! So it was off to the test centre for me and guess what - I showed up positive too (and Jen's mom, as it turns out). So yeah, there you have it, all five of us got covid via Charlie/the crèche, all the while thinking we had just contracted colds! But I'm happy to say, it's been perfectly fine. Seriously, in all our cases, it has been nothing to write home about! While I know that's not the case for many people, we've just sailed through with what I can only describe as a seasonal cold!I've mentioned before that I don't really mix anyway so I've never been too worried about catching it, but then of course I'd never be in circumstances where I'd be that close to anyone other than the babe! Thankfully, other than going between their house and my house I didn't go anywhere last week so I never unknowingly infected anyone else either. It started with a very low-grade, all-encompassing headache, which I put down to having my bedroom too hot, and then a bunged up nose and that was it for the duration! Oh I had a bit of an ache in the back, which I put down to not going to yoga for three weeks and, in retrospect, I realize I was probably tireder than usual and had lost my appetite, but it was nothing to make me suspect covid! When I told my sister her first reaction was \"well if you'd got the jab you probably wouldn't have caught it\" (nope, I don't believe even a jabbed individual would be safe getting vomited on by an infected person), and then she tried \"well it wouldn't have been so bad\" (what, less bad than a bunged up nose?), so in the end I told her to let it be. She made her choice, I made mine and I'm good with it - but that still doesn't explain how my triple-jabbed neighbours have all come down with covid either does it (nothing to do with me, thankfully). So there you have it, hopefully one and done as far as we are concerned! It also means we will all now get the ubiquitous pass sanitaire, which is only available to people who have been triple-jabbed or who have recovered from covid! It won't make an awful lot of difference to my life anyway as I have no intention of going out night-clubbing, but it will be nice to be able to sit on a café terrace for a coffee, something we unjabbed have been banned from doing for the past however many months!I have to say that the French securité sociale (the medical system) kicked in very quickly and efficiently after my positive test as I was bombarded with messages telling me what to do and asking if I needed financial help, medical help, assistance with my living arrangements or food shopping and so on (all of which was a \"no thank you\", of course), and then today I got a call asking for more details of my movements and who I had had contact with. I told the young woman that I was fine and that she didn't need to contact Jordan and Jen as we were all aware and had all tested positive, but she told me she had to call them for recording purposes so that was fine too!Now while I may not have chosen to get the jab, I have been following quite a few online doctors/experts who have been giving advice on what to do if you get sick. Here I have to say Dr. Eric Berg is just wonderful (although not the only one) and as each doctor gave their recommendations I looked up the product they were recommending and put it into my online Amazon basket. Not that I ordered everything of course, but I accumulated what I thought were the most helpful videos/recommendations and watched how you go about making sure you can clear mucus from your airways (not that it happened in my case anyway) and so on. But the most common recommendations seemed to be for Vitamin C, D3, Zinc, K2, Quercetin, Glutathion and NAC (N-acetyl-L-cystein), which, I understand is kept on hand by many doctors in the case, most commonly of Tylenol and/or alcohol poisoning. Basically it's a potent anti-oxidant and detox (or at least that's my understanding). So a few weeks ago I dumped everything out of my Amazon basket except those things and luckily for me I had them all on hand when covid caught me out and started taking them as soon as I was confirmed. Maybe they helped, maybe they didn't, but I have to say none of us have been any sicker than a regular cold, except that it maybe lasted a bit longer than a seasonal cold would by a couple of days!Anyway, we're all over it now and can come out of self-isolation as from tomorrow. Now André's peeved because he said if he realized that was all it was going to be he would rather have caught it and got it over with, but then he would throw a wobbly if he ever thought Charlie was going to spit up on him so maybe he'll never catch it!While I didn't need anything (another reason I'm eternally grateful that I keep a well-stocked pantry), André (who has repeatedly tested negative) did a bit of running around for Jordan and Jen. He was telling me that he stopped in at the pharmacy for them the other day and was flirting up a storm with a pretty assistant when Jordan called him and asked him to buy some diarrhea medication (I guess that was one of Jordan's side effects) - which kinda put the kibosh on André's flirting!Oh, another bit of juicy news is that France's vile Prime-Minister, Jean Castex, has just tested positive for covid also! This is the guy who has been banging the gavel about how we needed to be strict about obeying the guidelines and if we didn't there would be stiff penalties to pay. The same Jean Castex who categorically stated in July that if you were double-vaxed it was impossible to catch or transmit covid (WRONG), so the guy is either lying about his vaccine status (which is what I believe) or he doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to listening to medical advice. More to the point, Mr. \"We all have to follow the guidelines or there will be consequences\" was filmed at a recent Mayor's Congress fraternizing with mayors from all over France, not wearing a mask and shaking hands with everyone! He then travelled to Brussels where he met his Belgian counterpart just one day before being declared covid-positive and the French media are having a field day!Castex and the French Minister of the Interior at therecent Mayors' Congress!When questioned about this behaviour, Gabriel Attal, France's chihuahua in chief official spokesman said it was just \"a human lapse of judgement\". Such \"human lapse of judgement\" would get you or I a €135 fine but then I suppose the rules only apply to the little people, don't they! Do as I say, not as I do!And finally, around lunchtime there was a knock at my door so I leaned out my window and told the elderly gent that I wouldn't open my door as I had covid but could I help him. Turns out he was from our village Mairie bringing Christmas baskets to all the \"elderly\" people in the village (and yeah, he'd got the wrong address - he was looking for Mme Mugnier). Normally they have a Christmas lunch for everyone in the village over the age of 65 and since it was cancelled yet again this year they were distributing hampers instead. But I thought it was sweet of him to stop back a couple of minutes later and ask if I needed any help. I don't, of course, but it was nice to know someone cared enough to ask! So stay safe everyone and happy Thanksgiving to my friends in the U.S.!"},
{"title": "And here we go again!", "date": "Saturday 20 November 2021", "text": "One of the neighbours in our little housing unit has just got a totally new roof installed. Well quite a few neighbours have been doing that recently actually. Last year I got all new insulation put in and my roof treated (come to think of it, that might be part of the reason why my heating bill has gone way down, don't you think), but these people got a totally new roof and man are those guys hard-working! They've been showing up really early and working until it gets dark (I guess they have to work while the weather permits, right?) and while a crane has been depositing the tiles on the roof, these guys are the ones humping stacks of tiles to wherever they need to be before installing them! As I say, that's damn hard work!Talking of hard work, for the foreseeable future Jordan is working just down the road from me where they are building several new apartment buildings. I kinda like these apartments and might have been interested in one of them on the top floor except that they don't have a lift, so nah, I won't be going there! Anyway, when I've got time I've been making a cake and taking it down for the guys to eat with their lunch and I have to say he looked exhausted the other day. After Charlie's operation he managed to get a cold, followed by a cough and neither Jen nor Jordan got much sleep last week as the babe was crabby. Oh Jen's been pumping serum physiologique (saline solution?) into his nose to make sure to get that gunk out and he seems to be pretty much over it now, but that was a rough week for the three of them. But talking of the babe's operation, immediately after the procedure he pretty much stopped dribbling like a water cannon and - something we noticed this week - he can now actually tip his head back and look at the ceiling - something he seemingly hadn't been able to do previously, as I guess it pulled on his neck too much! So all in all, despite being unpleasant, getting that procedure was a good move! I spent a few hours over there on Wednesday to try to give Jen a break and the little devil managed to pass his cold on to me, but 24 hours later that's over too!Anyway, as I was driving down to Jordan I saw my friend going to the supermarket and she had walked there. It probably takes about an hour to walk down and maybe 20 minutes more to walk back because it's uphill, but hats off to her for being so dedicated. I sent her a text message to see if she wanted a lift back but she said she was good, so now she's putting me even more to shame!I stopped in at the supermarket to pick up a few things and noticed a little Asian food pop-up in the parking lot. André and I had eaten his take-away food before and it's pretty good so I decided to treat myself to lunch for a change. I have to say that's one thing covid has really turned on its head. More and more pop-ups are springing up everywhere, as is take away food, which really wasn't a thing round here before. Still, it's all well and good if someone can benefit from these crazy times we're living in!As I say, last week was rough for Jordan and Jen so I decided to make dinner for them and take it over. I felt like eating gratin (I make a good one) so I made three - one for them, one for André and one for me - and bought pork steaks and fresh broccoli to go with it. André was out when I stopped by to drop it off but as I have a key I let myself in and dropped off some mail at the same time. He was really pleased when he got home so called me to thank me and that was when he told me he was kinda in shock because a young woman he works with was taken ill on Sunday night and died Monday morning of an \"unexplained and unexpected\" event. She was only 37 (I think - well certainly under 40) and in good health, so even though work may never know what happened to her, I seriously hope they do an autopsy so that her family can find out what happened. It won't bring her back of course but ...!I don't want to sound smug (nah, yeah I do) but I've pretty much done all my Christmas shopping! I hate crowds so have been picking things up as and when so except for another gift for André I'm done. I stopped in at my local beauty salon as I wanted to buy a gift voucher for my friend and that's when I decided I was finally going to start going back to them again! So on Wednesday I had my first facial in about two years and it felt wonderful (I think my skin was screaming with relief). I asked her if she wanted me to do a covid test beforehand and she said no, but I figured I'd do one anyway and showed it to her when I got there, so all's good!I also finally got round to calling the travel company we had booked with to go see the tulips last year and asked for a reimbursement as it is now 18 months since they cancelled it (the legal limit). I mentioned to my friend that the cheque would be coming to her as she was down as the principal traveller and she told me she'd totally forgotten about it so it would be a nice Christmas bonus for her! Heck, if someone owes me €1,200 (about $1,500) I promise you I won't forget about it. I mean, that's what they have insurance for isn't it!And finally, I mentioned before that my neighbour had asked me if I would drive her husband to and from hospital sometime this week for his latest operation to put stents in his legs as she is afraid to drive out there. No problem, I told her to just let me know when! Anyway, it turns out her daughter had taken him to hospital on Wednesday night, with the operation being scheduled for 1 p.m. on Thursday. Around 6 p.m. I popped outside to take over a parcel I had taken in for another neighbour and M, my immediate neighbour, was also outside so I asked if the operation had gone well. Just as she was telling me that she didn't know as she couldn't get hold of him, her daughter called to say that papa was pissed off because his operation was supposed to take place a 1 p.m. and he had waited until 6 p.m. and told her to come and pick him up!!!!! Damn, this is now the third time he has pulled this kind of stunt, although I wasn't aware of the first time. Apparently he walked out the first time at the major hospital near here because something got up his nose I guess. Then the last time he was rude to the nurse the night before his operation and then checked himself out of hospital against medical advice a couple of hours after the operation. And of course he started bleeding at the scar site - which was when my nurse friend gave him hell for being so selfish as he could have started haemorraghing and left his wife in a real mess. So yet again he's \"done one\"! Good luck with getting any surgeon round here to take you on next time, after them doing all the scans and prior blood tests necessary for the op! Her daughter told her to keep her mouth shut because if she said anything to him when he came home he would use that as an excuse to lay into her as to why it was all her fault. She stopped in yesterday and was wound up like a spring but said she was managing to keep her mouth shut and he was prowling round like a caged tiger just waiting to pounce! She also thanked me for letting her come round to chat as she couldn't afford a shrink's appointment, so I told her while I was no shrink a cup of coffee with me or a glass of wine certainly wouldn't do any harm, would it!Actually I've had a few thoughts on whether his new (to me) aggression had other causes, but she said he'd pretty much always been an asshole to her, but was previously able to hide it better from others! She also thinks it's something to do with him \"no longer being Mr. Big\" (the director of a large bank round here) and that he is not dealing with being just another \"little old man\"! She might have a point there as I know so many who find it difficult no longer being \"important\" - I'm just glad I've never been important!  And apparently he really is letting his mean side slip in front of others now, although not in front of me so far. He was extremely rude to her in front of my other, younger neighbours one time and they just turned heel and walked back into their house without saying anything. Then when they were over on the west coast dealing with elderly mother problems, their basement, yet again, started to flood in the heavy rain and two of our other neighbours spent six hours jack-hammering a drain into the basement to stop it from flooding - with one of these men being 83 years old! What was the thank you they got? Something along the lines of \"it was a crap job and not necessary anyway\" - which is complete BS because the 83 year old is an absolute whiz and couldn't botch a job if you paid him to! So the reaction from the other neighbour who helped was that next time he could deal with a swimming pool in his basement himself when he got back 'cos he was never going to help him out again!She also told me that when they had been to the nursing home to see his mom, obviously only so many people were allowed in the room at once, so she stood at the door and just waved at mamie (who died a couple of weeks later), and was subsequently thrown out on her ear by him in no uncertain terms! Since her own mom was in the same home she went to see her and when the doctor came round she asked how Mme. R. was, as she was her MIL. And that's when the doctor said \"oh you're the one with the rude husband - we've all heard about him\"! She said she was mortified but I told her the shame wasn't hers to bear. If he's an AH, let him deal with it! Of course when that incident blew up he \"never said that\" or he \"never did that\", selective amnesia being pretty strong in narcs (my ex was very gifted in that domain), but his BIL just turned round and said \"well next time don't behave like an AH in front of so many witnesses then\"! She also told me a very dear friend of hers in her 90s recently told her that her husband has always only opened his mouth to eat and to say \"je, je, je\" (\"I, I, I\"), and she was stunned that others saw him so clearly for what he is! Now I freely admit I'm not a good judge of character - never have been - but I told her I felt that it's probably easy to see from the outside, but not quite so easy when it's up close and personal is it! What to others looked like massive red flags for so long were probably looking like a day at the carnaval to her! Anyway, she breaks my heart and I don't know what else I can do for her, except listen. She did say that she is so bitter because she will never let anyone get close again (she's a lovely woman), as he's sucked out her life blood up and spit it out so many times. I told her not to worry as I was now a bitter old crone too but hey, we could maybe get a place together later - and in the meantime, how about that glass of wine?"},
{"title": "A boring week!", "date": "Tuesday 16 November 2021", "text": "I have to say it's been a pretty \"bleh\" week round here. Maybe it's the grey weather and, of course, the fact that I can't be arsed to get out walking, but I'm not exactly full of the joys of spring right now! I haven't done an awful lot except potter around home and read quite a bit, but then again I reckon that's allowed right? I mean, seriously, do I have anywhere else I need to be right now? I mentioned some time ago I think that I'd stopped reading the newspapers (online) on a daily basis and limited it to just one time over the weekend. And you know what, turns out that's enough. I don't need (or want) to be bombarded with all the negative stuff that sells papers and attracts clicks. Oh I see all the dreadful things going on in the UK (and probably everywhere else too) but in the end, there's not an awful lot I can do about it is there so why not just drop it from my day-to-day life? I get a lot of what's going on in short bursts on Youtube news channels (which has been very helpful for me to get to know more about what's going on in France), but to read all the \"gory details\" every day - nah, I think I'll pass! That being said, I do follow a Youtuber called Phil Moorhouse re British politics and I have to say I really like his analysis of all the shenanigans going on there. Last week has been all about the \"cash for influence corruption scandal\" (you know, MPs selling themselves out to the highest bidder - shocking, I know)! Dear old Boris - instead of having the \"corruption committee\" investigate the latest thief in a top hat, tried to get the committee disbanded all together! You can't make this stuff up can you, and if it wasn't so serious it would be laughable - not that I see many people laughing about it right now. I guess most of the wheeler-dealers aren't too worried though are they, since they're the ones with the money and can \"buy\" all the votes and influence they need! I was glancing at something else while listening to Phil yesterday and I had to laugh when I heard him say (of Boris) \"if he could just stop being a prick for a week or two maybe things might start to calm down\". My thoughts exactly Phil, my thoughts exactly, but Boris stop being a prick? Nah, impossible!Because I've been rather less connected lately I only just found out about the attempted bombing of the Remembrance Day ceremony in Liverpool and the actions of a very brave taxi driver! I haven't caught all the details yet but from what I can gather the driver picked up a young man who wanted to be taken to the where the services were being held, but the driver was getting a bad vibe from him. I'm not quite sure how he did it but he ended up driving away from the ceremony and up to the front of Liverpool's Women's Hospital, where the young man attempted to detonate his belt. Apparently it stalled for just a split second, whereupon the driver was able to lock the man in the back of the cab and jump out himself. He was taken to hospital but released the next day as his injuries were relatively minor and I'm happy to say the only casualty was the deranged lunatic in the back of the cab! I hope he gets a medal for his bravery (and someone starts a Gofundme to help the driver get back on his feet)!Then last Tuesday I took a crate of stuff down to the food bank in town, this time concentrating mostly on buying baby stuff, having seen how expensive baby formula and nappies and so on are because of Charlie. I got chatting to the staff while they were unloading my crate and the lady was saying that they've seen a three-fold increase in the number of families requiring assistance over the last six months! Times are hard right now but I suspect they will get worse before they get better, right?A couple of weeks ago Jen asked if I would be free to drive her to a doctor's appointment for Charlie in Geneva yesterday, as I lived in Geneva for five years and know my way around, whereas she doesn't. No problem of course! Turns out the babe is \"tongue-tied\", where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the mouth is shorter than usual. This probably explains why he dribbles so much and would also, apparently explain why he wasn't able to breast-feed! Her paediatrician told her she could wait to see a doctor in France but since there weren't many locally she could recommend a doctor in Geneva if she was willing to pay out-of-pocket to see him. And of course the answer was yes so the two grandmas, Charlie and Jen set off to the appointment yesterday morning. Talk about luxurious! As we were early, a very handsome youngish man came over and asked us to wait until the therapist arrived and then came back with coffee for the three of us. I'm guessing from their names they were Greek (or maybe Cypriot) and the therapist explained that as I spoke English she would be happy to have me come in with Jen as her English was better than her French. This lady really took her time examining the babe and said she agreed that this \"tie\" should be cut in order to make life easier for him in so many ways. She also said that this should have been picked up in the maternity hospital, but what can you say about that now? She took her time to explain the whole procedure to Jen and said that he will definitely scream because he will basically be put in a straight jacket but that it would be very quick and almost painless! Turns out \"handsome\" was the doctor who was going to perform the procedure and since Jen didn't want to go with Charlie, her mom (who is a surgical theatre nurse) went in with him and in about five minutes it was all over. And yes he screamed (and Jen balled her eyes out, but what can you do when it's your baby)?He had had a rough night the night before and she told them that he had a temperature that morning and a blocked nose. Turns out he must also have had \"tummy trouble\" because what came out the other end a bit later was just evil, so all in all the poor little soul had a very rough day of it. Jen's mom had to leave so I went back home with her to take turns trying to console a tired, hungry, stuffed up baby who wanted to eat but couldn't, presumably because his mouth was hurting! Man was that hard work, walking around with him looking at the trucks and the cars in five minute bursts before he would get cranky again! I know we all go through it but I think you forget just how exhausting it can be don't you! Anyway, for the grand sum of around $600 it's all done (yeah, Geneva is expensive), and she has a follow-up appointment in two weeks to make sure it has all healed properly! I just checked in with them today and he's had a much better day, although Jen has an appointment with her own doctor tomorrow as she thinks he's coming down with bronchitis. Poor little sausage! Still, he's going to go through it one way or another isn't he - either via the crèche or when he starts school, but I'm just glad Jen is able to spend his first year with him so that she can keep him home when he needs more TLC!So anyway, enough doom and gloom for one post right? As I said, I haven't been doing an awful lot this past week but I see that East Idaho News's Nate Eaton is back on his Secret Santa mission and I'm hooked yet again. Someone in East Idaho is playing Secret Santa and giving away a large sum of money (in small-ish amounts), helping Idahoans in need with anonymous donations. Nate Easton has the perfect personality for the job so since Secret Santa is back I don't suppose I'll get too much done today either. So just another Feel Good Friday (on a Tuesday)!East Idaho News' Nate Eaton playing Secret Santa!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Saturday 6 November 2021", "text": "Yet again, there's not an awful lot going on around here right now, although the weather continues to be beautiful and the autumn colours are just glorious! I always decorate a little for Halloween (nothing over the top) even though I don't get that many trick or treaters because it's not such a big thing over here. I did do a great Mutley impersonation though, muttering under my breath, when my doorbell went on Saturday night and I opened it to two \"witches\". Thankfully I was gracious when I explained to them that actually Halloween is tomorrow 'cos the oldest said \"oh I know, but we won't be around tomorrow so we thought we'd come early\"! Right you are then! Then she asked me if I was American, to which I said no, my husband was American, although technically he still is American he's just no longer my husband (note, I didn't go into all that detail 'cos let's face it, all they wanted was candy, not my entire life story, right?). Then she said, \"yeah, but you're Jordan's mom and Charlie's grandma aren't you?\". When I said I was, she went on to explain that her mom was Jen's best friend, so boy was I glad I didn't yell at them to bugger off and come back tomorrow night! On Sunday I got a couple of visitors in the early afternoon (all the while muttering yet again that this is going to be a really long evening), but when I opened the door to see a really little girl (and her daddy) I was glad that once again I had managed to stuff my inner Mutley back into his cage! All in all, I didn't get too many visitors and it turned out to be quite a pleasant evening all told!The granddaughter next door, plus Isabelle'sdaughter and her friends!The Dutchman called to see if I wanted to go walking earlier in the week so I at least managed to get in one half-way decent walk, all while he whinges about how far it is to drive to my place and I whinge about having to listen to him whinge, so nothing new there! We lucked out too because although it was bitterly cold we managed to dodge in between the rain drops and got in around 8 km all told, even if it was on the flat!We got snow down to about 1,000 metres earlier in the week (I live at 800 metres, so it's definitely coming closer) and it is so pretty in the sun with the autumn colours. The Dutchman hadn't realized I live so close to the Plâteau de Glières (where a big resistance battle took place in WWII), so he asked if I would be up for driving up there soon as it's a place he would like to visit. To be honest, the visitors' centre isn't very big, but there is some lovely walking up there - on the flat, it being a plateau, of course - so hopefully we can get a couple more walks in before the heavy snow comes!All the houses round here have shutters on the doors and windows so I've started shutting them at night as it makes quite a difference to the indoor temperatures and fuel consumption. Actually it's been really good to see how relatively little fuel I'm now consuming since Max installed my new heating system. I'm now heating the house and the hot water by fuel and consuming less fuel per year than previously, when I was just heating the house! I suppose that's to be expected with a more efficient heating system, given that my previous furnace must have been about 40 years old. Still, it didn't owe me anything did it! Mind you, given that I shut all my shutters and I have a fire guard in front of my fireplace, I got the fright of my life the other evening when I was sitting reading and a terrified sparrow whizzed past my left ear! Somehow he must have managed to come down the chimney (dodging the plastic that I put up there to keep the cold air out), weave past the fire guard and was then frantically trying to make his escape while I was jumping up and down attempting to get a window open to let him out! At the moment Jordan is working just down the road from me on a block of 28 new-build apartments, so the other day I made what must have been the flatest Victoria sponge cake and took it down to the site for him and his friends to have with their coffee (I told him if they didn't like it to tell them Jen had made it, but it all went anyway). They have a Senegalese refugee who just started an apprenticeship with them and who Jordan gets along well with, but the other day Max pulled the \"new guy stunt\" on him when he asked how he knew that the cement mix was ready. So Max dipped his finger in the mix and licked it (or licked another finger) and told him that's how he figured out the right consistency. Poor sod, got a mouth full of cement mix before he realized they were having him on! They also told the other newbie that when he was cutting metal he needed to collect all the metal splinters as they rounded them up and sold them on to the scrap metal merchant! Ha, in my day they used to send the poor buggers out to buy a \"bubble for a spirit level\"! Still, they took it in good part!Talking of DIY, I got the sealant product out that I'd bought the other day to see how it worked on my shower room window and man is that window in worse shape than I thought! Well three of the velux windows are actually, so I think I should get someone in to see about changing them at some point, even if there's never a great time for incurring more expense is there! I got up the ladder and cleaned and sanded the window and then applied the sealant and while it's a definite improvement I reckon I should be thinking about changing them sooner rather than later!In other news, it's starting to look more and more like Brands Hatch round here, what with all the delivery vans constantly driving round our little island. I want to say \"Amazon\" delivery drivers, but obviously they're not necessarily all Amazon deliveries, of course, but boy are they busy and, I have to say, hard working! The other day I saw a cute little toy for Charlie for Christmas, ordered it in the evening and it was delivered the next day! Man, whatever you think about Amazon, they are (for the most part) damn efficient! I offered the young woman driver some Halloween candy as a thank you and she just laughed and said she'd forgotten her outfit!Brands HatchAnd finally, have you noticed how prices on everything seem to be increasing? Petrol, in particular, I noticed had gone up 20 cents a litre the other week over a period of about a month (that's almost $1/gallon). So of course there are continuing protests in France, not only against the vaccine passport but also about the price of petrol (plus the reform of the pension and the unemployment systems, to name a few). I found out quite by chance (thank you Facebook) that it would be a good idea not to head into town today as Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, was coming through town to head up to Le Grand Bornand (a local ski resort), so all the roads were closed off and the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) had prepared a warm Savoyard welcome for him. Now Jean Castex is to charisma what Cheez Whiz is to real cheese so all I can say is it couldn't happen to a nicer man!Jean Castex"},

Must be a thrilling, action-packed meeting!It's good to know we're all in good  hands!"},
{"title": "Just call me Rosie!", "date": "Saturday 30 October 2021", "text": "I see ol' Bojo did another U-turn last week (surprised anyone?). When he was first elected PM he ousted any cabinet member who was not 100% behind a hard Brexit. It was a case of \"toe the party line or you're out\"! Well since the UK has left the EU they are no longer bound by EU minimum standards - environmental, food security, etc. - you get the idea - and since the UK is now having a hard time obtaining the chemicals needed to treat sewage, the government decided to give the green light to allow water companies to dump \"minimally treated effluent\" (i.e. untreated shit) into the country's rivers and oceans, and Conservative hard Brexiteer MPs were forced by ol' Bojo to defend this stance to their constituents. They tried blaming the problems on Britain's \"antequated Victorian sewage systems\" which, funnily enough, seemed to have functioned adequately until now, so go figure. An amendment was introduced into Parliament to try to prevent this and was unceremoniously shot down by the government. Not unsurprisingly there was great public outcry that resulted in Bojo doing a complete 180 and backing away from this new position, thus hanging out to dry the Conservative MPs who had just had to defend it! The power of the man's ego and his ability to deny and/or blame others is something to behold! But then I suppose as the UK is, as I write, playing host to the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference in Glasgow, we can't be having untreated turds floating down the River Clyde while the bigwigs are eating their Scottish salmon can we! And what about the much vaunted recent trade deal with New Zealand, which will, for instance, see the current 20% tariff on imports of NZ mussels dropped and effectively put another nail in the coffin of the UK's fishing industry! Probably just as well, what with trying to grow mussels in all that untreated sewage huh! I tell ya, I shouldn't read this stuff really because I find his/their behaviour more and more outrageous by the day and it just does my head in!So with winter looming I decided that I needed to think about what projects I want to tackle round the house while there's so little going on outside. With that in mind I shot off to the local DIY place and started searching for the young(ish) man I always hone in on because he's so helpful and doesn't treat me like an idiot when I have to ask him to explain everything to me in simple terms. Oh, I play it off as being a language problem (which it is to a certain extent), but since I really don't know what I'm doing most of the time I find him to be incredibly helpful, although I'm sure next time he spots me walking in he's gonna try doing a runner first! Last time I was there I picked up a bag of mortar and re-cemented parts of my terrace that are becoming a bit \"holy\" (as in unstable, not religious) and it worked a treat! I probably should get some more and go over the entire terrace at some point, but for the time being it'll do. So today I told him that some of my window frames are starting to show water damage (I reckon they must have been installed about 25 years ago), and I couldn't afford to replace them just yet, so he sold me a product for outdoor use that can be used for waterproofing, and how to go about cleaning up the frames and applying it! Goal! Then it was off to get a new plug socket because I'd plugged my vacuum cleaner in the other day, yanked it too hard and pulled it out the wall, thus breaking the support! So there's job number 200 to add to my list. And I then asked him for advice on buying my own petrol-run generator as I want to be sure I have at least some electricity/heating/light this winter in the event of an extended power cut. So he showed me two, with the smaller one being €200 more expensive than the larger, more powerful one. Which didn't make sense to me but he explained that the cheaper generator - while more powerful - was also a lot noisier. But in the event of a sustained power cut do you really care about the noise? So I walked out of there with a generator too, which he kindly lugged out on a trolley and put in the back of my car after much huffing and puffing. But then of course, guess who had to get it out of the car alone when she got home? Yeah, me and damn, that thing was heavy! But I'm a stubborn bugger so I huffed and puffed (but didn't blow the house down) and got that thing into my garage all on my own! The irony is that it's actually on wheels but I needed to get it out of my car and out of the box before I could use the wheels! Anyway, I'm a few hundred euro lighter right now but have more than enough projects lined up for the coming winter - although sometimes I think doing a jigsaw puzzle might be an easier way to pass the time!Rosie the (old) riveter!After I'd finished sorting all that out there was a knock at my door and it was my neighbour come round for a chat as she said she hadn't seen me for ages and was concerned that I might be \"holed up\" too much on my own! I probably am actually but I'm ok with it really. So I told her that no, I was just going into \"hibernation\" mode, and while I actually go to yoga and out walking most weeks, (plus I see the Munchkin a couple of times a week), maybe I hadn't been as sociable as I should have been! Then she asked me a strange question - \"have you heard much coming from my house lately?\" When I told her that yes, unfortunately I'd heard quite a bit over the last few days because you just can't help it with these houses, so she told me that, as I suspected, the tension between them had been getting worse and worse and she couldn't take it any more. Actually I suspect that was the real reason she came round - she needed someone to just listen to her. Her hatred of her husband is growing by the day and when he more or less told her that if she didn't like it she could just \"bugger off\", I asked why she didn't make an appointment with a lawyer to find out just where she stood if she decided to divorce him. She doesn't have to do anything with that information of course, but at least she would know, and I suspect having been married 50 years next year she would be in a much better position than she thinks! Like I've said before, I don't think she would ever divorce him because she's afraid of striking out on her own at nearly 70, but at least if she gets that information she knows where she stands right? So then she mentioned that he has to go back into hospital for yet another operation to put more stents in his legs (over 50 years of smoking will do that for ya), but she didn't know how she would get him there since she's terrified of motorway driving, driving in the dark (and anywhere out of her comfort zone really), and her daughter will be back at work full-time at that point. So I told her it's not a problem, I will take them both as long as it's not the same day I have to take my friend to a different hospital for her colonoscopy! Heck, if it comes to that I can manage both as long as we know the dates and times of both procedures. But she makes me so sad, she's so beaten down and her world is becoming smaller and smaller as she's had her confidence sucked dry over the years! Still, I'm glad she came round because sometimes just having someone to listen to you can help, right?And finally, I've just started reading Wintering, The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times, by Katherine May, and I'm really enjoying it (sorry I can't remember who recommended it)!As far as I've gotten, she had to take time off work when her husband became ill, and then as soon as he got better she became ill and had to take sick leave herself. As a mother working outside the home (the term \"working mother\" being completely redundant - all mothers work), she was riddled with guilt and finding it so difficult to just slow down, having been used to going 100 miles an hour from the get-go. And then she realizes that she is starting to enjoy the enforced slow down and to question the need to be busy 100% of the time and achieve more and more! This is what struck a chord with me, the fact that she remembers when her son was born and then not much after that - why would we aspire to that if we could help it? She always enjoyed cooking but was now realizing that \"... the butcher can sell me exact quantities of meat, which I know I will use that same day. I no longer have to act out the cycle of freezing a packet of chicken, defrosting it a week later, then not having time to eat it and so throwing it away [guilty as charged]. I feel as though I'm cooking autumn into my house\"! ... \"Life is clearly teaching me some kind of lesson, but I can't decipher it yet\"! ... and \"Life begins to happen again, and that makes for more compelling memories\"!As I say, I haven't finished it yet but so far I'm enjoying it very much and it's turning into one of those books I can't put down. When I see the shockingly high - and unexpected - figures for the number of people who, having worked from home during lockdown, are now deciding they don't want to go back to the rat race and are resigning in their droves, maybe more people really are deciding to get off the hamster wheel and work less (assuming they have the financial means to do so) and I can only say \"good on yer mate\" - it took me way too long to figure that one out - but then I'm slow!"},
{"title": "All quiet!", "date": "Wednesday 27 October 2021", "text": "There's not much going on here at the moment just more of the same old, same old. The weather is glorious, however, and I kick myself sometimes for not getting out and enjoying it every day - but I guess we can't be all gung ho and enthusiastic every day, can we! In any case, I ached all over for a couple of days after my last walk and switching my walking boots out to another pair didn't really help - I just got a nasty blister in a different place! I have good quality hiking boots but I always feel they are too heavy. Maybe I should really try to get them worn in because wearing the cheap and nasty boots just isn't working!So I haven't really been doing a lot these past few days. I did, however, decide to get the baby crib that my neighbour's daughter gave me out of the small spare bedroom and into my own bedroom. It was driving me bonkers and so I hauled that baby out onto my balcony and into my bedroom - nearly putting my back out at the same time because that thing is heavy! Still, it fits much better in the larger bedroom and has freed up a whole pile of space in the spare bedroom. I also realized I could quite easily get a bunch of stuff out of the house and down into my basement so I lugged spares of all my supplies down two flights of stairs to my basement and have now got a fairly nice set-up going with stuff being put onto the shelves of my two little temporary greenhouses! Why I didn't do this years ago I have no idea, but seeing it sorted and properly stacked also allows me to see what I need more of (nothing at the moment) and what I have plenty of and won't need to buy for months probably. That's the trouble with shoving eveything into a cupboard isn't it - you don't realize just what you have!As I was going out the other day I realized we had our first frost of the year and, yet again, how much I appreciated not having to start scraping my car windshield at six in the morning!!!! I'm easily pleased obviously! On the way out today I saw my neighbour and chatted to her for a while and she looks so unhappy. I reckon they're going through a rough(er) patch at the moment because when I sit here reading I'm hearing more and more yelling coming from next door. It really triggers me, actually, because that used to be happening in our house - yeah, we were the screaming neighbours - and I absolutely hate to hear yelling now!On Sunday nights a few of us former colleagues get together for a quick zoom chat, and after not making it these past couple of weeks, I finally remembered and joined another two friends for a chinwag. It was odd though because one friend had just arrived back from a visit to family in England and said to me \"oh, I bet you'll be happy, guess who's got covid - me\"! Say what, why would I be happy she's got covid? I know we have differing opinions on the jab but I wouldn't wish anyone to get ill! She started getting an itchy throat and has now come down with a dreadful cold, but as at Sunday she said she really wasn't particularly unwell. Her husband reckons it was the guy that sat next to her on the plane and coughed all over her the entire time, but who knows. One thing is certain though, is that plane full of fully vaccinated people had at least one covid case on board didn't it! Scary stuff! So I told her I hoped she was ok and that while I didn't intend to get jabbed, I also wasn't dumb enough to be out nightclubbing (as if I could) or going to crowded places either, my idea of having a good time being out and about in the mountains! Still, she's very no-nonsense and I'm sure she'll be fine (fingers crossed)!While I haven't got as much done as I would have liked to these past few days, I did at least spend a good few hours working in the garden the other day and got that sorted. Somebody (I have no idea who) placed a 50 litre bag of compost by my back gate and while I am extremely grateful I kept leaving it where it was because I never buy anything heavier than the 20 litre bags. Still, needs must, and I lugged that baby up to the top of my garden to spread the soil over the top of the grass clippings I just dumped on my raised beds. I also shoved a few sprouted potatoes into one bed and garlic into another so we'll see what, if anything, pops up next spring!I also got a message from my gardener who said my neighbour had told him that I had more pruning work for him if he wanted it. I had thought about trying to do it myself, but in the end I realize I have neither the right equipment nor the muscles for this stuff any more and in three hours he ploughed his way through two hazelnut trees, the damson bush, the buddleia, the peach tree and a few other things. How lucky am I that I get to just pansy about pretending to garden and yet Mr. Muscle does all the hard grift! I'm not quite as bad as Margot but sometimes I feel like it!For those that don't know it, The Good Life is a UK series from the '70s and just one of the sweetest series ever. Tom and Jerry (ha ha) are two executives working at the same firm when Tom and his wife, Barbara, decide they want to drop out of the rat race and become self-sufficient. They live in a posh part of London, next door to Jerry and his snobby wife, Margo, and we got to watch their trials and tribulations over a few series and, more importantly, how the friendship between the two couples developed despite their differences!And finally, we put the clocks back on Saturday night/Sunday morning this weekend, but does anyone seriously want 2021 to last another hour longer than necessary? Answers on a postcard!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Thursday 21 October 2021", "text": "My friend got back from a month in Spain recently so we decided that we should get out walking again before the snow comes. We both like the cold weather but walking on snow is not a favourite! Actually she slipped and fell on the ice last winter, banging her knee heavily, and is pretty much convinced that is how the pulmonary embolism she got in February came about! Either way, her stay in hospital frightened her so since leaving hospital she has been extremely disciplined about getting out walking and losing a fair amount of weight, so hats off to her! Anyway as the weather was good we set off on Tuesday to do an \"uphill\", although yet again we ended up doing more \"uphill\" than I think either of us wanted! Yeah, if one of us learned just a little about orienteering we might do very well!Since I had to drop my car off to get my snow tyres put on we took her car and set off for Plaine Joux, which has got to be one of the most beautiful spots around here, even though pretty much everywhere is lovely. We decided to park down at the lac Vert (the green lake), which is very small but beautiful, particularly at this time of year obvs. Lac VertShe told me she had been out this way a few days previously and had \"found the new 'Himalayan footbridge'\" but had been too scared to cross it. Now this is the bridge I had gone looking for about a year ago and couldn't find it (again, my map-reading skills leave a lot to be desired), but it turned out it was just a 30 minute walk from the lac Vert so off we went. On the way there we passed two forestry workers sitting on a bench having their lunch and I commented to them that they must have the world's most scenic lunch spot - and of course they agreed!The view from the bench (that's the Mont Blanc in the distance)!Well we found the footbridge and my friend told me that she turned back last time. So I said I would turn back with her if she wanted but I was happy to go over the bridge too - and she took the bait! Yep it was wobbly and she mentioned that not long after they'd built it they'd had problems with one of the cables and had to close it for a while (now that's reassuring isn't it), but over it we went and it was great! On a side note, as a follow-up to her stay in hospital my friend has had to have a whole barrage of tests (you know, half of which she should have been doing routinely but never got round to) and so she's got to go back shortly for a colonoscopy - which she is dreading! And she was saying how awful it is to have to provide poop samples on three consecutive days if you don't usually go every day (I know, don't we have wonderful conversations) so I told her that if one of the cables on the bridge looked a bit iffy this time I don't think she'd have any problem providing those stool samples (nor would I, I suspect)!Anyway, we made it, feeling very proud of ourselves and decided to take a break for lunch - and look at the cute little picnic table we found!After that we got a bit side-tracked because our intended route was closed off due to forestry work so we ended up chasing our tails and hoping there be no damn bears in these woods because we went way out of our way before finally making it back to the road where we were appalled to see it indicated 6 km uphill to get back to the lac Vert! Damn! We were starting to get to the point where we'd had enough but if you need to walk another 6 km to get back to the car what choice do you have?But we made it back up to Plaine Joux which, as I say, is probably one of the most beautiful spots around!Plaine JouxWe stopped here for a drink and a breather and were lucky enough to see a few people setting off paragliding because it was the most perfect day for it. Oh, and Anne (in Alabam), that wasn't me in the picture - sorry about that! I asked my friend if she would do it and said I thought I could probably throw myself off the side of the mountain (in a tandem jump, of course) but would have bigger concerns about the landing. Then my stupid sense of humour kicks in because at this spot we're about 15 minutes from the Italian border so I let my imagination run and was saying what if you couldn't \"steer\" the bloody thing and you ended up in Italy with the Italian border guards looking up at the sky yelling \"passaporti per favore\"!!!! Oh well, it made the lady behind me giggle!After that we got to call it a day (thank God) because I had to get back to Ford to pick up my car. But I did over 17 km (10.5 miles) and more than 21,000 steps and I'm knackered! I've really felt the front of my thighs today and was hobbling down the stairs like a little old lady - and I seriously reckon I could crack walnuts with my butt cheeks at this point, but it was a great day out and I'm so glad we did it!In other news I took a shufty at the book exchange in our local supermarket and was pleasantly surprised to find Simon Wiesenthal's book Justice Is Not Vengeance (or at least that's my translation of the French title - not sure what it's called in English), so that should be an interesting read!And finally, I just received a message from my friend to say that the French have given her an appointment for her citizenship interview end-November - just 3.5 years after she submitted her paperwork!!! Ha, by the time I started preparing mine it had all gone online and I have only been able to submit a certain number of required documents so goodness knows where that leaves me! But, in two years time I will be 65 and since I've lived in France over 25 years (both of which are pre-requisites) and am now the grandmother of a French child, I can request citizenship by ascendency at that point and, from what I understand, it's a given - no more tests, French exams, nothing, as long as I'm not a career criminal I guess. So all that work for nothing eh! Oh well, I'll take it!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 17 October 2021", "text": "So what's new? Not a lot really as I seem to be just treading water at the moment - which is annoying because the weather is glorious and I really wanted to be out there enjoying it - but I just don't seem to have the oomph right now. Oh well, it'll come back I suppose! That being said I got my 1,000 miles in sometime in September, which is pretty pathetic really because it doesn't entail an awful lot of walking on a consistant daily basis but I suppose taking into account bad weather (and the constant rain this year), it's not too bad, even if it could be a lot better!The figures on the left are km, and the miles are on the right!My friend suggested we go out walking the other week so I took him to the Lac Bleu (where the three lakes are) and I'm pretty sure he's now found his new favourite spot to walk, so much so that a couple of days later he came over again and we went to the small lake at La Tour. This lake is just five minutes from André's place so we stopped in there for a coffee too. It wasn't much in the way of km walked but I guess every little helps!Lac de la TourOn a different note, I got a shock the other day because I received a monthly bill for my mobile, one for my wifi and another one for my landline which hasn't worked in six weeks! Well that put a bee in my bonnet and I got straight on to SFR (my phone carrier) intending to read the riot act to someone - anyone - because while I didn't care about the phone not working, I was damned if I was going to pay €40 a month for the privilege! Now I hate making these calls because they must outsource them to Africa (just like the calls in the UK seem to go to India) and I have a hard time with their accents, especially when they usually have their microphone stuck in their left ear half the time! (That being said, I'll take the African accents over the French-Canadian accents any day)! Oh don't get me wrong, they are always very helpful but I hate having to tell the first person (North African) what the problem is, and then she puts me through to the next person (French-speaking African - that is if the line doesn't cut off) and I have to go through it all again. Anyway, while the second guy was, indeed, hard to understand, after I asked him to speak up we managed to figure out what the problem was. And it turned out it was me!!! Good job I never gave anyone a bollocking then isn't it!! When he asked me how I'd ended up with that particular wifi box I told him I'd been online and that was the one recommended after I'd put in my post code, but, turns out it wasn't compatible with my landline, unlike my last one, so it was never going to work! Anyway, long story short, he sorted me out with a new box against the return of the old one and guess what, the damn thing works now! What's more, since the telemarketers started up immediately, I've had the bloody thing unplugged ever since! Still, at least it's sorted and I did apologize to the young man for him getting the \"little old lady call who doesn't understand anything\" and he just laughed and said \"no problem\"! So I'm sorted, although André still isn't, but I think that might have more to do with his place being brand new and him being one of the first tenants!Moving swiftly on, the other day I was on FB and I'm starting to realize that if it wasn't for being able to keep in touch with family and friends dotted all over the place I'd probably just get rid of it because I don't like being \"advertised at\" constantly. I actually have two FB accounts because when I was leaving work I realized that I'd used my work's email as my log-in email and when I tried to switch it to my private email it wouldn't go through. So today I finally went in and deleted that account and may get rid of the main one too - but I'll have to think about that for a while! Anyhoo, a couple of days ago I got a message from Sharon, a Scottish lady I'd met in St. Lucia about six years ago, just sending a short message to ask how I was doing. A few of us did exchange contact details and very occasionally would shoot off a quick message to each other so this didn't surprise me too much. BUT, after a couple of messages \"Sharon\" asked if I wanted her to tell me about the government windfall that she'd just received and I should be interested in it because she'd \"seen my name on the list too\" - which frankly would be a bloody miracle because the U.K. population is pushing up to near 70 million and I was using my married name when we met! And then I remembered when my Words With Friends buddy in New York sent me the same message. Now this was a pretty generous offer considering I haven't lived in the U.S. for over 30 years and it's been over 40 years since I left the U.K! So I told \"Sharon\" where to shove it and now \"Sharon\" is threatening to kill me! Oh dear, some people don't take rejection at all well do they! I did get in touch with the real Sharon to let her know her page had been hacked and we ended up having a chat but gosh, these scammers/creeps are everywhere aren't they!While I was online my niece in England sent me a message to thank me for her son's birthday card and the money I sent for both her kids. She also mentioned that her 11 year old daughter had covid as she had tested positive on Sunday night. Now I'm not sure if weekly testing is mandatory for schoolkids in England or if it was just something they did for themselves, but her daughter tested positive a second time when they had a pcr test done through a testing centre! She said she'd complained of a headache a couple of days earlier and then lost her sense of smell, but other than that she was fit as a fiddle (thank God) and really annoyed that she couldn't see her friends for 10 days, while her younger brother was equally annoyed that he consistently tested negative and didn't get to take the week off school!In other news, flamboyant French businessman, Bernard Tapie, died last week and there was seemingly a great outpouring of sympathy - although not from round here I reckon. At one time he had owned Adidas, the Marseille football team and La Vie Claire (a large organic store) - had I known he was the owner I wouldn't have shopped there! I remember my colleague telling me years ago that Tapie was after buying a large factory in a nearby town and did the showman thing of landing in their parking lot in a helicopter and swearing to the workforce that their jobs were safe - and of course as soon as the sale went through he laid them all off! So nah, I don't think too many older men round here will care too much about that one!But talking of showmen, Boris (the Clown) Johnson makes me want to scream anytime I see him on TV - you know, he of the walking bloody comedy act! Oh the comedy act might - just might - have been funny before he became PM but every time I hear that buffoon crack another joke when asked a serious question I want to reach through the TV and strangle him. That's how little he cares about the country and working people. He and his cronies pushed through a hardline Brexit and even though the country's quickly going to hell in a handbasket he just doesn't care! They have already started culling thousands of pigs because they don't have the skilled workers to butcher them, nor the truck drivers to deliver them to market. So they are being culled - and Johnson's joke on TV was \"well they were going to die anyway, I mean, you eat bacon sandwiches don't you\"! Ha, ha very funny, but nope they are being \"culled\" which means the farmers will get little, if anything, for their hard work. Whichever way you go on meat-eating, surely if the animal is going to die it shouldn't be like that! Oh and then there is the truck driver shortage, which admittedly is a shortage throughout Europe and not just the U.K. But Johnson's hard Brexit meant they kicked most of those \"bloody foreigners\" out of the country and now they're short approximately 100,000 truck drivers! Then when the haulage companies finally got through to the eejit that this was serious he offered up 5,000 short-term work visas for drivers. Have a guess how many \"bloody foreigners wanted to come over here and steal those jobs\"! Can't guess? They had 27 applications for tanker drivers (of which 20 were suitable) and 100 applications for HGV drivers! If it wasn't so pathetic it would be funny! And I swear this is true, people who had obtained their driving licences pre-1999 (so that would be me then) started receiving letters from the government asking if they would like a job driving trucks because (apparently) those licences were automatically valid for someone to drive a 7.5 ton truck! Ha, I wonder if the Queen got one because not only did she get her licence pre-1999 (obviously) but she also drove a truck during WWII! Well it turns out that those letters were addressed to German citizens living in the U.K. because it was only their licences that gave them the truck-driving licence, not the U.K. licences. Still, the Queen has German blood in her doesn't she? And then there was the issue of just one cabotage stop allowed. Cabotage is, say, when you get a Polish driver comes over with a load to drop in Glasgow and previously he would have been able to pick up another load for Manchester, and then another for London, for instance, before heading back to Poland. Well they put a stop to that and were only allowing one cabotage stop so tell me where the interest would be for any haulier to be driving round Britain with an empty truck and a line 100 trucks long to process the new customs formalities and not a pot for them to piss in? I think he's had to back down on that too and allow extra cabotage stops, but can you just see the madness - and why I just want to reach through the TV screen and wring this clown's neck - and I don't even live in the U.K.? Or how about the \"wonderful deal\" they've agreed with the U.S. where they will be exporting Welsh lamb to the States? Great huh? But then why the hell would they be importing Australian lamb into the U.K. at the same time? Now I know I'm no economist but can anybody else see a simpler solution to this here? How about have Australia export their lamb direct to the U.S. instead and let folks in the U.K. eat the lamb that's being raised just a few miles down the road? I don't know, maybe that's why I'll never be rich, because that one has me completely befuddled!The U.K.'s Clown-in-Chief!Still, there is a bit of good news in this hard Brexit because I hear Tim Martin, the rampant xenophobic boss of the Wetherspoon's pub chain, has posted a loss of around £195 million for the 12 months leading up to July 2021. I'd read a different figure but either way it was a lot, because Mr. Hardline Brexit now can't get the slaves low-paid workers to staff his establishments! Couldn't happen to a nicer fella, I reckon - the cheek of those \"damn foreigners\"!"},
{"title": "I'm back!", "date": "Wednesday 13 October 2021", "text": "It was Arnie that said that right? I'm not sure - but anyways, I'm back! I realized during my self-imposed exile how much I kinda needed to put my thoughts down on paper in order to keep my brain free of mental \"static\". I never considered myself particularly political but when I think about all the things that get my blood boiling maybe I am. Anyhoo, I went offline because someone I trusted to respect my blogging privacy did just the opposite and flapped their jaws. More fool me for trusting that person! I wanted my blog to remain anonymous \"over here\" and that trust was betrayed but in the end, who cares if their need to gossip was greater than their respect for my privacy! But man was I furious! I knew I had to give it some time for me to cool down and I have because damn, if I'd written what I really thought at the beginning it would have been blue! But you know what, it doesn't matter! I considered making my blog permanently private, but ultimately I didn't want to do that. I also considering moving my blog (I have another blog) but sod it, I wanted my blog all in one place because damn it, I like occasionally reading back through it. After all, that was the reason I started my blog - well that and hopefully having someone further down the line happy to read what grandma/great grandma wrote. Maybe that will never happen - who knows - but I know I would have loved having access to my grandma or, even better, my great grandma's thoughts. So here I am, back again. I've pulled a couple of posts (thank you Marksgran for telling me how to do that) and I'm up and raring to go because, dammit, I have so much I want to get out of my head and down on paper!So what's happening here? Not an awful lot in reality, but the weather is glorious - just my kind of weather actually. It was funny because my neighbour came out of her house in a huge jacket and scarf wrapped three times round her neck and I'm out in shorts and T-shirt! Give me the cool weather any time! I had been talking to my sweet Honduran colleague about us getting together to go out walking and we finally managed it this weekend. Oh we didn't manage much walking because she has a little two-year old and we fit in our activities around what the babe wanted to do - but you know what, it was lovely. We drove down to the lake at Passy and the babe had a wonderful time playing on the swings and making sandcastles. She and I hit it off immediately because I did all the stupid \"oh what smelly feet you have\" - and I loved it - and we have plans to expand our outings to a much bigger mom and baby group (even though my \"baby\" is 29 and a daddy himself)! I don't know, I just feel I live in such a beautiful area that I need to let others in on the secret!A couple of weeks ago I went to the funeral of my dear colleague C and it was so sad. I knew where this crematorium was because I'd had the misfortune to go there before when my friend V lost her son at the young age of 21. But, what I hadn't realized was that due to all the roadworks around there my GPS sent me all over the place and I ended up making it just as the ceremony was starting! Damn! And it really was one of the saddest funerals I have ever attended. I would say the room was only about 2/3 full and the weather, being grey and miserable, certainly added to the sadness. But C's children gave her a loving send off, all the while most of us were thinking why? I guess we will never know, but somehow I feel she just might have been another victim of this pandemic. Maybe, just maybe, if people had been in work, working in their offices someone might have seen that things weren't going too well for her! Who knows!And finally (for now), Jordan and Jen invited us all over for dinner the other week. Jen, Jen's mom and I have birthdays all within a short period of time so we all got together and did a pot luck (repas canadien?) and it was really lovely. Charlie hadn't got enough sleep so while I can't say he was cranky, he definitely wasn't going to go down without a fight so I (happily) walked around with him in my arms singing to him to try to get him to settle. Well my lullabys might not have worked on the Munchkin but damn, when I turned round Jen's mom's boyfriend had fallen asleep and this is how we found Leni, the horrible cat! Ah bless!"},

{"title": "The good, the bad, and the very, very sad!", "date": "Monday 27 September 2021", "text": "I saw Sam's post today (at A New Frame of Reference blog) where she posted pictures of her autumn decorations on the mantelpiece, and seeing the word \"mantel\" took me back to a funny incident when Jordan was pretty young. I commented on Sam's blog that while it's great for kids to be bilingual, when they're young they don't often have the more extensive vocabulary of non-bilingual children because they're obviously dealing with more than one language. Anyway, one time Jordan asked me where my car keys were, and I told him \"on the mantel\". So he went inside, only to come out a few minutes later and say \"mommy, what's a mantel\"? And it kinda brought home to me how much we take for granted in our daily language! I mean, with my friends, if I can't think of an English word I just throw in the French word and (most) everyone gets it. For instance, \"the basement\" is never \"the basement\", it's pretty much always \"la cave\". I suppose you get lazy but I remember hearing my sister and her family doing the same thing once when they came over from Denmark - it was very much bastardized English! Anyway, I was talking to my Welsh friend about this one time and she recalled an occasion when her girls were quite young and one of them wanted to go to the toilet in the restaurant. R called out to her to \"remember to pull the chain\" - and her daughter had no idea what she was talking about! I mean, seriously, how long have flush toilets been around? I think she might have been showing her age there, don't you! Anyway, all that nonsense is just to say it's odd what pops into your brain sometimes, isn't it!On the \"good\" side, Switzerland held a referendum on same-sex marriage on Sunday and voted overwhelmingly in favour! Way to go Switzerland - a tad late perhaps, but better late than never eh!Then yesterday as I was taking my rubbish down to the local bins I bumped into Stan's wife, Martine. She had her four-year old grandson with her and it was the first time I'd ever met him. By golly he's a handsome lad, just like his dad, Samuel (who hopefully will be representing Nigeria in the cross-country skiing in the next winter Olympics)! When I asked how Stan was she told me that he was here in France but not doing too well as \"his leukemia isn't going well\"!!!! Say what, Stan has leukemia????? Damn! Apparently he'd been hospitalized in Nigeria but was now back home in France with his family but not doing too well. He's an absolute ox of a man and the thought of him struggling to deal with leukemia is, frankly, unthinkable! But then I remembered about 15 years ago where he had regularly-programmed 24-hour stints in hospital for them to give him blood transfusions \"to help his white blood cell count\". When I asked him what it was for he was very vague, but damn, I never saw him being this ill! So I told her while I'll obviously not go anywhere near him, if and when he's feeling a little better and wants to have a natter, maybe I could come up to their garden gate and have a chat if he's up for it - or maybe I could Facetime him, even though he only lives about 100 metres from me. We'll see how it goes, but fingers crossed for my mate Stan!And then today I received the bloody awful news about sweet C! I had known C since the day she was recruited maybe 25 years ago because of working in HR, of course, and while she wasn't a friend we would often chat if we happened to be walking down from the parking lot together. I also knew - as did most people - that she was mentally fragile! Anyway, when I left HR and moved to the same division as her, C was very kind and helpful to me because I hadn't got a clue what I was doing. Oh she could be a bit \"dippy\" sometimes, in a fun way, but I swear she never had a mean bone in her body!Anyway, a friend sent me a message the other day to say that her children and the gendarmerie had sent out a communication asking if people had seen her because she had disappeared from home on 18 September having left both her handbag and phone behind (according to her children)! Then today there was an article in the newspaper to say that her car had gone over a ravine \"as the result of an accident which occurred on 25 September\" and C was dead!!! Thankfully no-one else was involved, but I can't get my mind round the fact that if she disappeared on 18 September and the accident happened on 25 September where on earth was she during the intervening week? My hope was that she had been taken ill and ended up in hospital, and with no ID on her they hadn't been able to trace her family. Or I guess the accident could have happened on the day she disappeared and had only been discovered on 25th! Will her family ever get to know? She was 57 years old but I picture her in my mind at around 45 because that's about the age she looked to me. She was sweet and kind and I wish so much she hadn't gone like that. Her poor family - and poor sweet C! RIP hon!"},
{"title": "Well that worked out well!", "date": "Saturday 25 September 2021", "text": "I got a slip in my mail box the other day for me to go to the Post Office to pick up a parcel and yay, the two sets of The Complete Far Side that I'd ordered over a month ago finally showed up! Jordan had mentioned to me how much he likes my Gary Larsen set so that pinged an idea into my head to buy both the boys a set for Christmas! Turns out they're pretty hard to get hold of (and pretty darn expensive - over €200 each!!!) but at least they got here eventually. I was a bit ticked off when the lady told me that there was a tax to pay on them though because I'd ordered them through Amazon, France, and didn't see where it indicated that the sender was located in the U.S., so I thought damn, this is gonna be expensive! One time I ordered $110 worth of patchwork stuff from the States and ended up paying €60 in import duty, so never again. Likewise I no longer order anything from the U.K. because I'd now be liable to pay taxes on that too as we're no longer part of the E.U. Still, I thought I'd just have to suck it up, buttercup, and pay whatever it took. Turns out it was ok in the end as it only cost me €15 but phew, I was expecting a helluva lot more than that!Then last week Amazon finally reimbursed me the €700 I paid for the phone that went AWOL so I decided to take a look at what kinds of deals SFR - my phone carrier - had on their site. My two-year contract with them ended in May and I always allow it to run out because they are usually willing to make some kind of concession to get you to sign back up with them. Well lo and behold they were offering an iPhone 11 for €1 if I signed back up for a two year contract!!! That's a big saving over €700 isn't it! So I went online to fill in all the required info, stating that I wanted to keep the same number. Trouble was, when I tried to input another required code it wouldn't go through, so I ended up calling them. And wouldn't you know it, that offer was only available to new customers! Damn! The young woman told me she could indeed get me an iPhone 11 but not at that price, so I thought \"oh here we go, how much do they want now\"? Well it turns out they wanted the grand sum of €9, plus having me sign up for a two year contract at €40/month. Well that's pretty much what I pay anyway so I told her I was happy to go for it - and then she said \"oh it's your birthday soon, how about I knock €5/month off that amount and throw in a free phone case at the same time\"? Ha, so now I'm the proud owner of a much better phone than my old one, which is on its last legs anyway. Not that I really need a fancy phone because basically all I do is call, text and take photos, but at that price I'm not going to argue with them. So yay me!In other news Jen's mom called me recently asking about my Monday morning yoga class, which is just round the corner from the new apartment she will be moving to in December. I told her how much I liked the teacher, what the cost was and that I was pretty sure she could have a couple of free lessons to see if she liked it - but she should be sure to tell the teacher that she has back problems, just in case. Anyway, she came with me a couple of times and is going to sign up as she felt it did her back the world of good. I mentioned to her the first week that I wanted to stop over at Jordan and Jen's to see Charlie as he doesn't go to day care on Mondays so we called Jen and the two grandmas got to play with the babe for a couple of hours. Jen suggested we get take-out from the little restaurant in town so now we've made a date to stop over every Monday/most Mondays to see the babe and eat together. Sounds good to me!Then on Thursday I drove down to Annecy to meet up with my friend, M, who I haven't seen in about three years. She's American (and also French, through her late husband) and after her husband died about five years ago she moved to Ireland with her son when he got a job there. She's a fairly reserved person so ended up not liking Ireland at all, although goodness knows the Irish are a friendly bunch and easy to get to know! They lived in Cork and she never bought a car so I think her world kinda shrunk once they moved there. Anyway, since her son, his new wife and step-daughter wanted to move back to France (as did M), they set the wheels in motion to transfer back here and she's been in Annecy since July of this year. It's sad really because she and her husband bought an apartment in the most perfect spot in Annecy so that they could retire to it - and then her husband died at 59 and they never got to live out their dream retirement together! Just her, although since her husband was the love of her life I'm not so sure she now sees herself as living the dream!And to be honest I found her sad, still grieving for her husband and since she's so terrified of this virus she's isolating herself even more. She asked me if I would agree to take a lateral flow test when I got to her place so I said \"sure, no problem, let's both do them\". Apparently they are available for free in the U.K. (or at least in England) and her daughter bought a whole bunch with her when she came over from London not so long ago. Well, you've never seen anything like it! I had to laugh in the end because M had on a big, industrial-strength mask and rubber gloves - I told her she looked like she was preparing for a moon landing - and she burst out laughing, which was good to see. When I handed her my swab she made such a pig's ear out of it, mistakenly trying to get two drops of solution onto the kit from the swab rather than from the solution bottle. I reckon she contaminated my test with all that fiddling around because absolutely nothing happened. Not positive, not negative, nada! I swear we both had a better chance of showing up pregnant than getting a covid result from that! With her own test the colours lit up immediately and then just left one line - thus proving she was negative. So I told her to give me another test and I'd do it myself this time and of course it came back negative because I don't really mix any more either. So after that she took off the astronaut's mask and we ordered in Moroccan food, and sat on her balcony with a couple of glasses of wine yacking away - as you do when you haven't seen someone in years! And it was great, although like I say, I found her to be \"fragile\" - for want of a better word. I guess losing her husband and then withdrawing into herself during the pandemic really did a number on her! She's also got hip problems so I told her we'd go out cruising and I knew loads of walks we could do on the flat because, as she said, when they lived around here they never went out exploring like we did. It's odd but my other neighbour said the same thing and yet my ex and I were constantly out looking for new places to explore - that is until the marriage blew up, but that's a whole other story. So I told her that I can either pick her up or she can catch the train up to me and we'll go out exploring together before the bad weather kicks in. I'll even get myself some lateral flow tests each time if she would be more comfortable doing that, so it looks like we have a date! She also lent me her copy of Thoreau's Walden, which I've wanted to read for ages. She said it's pretty heavy going and looking at the miniscule print I'll have to see how I get on, but it's one more book to add to the growing pile waiting for my attention!Oh and I just finished watching Clickbait on Netflix and thoroughly enjoyed it, after giving up on The Queen's Gambit. Of course it was pretty far-fetched but very watchable and more-ish and I was convinced I'd figured out who the bad guy was by the last episode. But guess what, I was wrong, just like all those years ago when I would read Agatha Christie as a kid and feel sure I knew who the villain was - and then get it wrong every time. In my defence, Agatha Christie was a clever writer and I was a kid - but yeah, that's the best I could come up with!And finally, just a quick shout out to Tania in Essex. I see that your blog is currently unavailable so I hope everything is ok with you and yours! Take care hon!"},
{"title": "Reconnecting!", "date": "Friday 24 September 2021", "text": "Life continues as normal as it can here in my little corner of France. Nothing exciting, but nothing dramatic either! I think I've totally thrown Facebook algorithms off by blocking them from my phone because I'm now getting bombarded by adverts to \"reverse my bunions\"! I guess it makes a change from trying to improve my status as a male bodybuilder, but since I don't have bunions I am at a bit of a loss!I managed to get out in the garden to put my garden \"to bed\" these past few days and it has been lovely. The weather is glorious (25°C - just my kind of temperature), and cutting back the tomato plants and all the other foliage has really opened up space around here (does anyone else love the smell of tomato plants on their fingers or am I just weird?)! Last autumn I threw a bunch of stringy potatoes into one of my raised beds and believe it or not they have actually grown and seem to be harvesting themselves because every time I go out there, the soil is just glorious and I have a few - admittedly very small - potatoes sitting on top of the bed! Ah, simple joys. I wonder though if it was because I dumped all the mouldy grass clippings onto the raised beds that it made such a big difference to the quality of the soil! One of life's simple pleasures I guess!Talking of gardening, my gardener showed up the other day to cut my lawn and I ended up chatting with him about cutting the hedges as and when it suited him. I also mentioned that I needed my damson bush cut back and the mirabel plum tree was looking very sad, so he is going to take the plum tree out (a shame as it was glorious) as it is really sick and he will do the necessary for the rest. So I'm thinking I'll have to get looking for some more trees to plant to replace the plum and the cherry trees he's taken out - as I hate an \"empty\" back garden! My neighbour asked me yesterday if I was responsible for cutting the island in front of our houses so I told him I had asked my gardener to cut it one day when he came with his ride-on mower and I would pay him! There's nothing like paying \"the hired help\" to get something done is there, but hey, I have no intention of doing it myself, so I feel like I'm doing my bit to keep the place tidy and my gardener sure as heck is glad of the money. Actually I sat with him after I offered him a coffee (my gardener, not my neighbour) and we ended up getting into French politics and boy was that an interesting discussion! Next May we have the French presidential elections and I talked to both my neighbour and my gardener about what was going on there. While I know the pandemic will have been hard on any government to handle, Macron's authoritarianism has rubbed so many noses the wrong way - and yet I had so much hope for him when he was elected! So I was talking to my neighbour the other day about which way she thought the election might go and she was saying that while nobody wants to see Macron re-elected, the problem was that there seemed to be no viable opposition - and my gardener said the same thing! Macron basically ran against right wing Marine Le Pen last time and won but this time who knows. Not me, certainly. Oh I've seen the various politicians and understand their views as regards the pandemic, the vax passport and so on, but as to their general politics, I have no idea. We have François Asselineau, who I have appreciated very much during the pandemic. He has promised a vote on withdrawal from the EU (but for god's sake take a look at what a pig's ear that made of Britain) and NATO - but I liked him (not that I get a vote anywhere right now). Jean-Luc Melenchon - I have no idea but my neighbour says he is a nasty piece of work but talks a good talk (don't they all). But the most frightening to me is Eric Zemmour, who is more far right than Marine Le Pen! I had heard of him but only got to listen to him for the first time the other day - the racism just drips out of him like autumn rain on an oak tree. The problem is - he is very, very eloquent so damn! God knows we don't want any more Macron and his (former) relationship as Pfizer's banker, but who the hell do we have to replace him? (Try googling \"qui est le banquier de Pfizer en France\" - who is Pfizer's banker in France? - and see what pops up)!Anyway, that's enough drama for today 'cos it's my birthday. Yeah, 63 and still raring to go! I went over to Jordan and Jen's today as Jordan works a half day on Fridays so I got to see my son as well as my sweetheart grandson on my birthday. I swear if that baby smiles any wider he will tear his lips! I can see that the Munchkin is about ready to try crawling - that bum goes up in the air but then he falls flat on his nose! So I got down on the floor opposite him and the two of us grunted our way towards crawling but he isn't there yet. As Jen said, at least she got her floor cleaned because grandma and babe covered most of the kitchen area on their bellies! While I was there Jordan showed me a bathroom sink that he was given from work to replace the one in their bathroom and a tap unit that would cost €400 if sold to the public that his boss told him to take if he wanted it for their bathroom renovation!!! I had mentioned to him about working on my bathrooms little by little because god knows they need it and he said that he had a couple of new sinks that I could use in my bathroom if I just went out and bought the tap units. So job done. I can wait for the rest, he can instal the sinks and taps as and when, I can pay him good money to do that, then repaint the units under them and have half a decent bathroom started! Yay me and yay him, because I feel I really need to push him to gain confidence and get started on doing plumbing on the side!So that's about it for today at least. I met up yesterday with my dear American friend who I haven't seen for maybe four years because she was living in Ireland (more on that tomorrow). It was hard going because I find her so \"broken\", probably more mentally than physically, but I feel that somehow she's living her reality that is the US right now, despite the fact that she doesn't live there any more! I love her to bits and hate to see how fragile she has become. But, as I say, more on that tomorrow!And again I see the terrible covid stats in north America and have a hard time comprehending it from over here. But just for comparison, I took this screen shot of official stats the other day to show just how different things are here!These are the official stats from the State of Haute Savoie as at 20 September. Taux d'incidence - incidence - 71.6/100,000 - (I'm guessing that's positive tests).Taux de positivité - positivity - 1.4% (down 0.1 points)23 SeptemberHospitalisations - 50 (+5)Patients in ICU - 16 (stable - that includes all ICU patients, not just covid)Total deaths - 1,066 (stable) - since the beginning of the pandemic. The last four months have shown maybe 10 deaths.Discharged from hospital (since the beginning of the pandemic) - 5,335 (+3)Regional statistics:R number (at 12 August) - 1.08  Taux d'occupation en réa (ICU bed occupancy) - 24.5% (today I just saw 12% but that hasn't been posted yet).So of course I don't understand what's going on in north America and I can't relate. I hope you will see now why my reality is so very different from so many of yours. Either way, stay safe!"},
{"title": "In praise of small businesses!", "date": "Thursday 16 September 2021", "text": "So I finally gave in and ordered a new iPhone from Amazon on 24 August. When it hadn't arrived after about 10 days I  just put it down to ... well, whatever the excuse is at the moment, really. Not to worry, though, as my current phone still works, albeit in a somewhat temperamental manner when I'm out and about. But the other day I thought it really was taking a long time so I looked up my order on Amazon France and saw that it had been \"delivered on 26 August\"! Well not a bit of it! I haven't seen hide nor hair of that thing and since it was being transported by Chronopost (meaning it had to be signed for), I contacted Amazon by email to ask what gives. To be fair, they have always been very efficient, and they got back to me immediately saying they would put a trace on it, even though they \"expected it to be delivered in the next 48 hours, but in any case they would get back to me by 3 September at the latest\". When that didn't happen I waited a bit longer and contacted them again, but this time by phone. After a few goes back and forth with the young woman I asked why it was so difficult to trace something that had to be signed for and she couldn't answer me. Anyway, she told me she would have to contact her supervisor and we made arrangements for someone to call me at 10 a.m. last Monday - and you guessed it, nobody called! Again I have to say that this is most unusual for Amazon as on the rare occasion I have had a problem, they have always resolved it very quickly!So yesterday I got p...ssed off and sent yet another email giving a résumé of the situation and asking when I was going to get my money back (€700 if you're interested). Well I finally got an email from the young woman I spoke to on the phone and she said she had issued a reimbursement order and to give it between five and seven days! Just on the off-chance I tried checking my credit card on my phone but so far, nothing yet. Trouble is, checking my credit card on my phone only works once every couple of times at the moment. Ditto trying to update my French banking app to incorporate a new security code that they are insisting on. Every time I try to do this I get a message telling me \"this service is currently unavailable\", so today I received a letter from them giving me a second code that I will have to input any time I want to make a purchase online. On a side note, I would be absolutely delighted if Amazon reimbursed me and then my phone finally showed up because on the couple of occasions I've had this happen and contacted them to find out how to return the item when it subsequently showed up, they've told me to keep it!!! Somehow I don't see that happening though, do you! I also have another large package which is waaayyy delayed too (two compendiums of the complete works of Gary Larsen. I have one myself and wanted to get one each for my sons for Christmas since they love mine). Well these haven't turned up yet either (although order tracking confirms \"the plane has landed\" - though where, I have no idea!). So now I'm wondering if these delays are due to the pandemic, a labour shortage or the global economic situation - who knows!Then last week I received my new wifi box since my old one must be about 15 years old and is also on its last legs. Well I messed around with that thing for ages and couldn't get it to work, which again is odd because I had no problem setting the first one up. So in the end I asked my neighbour for help and he realized that the sim card codes I was trying to input were for my telephone and not for the wifi box. Just FYI, if you are ever told to insert a sim card into a wifi box (or into anything really) where you have to push it out of its plastic support, for goodness sakes don't throw that little piece of plastic away because that is where your codes and passwords are, in tiny, tiny letters on the back! I didn't know that but thankfully hadn't thrown it away and he was able to get it up and running! Just as a test, he called his wife using my home phone (which was now running off the new wifi) and everything seemed hunky dory - well that is until about 30 minutes later when I realized that my home phone no longer worked!Well I've tried everything to get it to work and even ran down to a little shop in town (where André bought a whole bunch of stuff for his apartment) and explained my problem to them. The guy took his time and explained to me exactly where the cables should be hooked up and when I asked to buy a specific cable to do the hook up he just handed one over and told me to take it home and try it out - and come back tomorrow to pay for it if it worked! And he doesn't even know me (even though I've shopped there a few times). I have to admit I was a bit surprised at that. I mean, why should they trust me to come back and pay the next day? Oddly enough, about 15 years ago my husband and I were looking at furniture in a town about 30 minutes from here when we spotted a couple of paintings that we liked that were done by art students, but couldn't decide which one we preferred - so the guy told us to take them both home to get a better look at them and then come back later and settle up with him!!! Seriously, how great is it that there are still such trusting people around!In the end I found my own cable to hook up the phone and the wifi box but yet again, my phone worked for one call and then nada! In any case I ran back into town today to take their cable back and the guy said they might well be working on a problem on the line so to give my phone carrier a call back. And that was when I got a text message from my carrier saying they were indeed working on the line and would let me know in a couple of days when everything was up and running again!So the upshot is that I no longer have a working home phone but you know what - I'm not sure I mind because I'm no longer getting the telemarketing calls! How cool is that! I guess the only downside to doing away with it all together is that I don't like handing out my mobile number to all and sundry so I usually give out my home number and tell people to start leaving a message when the answering machine kicks in! We'll see what happens, I guess, but in the meantime it's really not such a hardship to do without it (again, first world problems right)! That being said, while getting rid of the telemarketers is a definite plus, I'm still getting the occasional email from someone wanting to put millions of $$$$$ into my bank account. Actually I got one yesterday from Dr. Fatima XXXX who had \"a bank account with $10 million in it and she didn't know what to do with it\" - so I went ahead and told her exactly what to do with it! Do you think that might be why they keep coming back?But this got me thinking, if my wifi starts playing up (it's very slow in the evenings right now), my mobile phone hasn't arrived, and my home phone isn't working, how vulnerable are we if our access to these things gets completely cut for whatever reason? More and more today they are closing bank branches (they haven't used cheques in Switzerland since 2003) and pretty much everything has to be done online now. So if \"they\" cut off our access to these things where would that leave us? It's the ultimate control, really, isn't it!Last year I was reading about the wildfires (in California, I think) and one lady said that she had painted her phone number onto her horses' hooves in nail polish before setting them free to get away, (she knew that if she painted it onto their flanks if they got singed or burned it would disappear), and she was also saying that she was going to get her hands on as much cash as she could in case \"everything went down\". I must admit I had never thought about this but of course if the banking system went down for whatever reason (hurricane, earthquake, flooding, revolution!) we'd all be screwed for getting cash wouldn't we. I also remember seeing a man in Sicily at the beginning of the pandemic trying to buy food for his family but because he had no access to cash and his card wouldn't work, they refused him! I don't really know where I'm going with all this, but I guess my struggling to get everything back up and running here at the moment brought home to me how much we are at the mercy of the online system and, potentially, the powers-that-be!And finally, I started watching The Queen's Gambit the other night because I'd heard it was good. Well I'm on episode four (of seven) and yet again, so far, it's just not doing it for me. I've sat through three hours more or less watching people play chess so I'm hoping things improve in the remaining episodes because it's a bit like watching paint dry at the moment. Or maybe it's just me being difficult. I loved Downton Abbey, The Sopranos and Dr. Foster. Grace and Frankie was ok, The Kominsky Method was frankly painful, and here I am again half falling asleep watching a programme about playing chess and fixating on how wide set the main actress's eyes are! Maybe I'm just too hard to please, but if you have any suggestions for something a bit more stimulating feel free to let me know!"},
{"title": "All quiet here!", "date": "Monday 13 September 2021", "text": "There's not much going on around here to be honest - hence my not posting for a while. But at least not having much planned has given me more time to binge watch a few programmes and read several books (at the same time, usually). I've not long finished reading The Governess (thank you Ms Moon I believe) and I really enjoyed it. While I know it was fiction Marion Crawford was indeed the governess to Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret and it's written from her perspective as someone who wanted to work teaching poor kids in the slums - and ended up becoming the governess of the future Queen of England! She doesn't write particularly favourably about the \"dear old Queen Mum\" and, for whatever reason, I always felt that the Queen Mother was calculating, to say the least. How would I know? Well I don't of course, but she was just someone I didn't take to for some reason. Then I started reading Professor Chandra Follows His Bliss, which I'm enjoying too, after finishing All The Things I Never Told You. I suppose I go from wanting to read the \"fluffy stuff\" for a while and then feel I need something a bit more substantial to get my teeth into, so I started reading The Looming Tower, which is all about the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al-Queda! It's hard going because so many of them have the same name but in the end there really are only a few names that you need to hang on to. It takes you from the establishment of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt at the time of Nasser and how the different factions fought against each other, with the progressives pitted against those who wanted a return to a more fundamentalist State. It has tended to be a book that I put down and pick up again every so often as I have to be in the right mood for it, but one thing that stands out immediately is what a clever man bin Laden's father was. An illiterate, penniless Yemeni, he made his way to Saudi Arabia as a labourer and worked his way up through the ranks to become head of the largest construction company in Saudi Arabia. Of course he apparently also sired 54 children by 22 wives, with Osama's mother being just 14 when he married her and while that way of life is totally alien to me, of course, there's no denying he was a clever man!One thing that struck me in the book was that it was not unknown for men to be \"offered\" the possibility to take a wife during the afternoon and then to divorce her the next day (so State sanctioned prostitution then, or more accurately, State sanctioned sexual abuse!), and when I mentioned this to my friend he told me that he had been offered such an \"arrangement\" on one of his many work trips if he was ever \"at a loss for something to do in the evenings\"! Thankfully he turned the offer down!I have also started reading Skint Estate by Cash Carraway, detailing her horrific life in poverty in England. Her mother was violent and her father abandoned them, so she was left to make a living any way she could - with the obvious answer being prostitution and performing in a peep show flop house in London. The story pretty much starts with her finding out she is pregnant by her violent boyfriend and running away to a women's refuge in order to be able to keep her baby. Her story is gross and stomach-churning, but for someone with so little education - except what she received on the streets - she is a clever and talented writer who, I believe, was able to drag herself and her daughter up out of the gutter on the strength of that book deal!Talking of my friend, I'm pleased to say that after about eight weeks he finally seems to be back to his old self. He came over the other Friday and we walked into Cluses as I had to drop off my old wifi box with my service provider, and we easily walked 12 km that day - and this from a man who couldn't walk 500 metres these past few months! When we got back we started watching The Irishman on Netflix, as he had wanted to see it for sometime (I don't think it ever came out in cinemas here). As it's three-and-a-half hours long we didn't get all the way through it, so something tells me he'll be coming back over to finish watching that soon!I managed to slog my way through The Kominsky Method (there's another how many hours of my life I'll never get back?) but I wasn't impressed with it. Oh Alan Arkin stole the show and much of the dialogue was very clever but it just seemed to me a showcase for Michael Douglas playing an old lech so it wasn't for me. I should have realized when I started fast-forwarding through the parts where he's teaching in his acting studio that I should have given up right there and then! But I then finally discovered that I could get Doctor Foster on a streaming network called Salto and binge-watched that this past week (I told you I've really done bugger all lately). I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Foster but I do wonder if she was almost as psychopathic as her husband. It was all very gripping, but all that bed-hopping in merry old England - well, whatever next!Jen started the babe off on \"solids\" (well mush really) and he's loving it. She gives him his own spoon at the same time as she's feeding him and you just have to keep ducking if you don't want to get puréed broccoli all over your hair and clothes. She's puréeing everything herself from fresh, except for a couple of veggies that she thinks might be a bit stringy for him as yet, so she bought a couple of pots of baby food. When I asked her if they were for the crèche she said no, that the crèche makes all the food for the children themselves - the parents don't have to provide it. I was dead impressed! When I told my sister how little they pay for the crèche (around €180/month for three days a week) she almost fainted. Heck, I was paying 720 Swiss francs a month back in 1989 for André in Switzerland (it'd be over SF 2,000/month now) and when you see what a lovely crèche it is and how well it's run, I guess you have to admit it's one of the benefits of a socialist state!Anyway, that's about it for today. The only thing that grew in my garden this year was tomatoes so I've got to go downstairs and process some of that lovely produce before it goes off. Other than tomatoes I don't really know why I bother planting a garden really. I'm all gung-ho at the beginning and then just think \"sod it\" by the end of the summer and leave it to Mother Nature, who gives me a few tomatoes and makes the rest over to the slugs!"},
{"title": "Apparently I've been cancelled!", "date": "Thursday 2 September 2021", "text": "I've been on a bit of a roll this past week, getting stuff sorted and out of here and it's been great! I'd guess it's got more to do with the cooler temperatures than any \"come to Jesus\" moment on my part, but either way it's felt good to make some progress around here. Last Wednesday I looked after the babe while Jordan and Jen were getting André's stuff out of their garage (now André can deal with it at his own place)! After they'd finished Jen mentioned an old dresser that my ex and I had had in our bedroom (he took the bedroom furniture when he left) so I asked how they were going to get it out of there as it was heavy. She said she was going to put a load of stuff on FB Marketplace for a few €€€€€ to try to get rid of it - unless I wanted it back! Ha, I didn't like it when we bought it so I really didn't want it back 36 years later with water damage to the top! Frankly, I didn't think she would be able to sell it but within about 20 minutes she'd had offers on that, one of the night stands that went with it and a few other things that I would have just dropped off at the recycling centre! Who wudda guessed that people would actually pay money for that stuff. Not me, that's for sure. So then I mentioned that I had a whole bunch of stuff at home that I was planning to take to the charity shop and if she had the time and patience to post it on FB she was welcome to keep the money. For instance, my sister pushed me to buy a sterilizer when the babe was born but new moms don't sterilize bottles these days (true apparently) so I have a brand new sterilizer and bottle warmer that she can try to get rid of. Plus maybe eight copper pans in the basement that my ex bought and I didn't know what to do with. They seem to be quite sought after so anything she can make on the side will be money in their pockets! Which is just as well really because she is working this week, then taking the rest of September off on leave she has to take or she will lose it - and then from 1 October she goes on parental leave for six months to which she is entitled under French law for a first baby under the age of one year! She won't get paid for it (this is where my financial help will kick in) but at least it will get her away from this business of hospital staff having to be vaccinated and will give them six months to decide where to take it from there. I guess Jordan could look for work in Switzerland (and quite easily double his salary), Jen can retrain or she can see where her job situation stands at the end of six months. One thing I had thought though is that she might use these six months to take courses in small business management/accountability since I reckon the way forward for them would be for Jordan to set himself up as a small business owner and easily triple the salary that he is making now. You know, doing the small plumbing jobs that you can't get a bigger business to take on for love nor money around here. To me that's the way it would make sense for them to head - I'll have to bring it up with them next time I see them. And to be honest, I would be happy to take the same course at the Chamber of Commerce too as it wouldn't do any harm would it. Talking of Jen's job (as a psychiatric nurse in an out-patient hospital), I've mentioned before that they are supposed to be 12 nurses when they've only been eight for the past couple of years. Now Jen is taking parental leave and at least one nurse has just resigned so where does that leave the unit? Up the proverbial shit creek without a paddle, I would guess! Jen was telling me that the Director of the hospital where she works has asked all staff to provide information on their vaccination status, and out of around 500 staff, only 125 have so far complied!What a bloody mess! Since firefighters and first responders also face mandatory vaccination or be put on unpaid leave as from 15 September, one of their firefighter friends was telling Jen that all of the volunteer firefighers at the local firehouse have resigned, and since around 75% of the firefighters are volunteers, well they're in a bloody mess there too. Apparently in the small area they cover, they have lost three people to heart attacks in the last few weeks because they didn't have enough first responder teams to get to them in time! He said they are devastated, of course, but I suspect we're going to hear this more and more as time goes on and the stand-off continues. Conversely they were called out to a person taken ill in a residential home the other week and when the crew got there the lady director of the home asked the fireman for his pass (vaccine passport). When he told her he didn't have one and in any case didn't have to provide one until 15 September she refused to let him in!!! So they ended up in a stand-off, with the director calling his supervisor who, thankfully, stood up for the fireman, and who was eventually allowed in and was able to save that person's life!I also managed to get my backside into gear and go walking with my friend at the lake in Passy last week and it was just beautiful. I was telling her that I'd ordered a new wifi box and phone (both of which are now on their last legs), but that I hated setting this stuff up and activating sim cards and whatnot but needs must, I suppose. And then I laughed because there was a group of young kids walking behind us and I'm sure if they had understood English they would have roared laughing at the two old biddies in front of them who \"didn't know how to set up a wifi network and activate a phone\"! You know, just the way we laughed at our parents when they couldn't \"get the hang of all this new-fangled stuff\"! Heck, when my sister married a Dane and they were packing her stuff to move to Denmark, my mom told her to buy a TV in England before she left, and when my sister asked why, my mom told her that then she'd be able to get the BBC in Denmark!The lake at Passy last week!We usually do one circuit of the lake and then stop for a drink at the little outdoor cabana there. Well this time we needed the pass, of course, and since my friend has been vaccinated she went up and ordered two take-out drinks. When the girl called us to say that our drinks were ready I went up to pay and she told me to tell my friend that she couldn't sit at that outdoor table if she didn't have the pass (she did, but this young woman didn't know that)! So my friend was sitting at an outdoor table under the trees, with no other table being occupied and about 30 metres away from anyone and she couldn't sit there! Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the restaurant. They have to do what they have to do, but we ended up going from the sublime to the ridiculous, with my friend sitting on the bench and me sitting on the grass next to her!! She came over and sat with me in the grass \"in solidarity\" but might have regretted it as we both ended up looking like beached whales when we tried to get up!So this got me to thinking about how this vaccine is so polarizing in, say, the States, and yet not at all over here, and then I realized it's a matter of numbers. From what I see in the States the situation is horrendous but here? Nope, can't see it at all. I've mentioned before that I check the government statistics every day for Haute Savoie (this département - State, if you like) and there have only been 10 deaths attributed to covid in the past 10 weeks! And current bed occupation in ICUs in this State is only at 37%, including all medically sick, not just covid patients. In fact, the hospital statistics are for the State of Haute Savoie and the State of l'Ain, because Ain doesn't have any hospitals and anyone getting sick there either goes into Geneva (if they are covered in Switzerland) or comes into Haute Savoie. In fact, one of the ladies from my sewing club called me yesterday re sewing and when does it start up again and so on. She's a nurse in the second-largest hospital in Haute Savoie and was saying that while they have had a few covid patients on the wards (not in ICU), it's mostly been a case of \"a bad cold\" (her words, not mine) and they have been able to release them after a few days in hospital. So you see, we're not seeing a pandemic - at least not round here - and so whether or not you're vaccinated is not dividing society and pitting people against each other!Another thing that is not only not dividing people - in fact it's uniting them, if anything - is this bloody vaccine pass, which I don't think is working out the way the government were hoping. Since it was introduced, all shopping centres larger than 20,000 square metres (so shopping malls, basically) are off limits to anyone without a pass. Except, lawyers have been filing complaints against this (so far four have been overturned), supported by the malls themselves, (of course €€€€ talk), who have seen their revenue go down by between 15 and 40%! Over here, if you want to use a shopping cart you have to insert either a coin or a token and it frees your cart from the storage bay (that ensures that you take your own cart back and they don't have to pay anyone to round up stray carts). Well protesters near Marseilles recently rounded up all the shopping carts in the parking lot and strung them together across the entrance to the mall, thus blocking access to anyone and everyone! Then you have the ridiculous situation where you can get on the Paris metro (the underground train line) without a pass but you can't sit on a café terrace and have a cup of coffee, so in Reims recently, protesters staged a sit-in picnic in the pedestrian area in front of the cafés and restaurants where they would normally be spending their money!A protest picnic in Reims!Goodness knows the French could have an argument in an empty room, but it has been surprising even to me how much people are sticking together and boycotting the places that require the pass. Masks are still mandatory in any indoor public places and I have never seen anyone kick off about that, but the pass? It seems to be a big \"no thanks\" all round!Then on Monday night I attended an emergency meeting at the Mairie where we have our sewing club, the point of which being to inform all the different associations/clubs about the situation regarding the vaccine pass. One of the ladies had been the President of the entire Association for many, many years, and had taught theatre to adolescents (on a voluntary basis) for over 30 years. Well Catherine let rip a rant which was worthy of a balcony in Buenos Aires, all the while being vaccinated herself. She was so lit up, saying that the whole point of this pass was to divide the nation (it hasn't) and how ridiculous it was that you could go to Sunday services at church without a pass, but you couldn't attend the same church in the afternoon to listen to a recital! She went on and on as she was so angry about the whole thing and when she'd finished I started clapping - and everyone joined in! And she's right! There is no coherence at all to this damn pass and everyone knows it. Like I've said before, firemen have to get vaccinated but not police officers, gendarmes have to get it but not politicians (who can number 500 people when the National Assembly is in full session)! Damn, it makes your head spin! So Catherine's response was that she would not be checking anyone's pass if they want to attend her workshop, the yoga lady said the same thing and that she would suspend activities in solidarity. I told them that I intended to resign rather than check passes for a club that I was not allowed to attend and on and on it went! The MJC (where I used to take pilates classes) has seen its membership drop through the floor, the MJC where I take my Italian lessons is off limits to me without the pass, so Italian has gone out the window, and I've just learned that the Tuesday afternoon yoga class is \"mandatory pass\" too, so that's off limits to me too (actually I suspect no-one will re-enrol). But you know what, I can live without all of this stuff but how are these associations going to survive if this keeps on? They're probably not, right! In theory the pass is mandated until 15 November and is legal under the Constitution as an \"urgent, temporary measure\". I guess it remains to be seen if they will try to extend it beyond 15 November and/or if they have the stomach to watch so many of these small businesses go under as a result!In other news, I managed to get another six bags of stuff out of the garage and dropped off at the charity shop the other day, as well as tearing the top bedroom apart and getting it scrubbed from top to bottom now that André has moved out. While he was here I flicked the vaccuum around on occasion but nothing more than that. Since he's moved out I've managed to pull all the furniture away from the walls and get in every nook and cranny to clean and boy does it look better up there (but eeewww, behind the wardrobe)!All 12 of the apartments in André's building are apparently sold but so far only six people have moved in, so the other day he had an apéritif and invited all the neighbours as a \"get to know you\" kinda thing. It seems that they are mostly young people so it could turn out well for him. He'd already met Priscilla, his immediate neighbour, but when he had some friends round last week he invited her also. At around 11 p.m. she said she was leaving as she had to work the next morning but they stayed up until 5 a.m. chatting. So at 5 a.m. she sent him a text message, words to the effect \"you dirty stop-out, staying up all night and here's me getting up to start work\", so he went round to her apartment with a coffee for her and rang the doorbell - and she burst out laughing! Hmmm, she's single and cute so .... (or is it just me adding two and two together and getting five)?And finally, on Tuesday night I was invited to dinner at my friend's house in Switzerland. He was the person I worked most closely with during my last five years at work. It was only when I got there, though, that I found out I was the only woman. Oh well, not a problem, I knew everyone, except one new colleague anyway. So we ended up being the new guy (a very nice Bolivian), a Chinese colleague, a Pakistani, my Uruguayan friend and me! They were already on the G &Ts when I got there but I turned that down in favour of a glass of wine. It was all right for them as they all lived in Geneva and were taxiing home but nope, not for me. I had two small glasses of wine over a five-hour period and then switched to water as I had a long drive home! But - and I don't know if it's age or what - the wine seemed to give me a stinking headache almost immediately so maybe I can no longer tolerate the histamines/sulfites(?) in white wine either. Damn, I may well end up teetotal before I know it! In any case, C cooked us a lovely meal and I had great fun meeting back up with these guys. Ali, the Pakistani, is a real hoot and can tell story after story! He was the guy who staggered into my office on my last day bearing wine and snacks because he wasn't letting me go without a party. If you remember I was so pissed off at my director that I decided I was leaving (after 35 years) without giving a drink. Well Ali had other ideas and soon everyone was crowding into my office and I ended up having what I reckon was the best leaving do ever! So yep, I had a great evening and it was so lovely to see them again amid all this doom and gloom. C will be helping his father retire back to Uruguay (from Belgium) soon, helping his Romanian grandma move back to Australia and will have his mom moving in with him as she doesn't want to go to Romania, Australia or Uruguay, so Geneva it is! Not sure when I'll get to meet up with him again but I'm sure it'll be great fun living with his mom (NOT!). He says he's moving in with me when that happens so I guess it's just as well I've managed to clean the skeletons out from behind the wardrobe in André's room. Oh happy days - poor guy! That'll be something for him to look forward to, I guess!"},
{"title": "Just needed a break!", "date": "Sunday 22 August 2021", "text": "I decided to take a break from the news and social media for a few days this week because it was starting to get me down. \"Starting to get me down\"? Maybe not, I'm sure it's been affecting all of us in some way or other for the past goodness knows how long, right? I guess sometimes you have to say to yourself \"well there's nothing I can do about it is there\" - by which I mean for me at the moment the appalling situation in Afghanistan. My heart breaks for those people - more especially the women and girls who are stuck there with a bunch of swaggering neanderthals and who will shortly be laying down their own version of the law and how these women will be \"allowed\" to live their lives! So I had to turn it off for a while!That's not to say that we don't have our own problems closer to home, of course. I'm sure many of you see what's going on here in France and the passe sanitaire which will supposedly only be required until 15 November. Well if you believe that I've got a bridge in Paris I can sell you. The only way I can deal with that is basically keep myself to myself for the most part, which was when I realized the other day that other than going grocery shopping I haven't been out for weeks - well not counting seeing my kids. I haven't seen my friend in about six weeks, though I spoke to him today and thankfully he is starting to feel better. So we haven't been out walking and I think that might be part of the problem. I haven't been out walking and I realize how much I need some form of exercise for my sanity. Mind you, I reckon I always get a bit like this in summer in any case because I just can't function in the heat. Still, from what I've seen we had about 10 days of \"summer\" and our temperatures are already going back down to \"autumn\" levels, so maybe I'll take myself out walking this week and become all Pollyanna-ish again! I guess also having André move out might have had an impact because at least I had someone to talk to occasionally, even if he did spend a lot of the time in front of his computer. Jen asked me if I would watch the babe on Wednesday while they get the rest of André's stuff out of their garage, so that'll be something to look forward to. He's just started taking more and bigger bottles per day so as she reckons he's getting hungrier and needs more than just milk, she puréed courgettes yesterday and has started trying him with a couple of spoons of that. Judging by the turned up nose the jury's still out on that one (I told him to push for chocolate ice cream tomorrow), but he's eating it slowly anyway so it's a start!Since I've been at home so much lately I'm also getting the full force of the bloody telemarketers. The other day I got seven calls on my home phone and I reckon they are all from two different companies because the only things that change each time are the last two digits on the number calling. I mostly just black list them on my phone but they obviously have more numbers available to them than I have fingers to hit the \"black list\" button. Still, I never answer them, just let them go to the answering machine and of course the big give away is that they never leave a message. I reckon at least one of them is from my mobile phone carrier because my contract with them expired in May and they are obviously desperate to get me to sign up again. I still haven't decided whether I will take up another two-year contract and maybe update my phone through them, or just go ahead and update my phone without signing back up. The jury's still out on that one too!I did finally get my backside into gear though and sorted out a whole ton of bed linen to put in the charity bin - some of it still in the original packaging! It was all in good condition (I cut the \"iffy\" stuff up for rags) and I matched sheets with duvet covers and pillow cases but in all honesty, how many sets of linen do I need? Jen took one set that she liked and André took two others but all in all I threw out seven 30 litre trash bags of linen, one bag of clothes and I have two more bags of stuff that actually needs to be taken to the charity shop. I also picked out a few Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs books to put in the book exchange at the local supermarket, where I'm glad to say they've already been taken! I initially liked Patricia Cornwell very much but eventually decided there were only so many books I could read about \"exhausted forensic pathologists\" so put them in the \"donate\" bag without taking the time to check if I'd already read them. Next job has to be sorting all the pretty plant pots, vases and trinkets I've collected over the years. Sure they're pretty, but as Anne was saying (at New Happenings) if you haven't used an item in years, why hang on to it when someone else might get some pleasure out of it!In other news, I follow a couple of vloggers on Youtube, one of whom I really like for his down-to-earth no-nonsense approach, mainly to the ever-more-evident benefits of Brexit (I'm being sarcastic) and while I don't agree with him on everything, I have to admit I enjoy listening to him slam Boris Johnson and this Conservative government for their complete lack of ability (or desire?) to govern. On that I agree with him completely. I heard someone (I think it was Michael Heseltine) once describe Johnson as \"someone who looks to see which way the crowd is running, dashes to the front and shouts 'follow me lads'\" and I think he's spot on! (The vlogger in question is Phil Moorhouse at A Different Bias, if you're interested)!Another vlogger who is quite interesting (but I really don't like his delivery style) made a vlog this week about \"a kipper\" as he calls them - someone who voted for Brexit but who has been living in France on the quiet for years! While the guy had every right to live in France, after a period of 183 days of living in the country you are considered fiscally resident and yet so many of these Brits (mainly in Spain and France) never registered their cars in their E.U. countries and you can be pretty damn certain they claimed to be still living in the U.K. and never regularized their status here. Well he just found out that this one guy stated that he was \"going back home\" and when asked why it was because \"he didn't want to lose his Britishness?????\" (what, buck teeth and a face like a horse)? No the real reason would be because now that deadlines have passed for applying for residence permits (we three have ours thankfully), the local authorities will start chasing up these \"temporary residents\" in the British registered cars and coming after them for unpaid taxes. What's more, the vlogger also found out that the \"kipper\" had a council house in the U.K. (subsidized housing) which was paid for by the local council and he had a mate living in it and paying him £1,000/month in rent on the quiet, so he was getting the best of both worlds! That kind of thing makes me so mad so I guess you can see why I had to get off social media for a while!Then we had the rather satisfying case of that other prat, Nigel Farage, finally getting somewhat of a comeuppance the other week. He's another politician who plays the \"hail fellow, well met, friend of the people\" but who, in my opinion, is just in it to line his pockets like so many of the others. Well he made a comment the other day that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) were basically now just a taxi service helping refugees to cross the channel in rubber dinghies into Britain and they should be prosecuted! I can't quite remember but I think he actually mentioned introducing a draft law into Parliament to propose just that - prosecuting the RNLI and others in the same situation. On a side note, if the powers that be can't solve the refugee crisis then I'm sure I wouldn't know how to, but to expect the RNLI not to provide assistance to anyone in distress in the middle of the Channel is downright evil. The RNLI are my favourite charity, well respected and staffed totally by volunteers, but they are not a charity in the sense that they receive no funding from the British government because they want to have complete control over the way they operate. Well the uproar caused by Farage's comment was so great he ended up back-tracking as fast as his little legs could peddle, but someone set up a Go Fund Me in favour of the RNLI and it raised over £200,000 in one day! Way to go that person!So thankfully I seem to be coming out of my funk for now and have yet again realized that the best way to keep a positive attitude in these rotten times is to keep plodding on with the exercise. And apparently Facebook seems to agree with me because I'm still getting the \"sites that may interest you\" which all seem to be about competitive cycling! I have no idea what kind of algorithm they use to suggest these sites - or maybe I'm getting a bit masculine looking in my old age, but I've just received one suggestion for a bodybuilding site called \"Men's Physique - Posing and Flexing\"!! Ha, maybe I'd better make an appointment to get my whiskers taken care of sooner rather than later!"},
{"title": "Hmmm, so what if ...?", "date": "Sunday 15 August 2021", "text": "Well summer seems to finally be upon us, arriving in one fell swoop since last week and it's scorching here. While it's been a pain in the butt to have had so much rain for so long, I can't say I mind having missed out on these temperatures for the last six weeks or so as I just I can't take it. Which I guess is kinda sod's law that André and I ended up moving the vast majority of his stuff out to his new place this week. On Wednesday I was up and down stairs like a mad woman, packing and loading stuff and then in the afternoon we went back to the store where he bought most of his furniture to get a few extra items (coffee tables, book cases, shelves for the garage) and by the end of the day we were both wrecked. Then on Thursday I took him to a store where he could get most of the remaining stuff he needed (you know, like trash cans, linen baskets) at a reasonable price, a quick drive through Mickey D's for lunch and then back to his place to unload. Friday I told him he really needed to get some grocery shopping done because the truckers' union had threatened to bring the country to a stand still starting this weekend over the pass sanitaire and he might not make it out his front door. Oddly enough it hasn't happened because Macron decided that truckers (along with the police, the military and politicians???) should be exempt from being required to have this vaccine for their work and their truck stops/watering holes would also remain open to them! So there's method in his madness because (so far) they haven't gone on strike, but the fact that those four categories of people will not be required by law to get the vaccine proves - to my mind at least - that this pass is anything but sanitaire! But ... I digress. So I showed André where I got all my fresh stuff if I didn't want to go to the market, then on to the frozen food store which is excellent (I'm sensing he will be living at this place), and finally to the regular store for the rest of his stuff. Now this supermarket chain regularly has promotions whereby you get a sticker for every €10 you spend and it enables you to buy other goods at much reduced prices. They were doing that with wine glasses and then Tupperware recently, but I only collected the stickers because my neighbours wanted them. But this time they are doing a good deal on towels and for 10 stickers and €10 you can get one very good quality bath towel, so I started collecting them thinking they would come in useful for André. Well I had parked and gotten there before him and while I was waiting a man came up to me and asked if I collected the stickers only he had a whole pile of them and had no use for them. When I said yes I would be glad of them he handed me an envelope full, so André now has a whole pile of bath and hand towels on order for about a quarter of the regular price. I hate to even think what he has spent this past week though, but he's keeping track of it and said he is still fine. I sure hope so! Then yesterday I went over to Jordan's to make sure Leni the horrible cat was ok and decided to spend an hour there with him reading (me, not him) so that he would have some company. Can you believe I even gave him cat treats and the little rat still treats me with utter contempt (well after he'd had the treats that is). Oh well, I did my bit, cleaned up his food and put fresh water down for him and heck, I even emptied the cat shit out of his litter and there's not one bit of gratitude! While I know most cats are more affectionate than Leni, it just confirms to me that I'm not a cat person as I don't want to go shit shovelling for an ungrateful cat, and in the end, although I like dogs more, I really don't want to do it for dogs either, so that, at least, has put any idea I might have had about getting a pet to rest!After that I went back up to André's (he was out running around) and spent about five hours emptying boxes and putting stuff away in this bloody heat! Man does he owe me big time. But you know what, I love his apartment and it's giving me vague thoughts of \"hey, why don't I move too\"? I'm very impressed with the builder and who needs a house when a two or possibly three-bedroomed apartment will do the job just nicely? I reckon I could sell this, buy an apartment and walk away with about €100,000 so it would make sense too.  Hmmmm, has the seed of an idea just been planted?Now I love where I live, the village is beautiful and my neighbours are great, so there's that to consider, but more and more I like the idea of being able to at least walk to a shop or a restaurant rather than having to take the car everywhere. Oh I wouldn't get that where André lives either so the choice of location would have to be carefully considered, but I'm beginning to like the sound of it. Of course it would mean some serious down-sizing/decluttering this end, so with that in mind, after I'd finished cleaning today I worked for about two hours sorting and putting stuff aside for either André to take or for Goodwill! We'll see I guess, because this burst of enthusiasm has so far lasted 24 hours. I really do love this village as it is so picturesque but who knows what the future holds. It's kinda exciting just thinking about it all the same!Jordan and Jen leave Brittany tomorrow and will drive through the night in the hope that the babe will get as much sleep as possible. They've had a great time and wonderful weather, although Charlie didn't like his first experience of the sea - he was afraid of the waves! But talking of the heat, I saw on the news that Syracuse in Sicily has just registered the highest temperature in Europe (I believe) - 118°F!!!! Wow, it was scorching the day I visited and it was nowhere near that temperature - but what a stunning place that was!Syracuse, SicilyI bumped into my friend at the mailbox the other day and we were discussing her upcoming trip to Spain (I'll be taking her to the airport) and I was saying how much I would actually like to go back to the UK and travel around, something I feel Steve and I would have done together if he hadn't died! She feels the same as I do in that when we used to go back home, it was always to see family, so you never really visited other places and there are so many places I would like to explore. André and Lily fell in love with Yorkshire and the Isle of Skye on their last trip to the UK, and my niece has just spent a week in the Lake District (I have fond memories of Youth Hostelling there) after which she and her family made their way slowly back to their home in the south of England, stopping off in various beauty spots for a night or two on the way back. She always takes loads of photos and it's really whetted my appetite to go back home whenever that might be possible and do a long trip! It ain't happening yet of course but it's nice to dream isn't it!This isn't a very good picture, but it's of The Shamblesin York, which was the inspiration for Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter movies!"},
{"title": "All change!", "date": "Wednesday 11 August 2021", "text": "Things are starting to move again around here, starting with the weather, which has finally hit the kind of temperatures we would normally expect this time of year. Would you believe last week we only managed 16°C (60°F) and it rained all day? I mean, by the time August gets here we're usually desperate for the 15th to roll around in the hope that it might start to cool down a bit, but this year? Not a bit of it! Well that was until this week when we've finally started getting up to about 33°C (90°F) - even though this time of year we'd normally be hitting as high as 38°- 40°C. Still, I'm not complaining about missing those temperatures!The people showed up to André's new place yesterday to install the kitchen and need to come back tomorrow to provide the finishing touches and then he's pretty much set to go. I think he's talking about moving out good and proper on Friday night, but there's no rush as he can stay here as long as he wants, obviously. Still, nine months of having him here hasn't been bad at all and he was able to save up a good amount of money, which has allowed him to get pretty much everything he needs for the apartment. I guess it's sod's law though that today was the day we ended up moving most of his stuff out of my place - and also the hottest day of the year so far! We had a pretty good removal system going between the two of us but given that my house is on four floors I was a sweaty mess by the time we'd got most of it loaded up into our cars! Still, his place is lovely and we got to sit and enjoy a beer on the balcony when we were done (for as long as we could stand it, because the sun was scorching)! First thing he's gonna have to buy tomorrow will be a couple of parasols for the balcony because we could barely open our eyes, it was so bright! So tomorrow we're off to IKEA, Geneva, to have a shufty and pick up some smaller decorative items! I love going to IKEA, but I also love leaving the place as it can be so tiring - that's if you can even find your way out of there. Very crafty bit of consumer-promotion that - make the buggers keep walking round and round until they promise to buy something if only you'll let them leave!My ex was supposed to be arriving here to meet Charlie for the first time on 25th August, but when I commented to André that his dad would love his new place he told me that he wasn't coming, but was pushing his trip back to next March! Say what???? Although he has had both vaccinations it turns out that he can't provide a \"QR code\" to prove this and so would not be allowed to land in Switzerland (although crossing the border into France is usually not a problem)! When I asked how he proves he's been vaccinated in the States André said he doesn't have to (at least not in PA), nor do they have to wear masks. I don't know, I don't understand any of this any more because I thought there was some sort of equivalence to allow foreign travel to start up again - but apparently not! Who knows!Jordan and Jen are in Brittany at the moment staying at Jen's best friend's and the weather looks lovely up there too, although it can be very windy. I'm so glad they've got to have something of a break too because it's been a tough year for them both - well, like for most people, I guess!I'm starting to get itchy feet a little with the travel bug but since I won't be going anywhere until at least next spring I'll have to get back out into the mountains as soon as the weather cools off a bit, just to make it feel like I've actually done something this year! Not a lot, admittedly, but at least something! It's been about 15 months since we were supposed to go to Holland (to see the tulips) and come back via Germany, but that was cancelled because of covid of course, so I'm thinking that in a couple of months I should be getting the money back for that trip (as well as a short trip to Italy) - crikey, it's amazing how much you save when you never do anything isn't it!My house phone has been ringing off the hook these past couple of months (I always let it go to the answering machine), when I realized the other day that my mobile phone contract with SFR (my carrier) had expired so it's probably them plugging me into speed dial so that they can sign me back up to a contract. Just out of curiosity I looked to see what they were offering by way of incentive, and did the calculations on renewing with them and getting myself an iPhone 12 at a much reduced price. But, I'm getting quite good at sitting on these things too because while I think I probably need to upgrade my phone, to be honest, I don't really care that much about phones either. I also looked into buying an iPhone through the Apple site and the prices aren't too bad there, but I think I'll leave it for a bit as my current phone is ok, even though I had to change the battery last year. And talking of phones, somehow I stumbled across a couple of Youtubers called \"Payette Forward\" (basically \"iPhones for idiots\") and they walk you through which phone settings you can easily turn off in order to not only save your battery but also to limit somewhat the apps that can track your phone usage. While I knew that Facebook was automatically loaded onto my phone when I got it, I hadn't realized that the FB tracker is defaulted to \"on\" when you get your phone. So they explained that by turning this one particular setting \"off\" (and loads of others), you can not only save your battery but also afford yourself just a tad more privacy, although I know darn well Big Brother is constantly watching of course. I tend to use my computer rather than my phone for FB but oddly enough, since I turned off this app setting on my phone, I'm now getting the weirdest suggestions of \"sites you might like\" when I log into FB on my computer! Half the bloody things seem to think I'm some kind of cycling fanatic and could give a toss about where the latest races are or what the best deals on bikes are! Well I guess, if Big Brother is watching me at the moment, he must be slightly drunk, because I can't block these cycling ads quick enough!And finally, whenever someone mentions a book, a movie or a series that they've enjoyed I write it down for \"the times when I can't think of anything better to do\" .... which will most likely be more often now that André is moving out. So with that in mind I started watching The Kominsky Method on Netflix and I have to admit it's growing on me. I've never been much of a fan of Michael Douglas, but the writing is very clever and I think Alan Arkin (so far) has just stolen the show. To be continued, I guess!"},
{"title": "In praise of the stay-at-home mom (or dad)!", "date": "Thursday 5 August 2021", "text": "I've been taking care of Charlie full-time this week as the crèche closes for the month of August and Jordan and Jen only start their vacation (they're off to Brittany) next week. Now that he's well again he is his usual adorable self but I'd forgotten just how hard it is taking care of a baby full-time. You can't do anything on the spur of the moment and have to plan everything around the baby's schedule! Plus if you do have to go out you basically end up packing for a Himalayan trekking expedition! Oh I know you build up to it and you definitely develop a routine as time goes on with your own kids, but it brought back to me just how hard a job being a stay-at-home (SAHM) is! I would have given my right arm to be a SAHM, but since I earned more than my husband and I was the one with the wonderful expat benefits it wasn't to be. Ultimately the fact that I kept my job worked in my favour because I was able to comfortably divorce my husband (receiving no spousal or child support of course) when he decided the bar room skank was a better fit for him (she was)! More than once I've wondered where I would have ended up if I had stayed home with my kids with no income of my own, only to be abandoned for a skank at 51. Thankfully I never had to find out!Of course working full-time with young kids I, like so many others, had the constant pressure of having to run, run, run and the stress of keeping all those plates spinning was tremendous - as any working mom knows! But to anyone who wonders \"what on earth SAHM's do all day\", I would just say try it for yourself and then get back to me in a year's time! Because of course it's not just about the kids is it. There's the cooking and cleaning and shopping and homework and all the other duties that usually fall to the person that stays home. It can also be mind-blowingly stultifying to sing Old MacDonald Had A Farm on an endless loop to try to calm a cranky baby (ask me how I know - tee hee - at least Charlie knows all the names of the farmyard animals in English at this point)!At one point, when we were in the thick of raising kids and both working full-time, I spoke to my husband about the possibility of him giving up work to stay home because I felt that if we were careful financially we could have pulled it off. Trouble with that was the words \"financial prudence\" and \"my husband\" should never feature in the same sentence - as I learned to my cost after getting married. I mean this was the guy who, while drunk, went out one Saturday afternoon and bought himself a car (on credit, of course) for €40,000 (which was around $60,000 at the time), while I was driving a car that would generously be valued at around €1,000 in the divorce!!! So no, we would quickly have gotten into a real financial mess if he had given up work and we depended solely on my income. The other problem with having him being a stay-at-home dad was that I learned - through experience when he lost his job in the US - that his idea of being a SAHD was feeding the baby and maybe making dinner - but that was it. I remember coming home from work one night and he hadn't washed or dressed the baby at all that day, the washing was piled up and he was doing his usual, sitting there playing guitar. For him, as I say, being a SAHD didn't involve grocery shopping, cleaning, ironing or anything other than - well \"staying home\", so I dropped that idea poste haste! It was a shame though because I always felt life would have been easier in so many ways if one of us - it didn't matter who - had been able to stay home! So having spent a few days with Charlie, who I reckon needs an inordinate amount of sleep at the moment, it reminded me again of just how much \"unseen\" work stay-at-home moms do, Ladies (and the occasional gent), I salute you!By Katie Kirby, Hurrah For GinI used to follow Katie Kirby's blog \"Hurrah for Gin\" years ago, and I think she captured what was often the real truth about what it's like staying home with young children!In other news, André got the keys to his apartment on Tuesday so I packed for the aforementioned Himalayan expedition and took Charlie over to see it - and it's just lovely. It's on the top (second) floor of a small, new build apartment block about 30 minutes from my place. The view from his very large balcony.It's not a very good picture as I had babe on one arm andwas trying to get the picture with the other. The mountainsin the distance are where my house is - so he canwave good night to me every evening if he feels like it!On Wednesday most of his furniture was delivered and assembled, with more being delivered today. The kitchen will only go in next Tuesday but he said it is already looking good. Unfortunately he can't get a wifi connection before 18 August as so many people are on holiday, so he was initially thinking he would have to continue to work from my place. But with Jordan and Jen being away as from next week they asked him to move into their place until they get back - which works out well for them also because he can take care of Leni, the horrible cat! Seriously, this cat is a nasty piece of work who would scratch you rather than look at you (thankfully he's ok with the baby so far). I mean, the other day I had put my bag on the table with my car keys next to it. Well Leni has a handbag fetish and is forever sniffing around it. As I wanted to leave I managed to nudge my bag away from him, but in order to get my car keys I had to go get a large hooked pole (you know, the kind you close roller blinds with) and surreptitiously hook my keys away from him! The good news is that with me going over there more often to take care of the baby he now just treats me with mild contempt - and I can live with that because the feeling is mutual. But André has a better relationship with him as he lived with J and J for three months so I guess a short period of cohabitation between them will work out okay!So I'm really pleased to see that things are working out well for him and he's happy. I was asking him about work the other day and apparently he is good to work from home (primarily) for the next four years, because his employer is renovating their main building with a view to getting rid of an annex and what I presume is a ridiculously high rent. Of course he and the rest of the staff will have periods when they will have to be on site (and he is happy to go in to work anyway), but to be able to telecommute pretty much indefinitely will be a dream come true (if he did but know it), given the horrendous traffic problems we have round here. Heck, I was only asking for the occasional telecommuting days and my boss refused - hence I handed my notice in two years earlier than I intended to. But then whaddayaknow, a few months later the pandemic arrives and everyone has been telecommuting ever since. But, as I've said before, I don't regret quitting because the freedom I have gained was so worth it. And now I'm off to sing Old MacDonald to try to get the Munchkin down for his nap! Freedom? What freedom? Did I say freedom????"},
{"title": "Much better!", "date": "Wednesday 28 July 2021", "text": "I think we've finally rounded the corner with Charlie as he is much, much better today. While the fever and rash disappeared fairly quickly, he just wasn't himself and Jen was having a helluva time getting him to drink, which meant she/they were up half the night trying to coax him to drink something/anything but there was nothing doing. I had him all day yesterday and again he really was taking in very little, although to be fair I reckon he wasn't dehydrated, nor was he listless. Today he went back to the crèche in the morning but again he only took 60 ml of milk (as opposed to about a minimum of 150 ml we would aim for with each bottle). I went and picked him up at 1 p.m. and what a sophisticated place that is! I needed a code to get through the initial gate, obligatory mask, of course, then I had to put on \"overshoes\" before I could go in (fair enough, there are little ones crawling around), show my passport before they would hand him over to me, and finally as I left I had to punch in a computer screen to record  that Charlie B was being taken off the premises. Very sophisticated! When I got back to Jordan and Jen's place I offered him a bottle and he guzzled down 150 ml and then slept for three hours! Well that can't do any harm can it! He was just starting to wake up (albeit somewhat cranky) when his dad came home so I suggested another bottle as if he was still cranky it couldn't be because he was tired. So we went for it again and he drank another 110 ml and ol' smiley face was back with us again! Jen just sent me a message to say he just took another 180 ml tonight so she's relieved and I'm hoping he will get a good night's sleep so that they can get some rest too! I have to confess to the cardinal sin of plonking him down in front of the TV yesterday though to try to keep him awake for a bit while I was getting stuff together and he seemed quite taken with Scooby Doo - all the more so since Scooby pulled it off yet again and figured out who the bad guy was! Phew, it was touch and go there for a while!I also spoke to my friend today and he thought he might be feeling just a little better also. Not great (he had to keep taking a breather just talking to me), but he had been able to walk the 500 metres to the baker's without taking a break and was also able to do a little work on the computer before his sight went whoozy again! So no, he's not great but hopefully getting there, if very slowly!André gets the keys to his new place on Tuesday and when he mentioned to Max that he had better start thinking about furnishing it, Max told him he should get a move on because the sales were on but were finishing tomorrow (Tuesday). So with that André put in for the afternoon and shot off to the stores to take advantage of the sales - which nobody (except Max, obviously) had thought about, since I avoid those things like the plague. Well he came back having ordered all the \"big stuff\" - two beds, a dining table, sofa, coffee table, TV, balcony furniture etc. and today ran out and ordered smaller stuff like a vacuum cleaner, an iron (ha, what a joke), toaster, kettle and so on, so things are looking good! He's having it all delivered next Thursday and he's paid the extra to have it all assembled too. Some people don't know they're born!!!! Hell, when my ex left he took all the bedroom furniture so I ordered a new bedroom set but then nearly drove myself nuts trying to assemble it on my own (the bed collapsed a couple of times until I figured it out). But furniture was eventually assembled (and much wine was drunk) and I'm quite happy with the end result!On Sunday he went white water rafting as Max had a spare ticket from someone who had backed out at the last minute. What he hadn't realized was that it was with an association of disabled people, since Max's girlfriend is in a wheelchair following a car accident involving a wild boar. She's quite amazing though, as she and Max go out cycling every weekend and Max can barely keep up with her. He's a plumber and so is obviously pretty muscular, but André said the strength in Elise's arms has to be seen to be believed and she leaves them standing. Apparently there were three boats, made up of able-bodied friends/assistants and disabled people from the association. In André's boat they had Elise (who had to sit in the bottom of the boat because she has no use of her legs), a young man who had lost a leg in a motorbike accident, and a young-ish man who had been in a helicopter crash where he had lost a leg, his left forearm, the sight in one eye and had extensive burns all over his body. I told André it makes me wonder if I would ever have the strength to come back fighting like these people have, but hopefully none of us will ever have to find out. Max apparently whacked one of the assistants' finger with his paddle at one point and she was complaining to him about it, but when she complained about the pain in her finger the second time Elise just pointed to her own crippled legs and said \"really?\" - and they all burst out laughing! After the trip they ate in a restaurant further up the mountain and are already talking about doing it again sometime. I know André will be up for it as he said they were such a great group of people! It does make you realize how much we probably take for granted though doesn't it. So next time I feel a whinge session coming on, I hope I can take a step back and think there but for the grace of God go I, right?"},
{"title": "All quiet on the western front!", "date": "Thursday 22 July 2021", "text": "Well on the the eastern front (of France) at least, things are pretty quiet here right now. Schools have broken up and I'm guessing there has been the usual mad dash down to the beaches of the south of France - although I wouldn't know because I haven't been following the updates on the traffic exodus as I'm not going anywhere. My friend sent me a message and asked if I wanted to go walking today so I suggested the Lac Bleu as a good part of the walk is shaded and she'd never been there before. Well it was a great hit! There are several lakes which seem to be designated as one for the kiddies (the Lac Bleu), one for the kayakers/pedaloes (not sure what that's called) and a third lake called the Lac aux Dames - which is where the fishermen get to fish in peace. And it was glorious. I guess because it's not on the beaten path, even now, in the middle of July, there was plenty of room for everyone. It was just as well we were able to walk in the woods for a good part of the way though because it was 30°C (86°F) and at altitude the heat hits you like a laser. Thankfully I remembered to put sunscreen on before I left so I don't feel too bad now, although I am a little burned, but as we were out from 10.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. I'm pretty tired and sweaty too. Still it was good to get a few km under my belt for a change!The Lac BleuMy friend has been very good about getting out and walking since she was hospitalized in February (with the pulmonary embolism) and she's managed to lose 16 kg (35 lb) by being both very disciplined and active. She puts me to shame actually because I have no willpower when it comes to dieting, but we've decided that we will keep up the walking now that the good weather has finally arrived and will aim for some higher altitude walks come September and the cooler weather!Jen went back to work on Tuesday after her maternity leave and she said it was nice to be back. Tomorrow is my first day of taking care of Charlie and she just called because the crèche told her he had a bit of a temperature. She's not too worried because it's hot and he sounded really chipper and babbling away when she was on the phone. I told her she'll have to show me how to take his temperature when I get there just in case and she couldn't believe I had never taken my kids' temperatures, but nope, never, not once. In our house it was always \"put your hand on the kid's forehead\" and it was either \"hot\" or \"cold\". The French do seem to have an obsesssion with taking their temperature though and when someone would tell me theirs was \"38.5\" or whatever I would just stare at them blankly. Still, he's little and I will happily take his temperature if he's cranky, but I reckon he's also cutting a first tooth as he is chewing away on his fingers and dribbling up a river!Then the other night I watched another short Sarah Millican clip on Youtube where she was talking about sex education for children. She makes no bones about the fact that she never wanted children so was trying to remember how \"the birds and the bees\" was taught when she was a kid. There was a well known nurse (at least I think she was a nurse) in the U.K. called Claire Rayner who published (amongst other things) a book called The Body Book around 1977 which was used many moons ago to explain to kids where babies came from. Of course she made a whole comedy sketch out of it but what really tickled me was one of the comments under the video. One lady said she was trying to talk to her little boy about \"how you grow up to be a big boy or 'a daddy'\" and she opened the book to a page that showed a drawing of a naked male child next to a naked adult male, complete with hair in all the appropriate places. When she finished the little boy ran to his room sobbing, so thinking he'd been completely traumatized she explained to him that it was okay and that all little boys grew up to be big boys. And that's when he blurted out \"but I don't WANT to have a moustache\" and was inconsolable for the rest of the evening! Tickled me no end!My neighbours came round on Sunday with their granddaughter's old crib for me to have here for Charlie, so after washing the mattress cover I reckoned I could use the scrubby old sheet as a pattern and make brand new fitted sheets out of fabric that I'd bought. Well, it was ok but talk about a botch job! I'm apparently a great believer in \"that'll do\" when it comes to sewing but I did at least manage to make an elasticated sheet that fits the mattress with quite a few sins being hidden underneath! I also managed to screw up a new duvet cover. Seriously? It's a rectangle of fabric sewn together on three sides, but somehow I managed to cut it way too small and ended up having to sew strips back onto one end and hide that bit underneath too. Now all I have to do is figure out how to use the bloody press-stud inserter. It looks like a mediaeval instrument of torture and I've screwed up the studs on spare fabric three times already. I think at some point I'm going to have to admit I'm just not cut out for this sewing lark. Still, at least the bed is clean and fresh, and looks quite pretty, as long as you don't look too closely!And in order to make room for the crib in the spare room I've been sorting out yet more stuff. Damn, I knew I'd got lots of sweat pants but seriously??? It seems like every time I went to England to see my mom I bought new workout clothes, because everybody knows all you have to do is put them on and you lose 10 lbs right? No? Crikey, if I lost 10 lbs every time I bought a new pair of sweat pants I'd disappear down a drain hole. They won't go to waste, of course, because I live in the bloody things in winter, but to have that many exercise clothes in drawers in the spare room - what can I say? Move over Jane Fonda, my time has come!"},
{"title": "And breathe!", "date": "Saturday 17 July 2021", "text": "I had to laugh when I saw Marksgran's comment of \"and breathe\" on yesterday's post! Sorry about that epic rant folks but better out than in as they say!So where were we? Oh yes, all over France today people are protesting peacefully against the proposed pass sanitaire amongst other things. What is really interesting is that the protesters are from all walks of life and from across the political spectrum as there is pretty much rock solid opposition to what Napoleon (affectionately known as \"Nappy\") is trying to do! I learned last night that apparently the U.N. has already pulled ole Nappy up and reminded him that France signed the Declaration of Human Rights years ago. The E.U. has also apparently reminded him that France signed E.U. Directive No. XXXXX in January of this year to the effect that people will in no way, shape or form be pressured into accepting vaccines against their wishes, and there shall be no legal, political or workplace comeback! I'm paraphrasing of course but .... Now Napoleon is a banker (that spelling's only off by one letter!), but you'd think he might have access to a lawyer or two somewhere in the building who could have pointed all this out to him wouldn't you! Then later I heard the Senator for Haute Savoie, who has already indicated that he will vote against this draft law on Wednesday, saying that he will also not authorize police to verify people's pass status at all, so good on you Mr. Hervé!Apparently Macron originally wanted the police to come under the \"must vaccinate\" umbrella also, but when they told him where to shove it they were exempted on the grounds that \"they do not come into contact with vulnerable people\" (that was the best they could come up with?), so now you have the incongruous situation of having firefighters and police attending the same incident where the firefighter must be vaccinated and the police officer doesn't have to be! Jen says the excuse that they \"do not come into contact with vulnerable people\" is complete crap because when they have a violent event in her psychiatric unit (about once a week), it's the police that come and remove the patient to secure facilities! Even more farcical, as one restaurant owner said today on TV, is that he will be put in a position of having clients in his restaurant and when the police try to come in and check their passes he will have to tell them to get out because they are not in possession of such passes themselves! It's getting less and less coherent by the minute - and is making the pompous little peacock in the Elysée Palace look more and more stupid, if that's possible! Moreover the truckers' union has warned that if this law goes through, they will be blocking roads up and down France as from 15 August, and if there's one union you don't want to piss off it's the truckers' union! And I really must point out here that people are NOT necessarily against the vaccination - they are against this pass as an infringement of their civil liberties, because once you accept losing one element of your civil rights, how long before they come chipping away at the next one? Many of the protesters are indeed vaccinated anyway. People are still working from home when they can, they are routinely wearing masks and they are social distancing, and since they have toed the line right from the start of this pandemic, they are not willing to accept further infringements of their rights under the guise of authoritarianism dressed up as necessity!When it comes to spreading the virus, apparently, these guys aren't the problem!Macron at the Bastille Day celebrations!The Cannes film festival!The Tour de France!It's these guys!The irony is, there's all this hoohah about these old guys sitting outside having a drink - do they have their pass? How can we check? - and yet when I had lunch with my friends in Switzerland on Wednesday and I mentioned it to the waiter he said \"no problem, what would you like to drink\"?For the record, since I have to put this somewhere, years ago I had a violent reaction to a hepatitis vaccine that landed me in hospital 24 hours later covered in scabs all over my face and arms! Ever since then I've stayed away from vaccines where possible - never got the annual flu jab, you get the idea. More importantly though, my friend retired not so long ago from the vaccines unit of the World Health Organization. At the beginning of the pandemic she asked me what I thought about getting \"the new vaccine\" and I told her I didn't think anything as I simply didn't know. She said she was worried because new vaccines, i.e. being newly rolled out to the public, take around two to three years for their side effects to become apparent. So with that thought in mind I decided I wanted to wait. I'm not a gun-toting right winger. I don't think I'll be micro-chipped if I get the vaccine, nor do I think my arms will become magnetized or aliens come down to whisk me away for experimental purposes. I hope it really is a safe vaccine because for it to turn out to be otherwise just doesn't bear thinking about!If the situation were really dire, and we truly were \"all in it together\", then fine, but as you guys in the U.K. know all too well, \"in it together\" means entirely different things to the rich than it does to the poor. Viz That Twat Cummings who drove over 100 miles to a beauty spot during lockdown \"because he thought his eyes were playing up and he wanted to check them out\". Or the equally twatty married Health Minister, Matt Hancock, who not only didn't social distance but was caught on camera being waayyy too \"handy\" with his equally married mistress (and who he employed in his office to work \"two hours a week for £15,000 a year\")! Or how about bug-eye Michael Gove, who had to fly to Portugal on \"urgent government business\" (to watch the football match), but did not have to self-isolate upon returning to the U.K. because he suddenly became part of a hitherto unheard of trial group of people who no longer had to isolate! Yeah right, do as I say, not as I do eh!Regarding covid death figures going up, I have been checking the official figures for Haute Savoie for ages and I would say it's been about a month since we had even one death registered here. Bed occupation rates in ICU units are fairly static at about 10%, and that despite Macron's administration having closed over 4,000 hospital beds since they came to power, with 1,200 beds being closed in the first three months of this year during a pandemic! Jen has a friend who works in ICU at the CHAL hospital near here (the second biggest hospital in Haute Savoie) and she was telling Jen they haven't had a covid patient in ICU for months, so they could easily take in patients from elsewhere if necessary, but nope, nothing for a couple of months!As for Jen, I stopped in to see them yesterday and she had a big smile on her face. When I asked what that was about she read out an email that had been sent by the director of the hospital where she works saying that while she strongly recommended people get vaccinated she, the director, would not be stopping anybody's pay or firing anyone for not being vaccinated. Under Macron's master plan, anyone who is not fully vaccinated after three months would be fired for faute grave, but that again has been contradicted by legal advice that says he simply cannot do that. He can't make the frickin' rules up as he goes along (although I'm sure he'd love to). The irony is that Jen's unit is supposed to have 12 nurses and they are only eight so they are already understaffed. Given that at least three have already said they will resign (and potentially others - Jen doesn't know), I guess this lady knows where her loyalties have to lie if she wants her unit to stay open! But then as Jen said, vaccinated or not vaccinated, it's not like we walk onto the unit with cow shit on our boots having just cleaned out the barn is it! We're bloody nurses, we wear protective gear and we are on a psychiatric ward, not a sick-patient ward! So things are looking more positive on that front too, I'm pleased to say!On a different note, a friend and I went out to the lake at Passy today, this being the first day of decent weather in months. It was glorious to see all the little kids in the water and people having fun after such a long hard slog. We did two circuits and then stopped for a lovely lunch, thus allowing us to catch up after not seeing each other for ages (and I guess allowing me to blow off steam right)! When I got home my sister called for a chat and as is the norm these days, we got off on the vax question. I never brought it up as we both know what the other's position is, but I did hear my BIL say \"well I think you're a bloody idiot\" (we never speak to each other like that), so I just replied \"your opinion of me is noted, but I have to disagree\"! At which point my sister said to drop it because he and I can get into it if we need to. Next thing I hear (again from BIL) is \"I see the bloody French are at it again, protesting, that's all they ever do\"! So I told him they were also protesting against reforms to unemployment legislation (which I know nothing about) and pension reform (about which I know a little). I'm not getting this totally straight but apparently under the current French system, your pension is calculated based on the last five (or maybe 10?) years' salary of your working life. Napoleon has now drafted a reform whereby your pension will be calculated using your salary from the day you started work and over your entire working life, so from 15 years of age in my BIL's case (he's now 73). So I asked him what it would do to his pension, and didn't he think he might, just might, be a little inclined to protest too! He had to admit that he would so I'm glad I pulled him up on that. Not everything is black and white ya know! And you're welcome!Anyway, in other news, Charlie started at the crèche last week and it is going really well. He isn't one to look at toys but seemingly prefers people watching. So apart from when he's sleeping and eating, he gets to people watch to his heart's content and is totally unperturbed by his new surroundings. Jen said he is the youngest one there and there are four very nice assistants for 12 children who are really good with him! He's still a happy baby so that's obviously true and I think she's relieved to be able to start back to work next week knowing he's ok, with me taking care of him on Fridays starting this week! He's a little doll and is so used to being around people that it really doesn't seem to phase him!The \"cowboy look\" he's got going there is due to all the dribbling!I heard this week too that a niece in Denmark has also just given birth. We have nothing to do with that side of the family sadly (my \"Danish\" sister's choice, not ours), so I had a peep on FB and he is another little doll. I didn't even know this niece had gotten married and when I saw her husband I have to admit he's a handsome guy. But then I looked again, and while he is indeed a handsome guy, one of his main pictures is of the actor Paul Walker, so I guess he obviously thinks he looks like Paul Walker. I mentioned this to my \"English\" sister and how another \"acquaintance\" had done the same thing and put a picture of herself next to a picture of Sharon Stone. Maybe it's me, but I think this is really weird - \"hey, look at me, don't you think I look like Sharon Stone\"? I also know someone who swears her 80+ something sister looks \"just like Elizabeth Taylor\". When I had a look, frankly, she looks more like Minnie Mouse meets Tammy Faye Bakker, but then maybe I'm not very good at this stuff! I told my sister I was going to post a picture of Sarah Millican on my FB page to see if anyone noticed. But you know what, I'd rather spend an evening with Sarah Millican than all the gorgeous Hollywood stars in the world, 'cos she's just magic!Sarah Millican"},
{"title": "Vive la Révolution!", "date": "Thursday 15 July 2021", "text": "TRIGGER WARNING - AND EXTREMELY LONG!I had to take a break from the internet for a while last week as I was so sick of thinking about things that I knew would do my head in if I didn't. I suspect this post is going to be pretty long so if any of you can't sleep stick around - I'll have you asleep in no time. Thing is, once I start not being able to sleep and moithering in my head I know that the only way to get things to calm down is to get it down in writing - in order to empty my head! Anyway, here goes!I suppose what has been a big contributing factor to my (and most other people's) funks is this god-awful weather. It has been rain, rain and more rain, non-stop, with today's high temperature hitting a whopping 16°C (60°F). And that's how it's been for weeks! They may be talking about global warming but if it is happening it sure ain't happening anywhere near here. Add to that that both my immediate neighbours each have two pumps running in their basements 24/7 to keep water out - and the guilt trip (and relief, admittedly) that my place has stayed dry has been bothering me quite a bit! In all honesty, I truly believe that the fact that they have been getting flooded for the last several years is probably down to my immediate neighbour's handywork - or lack thereof. The area where I live, in French, is called Fields of Song, which refers not to birdsong but apparently the \"singing\" of the many underground streams as they make their way down the mountains. When my house was built they apparently placed a large drain towards the left-hand edge of my garden to deal with these springs - I can tell by the location of extreme dry patches in the lawn during normal summers. Additionally, a few years ago, a few of us neighbours got together to put extra piping in further up the gardens to channel excess water down to the drains on the main road. What I think happened is Mr. Handyman next door cut into the slope of the garden behind my hedge to build what turned out to be a very pretty small BBQ and seating area - and I reckon ended up diverting spring water into their two basements. So one of the upcoming tasks is to get professionals in to redivert water away from their homes (not at my expense of course, but still a hassle), but this bloody non-stop rain isn't making getting this done any easier!So yeah, I guess this bloody weather is having a huge effect on everyone's general malaise right now. But the malaise seems to be never-ending doesn't it! And I've been thinking more and more about what a nasty, spiteful world we seem to be moving towards, whichever side of any particular argument you choose to be on. Take the US elections and the never-ending fall out from them. Whether you are on Team \"Trump is the only one who can save us\" or Team \"Watch out for the lunatic at Mar-a-Lago\", the downright hate and violence it has engendered has to be seen to be believed!Then we Brits got Bojo, and the nastiness depending on whether you're Team \"Boris is the man for the job\" v. \"Get this philandering AH out of there\" is a sight to behold!And of course, 31 December was the \"final\" date for Brexit, the date by which those of us who are expats had to be legally resident in our E.U. country of choice before we lost our Withdrawal Agreement rights. Again, it was Team \"Rule Britannia and now we get to control our own borders\" v. Team \"How ya liking not being able to get your harvest in fellas?\", and while here the nastiness has calmed down a little - perhaps - Brexit engendered divisive hatreds, often between family members which it has sometimes not been possible to patch over. Anecdotally, someone on our FB Brexit group recently posted that he ordered a £95 kilt from the U.K. to wear to a wedding here in France and ended up paying €53 in import duty on it!!! So how ya liking the prices of them apples now folks? I never order anything from the UK anymore for that reason, but why anyone should be surprised that this kind of thing would be one of the consequences of Brexit is beyond me! It for sure isn't all sunshine and daisies in the E.U. and the pandemic has probably muddied many of the issues - good or bad on both sides anyway - but it's just one more thing that has had my head spinning!I ended up watching the final of the Euros the other night, with England playing (and losing against) Italy. I can't really say I'm particularly interested in football. Oh it would have been nice if they had won, but in the end pfft, to me it didn't really matter. What really upset me though, was at the end when it went to penalties, and the three young English players that took - and missed - the penalties were all black, my immediate thought was \"oh my God, I wish that hadn't happened\". Because, of course, had they won they would have been \"wonderful examples of fine upstanding English lads\", but because they lost they were subject to what I assume is more than the usual amount of racist abuse that they normally have to put up with! When did that ever become acceptable - to hurl racist abuse at someone because of the colour of their skin? What the hell is the world coming to when \"oh she's a Karen\" is easily understood to be an offensive bigotted woman (with apologies to all the non-Karen Karens out there - I'm sure you're lovely)? I don't know, it just all got to be a bit too much for me last week so I decided to get off the internet for a while to give my mind a break!But the real humdinger for us here in France this week has been President Macron's introduction of a draft law (to be approved by Parliament) which we are referring to as the pass sanitaire (PS). Under this new law, if approved, a PS can be obtained by anyone who has either been fully vaccinated or who has a covid test less than 48 hours old (about €50 and not reimbursable). As from 21 July, anyone not in possession of a PS, can not go, for example, to the cinema, the swimming pool, museums, cafés and restaurants (whether sitting inside or outside on the terrace), shopping malls or to any place where more than 50 people might be expected to congregagate. So, for example, you won't be able to attend your son's junior school football match, for instance. NOR WILL THEY BE ABLE TO ENTER MEDICAL/HOSPITAL FACILITIES!!!!!! Moreover, young people from the age of 12 up will need the PS in order to be able to attend school in person!  Anyone who comes into regular contact with the public will need to be fully vaccinated - so McDonald's workers, restaurant workers, train drivers, ticket collectors, bus drivers and all medical personnel! I'm not going to go into all the details because to be honest I'm sick of thinking about it, but it will mean if you don't have a PS you cannot catch a bus, a train or a plane! Doesn't bother me too much as I can live without all of that, but what about those that need to have a PS in order to work? Sieg Heil, Mr. Frickin' Macron, can you guess the last time anyone issued that kind of edict?Whichever way you lean regarding the vaccine, a person's fundalmental right is to the freedom to exert control over their own body (as defined at the Nuremberg trials), a right which is not superseded by the \"greater good of society\"!To be forced to ingest something into your body against your informed consent is considered a crime against humanity - the Nuremberg Code still stands!So that is why instead of celebrating Bastille Day on 14 July, the French were out protesting in cities all over the country. And they were peaceful protests, apart from the usual small band of professional rioters in Paris. But what happened on 14 July will be nothing compared to what is going to happen this Saturday, as the \"real\" protests will in no way be a celebration, and if not heads, then at least hopefully a President and wannabe dictator will be brought down!I saw an interview on TV with Loïc Hervé who - and I didn't know this - is actually the Senate representative for Haute Savoie (this region) and he was saying that despite being vaccinated himself, he intends to vote against this law as a complete infringement of people's human rights - you know, what Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité is all about! I'm paraphrasing here but if, for the greater good of mankind, mandatory vaccination is enforced, well won't that be all well and dandy folks! All in the name of freedom. But then what happens in a couple of years' time when they find out that too many disabled children are being born? How about we just enforce abortion/euthanasia for these children for the greater good of mankind and in the name of freedom? Won't that be fine and dandy as we'll all be beautiful and free. But then, in a few years time, what about the gay people, or the ..... you get the gist of it. If we allow our rights to be infringed for the greater good of mankind and in the name of freedom - well then we will never be free will we! (On a side note, I wrote to his office and congratulated him on his stance - wonder if he'll write back)!Also on Wednesday, I was invited to lunch with some friends (who are all vaccinated) in Switzerland, so I called the restaurant and said that I didn't have a pass sanitaire (not vaccinated yet and not going to pay €50 for a test) and should I not come? His reply \"Madame, this is Switzerland, such things as the pass sanitaire law would have to be submitted to the people's vote (they vote on everything in Switzerland) so you will never need a pass sanitaire here, ever. We look forward to seeing you!\" (I could have cried). If that ain't a democracy I don't know what is. Oh, and of all the United Nation Member States guess which two countries have imposed similar pass sanitaire laws? Can't guess? Norway and Denmark? Nope. Portugal tried to impose it and was forced to withdraw it after just one day. Still can't guess? Well, the answer is Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - so ya see, we're in good company!So I guess finally it comes down to which team you are on, yet again. Team \"it's everybody's civil duty to get this wonderful vaccine\" or Team \"ya ain't gonna stick anything which is a trial therapy and for which there is no recourse against the manufacturers if (when) everything goes tits up in two years\" into my arm! Again, on a side note, legal efforts have been made to obtain copies of the contracts between the drug companies and the E.U. governments (all to no avail so far). But one thing is for sure, in each contract there is most definitely a \"no recourse\" clause in the event this trial therapy has to be withdrawn in two-three years. And just as a BTW, I saw it mentioned that \"you might want to look at your mortgage insurance small print for anything referring to your insurance being nullified if you participate in 'trial' anything\". My house is paid off and I couldn't be bothered to look but, that was something else I guess most people hadn't thought of. Or how about the fact that the SARs (I think it was) vaccine trial was called off after around 53 deaths were linked to it, and yet, worldwide there are already thousands of deaths and \"adverse vaccine reactions\" to this trial therapy and yet they are still pushing it!Well done Sen. Ron Johnson for at least saying these people need to belistened to. (The original video is over an hour long)!Sure covid kills, but then so does this \"therapy\" (it isn't a vaccine apparently, but they started referring to it as such because it's something they stick in your arm)!Anyway, and finally, I promise I will shut up afterwards, but I was always leaning towards not dashing out to get this \"vaccine\", mainly because, even though it has indeed been in the works for many years, it is still in trial phase, and will remain so until around May 2022 unless they withdraw it beforehand. No, I reckoned my lifestyle of being pretty insular, with the highlight of my week being grocery shopping and walking in the mountains, it was easier for me to say \"nope, don't want it\"! That being said, I do keep an eye on the official statistics for our local town - which have been at \"less than 1\" for positive tests for ages and 11% of hospital beds in Haute Savoie being occupied at this point in time! I know many of you won't agree with me, but two days ago I saw a presentation by a Canadian doctor indicating that 62% of his patients having received the vaccine within the last seven days, show indications of blood clotting. He pointed out that these effects are cumulative with each successive shot, and explained why he feels that deaths as a result of right-sided heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension will start to skyrocket within two to three years because of this. He isn't the only one saying this and these are experts - not Sean Hannity from Fox News either. I'm pretty sure you can find an expert for whichever side of this particular fence you sit, of course, but this video in particular, ending with him talking about the deaths from right-sided heart failure, sent ice through my veins!When I went to lunch with my friends there was only one (friendly) comment about me not being vaccinated (yet) but all I could say was \"you're vaccinated, so surely I'm the only one at real risk here\"! But you know, I don't want to get into this with my friends. It's something we're gonna have to agree to disagree on. In a way I hope I end up with egg on my face in a couple of years as my belief was wrong, because honestly the opposite just doesn't bear thinking about! And by the way, I'm not an anti-vaxxer. My kids and I are all vaccinated with all the required vaccines that have been in use for decades. I just don't see being used as a human guinea pig in somebody's clinical trials and against whom I have no recourse if something goes drastically wrong! (If you're interested, the video was of Dr. Charles Hoffe on the Laura Lynn show. There are plenty more, including regarding the lawsuits being prepared by the team that took down Volkswagen in the \"Dieselgate\" case. They are preparing \"Nuremburg crimes against humanity\" lawsuits as we speak)!So finally (if you're still with me here you've got quite the stamina), I don't feel that Herr Macron's law has a snowflake's chance in hell of going through. If it does, all hell will break loose. That being said, as a nurse Jen would be the only one amongst us who would have to get the \"vaccine\" and since she is following the same discussions as we are you can imagine how she is reacting. It will be a case of \"get your vaccine or get fired\". Since they need her salary to keep their home/family going she has eyes like a deer caught in the headlights. Already she knows of five nurses where she works who will resign if it goes through and they are preparing to take a photo in front of their hospital to post on social media saying \"these are just some of the people you will lose because of this\"! At a hospital north of Paris one doctor has said he will lose at least 40% of his medical personnel, not only because of this but also because last year's \"heroes of the pandemic\" have this year been told \"here's your €20 pay rise, now get back to work\"! Moreover, fire stations in France are usually manned by a few paid professionals, with the rest being made up of volunteer firefighters (these are actually the paramedics that would bring you to hospital if needed). Many of them have already indicated that they will resign if mandatory vaccination goes through. Hell, why would they stay? They are volunteers after all! Oddly enough, that crafty fox Herr Macron excluded the police and the military from mandatory vaccination requirements. Why? Surely the police, in particular, will be coming into contact with large members of the public when they are checking everyone's pass sanitaire (in addition to all the other stuff they have to do). Could it be because he knows they will also revolt if he tries to impose it on them and then he will lose control of the police and the military?Anyway, yesterday after lunch I stopped in at Jordan and Jen's for a family powow (Jordan was off, it being Bastille Day). As we're very open about finances, I thought, let's get straight to it. I asked them how much they needed to cover their monthly expenses. They sat and worked it all out and on just Jordan's salary they come up way short (she earns more than him, although as a professional nurse and a qualified plumber, their salaries are disgustingly low)! It had been moithering me for ages and then it finally hit me that I couldn't in clear conscience keep putting money into my savings/holidays fund when my kids need help.To cut straight to the chase, if they insist on mandatory vaccination for Jen she will first take the final six months' parental leave (very reduced pay) to which she is entitled, and then she will resign. I told her I will give them the amount of money that used to go into my savings for as long as it takes them to get back on their feet (not far off the amount of her full salary). They will not lose their home. I also told them I was giving them this money, not lending it. I mean, what's the point in them inheriting any assets I have many years down the road (hopefully) when they need help now? Since I hadn't said anything about it beforehand (because I'd only just thought of it anyway), it must have come as a shock to both of them and Jen just put her head on Jordan's shoulders and cried with relief! But dammit, there was always going to be a solution (for them at least - not for some other poor buggers who have no other option but to keep their jobs). We had gone through worst case scenario - they sell the small home they had worked so hard to buy. Next best - rent out the apartment and move in with either André or me! Jen called me again this morning saying she couldn't believe I would do that, but then why the hell wouldn't I? So now she's got time to retrain and they can move forward without worrying about money. When she asked me what she could do for me, I told her to get me a bunch of flowers - or sneak into the cemetery late at night and nick a bunch - but not to forget to take the card off! I also told her Jordan should tell Max (his friend and boss) that he is looking for work in Switzerland. That gives Max a chance to up his wages to a level consistent with his skills, and since Max knows he'd be in the shit without Jordan because he has tons of work lined up and they can't find another plumber for love nor money, hopefully it should shake Max up a bit too. Damn, I don't get mad often but when I do I'm like a dog with a bone. I will not give up, especially if I think there is injustice. When I got home I starting looking at plumbing/central heating job offers in Geneva, and in less than a minute I came up with one just over the border which would already triple his income. I told Jordan the one thing he had to do for me was call that company - that was all I was asking - and in addition to talking about their requirements/his skills, to stress that he is bilingual - which is a big advantage in Geneva! We'll see what happens I guess. It may already be taken but there will be others anyway and at least it gives them some breathing space!So there you have it, what's been bothering me this last week and why I haven't been online and commenting on your blogs. I don't want to argue with anyone about vaccination. God knows I hope I'm proved totally wrong and end up with egg on my face (assuming any of us are alive at the end of all this). But my feeling is you stand as much chance of dying from the vaccination as you do from covid (only it'll happen a bit later), so I'll take my chances with the virus!Stay safe everyone, whichever way you choose to do that. And tomorrow something a little less \"heavy\" huh?"},
{"title": "Plodding along!", "date": "Thursday 1 July 2021", "text": "Things haven't exactly been quiet here but nothing particularly interesting has been happening either. The weather continues to be pretty crappy - moderately warm but with daily rain and even violent storms several times a week! I went to my Italian lesson the other night and as we walked out the most god-awful storm started so my teacher and I hung back for a while to see if it would pass over. When it didn't we realized we had no choice but to make a run for it - but man was that an interesting 45 minute drive home! It was lashing down rain and between that and the darkness it was really hard to drive. The person in front of me was going particularly slow and the eejit behind me was getting his knickers in a twist, revving his engine like crazy, obviously convinced that was all that was needed to make everyone go faster! It's not like he had to wait more than about five minutes before he could pass anyway, but I guess that's one person who has never heard of hydroplaning!I usually take the low road home but even when I was on my way to my lesson it had already started to flood so I stuck with the motorway all the way. Damn, I hate those kinds of storms - and I hate eejits like the one behind me even more! I mean, you don't only have to worry about floods, what about the trees they bring down huh? Crikey, what happens when you find this thing in the middle of the road as you're roaring past overtaking everyone - you'd end up with a pretty severe headache right!One of the uprooted trees in town!At yoga on Monday she told us we were going to work on \"our abdominal muscles\" - all the while trying desperately not to look at me! It didn't feel too bad while I was doing it but I definitely knew about it later that afternoon. Damn, it's amazing how quickly you lose momentum when you take a break from exercising isn't it. On the way out Sylvie, who does the Monday and Tuesday yoga classes with me, mentioned that she was thinking about organizing a hike this time next year to cover the Traversée du Jura! The Jura mountains are to the north of Lake Geneva (the alps are to the south) and while they are very different to the alps and not as high, they are still very beautiful. So thinking \"oh that might be something to look forward to\" I asked her how long the \"hike \" was. When she said 400 km I nearly fell off the bench where I was sitting putting my shoes back on! My first reaction was \"well that's a definite no then\", but in the spirit of not saying no right off the bat, I think I'll save that for next week! I just know I could never get fit enough to do that in a year but ..... never say never, I guess!One of the routes for the Traversée du Jura!I have also been back to the gym trying to get back into the swing of things but damn, is it hard work at the beginning. I made a fool of myself last week though because I went in the afternoon instead of the morning and as I walked in I called out bonjour to the guys behind the desk - only to realize that a group of ladies were in the middle of a yoga lesson right there and I hadn't spotted them! Then, since the changing rooms have opened back up, I thought I'd go use the bathroom before heading upstairs. I thought something had changed when I went in, but only discovered what it was when a young man from the front desk came running after me to say I'd walked into the men's changing rooms! Damn, I may be getting older but I hadn't thought I'd reached that stage just yet! They have an expression in French which basically translates to \"I hadn't taken the straw out of my clogs yet\" - or, as we say in the UK, \"you can take the girl out the country but ....\"! I told André that on the programme of machines/exercises my trainer had set for me when I initially joined up, he had asked me to start doing a plank to see how long I could last. Frankly anything longer than a minute I count as a success, but André said I could easily cheat if I just rested up on my belly and boobs!!!! Hell, I reckon I could take both my arms and my legs off the floor and someone could just \"spin me around\" if we wanted to make things a bit more interesting. Still, I'm doing more than Mr. Critical over there aren't I. Actually he said once he gets settled into his apartment he might come with me and enrol at my gym, but since this is someone who considers exercise to be taking a bath then pulling the plug and fighting the current we'll see how that goes, I guess!On Saturday some really fit people will be coming through here again as the Tour de France will be heading down from le Grand Bornand to Cluses through the local town of Bonneville - and clogging up the traffic quite nicely again, I would imagine. I saw in today's news that a local sheep farmer has nighttime footage of a wolf attacking his sheep so if Mr. Wolf shows up at the Tour de France that could make things interesting. Farmers have always claimed that there are wolves in these mountains (well something is attacking their livestock), but it is usually denied by the authorities, who probably don't want to admit it. Doesn't make sense to me since if there are wolves and bears in eastern Europe what's stopping them from moving in to western Europe also? Nothing right!In other news, France has dropped pretty much 99% of its covid restrictions as from today - everything except masks when in indoor public places, and it's a nice feeling, I have to admit. I watched the England/Germany football match the other night in the Euros and surprise, surprise England actually beat Germany 2-0! Now that doesn't happen very often I can tell you. I'm not that bothered about football, to be honest, but it made a nice to change to watch England actually win something. I didn't find it to be the most exciting match though, but then I guess that would make me just one of thousands of expert couch potatoes wouldn't it, lying on the sofa eating crisps while doling out my opinion of where they went wrong!Couch potato!Prince William and Kate took Prince George to Wembley Stadium to watch the match - which was nice - but I do wish they would dress him like a little boy occasionally, and not like some young schoolboy in starchy knickerbockers. Still, again, I don't suppose they care what I think do they!And finally, I'm really moving on with sorting and decluttering - and it's now getting quite motivating. I'm still going through loads and loads of linens, sorting what's decent (and even still in its package) in case my son wants it, putting stuff in the recycling bin and ripping up more stuff for rags. I would say over 50% of it is what my ex left behind when he hightailed it back to the US in 2015 and left me to empty his rental. One thing I can't figure out though is how he had three beds and seemed to need 85 sets of bed linen for them!!! Damn, it's no wonder I had my work cut out for me!"},
{"title": "Busy!", "date": "Wednesday 23 June 2021", "text": "While the weather remains a bit \"iffy\" over here, things seem to be slowly returning to some kind of normal. I suppose totally lifting the curfew on Monday helped because even though I rarely go out after 11 pm, just knowing I haven't got to rush back home is very liberating. And if I'm feeling that way I can only imagine how relieved young people feel! André has been out with mates about three times this last week - initially sleeping over at their places because of curfew and then last night he came home at 2 a.m! His fireman friend, Laurent (Zoreille - Ears) invited him to go to a billiard evening in Sevrier on Lake Annecy. I don't think he was expecting to be out so late but since they wanted to stay till the end and Laurent's girlfriend was driving I guess ya just goes with the flow don't ya! But talking of \"going with the flow\", I think André was regretting mixing his drinks this morning as he had a bit of a sore head. I told him mixing drinks wasn't a good idea, was it. Oh sure, it seemed like a great idea last night, but this morning? Nah, not so much! He had a call from the notary this week and will be signing for his apartment on 2 July and getting his keys on19 July, so not long to go now. It's so exciting and we're both looking forward to going out shopping as he needs just about everything! One of the advantages of not having kids at home is that I sleep the sleep of the just, but of course since he's been with me I've stopped putting my phone on \"do not disturb\" at night when he's out. I won't miss that I can tell you because of course when they don't live with you you have no idea what's going on! Anyway, I got a burst of energy yesterday and spent a few hours working in the garden and then going through one of my linen cupboards trying to get that decluttered. Damn I've got so much stuff, so I started tearing up some old sheets and stuffing them in a bag. When he asked me what I was doing I told him I imagine he'd be needing rags/cloths when he moves into his new place and starts assembling furniture, so I handed him the bag with a \"Merry Christmas son\"! That's one name crossed off my Christmas list!Then on Monday I had a dentist's appointment in Geneva and had just got out of there around 3 p.m. when I saw on the local news that a sink hole had opened up just one block from where I'd driven through. It wasn't a major sink hole and no-one was hurt, thankfully, but I imagine traffic was horrendous after that, so that's one more joy to add to the list of no longer having to go into Geneva every day!Heck that would have done some damage to my suspensionwouldn't it - well the car's, not mine. My bra straps aredesigned to withstand an earthquake!On Sunday France had the first of two rounds of municipal/regional elections and thankfully Marine Le Pen's far right party did worse than last time around - but then again so did Macron's party, so next year's Presidential elections could be interesting!Last night I finished watching The Serpent on Netflix. It took me ages to get through it because the first five or so episodes had me on the edge of my seat and I didn't honestly know if I wanted to continue. I think the music had something to do with it actually, but it was really gripping stuff, all the more so since it was a true story! Damn, if you ever want a look into a severely deranged mind you could do no better than to watch that series!And finally the other day I received an email from the bus company my friend and I have taken so many trips with. They were sending out the outings planned for July and August. Trouble is, while I haven't been particularly worried about covid, neither my friend nor I feel up to getting up close and personal with a whole bunch of other people on a bus just yet! Still, looking at where they are planning their outings has given me loads of new ideas of places we could visit on our own, starting in July when most of them open up. I've got about six possibles lined up already, all less than 200 km away from here, so that will give us something to look forward to, even if it's not exactly \"holidays\" as I might normally have imagined them. Still, no worries, I'm sure they'll be just great as this region of France still continues to pleasantly surprise me!"},
{"title": "A semblance of normality!", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2021", "text": "So Biden and Putin met in Geneva today and, as would be expected, half of Geneva was closed off and it must have been pretty damn miserable for anyone trying to get to work. I would imagine today would have been the day for people to work from home but of course that's not possible for everyone. I'm sure there was no love lost between the two leaders but by gum doesn't Putin always have a face like there's a bad smell in the room!André came in yesterday and told me that when he was driving into town he started having trouble with his car seat - it wouldn't stay in the forward position - so he's not sure if he's going to have to make yet another appointment with Ford to get that sorted. He keeps pouring money into the bloody thing and every time we hope that this time that's it, but there always seems to be something new to fix. Admittedly his dad bought it in 2009 so it's not a new car. More to the point, this is the car that his dad went out drunk one Saturday afternoon and spent $60,000 on a brand new car for himself! Man was I pissed off (a) that he was drunk, and (b) that he spent that much money without as much as a \"by your leave\" to me, even though paying for the damn thing was going to come out of our joint account! At least that was one thing that I insisted he take on in the divorce settlement - reimbursement of his car loan. I mean, it's not like he looked after the damn thing or anything. In fact, about six years ago he had to have a completely new engine put in because he never bothered checking the oil and the engine just blew. So on that basis André bought the car off his dad when he left to go back to the States, and while it hasn't been a bad car as such, it does seem to be constantly haemorrhaging money at the moment. Hell, I told him to just attach a new car to the wing mirror and be done with it but I sense that didn't go down too well! Oh well, not my problem is it!In other matters, yesterday I took a trip out to the large charity store near here and the first thing I saw as I walked in was a baby bouncy chair - for the grand sum of €6 (brand new they run between €60 and €70)! Talk about lucking out! I've dropped off stuff there before but never actually been in to buy anything. I can't say the place did anything for me, to be honest, but I reckon you could maybe get some halfway decent second-hand furniture if you were just starting out. I don't think I'll be going back again to buy though - I'd rather stick to vide-greniers - but it certainly was worth the trip, once I'd got back home and washed the cover. So now we have somewhere to plonk the babe when he's at my place all for the grand sum of €6!I see that the British Embassy in Paris is also doing a big push to get expat Brits living in France to hurry up and request their residency permits before the cut off date of 30 June if they have not already done so. Beyond that date, any Brit either living or wanting to live in France will be subject to the more stringent rules that apply to third country nationals. I say hats off to them really because I find it hard to believe that people who live here can be that cut off from the reality of what's required for a Brit after Brexit. I suppose some older people might not be computer-literate, of course, but there have been groups set up to try to help these people do what they need to do in time, the Embassy has addressed letters to Mairies in France to bring this to their attention, and they are also taking out newspaper ads saying \"hey, you've got two weeks left to do the necessary\"! I suppose some will get caught out but it won't be for lack of trying to reach them!Now that the good weather has finally arrived my garden has gone nuts. Trouble is, everything seems to flower at once for one magnificent burst of colour in June and then bam it's all gone again. Still, sitting in my garden at this time of year is just glorious!On the recommendation of a friend I have just finished a book called The Thursday Murder Club, which turned out to be a fun, easy read. It was written by Richard Osman of Pointless fame and it reads just like he speaks. He is, I think, the unintended \"star\" of the above-mentioned show, a self-deprecating man-giant who reminds me of Brains from Thunderbirds, except that he's probably twice Brains' height. So if you're looking for a simple read, you might like to give it a shot!Richard Osman (that's him on the right)!!!!Brains, from Thunderbirds!Yoga started up on Monday morning and I felt like I weighed 300 lbs and someone had put me in a body cast, that's how supple I was! I wasn't at all worried about covid because although 10 people are enrolled I figured half wouldn't show anyway - which turned out to be true because in the end there were just two of us, so again it was almost a private lesson. Yet again I came out of there feeling wonderful - it's so good to be back. Sylvie, the other yoga lady, told me that the older lady, Cami, from our Tuesday afternoon yoga lesson had died in January. Turns out it wasn't covid but more the fact that she was 90 years old and I guess it was just her time, but crikey, 90 years old and still throwing herself around a yoga mat with gay abandon! Well done Cami, you rocked it to the end girl! Then on Monday night I started up sewing club again. To be honest I could easily drop out of sewing because I'm not enjoying it but since I volunteered to take over as President I feel I need to put a few years in. And again there were only six of us in the large sewing room so no-one seemed to be overly bothered about covid. Then today I determined that I would head back to the gym, which has been closed for eight months and again, don't I know it! Admittedly I went with a bit of a petulant child attitude (\"wah, wah, I don't want to do this\") but again, I felt so good when I left there. It's a huge hangar-like building on two floors and, as on so many other occasions, there were just three of us upstairs using the weight machines. They also had one side door/wall completely open so there was plenty of air circulating so I wasn't too worried about being around other people. I bumped into Ben, my original trainer, who was the first person I knew that had contracted covid, so I asked him how it was. He said apart from being really tired and sleeping for about a week, it wasn't bad at all, so that's good to hear! I tell you what though, eight months of no or little exercise and those wall-to-wall mirrors do no-one any favours, especially not me! And finally, when I got home from my Italian lesson tonight I see that the French Prime Minister has announced the ending of the curfew as from 21 June instead of 30 June because they are so pleased with the way the figures are going here! Wow, that's great! Also, as from Thursday (i.e. tomorrow) masks are no longer required outside for the most part, although they will still be mandatory in certain places, like outdoor markets and so on. Again, wow! I watched an interview with a French epidemiologist who was saying that the figures are so low for May and June as to justify significant easing of restrictions earlier than anticipated but, for the most part, that was down to the weather. He warned that the figures will most likely go back up again in September, in particular with the threat of the so-called Indian variant, but for the time being, it looks like freedom is on the horizon. I'll drink to that!"},
{"title": "Spring seems to have been cancelled due to lack of interest!", "date": "Sunday 13 June 2021", "text": "I'm not sure what happened but mother nature seems to have just skipped over spring this year and jumped straight from winter to summer! Shame really, as spring is my favourite season! I mean, we went from non-stop rain and around 15°C (59°F) to dry as a bone and 31°C (88°F) - and I'm wilting already. Well actually I'm ok as long as I stick around the house because the ground floor stays fairly cool and I can usually get a through breeze going, but of course I can't stay inside for two months can I! Thankfully my basement remains at a fairly constant temperature all year round and is a good place to store fruit and veg, either out on the work surfaces or in the fridge down there. (One thing ya gotta love about winter is you can always keep your wine cold right?)! So the other day I took the bull by the horns and finally got round to pressure-spraying my back terrace. It's a faff to set it all up but it's pretty satisfying to see all that crud coming off all the same. André works in the living room which gives on to the back terrace so I asked him if it would bother him if I ran the Kärcher and he said \"as long as you're not doing it in the living room\" (smart arse) and then, after I'd finished up, he had the nerve to say he couldn't see much difference! I tell ya, the urge to pressure spray his back teeth right there and then was pretty strong, so I'd say he got off lightly! Then while I was out the gardener came by and cut my grass after almost a month of non-stop rain, so all-in-all everything's looking pretty hunky dory right now!As I finally got around to preparing Jordan's US taxes on Tuesday I called Jen to ask if I could stop over and leave them for him to sign. I have to wait until they've prepared their French taxes so I can get his final figure for 2020 and then convert it to $$$ for the US filing. What a faff that is for so little income! Still, it has to be done. Actually that's one of the reasons I gave up my green card in 1992. At the time, we were now a family of four living back in Europe, and in order for me to keep my green card I had to visit the US at least once a year. Well with two young kids and a new mortgage there was no way I could have afforded that trip every year so I handed it back. I think the rules have changed since but at least after that I never had to file US taxes again - which is good because I had a decent salary and when the dollar dropped through the floor against the Swiss franc I would definitely have owed! Anyway, Jen said she wanted to run into town to pick up a few things and did I want to come with her. Well I had forgotten how much stuff you have to lug around when you've got a baby in tow! The car seat, the stroller, the diaper bag, the spare bottles. You name it, I reckon a Himalayan expedition has got nothing on a shopping trip with a baby! That being said, Jen's very organized and he was a doll so everything worked out fine, but crikey, there's no such thing as just \"nipping out to get a baguette\" is there! Still, if you don't prepare you will inevitably get caught out won't you. I remember when André was first born I had a diaper bag for him but decided to leave it in the car while I nipped into the bank in D.C. I realized that was a mistake when a very kind lady pointed out that I'd got \"green stuff\" running all down my arm! Oh happy days!Then on Friday I decided to sit in the garden and read for a while but André's US taxes were bugging me so I told him to give me his figures and in about 20 minutes I'd got his return prepared also, so that's a big thing knocked off the list. Just gotta get his French taxes sorted and we'll be home and dry. Oh and it's weird to think that all being well in just over a month he'll be moving into his own place! I was just saying to him the other day that this time last year he was still happily married (or so he thought), and now he's divorced, moved into France, got his residence permit sorted and is moving into his own bachelor pad in a few weeks! Stll, he's happy and I get to see both my kids more than ever before. Lucky me!Last week Jen's grandparents made the trip down from northern France to see the baby so yesterday we all went out to lunch together on the terrace of the small restaurant near their home and it was really nice. While I can't say the lockdowns have bothered me as much as some, it was a really pleasant change to be sitting outside eating lunch again after all the restrictions and the bloody rain. Yesterday morning Jen and I decided to go to a vide-grenier (a mix of car boot/garage sale organized by the local villages) which was specifically aimed at baby stuff and where all the profits went to a foundation associated with a disease I'd never heard of, nor, I'm ashamed to say, can I remember the name now. But it was really well organized, everything was clearly priced and while the stuff wasn't maybe as cheap as you could get in a regular vide-grenier, it was still a good deal. Jen picked up a whole bunch of clothes for when Charlie is a year old (or more likely, what will fit him at around nine months), a bunch of toys and books and so on. I got a few things too and while everything appeared to be clean anyway, of course we'll both wash it all and put it away until needed. What I really wanted was a baby bouncy seat to keep at my house but I was out of luck, so tomorrow I will head out to the big charity shop near here to have a shufty, failing which I'll just go and buy a new one (but that seems a bit silly as they are in them for such a short time). The vide-grenier was in a village called Contamine-sur-Arve and boy was it pretty. I've driven through it on the main road loads of times, but higher up the mountain and back in amongst the woods were the prettiest rural hideaways you can imagine. I would have loved it years ago but I think as I get older I need to be closer to other people and the size of my house needs to decrease in inverse proportion to my age, rather than the other way around. Still, it was just lovely!On Wednesday night I went to my first Italian lesson in over a year. and there were only two of us, so it was pretty much a private lesson. Heck, there are only four of us when we're all present so I wasn't worried about going back to \"in person\" classes. Then my friend came over today and we headed out to the Lac Bleu to go walking. Well that was where we intended to go but we were yacking so much I took a wrong turn and we ended up back at the lake at Thyez and walked along the river Arve into Cluses instead - which was fine in the end because I think that's really his favourite spot anyway. Stopping at Cluses we sat on a terrace and had a drink before heading back along the shaded side of the river, so all in all I got in nine miles today and about 18,000 steps total. As he was about to leave I asked him to take a picture of my feet. When he asked why I told him my yoga class starts back up again tomorrow and the first time she says \"place your right hand on your left foot\" I'm going to be lost because I reckon I haven't seen my feet in over a year. He just looked at me like I was mad!And finally, since the rain has eased up my ongoing battle with the slugs devastating my \"crops\" seems to have abated somewhat. Thank God for that as I hate the buggers. In fact, it seems to be too hot for the snails too, so I guess I'm not the only one who doesn't like the heat. Still, if that's what it takes to get rid of the buggers I can live with it!"},
{"title": "Having a rethink!", "date": "Sunday 6 June 2021", "text": "As from this Wednesday France will be opening up a little more, with our curfew being pushed back from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., and all restrictions being scheduled to cease by end-June. Covid numbers are up slightly with the opening up a few weeks ago, but not dramatically so. There was one death in Haute Savoie in the past 24 hours and the R number is 0.83, so things are still going in the right direction thankfully. To be honest, unless that changes dramatically for the worse I don't see them being able to impose more lockdowns/restrictions because people's livelihoods are being destroyed - but that's just my opinion and what would I know! That being said, my Italian evening class has started back up (there are only four of us in the class anyway) and yoga will restart and my gym will open as from 9th June. Pilates also starts up again on Thursday but I've been thinking about it and I think I'm going to drop out. My life has been pretty \"programmed\" since I retired and what with starting to look after the Munchkin once a week I don't want to have a commitment every day and not have free time to plan hikes or meet up with friends. The pilates teacher was good and I felt great afterwards but I never actually enjoyed it so I think I'll give it a miss from now on. I mean, if I want more exercise I can go walking, down to the gym or take another yoga class, so decision made then! The only exercise I've been getting these past couple of weeks is my twice-daily slug-flinging and I can already feel the muscles in my right arm starting to develop! If they introduce slug-flinging as an Olympic event, you've got Team GB right here. We've had so much rain that the buggers are everywhere! They've ruined my courgette and chili pepper plants and are desperately trying to get at my lettuce plants - hence the daily arm exercises. I'm going to run round to my neighbour and beg some coffee grounds off her (I only drink capsule coffee but apparently slugs don't like the smell of coffee grounds), and I'm also going to save eggshells and crush those up to put around my plants to see if it helps as I don't want to use chemicals. I pulled up a lettuce to have with our dinner tonight and you have to be very careful how you clean them. I left all the outer leaves in the compost and then basically pressure sprayed what was left. Can't have too much protein in your diet can you!I also want more free time available because, as I mentioned some time ago, this year I joined Pays Rochois en Transition, which is a local group dedicated to zero waste, recycling, community gardens, etc. They also run a Repair Café twice a month and have just set up a seed exchange for anyone interested in gardening. I'm thinking I would like to get involved with them, but don't know how much time I will be able to offer. They do a lot more than that, of course, but this is what interests me the most and you can't be everywhere can you. Heck if I could be everywhere I'd get around to cleaning my windows as they are embarrassing they're so dirty. Another disadvantage of the sunshine - you can see all the muck! I also learned from the local Magazine de Saint Sixt that a project is underway to build what I hope is a small kinda grocery store/café behind the Mairie, which pleases me no end because goodness knows we need something to replace Stan's café!André went into Geneva Friday afternoon to go swimming in the lake with some friends, then they had band practice and he called me to say that Max had invited him to stay over (curfew, you see). I said it must feel weird to be 33 and letting your mom know you'd been invited for a sleepover so he asked if he could have 10 euros \"to buy some sweeties\"! Then today Max suggested they drive up to Chamonix for lunch and André said it was glorious. I'm glad to see he's finally getting to have a social life again after all this time (I guess there's still hope for me then)! I've talked about Max before. He's a friend of both my kids (and is also Jordan's boss) and André was telling me that he's in the process of putting in a €20,000 stair lift for his girlfriend, Elise, since she is wheelchair-bound following a car accident with a wild boar a few years ago (which brings home to me how lightly I escaped after my own encounter with a wild boar that time)! When I asked how they met André told me that Max had been out to dinner with his parents when he spotted Elise having dinner with her friends and chatted with her briefly. He was apparently so smitten with her that he raced back into the restaurant and asked if they would give him the contact phone number for the person that had made their reservation - which, of course, they wouldn't! So knowing roughly the area she had said she lived, he went door to door asking if anyone knew a beautiful young girl in a wheelchair. Someone did, and the rest, as they say, is history! Damn, I didn't know Max was such a romantic! I've always liked him but heaven knows there were times I would have liked to strangle him too, not least of all about 15 years ago when he must have been out partying on New Year's Eve, had too much to drink, and called me around four in the morning asking me to pick him up - but he didn't know where he was! Luckily for him I hadn't had a single drink that evening (I don't like NYE and I was on my own anyway), so I set off looking for him in town at 4 a.m. and brought him back here to sleep it off! Who would have thought that little divil would turn into the rather nice young man he is now!Yesterday we were invited over to Jordan and Jen's to belatedly celebrate Jordan's birthday and give him the symbols for his drum set (he was dead pleased). Babe was a bit cranky as he'd had his first vaccinations so I got to hold him and walk with him and tell him silly stories - and then he was all smiles afterwards, probably wondering what all that gobblydigook was about. André was imploring him to say tonton (uncle) and he just smiled so André asked me what I thought his first words would be. I told him my feelings are \"would ya get your ugly mush out of my face for once\" because, seriously, every time he opens his eyes he's got André's mush right there two inches from his face. I tittered, but André didn't think that was funny for some reason!But tonight André was obviously finding something funny because I'm sitting downstairs and I can hear him roaring laughing up in his bedroom. So I asked him what he was watching and he said Impractical Jokers. In this sketch they have one of the guys pretending to be in space and giving a talk to a bunch of young school kids about what it's like to be in space (the teacher's in on it, of course). The \"non-astronauts\" are feeding lines to the \"astronaut\" about what he should do and say. Have to say I had a bit of a giggle too!"},
{"title": "Been offline for a while!", "date": "Thursday 3 June 2021", "text": "I hadn't planned it but the other day I was feeling pretty bleh and decided that I was spending way too much time online - so I decided to take a few days' break! I tend to be on the computer more than watching the television anyway and just for a while I wanted to not think about politics, wars, covid, how long you have to isolate if you go from place A to place B, and even FB and my favourite blogs. My apologies for not commenting but I see from some blogs that I'm not the only one feeling this way at the moment. I also saw that a couple of my favourite blogs have gone private so I just wanted to say I hope you're both ok and will check in with us occasionally to let us know how you're doing. In the meantime, enjoy your privacy!I can't say things have been bad here, it's just this constant rain and cold-ish weather that's beginning to get even me down. Today, however, was hot and sunny but with the ever present threat of rain it was muggy too - which I guess reminds me of how much I dislike summer. That being said there was the prettiest rainbow tonight as I was shutting all the windows ahead of the latest thunderstorm to head our way!I see from the local Geneva news that there will be major renovations carried out on the Mont Blanc bridge for the next three months. It's the main bridge across the lake and while they will keep a lane open it's going to be hell for anyone trying to get to work (so what's new, right?)! Add to that Biden and Putin will be meeting in Geneva on 16 June and I'm so, so glad I don't have to try to navigate all that! Which brings to mind a story from just before my husband and I got married. He was a marine stationed at the US Mission and George Bush Sr. was coming to town as the then Vice-President. My now-ex was at my house but as it was only a short distance to the Mission from my place it was an easy walk for him to get there to assume duty. Trouble was, while he made it there in plenty of time, the gates to the Mission had already been locked and he couldn't get in! So the idiot thought it would be a good idea to go round the back of the Mission, throw his briefcase over the railings and then try to climb over - with some very twitchy-fingered Swiss police up on the roof! Thankfully for him the marine on duty recognized him and got him inside the compound, but damn, he nearly made the news that day! Can you imagine the infamy of being the marine having his picture taken hanging over the compound railings!!!! Oh and busted too! The other funny story (well not so funny for the marine concerned) was that the Gunnery Sergeant (who was a really good guy), travelled from the airport in the van that was transporting the VP's luggage, and when it was time to offload he couldn't get out!!! I have no idea what happened but he was locked in the back of the van! I don't know if they broke the lock or what in the end but he eventually did get out and the rest of the visit was \"uneventful\", I believe! Just as well really, I suppose!In other news it was Mother's Day here in France on Sunday so I had the kids over for lunch (not dinner as we're still under curfew). It was very nice and I made Jen a card from Charlie and cut some roses from the garden. The next day, 31st, was Jordan's 29th birthday (he was actually born on Mother's Day), so I also made him a card and got him a bottle of good wine, but we and a few friends have all chipped together to get him new symbols for his drum set (he's the drummer in their band and he beats the hell out of them, apparently). Jen's having us over for lunch on Saturday to celebrate his birthday so I'll get to see the little 'un again then! So you see there's no reason I should have been feeling down at all, but I guess this pandemic is wearing on everyone right! Oh, and I finally checked into getting vaccinated but as I suspected I am not eligible for it in France because I'm not covered by the French sécurité sociale (the French health service), so I will have to go into Switzerland, where I am covered with my private medical insurance. As far as I can tell it'll be the Moderna shot - although I'm not really sure - and I have a first appointment in July! Now it's on to getting the nose to the grindstone and off the sofa to get a few things done around here!"},
{"title": "Finally!", "date": "Wednesday 26 May 2021", "text": "Well it looks like spring is finally poking its nose round the corner after what must be one of the wettest months of May in recent history. Not only wet, but pretty darn cold for the time of year. Not that that bothers me too much, but it's quite something that I've only just turned the heating off today and it's 26 May!!! We've had tons of rain and I reckon that must have translated into snow at the higher altitudes (along with avalanche warnings). I mean just look at the picture I took out my bedroom window this morning. Yep, that's snow on them thar hills!Still, as I say, it looks like we might be turning a corner here now. I heard a very loud cuckoo in the back garden this morning and had a lovely woodpecker chipping away at the plum tree this evening. So now that the good weather is on the way, André offered to take my car into town and wash it for me! Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way a slob. I wash it regularly, I actually vacuumed it last week and I never throw stuff on the floor! It's just that it would seem my rims have been bugging him for ages so he took it into town and did a pretty good job cleaning it up. What with that and the neighbour's daughter offering to do the inside for me it is positively gleaming! Anaëlle (the daughter) does a really meticulous job cleaning cars and since she wants to earn a little pocket money why not! I had to stifle a giggle though because André had cleaned his car (his pride and joy) first before taking my car into town, and when he got back a bird had left a massive \"gift\" on his windscreen! Man was he pissed! And then again tonight, more bird poop on the hood of his car - which was when I realized that he parks closest to the house and just under the eaves I have a bird's nest, so I guess he'll need to keep a rag and bucket handy for a while!He went in to Geneva to stay at a friend's on Friday night and then Saturday had a birthday lunch with another friend. He hadn't planned to stay over but ended up calling me just before 9 p.m. to say he wouldn't make it home before curfew so was going to sleep over on Alexi's couch. When he got home the next day he looked rough, saying they'd stayed up half the night chatting and when he'd finally laid down to go to sleep Alexi's cat spent half the night playing with his toes like he was some kind of new toy, so he got no sleep. Not that he was too bothered though as he loves cats and wants to get at least one when he moves into his own place. He and Lily had two cats but, of course, he had to leave them behind when they divorced, so he's looking forward to getting one of his own!My friend and I had planned to \"play it by ear\" (i.e. wait for the good weather) before we go out walking again, and I had asked if he would be up for trying to hike up to La Bourgeoise near Samoëns, or if he fancied catching the cable car up to the Plâteau de Beauregard near la Clusaz in order to do the three-four hour walk back down. Well I think we'd decided on la Clusaz and the cable car - and then the dreadful cable car accident happened in northern Italy, killing (I think) 14 people, with one young boy being the only survivor! I had a brief \"flicker\" of maybe giving the cable car a miss but I know, in reality, I would still take one tomorrow! Same as flying. I hate flying but if not flying means I can't travel to the places I want to visit, well then I'm just going to fly and deal with it - usually by imbibing the in-flight white wine and trying to sleep through it!The cable car accident this week in Piedmont, northern Italy!Off on a totally different tangent, a few months ago my neighbour mentioned the Yuka app to me, which is an app that you can use to scan the bar code on an item of food or beauty products, for instance, and it will tell you what's in it and give the item a \"safety\" rating. Well last week I finally cracked and went to the hairdresser's to get this mushroom cloud on the top of my head brought into submission. When I mentioned that I'd been finding my hair to be a bit oily lately she suggested a particular shampoo and it seems to be a good fit, for the moment. It's a really attractive looking shampoo, but just out of curiosity I scanned it with the Yuka app. Well, it may be pretty but it wouldn't appear to be highly rated due to its high phenoxyethanol content (you can look the \"benefits\" of that up on google if you're interested). So on a whim I scanned a few more items and the results were interesting, to say the least. Now I know you can't live in a sterile bubble (nor would you want to I suspect) because it would be fundamentally impossible and every time you did come into contact with something \"unsuitable\" you would probably have a violent reaction to it but, as I say, the results were interesting!The Yuka app!Yves Rocher face creamFace cream from the local supermarket -about the same price as the Yves Rocher cream,neither of which are expensiveBrut deodorantThe shampoo I bought from the hairdresser!Now that all shops are open again I went out the other day looking for a travel bed for when the Munchkin is here. In the end I bought a larger playpen which will serve as a bed for when I'm babysitting him in July. It's now set up in prime location near the stairs in the living room and my house is starting to look like a day care centre - not that I mind, of course. Heck we had Jordan's first drum set in that exact same location for goodness knows how many years, plus the high chair, plus the toy box, plus ....! Jen has a physio appointment tomorrow afternoon and asked me to go over to babysit Charlie for a few hours, so that will be nice (for me at least - I'm not sure he could care less at this point)!And finally, I've taken a few more bags of clothes to the charity bin and started going through some very old issues of the BBC's Good Food Guide. I've been tearing out interesting recipes to try and throwing the rest of the magazine out, and the other day I found a recipe for aubergine, garlic and feta salad which was delicious (I was maybe a bit heavy-handed with the raw garlic but what the heck, it keeps the vampires away)! Then today I tried out fatoosh, which is a recipe I picked up from a Palestinian blogger and boy was it a big success with both of us. Mind you, all those fresh herbs and sumac (luckily I had some in the cupboard) are bound to be a recipe for success, right? So I've now been officially invited by André to come over and \"cook in his new place any time I want\"! Ah thanks babe, can't wait to take you up on that!Fatoosh salad - it's delicious!"},
{"title": "Neighbours!", "date": "Sunday 23 May 2021", "text": "It's been a pretty meh week this week, with just one day of decent-ish weather and the rest being wet and cool, so a crappy May all in all! My friend came over on Thursday (the only decent day) and we drove out to the lake at Thyez and then walked on into Cluses - which he seems to really like for some reason. The restrictions on café terraces have just been lifted so we were able to sit outside and have a drink once we got there and it was so nice to see people outside having lunch and a chat after so many months of restrictions. I think we've got about another three weeks (not sure of the date) before we'll be allowed to eat indoors but hopefully by then the weather will be hot and no-one will want to eat indoors anyway. Goodness knows the cafés and restaurants could do with a break right? On the way back I realized that Cluses' market is an all-day market so we had a quick wander round there and again it was really nice. There's quite a large North African community in Cluses so there were lots of lovely spices, dates, olives, almonds and cakes on sale and the smell was just wonderful. Maybe not as strong as the souks in Istanbul or Marrakech, but lovely all the same! All that and I clocked up another 14 km, which is just as well because I haven't done much else this week!I also got a message from my friend this week to say that she'd finally been granted French citizenship, and I'm delighted for her. She jumped on it as soon as the Brexit vote went down so she's at least a couple of years ahead of me. So while it takes ages, I guess the wheels of bureaucracy finally get there in the end don't they. I'm not really expecting anything for another two/three years anyway, but in two years time I will be 65 (yikes) and then having been in France over 25 years (nearer 35 at that point) and having a French grandchild I will be able to apply by ascendency so half this stuff I've been studying up on will no longer be necessary! It'll happen in the end, I suppose, and that time will go by whether or not I've started the process anyway, won't it!I was feeling a bit lethargic this weekend so finally gave myself a metaphorical kick up the butt and started sorting a few clothes out to put in the charity bin. When I tried some of them on I can only think \"what on earth was I thinking????\" so I quickly bundled them up and dropped them off immediately before I changed my mind! So just another - oh I don't know - 10,000 hours of sorting and I'll be good then! André has worked from home all week this week as there are major roadworks going on in Geneva, so I think he's getting a bit restless. That being said, he showed me a Youtube video of some guy having facial and nasal hair waxed which was pretty funny - well at least, the friend sitting in the background seemed to think it was hilarious as he was doubled up! I don't know which country they were in but the scream that this guy lets out when they yank his nasal hair out is quite something - not that we'll have an awful lot of sympathy for him, eh ladies?Eewww yuck!As I said, we've had so much rain this past week I realized I'd have to do something about my little greenhouse as the sheer weight of the accumulated rain was making the top sag. I've managed to wedge a few cross-poles up to the roof to hopefully keep it at a slope and help the rain to drain off it before it tears it. Note to self, \"when you go out in the morning to push the roof up with a broom and, hopefully, clear the rain water do it from the inside if you don't want to get a shower!\" I've actually taken to leaving an old spoon up by my raised beds too in order to do a bit of \"slug-flinging\" as the buggers keep getting into my lettuce beds! Well that and having a dedicated bucket and trowel for shit-shovelling deposits left by neighbours' dogs!!!! I've mentioned before that my back garden is open so my lawn seems to be fair game for quite a few dogs to come and \"relieve themselves\", including a dog belonging to one family who would go absolutely ballistic if someone else's dog left them a gift on their lawn! Still, I guess you have to take the good with the bad and on balance I'd say the \"good\" far outweighs the bad as far as my neighbours are concerned!The other day, just as I was on my way out, my immediate neighbour rang the doorbell and asked if she could come in for a coffee. She was wound up tighter than a coil so I put my plans to one side and sat with her for about half an hour. It was the usual, how much she hates her husband, if she had any money she'd leave him and how he treats her with utter contempt. Thing is, she won't (or probably can't) leave him at this point (she's nearly 70 and has no money) so it's a question of \"putting up\" I guess. That being said, I asked her to come out walking with me when the weather picks up as surely he is more than capable of making himself a sandwich right? We'll see how that works but if she's never said no to him in the past it will be difficult to start doing so now won't it. But there's an awful lot of truth to the saying that they treat you as bad as you allow yourself to be treated too isn't there!After that the doorbell went again and I'm already starting to do my Mutley impersonation (\"sazzafrazzarazza\") because I tend to live upstairs - and it was another neighbour who wanted to know if I had any harissa (I did) as she'd made couscous for 10 and had forgotten the harissa!Then a few minutes later, another doorbell! Thankfully I didn't yank the door open like an ungracious clod because it was another neighbour whose husband had been picking Lily of the Valley in the woods and she'd brought some round for me - shortly to be followed by yet another neighbour who'd been given some expensive tea by a salesman and she wanted to give it to me as she knows I'm a tea drinker! Add to that the fact that André stayed in Geneva last night at a friend's and then came crashing home around mid-day, took a shower and dashed back out to another friend's for a birthday lunch - it's been like Grand Central Station here! I shouldn't complain though because in all honesty I'll take the noise and the bustle over silence and solitude any day, I guess!"},
{"title": "Busy doing nothing!", "date": "Saturday 15 May 2021", "text": "Actually that's not true at all. I've been so busy this past week it's been great. I think I'm starting to see a pattern here. I get sudden bursts of energy when I get so much done and then a complete slump a few days later. Maybe it's the fact that I now actually allow myself to spend a day doing not much at all that's helping. I've kinda always been someone who felt I couldn't \"take a day off\" and envied those that could. Hell, my ex had no such problem! But now, well I guess I'm doing it to myself aren't I as I don't owe anyone anything! That being said, I made a cup of tea the other day and walked into the living room to hand one to André - who promptly told me he was busy \"landing a 747\" (on his phone of course) and he \"bet most pilots weren't handed a cup of tea as they were landing\"! Ha, and here's me thinking he was working! I have no idea why the thought popped into my head at that point - maybe it was the cup of tea business - but I remember a few years ago reading about a woman whose little boy had just been to see Santa at the store and as they were leaving he said \"guess what mommy, I know what Santa's name is, it's Sid. Sid Claus!\" When she asked how he knew that he said that some woman had popped her head round the back of the curtain behind Santa and said \"Sid, there's a cup of tea here for you when you're ready\"! Ha, ha, that still tickles me even now, all these years later!I was watching a new episode of Our Yorkshire Farm the other night and was absolutely taken with it, as always. For those that don't know it, Amanda Owen is a shepherdess who lives on a remote farm in the Yorkshire dales with her husband, Clive, and their nine children. Now Amanda is a smart cookie and being not only a shepherdess, but an over-six-foot-tall photogenic blond she/they have made their way onto British television giving an insight into the tough life of farmers in the dales! And why not! Farming is a hard and risky business at the best of times and if they can make an income through other means good for them. That being said, they're a hard working and very down-to-earth family and the kids are adorable. Anyway, in this episode eight of the nine kids were roped in to act as \"bait\" (probably not the most appropriate word) for the North Yorkshire Mountain Rescue team. The kids had a 30 minute head start and were free to go anywhere they wanted on their 2,000 acre farm. The idea was for them to hide and avoid detection for at least two hours, thereby giving the rescue teams an opportunity to put their and their dogs' skills to the test. In the end only the oldest boy, Ruben, managed to evade capture but it was a great programme to watch as the kids - knowing the farm like the back of their hands - really put the rescue teams through their paces!Amanda and Clive Owen and their family!And talking of \"knowing something like the back of your hand\", when I was in junior school (so from ages 6-10) there were no black children in the school at all - which was surprising actually because this was inner-city Birmingham. Still, that was the case until Dale joined our class in our last year. One day our English teacher commented about the expression \"to know something like the back of your hand\" and what a silly expression that was. \"I mean, who in this class could see a picture of the back of their hand and recognize it as their own\"? At which point Dale put his hand up and said \"I think I might, Sir\" and we all cracked up! While it can't have been easy being the first and only (at the time) black kid in the school, Dale fit right in from day one, as you can imagine with a sense of humour like that!The other day I went grocery shopping and stopped in at my favourite store, Fresh, and boy was it busy! People were lined up with their carts waiting to pay all the way to the back of the shop, but the two women on check-out were absolutely nailing it, running two cash registers each at the same time, having one customer unload their goods while they were ringing up the second person. They absolutely rocked. I did wonder why the place was so busy but then realized that Ascension is a public holiday in Switzerland and all those extra shoppers were coming over from Geneva. This was borne out when I went on to the next supermarket and the scene was the same there too. Still, I was in no hurry and if the stores can make good money because of it then I'm all for it!On Facebook I follow a few sites relating to local news and the other day I saw a post to say that the outdoor swimming pool, les Marquisats, in Annecy would be closed for renovations until September 2023??? Now I'm sure there's a good reason for this but it seems strange to me that the pool has been closed over a year so far because of covid and now is the time they start renovations? Still, ours is not to reason why, I guess!Les Marquisats pool!Another thing I've been following on FB is that as we Brits are now no longer in the EU, if family or friends want to come over and stay with us we will have to apply for an attestation d'accueil for them at least 30 days before they travel. Basically what that means is that as now third-country-nationals (TCN - i.e. non-EU citizens), if a Brit wants to come to France and stay in a hotel, no problem - the hotel will do the paperwork. But, if a Brit wants to come over and stay with family or friends, the family (me in this case) has to provide a whole range of paperwork, basically guaranteeing to cover their expenses while they are over here, that I have a place to put them up and that I am here legally - and all this has to be approved by the Mairie at least 30 days in advance! There's been much too-ing and fro-ing about this with some saying that while the clause about TCNs does exist it isn't always applied. So by that logic when my ex comes over in September to see Charlie, André will have to do the necessary to get him an attestation. Oh, and it costs €30 a pop too! I guess this is the way other nationalities (or certain other nationalities) have always been treated but I'll be curious to see how it works in practice. I know when my in-laws came over years ago we never did this - or even when my ex's cousins came over, so who knows what's gonna happen. And of course if France starts applying this to the Brits, then logically the UK will start reciprocating. What a bloody cock up - just another one of the joys of Brexit!I spent about five hours working in the garden the other day, digging up some more of my veggie patch and trying to get the plants I'd bought planted before they die (a speciality of mine). I also spent a very frustrating hour or so trying to put together my little plastic greenhouse with the God-awful instructions. You'd think \"attach parts 1 and 2 to joints A and B\" would be easy wouldn't you, but I took that thing apart three times before I figured it out on my own as the instructions were that bad! I also had the joys of trying to get the cover over the bloody thing while holding it together at the same time (André was in the office) and every so often a gust of wind would pick the damn thing up leaving me in danger of flying off inside it like some kind of French Mary bloody Poppins. Still, it's up now and so far so good! I've also passed the 500 mile mark in my walking and while it could definitely be better, signing up for the \"Walk 1,000 Miles\" challenge again really has pushed me to do more than I otherwise would!And finally, Charlie is coming along in leaps and bounds now he's more settled. André spent the night at Jordan and Jen's last night as they wanted to play some guitar and Jen sent me a video of Charlie lying on his play mat in between his dad and his uncle playing guitar and him cooing away and (seemingly) thoroughly enjoying himself. Aaahhhh!!Charlie at seven weeks! Be still mybeating heart!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 10 May 2021", "text": "We've had bloody awful weather this past week. Solid rain every day - that is, until the weekend, which turned out nice and sunny thankfully. Now here we're back to Monday morning and it's forecast rain all week again. A typical May I guess. Usually rain doesn't bother me too much because I'm so used to it of course, but I feel sorry for people like my neighbour as it really brings her mood down and she finds it so hard to tolerate!I went out last week though and bought a few more veggie plants (oh how I love wandering round the big garden centres) and got the last plastic greenhouse-thingy in stock. Well, it's more of a shelter for the tomato plants really, but now I'm wondering if it will stand up to the winds we sometimes get round here. I always plant my tomatoes up against the living room window - where they do well as it's a sheltered, sunny spot up against a white wall. Trouble is, I keep running out of space, so hence I wanted the greenhouse. I took out my little rototiller and gouged out a spot at the top of the garden right next to my raised beds, so we'll see how my various veggies make out up there. I have no doubt they will thrive as it's a really sunny spot, but given the howling wind we had last night I'm a bit worried that I might wake up one morning and find my veggies scattered across the farmer's field being eaten by the donkeys. Time will tell I guess!In other news I think my kettle is on the blink as now when I turn it on we get loud whistling sounds like some opera singer warming up. Since André has the same whacky sense of humour as I do I mentioned the Florence Foster Jenkins film to him as my kettle sounds just like Meryl the Diva in that movie. So André pulled up the trailer for the film on his phone - and I swear if I hear that bloody thing one more time I think I'll brain him! It is funny, of course, but he keeps playing it over and over to the point that I want to punch him in the throat. Luckily he went in to work twice last week so I did get some respite. On the way home on Wednesday, as he was driving through Geneva he sent Lily's grandma a message to ask if she wanted company - which she did, and I'm so glad he still makes the effort to see her as she's a lovely lady! Her grandkids always called her Abuela, even though she's not Spanish, and when André and Lily divorced she told him that he was still family to her and to keep in touch - and he has! Good on him! Later - and I don't know how we got on the subject  - but he was telling me about a recurring nightmare he has about him being chased round the airport by a dinosaur???? Anyone wanna take a shot at that one?On Friday I stopped over to see the Munchkin and Jen left him with his dad and me for about three hours while she went out shopping. He is doing so much better, putting on weight and is much more relaxed now that his feeding is getting sorted. He's also just starting to react and smile (a little), so I spent a good 15 minutes telling him the story of how Mr. Donkey and Mr. Horsey in the field behind me decided to have a race, and since Mr. Horsey let Mr. Donkey win, they are now big friends and can't wait to meet Charlie next time he comes over! Rubbish I know but my dad was always babbling away like that to the grands. Jordan just rolled his eyes but Charlie smiled - or it might have been gas, but I'll take it as a smile! Jordan was telling me that they have so much work lined up he'll never be unemployed. So much so that they are looking to take on another qualified plumber and an apprentice but they can't find anyone??? Wow, I would have thought they'd have their pick, what with the crappy economic situation right now. There are three qualified plumbers (Max and his brother - the owners of the company - and Jordan) and one older man in his 40s who is retraining, having worked in the food industry for many years. He was also telling me that they have another big contract in Chamonix (where the Mont Blanc is) and for six months of the year, when access to the mountain refuges is on foot only, they will get taken up there by helicopter! Not bad huh - well it beats sitting on the number 25 bus for 90 minutes every day doesn't it!Chamonix and the Mont BlancWe had sad news from work this week when we were informed that a colleague had died (of cancer, I believe) at the age of 58. Many moons ago P had lived opposite me for about a year so my kids knew him. Well, more so André than Jordan, as Jordan was just a toddler. About 25 years ago he was lucky enough to win around $1.5 million (or the equivalent in Swiss francs), and yet within a few years it was all gone and he had nothing to show for it. All of a sudden he had \"friends\" crawling out of the woodwork who wanted to open a bar and so on, and so yep, just a few years later it was all gone and he had nothing. He didn't even own his own home and was living in a rented apartment when he died. He may have been a fool to lose all that money but he wasn't a nasty guy - in fact, he was pretty kind and decent - if gullible, I suppose. Poor guy, worked all those years and never got to enjoy retirement! It's sobering isn't it!Then the other day my neighbour came round and asked me if I would keep an eye on their place as they were having to dash off to the west coast of France as Mamie (his mom) is going downhill fast. Well she's 102 so I suppose it was to be expected, but I have to say I was a bit surprised at his reaction. When he got the phone call his eyes filled with tears - and yet he never called her, if she would call him he, himself, told me he would put the phone down and walk off leaving her chattering away to herself, and as far as I could see there was no love lost on his part. For her, on the other hand, he was the Boy King who could do no wrong - and yet it was her daughters who took care of her and did everything for her, not him. She even told me one time how lucky I was to have two boys. I found that quite insulting actually so just said I would have been equally lucky to have two girls as all children were a blessing. I'm not sure she appreciated that though! A couple of days after they left I felt sure I could hear something in their basement, and sure enough there was 10 cm of water down there (again). Our other neighbour came round with a heavy duty drill and was trying to create an evacuation spot to allow the water to escape (presumably with their go ahead), and from what I can see it's ok for the time being - but it's still raining of course! Damn I'm glad my basement has been spared (so far)! The other day I got a very sweet message from a former colleague saying that she'd heard I had a new grandson and sending me her congratulations. She's in her early 40s and was saying she's desperate to get vaccinated as she can't wait to get out of here because she's \"sick to death of mountains and lakes\"! That made me laugh actually, but as she's half Spanish I get that she wants to head down to Spain - it was just a funny way to say it. I mean, who the heck can be \"sick of mountains and lakes\"? Not me, that's for sure. Talking of which, Marysette (from the sewing club) and I went off walking on Saturday at a new-to-me spot about 30 minutes down the road from here. I'd often seen the signpost for the Lac Bleu but never went down there, and boy was I missing something! It was hot and pretty uncrowded when we got there and somehow, over a period of about five hours, we managed to clock up 18 km! Oh we stopped and had a picnic, then stopped again for a coffee, but still, we put the km in (and I got a rather fetching sunburn on my right arm and a V-shape burn on my neck - again. Will I ever learn?The Lac Bleu, although \"green lake\" seemsmore fitting than \"blue lake\" to be honest!Samoëns!"},
{"title": "And there you have it!", "date": "Thursday 6 May 2021", "text": "Well it took a little longer than usual, but Mr. Wonderful of Words With Friends fame finally showed his true colours after about four days! Yeah, hunky \"Louis\" with the cutey pie dog picture wanted to chat. Now when they do this (according to my own experience and confirmed by other ladies), they're either married/partnered men looking for a bit on the side or they're scammers. And would you believe it, but after \"Louis\" started to show his hand, \"Kelvin\" also showed up just dying to play WWF with me. I usually can't be arsed with these guys - in fact I never accept to play against a man now because what 32 year old Nigerian guy (seriously!) is really looking to play Word With Friends? Anyway, I took screen shots along the way, so ladies if \"Louis\" or \"Kelvin\" ever wants to play WWF with you, I'd give it a miss!Gorgeous \"Louis\" (they never look like the back end of a bus do they!So he's a diamond miner - dangerous job huh!And they're always tragically widowed - with their bratty kids being off their hands. At this point I told André I was surprised he wasn't US military (I'm giving André a running commentary and we're cracking up)!When he asked about my kids I told them one worked for Interpol - just to see if it would shake him up a bit. Thing is, it would be perfectly possible for my son to work for Interpol as Lyon's within easy commuting distance from here. These guys usually have several scams running at once so they don't actually read most of what you've written, so nope, Interpol didn't seem to phase him!When I asked \"Louis\" why he was showing up as \"Dennis G\" on my phone when he sent me a message he said he didn't know - but he quickly corrected his settings to show up as \"Louis\" again!By this time he had asked me for a photo so he could \"see what I looked like\", despite already telling me I had a \"smile that could light up the world\". I was getting a bit fed up by this time so just pulled the plug and blocked him!Enter \"Kelvin\", who's a \"military doctor currently on contract with Nato\" - in Afghanistan (oh bless his heart)!And of course he'll soon be retiring (so free to travel and meet up with little ol' me, who he has already fallen madly in love with, ya see)! I told him I was retired from the UN (not true), which was great as their pensions are pretty generous! So then the eejit asks me what \"my organization\" does (told ya, they don't read everything because they've got several scams going on at the same time)!So then I asked \"Kelvin\" why he was showing up as \"Sarah Nevada\" on my phone. \"Sarah Nevada\" - ha ha, that's not even clever, but I guess that's the name he uses when he's trying to scam/catfish a man!At this point I'd pretty much worn my \"typing finger\" down with these two and at some point I really needed to get in the shower so I just told him I knew what he was up to and basically to f.... off! Still, my car's in the garage, it's raining and I have nothing better to do. Well, that's not strictly true, I have tons of things I could be doing but .... it was fun for a while and André and I have really had a blast drafting messages to these two! So happy days then - I'm off to get in the shower!"},
{"title": "Anyone taking bets?", "date": "Saturday 1 May 2021", "text": "Happy May Day everyone! Actually I'd forgotten it was May Day until I drove into town and saw the vendors selling Lily of the Valley on all the street corners. That brought back memories of an old boss from before I was married who used to bring all the ladies in the office Lily of the Valley on May Day! He was somewhat \"bohemian\" in his outlook but he was always very nice to me. I never quite knew his family set-up but when he died I was surprised to see the announcement in the paper saying \"in loving memory - from A, his partner, M, his wife and XXXX his children\"! Good old Mr. T, God rest his soul!This week being the last week of lockdown (until the next time?) it's been a bit \"blah\", and even though it hasn't affected me as badly as some, I think we're all ready for it to be over. And it is - somewhat! As from Monday the restriction of staying within 10 km of your home is lifted, but the curfew remains. More stores are allowed to reopen and while I can't remember the exact dates, restaurant terraces are opening up, with cinemas and concert halls to follow, but indoor gyms being the last to open up mid-June. By end of June, \"all being well\", I believe the last curfews will be lifted and the country should open right back up. To be honest, even if (and when) the numbers start going back up I don't think people will be willing to go into another lockdown, given all the economic and emotional downsides. I guess we'll have to wait and see though won't we. I'll just be glad to be able to go back up the mountains now that we're freer and the snow is disappearing (although there were still avalanche warnings as late as last week)!I had another doctor's appointment in Geneva last week so my friend met me and we sat and had a drink together on the terrace of a café and both really enjoyed it. He's bored and I guess we're all missing human contact, especially those of us that are either working from home or retired. But can someone explain to me how I managed to walk away with some darning of his to do!!! He was wearing a nice dark blue sweater and when I commented on it he said it had been his father's and he wore it on occasion for sentimental reasons. When I pointed out it would look much better without the moth holes he was mortified, so cue me ending up bringing it home and attempting to clean it up a bit! I walked right into that one didn't I!On the Munchkin front, Jen took Charlie for his one month check up and explained to the paediatrician the problems he had started having on the feeding front. So the doctor ran some tests on him and while he is indeed slightly lactose-intolerant she said it wasn't enough to justify switching to the rice milk. Moreover she explained that rice milk is constipating so it's no wonder the poor little thing was in such pain the other week. She did say, though, that his oesophagus is quite raw from the acid reflux many babies get when the valve that stops the back flow hasn't toughened up yet, so she's given Jen a treatment for that and hey presto, he's a much happier baby and they're getting several rounds of four hours sleep a night, so everyone is happy!André helped me move some garden furniture this week and drag up my sunbed from the basement, which I made full use of on Tuesday as it was lovely weather. Just as well I did though because it's been piddling down ever since - drab, wet and grey! So I've spent a lot of time indoors pottering about doing nothing much in particular. Then today the landline and internet connection went down for about eight hours so there was no computer, no wifi, no landline and no Netflix. What to do? Well luckily I had just picked up a Joanne Harris novel called Five Quarters of the Orange and I'm loving it, so not having internet turned into a rather nice bonus today as I got to sit and read for hours. André said the same thing actually, but when I pointed out that if it wasn't restored by this evening he might have to talk to me instead of chatting with his mates, I saw the realization spread across his face that maybe it wasn't such a great thing after all!There's a group of former long-term colleagues who get on a zoom chat most weekends and this Sunday we were \"reminiscing\" - as is your want, I suppose, when you've worked together for so many years. At one point we were discussing the different computer systems we'd used over the years, and P made us all laugh when he said that at one of our organization's big meetings in Punta del Este (Uruguay) in 1986 someone told him that a document had arrived from Geneva and he couldn't figure out how it had got there - he'd never heard of a fax machine ya see! Time, tide and technology wait for no man do they! Then the other night I was channel-hopping and ended up watching the 1967 movie To Sir With Love starring Sidney Poitier (can you believe he's now 94)? It's about a young unemployed black man who takes up a post as a teacher in a tough area of London and how he wins over his class of \"rough\" students, although frankly if you considered that lot \"rough\", you'd have to agree that the schoolkids in the movie Grease were Hell's Angels! But it was a nice movie and I absolutely loved Lulu singing To Sir With Love. I wasn't a great fan of Lulu but she just nails that song!And finally, when the internet connection was restored this evening I was catching up on a few rounds of Words With Friends on FB. I tend to end up playing against the same people over and over again - none of whom (except for my friend in New York) is a man. It's pretty well known, in fact, that so many youngish men use WWF to try to pick up women and after playing a few words they suggest \"switching to WhatsApp\" or want your email address. Well, Mr. Hunk - he with the cutesy photo of him snuggling up to his dog - asked me to start a game tonight so I played the first round. Anyone wanna make bets on how many rounds he plays before he wants to switch to Whatsapp? All bets are currently open!"},
{"title": "Oh dear!", "date": "Saturday 24 April 2021", "text": "Well one more week to go and hopefully we'll be out of lockdown (again). I've felt a bit bleh this week but I suppose that's normal. I haven't been out walking because I guess I kinda \"resent\" the 10 km limit imposed on us - which is pretty stupid really because there are nice walks round here well within that radius! But don't mind me - I'm just having a whinge!My dentist called the other day to say she'd had a cancellation and did I want it to get my broken tooth fixed? I did, of course and it was so nice to be back in Geneva for a change. There was loads of parking because I guess many people are still working from home and as Geneva \"opened back up\" on Monday there were people sitting on café terraces eating or having a drink. I thought about stopping and having a drink too but since she'd pumped goodness knows how much anaesthetic into my mouth I thought the sight of me slobbering at the next table might put people off their food so decided to go straight home! It did bring home to me, though, that while I'm pretty happy on my own, I have missed socializing too, particularly before the weather gets too hot for my liking. And talking of teeth, I've gotten more into Grace and Frankie as it's gone on and it's made a nice change to watch something \"silly\" and not too taxing, buuut I have to admit I'm becoming a bit fixated on Martin Sheen's teeth! I don't know if he always had \"prominent\" teeth (goodness knows he was a gorgeous young man), but I keep wanting to suck those babies back in and I find it a little distracting. Still, I can live with it and the whole series has been a pleasant interlude in the seemingly never-ending bleh of the pandemic!Martin Sheen and Sam WatersonTalking of the pandemic (for a change), I saw an article in the news the other day where the city of Nice announced that they had 4,000 doses of the AstraZenica vaccine available and only 50 people turned up to get their shot! I don't know if people have been put off by all the bad press AstraZenica has gotten recently (which is a shame, I guess, because I believe Oxford University asked for it to be distributed at cost price - unlike the other vaccines), or if people are just not interested in getting vaccinated at all. I don't know to be honest!The other day I did a bit of baking and made James Martin's banana and maple syrup cake and while it looked nice I do wonder why I bother as I don't particularly like banana cake anyway. Still Jordan and Jen liked it and the Dorset apple cake I also made - that one's a winner every time! I also decided that while I was feeling pretty listless I'd give up on reading a couple of books which were turning out to be quite depressing. So I had a rummage through the hundreds of books on my shelves just waiting to be read and found a couple of Joanne Harris books (Chocolat anyone?) and another Carl Hiassen book (Star Island) which is a real hoot! I also saw that one of the victims of serial conman Mark Acklom has written a book about how he conned her out of the £850,000 she had in the bank from the sale of her home! I guess I was interested in his story because he was finally picked up by the police on the terrace of a café that I know in Geneva so his name stuck in my head. I think at last count he's been to prison five times and started his \"career\" as a conman at the age of 16!!!!! Damn!!! I know people will say \"how the hell did he con her out of £850,000?\" and \"oh that would never happen to me\", but I think these sociopaths are so good at what they do that so many people are in way too far before they realize they've been had. When the book comes out I'll download a sample onto my kindle as I think it might be a good read and, hopefully, a way for her to make back just a little of what he took from her!Serial con artist Mark Acklom!I got a pleasant surprise too the other day when I realized the farmer has yet again indulged his pleasure and put more donkeys in the fields at the back of my house. I counted 10 (there may have been more) and at least four babies and they are beautiful - if noisy buggers!And finally, more good news came when Jen asked me if I could watch the babe today while they had a meeting at the bank. They had had a rough time with his feeding this week so Jen called and got an appointment with a paediatrician when he started having trouble breathing and constantly throwing up his milk. Between them they figured out he is lactose intolerant - as is Jen, so I guess she shouldn't have been surprised - and they've now switched him to baby milk made from rice. She was so upset as she had desperately wanted to breast feed and wasn't able to, but now the Munchkin has had his milk switched hopefully he will be better able to tolerate it. When they dropped him off today they said to \"watch out\" because he's got some evil farts due to not having pooped in the past 24 hours - and indeed he smelled like he'd eaten a dead rat and could clear a room in about five seconds! For the first hour he was in his little baby carrier and every time he opened his eyes he had André's grinning mug in his face. After a while though he started getting cranky with stomach pains, but I was able to pacify him for the most part. I was concerned in case he hadn't peed so put him on the bed and took his nappy off and that was fine, but trying to put a new one back on him was like trying to dress a feral cat! Damn those legs were all over the place! At that point he must have got a really bad pain because he just sobbed (I almost did too). Oh it didn't last for long - just a few seconds - but it broke my heart to see. Still, all's well that ends well. Jordan and Jen were invited over to Max's for lunch and when Jen sent me a picture from over there she also said that he'd just pooped. She also sent me a picture of that (just in case I doubted her?) and it was all up his back and on his clothes (I guess I didn't get that nappy on so well then), but boy I'm glad that load didn't end up all over my bed! André said it looked like he'd been eating grass (!) so I reckon it was changing the milks on him that did it. Poor little soul, but at least I guess/hope he'll be happier now! And that, folks, is the poopy diaper story for the day. You're welcome! And bon appétit!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Friday 16 April 2021", "text": "The past couple of weeks have felt pretty long to me - just dragging by - or maybe it's just that this lockdown is feeling longer than the previous couple. We're two weeks into a four week lockdown \"lite\" and I'm guessing everyone is feeling pretty much the same! Still, time moves on, lockdown or no lockdown! The other day André finally received the good news that his loan application to buy his apartment has been approved. We were pretty certain it would be anyway (he's already picked out the kitchen units and flooring), but of course it's never over 'til the fat lady sings is it. His loan will be in Swiss francs, while the apartment is in France (think euros), but that makes sense as he earns Swissies and so will not have to worry about exchange rate fluctuations. I think more and more he's seeing what a good idea it was moving back into France (he originally wanted to stay in Geneva), because he realizes how much cheaper it is this side of the border, how beautiful it is (although he knew that anyway, having grown up here), and he has just as many mates over here (if not more) than he had when living in Geneva. It's amazing too to see that his monthly repayment will be just SF 1,100, compared to the SF 1,000/month he paid as his share of the rent on the one-bedroomed apartment he and Lily rented in Geneva. Of course he'll have all the other bills to keep up with on his own, but it's more than doable if he's sensible. He's also become more aware that one of the best guarantees of financial security in retirement is to own your own home outright. So yeah, he's stoked! What with that and stashing the cash to buy all the stuff he's going to need - it'll be fun to go out shopping with him! He also finally received his carte grise (title/log book?) for his car, which will allow him to switch his Swiss plates over to French. You're supposed to have these switched within three months of moving into France (he's been here 10!) but I guess there's not much they can say when you've done the necessary and yet still not received the corresponding official paperwork from them!We've had snow three times over the past few days but honestly nothing to write home about, although the temperatures have dropped quite significantly again. I went down to the market in my local town of La Roche yesterday looking to buy some new tea towels and veggie plants, and while I got a few plants, the bric-a-brac stand wasn't there, so I decided to head to the market in Bonneville today to see if I'd have better luck - but again, he wasn't there. That's when I realized, of course, all the non-essential stores are in lockdown so they're not allowing non-essential market vendors to trade either!!! In fact I would say Bonneville's market was operating at about only one-third capacity, so life has got to be hard for some of these stall-holders. I've been tracking the number of covid-related deaths in both the UK and France, since both countries have a pretty similar population size. France is due to hit 100,000 deaths shortly and seems to be tracking at 30,000 fewer deaths than the UK on a fairly consistent basis, so who knows which government got this lockdown business \"right\"! While I was at the market it struck me how nice it must be to just be able to wander out of your home and have the shops/markets right there, within walking distance. I know I'd be in heaven if I could do my shopping at Turin's market every day! While I have no plans to sell right now I realize at a later stage it might be an option for me to get an apartment in a small town round here in order to be able to walk everywhere. I already dislike driving in the snow and getting a small place in town would definitely have it's appeal, it's just that while my house is nothing special, the view from my back garden is just glorious, so I don't see me selling up just yet - but who knows what the future might bring!Bonneville market place!The other day I managed to break a tooth so I'm going to have to cross the border next week as my dentist is in Geneva. As I'm going to be in Switzerland anyway I thought I'd book up another couple of check-ups to get them out of the way too and hopefully be done with doctors for the year! After I got off the phone fixing up my appointments, André called me to come and take a look at the dishwasher, which was \"fizzing\" away nicely. Turns out I'd put washing machine tablets into the dishwasher (????) by mistake! I guess that's one way to get the floor properly clean isn't it!Yesterday I drove over to baby-sit the Munchkin so that Jen could have a few hours to herself (ladies, remember the luxury of being able to have a shower and wash your hair with the bathroom door shut?)! He'd just slurped his way through 120 ml of milk (up from 90 ml) and is going great guns, although the fact that he actually seems to \"hoover\" his milk is giving him a bit of tummy trouble. I can't say it's colic as it doesn't seem that severe, but since Jen's started giving him a fennel/camomile-based drink also it does seem a bit better. Oddly enough I remember my mom telling me that \"in the day\" they used to put a piece of coal from the fire into boiling water, let the water cool down and then give it to the baby as a colic remedy, and it worked pretty well. Makes sense, I suppose, since charcoal is in many \"tummy upset\" remedies. But isn't it amazing how so many of these old wives' tales turn out to be bang on? Anyway I played with the babe, who is now starting to open his eyes more, and babbled away to him for ages. Poor kid, he's probably wondering about the black and white fuzzy thing in his field of vision and the bunch of cobblers she's telling him! Still, it was lovely to spend some time with him, and at least Jen got to have a few hours to herself!Then the other night I was watching Mary Berry's Foolproof Cooking on TV and since I like Mary and so many of those recipes looked good, I decided to throw caution to the wind and order the accompanying book - and to hell with the expense! Well all €7 of \"expense\" really, since I went online and bought it second-hand. Not that I really need another cook book but if I ain't going to either Thailand or Mexico this year ...! I've also been continuing to enjoy more of Grace and Frankie. While the series is fun, I'm absolutely loving the music that goes with it, so I decided to go through the entire series and, using my superior technical skills (ha!), have been downloading the songs I really like to my Amazon Prime Music account! Anyone else love Dorothy Moore's Misty Blue or Candi Staton's Young Hearts Run Free? I mentioned before that I want to get rid of about 200 CDs I have cluttering up my house (most of them being my ex-husband's), so I'm going to pick out the one or two songs I like on each CD to download and then box them up for André to take with him. Win/win right? Then André was telling me that if I got an \"auxiliary music cable\" I could plug my phone in downstairs or in my car and play my own playlists anywhere. Who wudda thunk (see previous note about my technology skills)! Well since I didn't know what an \"auxiliary music cable\" was in French, and typing \"musical thingy\" into Amazon France doesn't seem to get me anywhere, I went on to Amazon UK and rummaged around, then went back to Amazon France to order. I no longer order anything from the UK thanks to Brexit because I'd have to pay extra for the customs paperwork and, potentially, customs duty on the items ordered. But this morning, just before I set off to the market, I got a message on my phone saying my parcel was being \"held up due to unpaid customs duties\"! I had to think for a minute but then realized it was a scam. Everything I've just ordered I ordered through Amazon France, and even if I had ordered anything from the UK, the grand total was about £25 and I wouldn't need to be paying customs duties on such a small amount. It can't just be a coincidence that I've just been on Amazon UK and Amazon France and all of a sudden someone's trying to scam me about \"parcels\". Makes you wonder though - that's pretty sophisticated scamming somewhere along the line isn't it!"},
{"title": "The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish ...!", "date": "Friday 9 April 2021", "text": "Well André and I kept the Munchkin here for five hours on Wednesday while mom and dad did a lot of running around, registering his birth with all the different agencies and so on and he was an absolute doll! It helps that André is even more ga ga than I am, so much so that after he'd given him his bottle I got the kitchen timer and put it on the table so he'd know when his \"time was up\" holding the babe! Ha! But seriously, he was so easy. Jen asked me to make sure that he held off on his next bottle for four hours as she really wants to get him on a schedule and I'd guess we only had about 15 minutes of him getting a bit restless before we could legitimately give him his next bottle - hence me walking around with him singing \"the wheels on the bus go round and round\" ... and I hate that bloody song! Still, it worked, he was as good as gold and Jordan and Jen got everything done that they needed to! Any time, kids, any time!While they were out my front doorbell rang and I opened it to two young men who thought they had an appointment to do an \"insulation evaluation\" of my house, but when they saw me they realized they'd got the wrong address. I had to laugh when the first guy said \"oh, sorry, I must have the wrong address because I made the appointment with a young person\" (!) and when he asked if it might be next door I said nope, they're even \"less young\" than I am! I did point out that if they were hoping to make a few sales they might want to finetune their doorstep patter a tad, but we all ended up laughing anyway. A little later André took me down into town to pick up my new compost bin and I'm dead pleased with it! I know, to think I used to love going clothes shopping and now I'm all excited about a compost bin. It was really easy to assemble but you needed to be two people as it was heavy and unwieldly, but we got there in the end. Not bad for €15 huh?Then, bugger me but didn't I get another whingeing email from bloody Chantal, she of the \"let's hide behind the cauliflowers\" fame. Why she thinks I care about anything she has to complain about is beyond me, but apparently she had just received a plaque from work to commemorate her 30 years of service to the organization and \"had I received one, and wasn't it a load of rubbish, and what a stupid thing to waste their money on\" .... and so on ad nauseum! Damn it woman, if you don't like it stick it in a cupboard or throw it in the bin but stop bloody moaning! (On a side note, I actually quite like mine and have it in a display cabinet)! Needless to say I never responded to her, but her constant whingeing gets right up my nose!And finally, Prince Philip's dying shouldn't really have come as a surprise to anyone I guess. I mean, he was 99 after all, although it's a shame he didn't quite make it to 100! He had lived a very dramatic young life, being smuggled out of Greece as a baby in an orange crate, his mother being diagnosed with schizophrenia (I believe) and ending up in a psychiatric institution and his pregnant sister and her family being killed in a small plane crash. However \"privileged\" he might have been by birth, that's a hellluva lot for any young man to live through. But I liked him. I believe he was a force to reckon with and an absolute rock for the Queen. I also like the fact that he was irreverent and apparently had a great sense of humour. I guess most of us thought he was perennial because he'd always just kinda been there - and yet now he isn't. I'm also assuming his passing will knock quite a few stand-up comedians off balance for a while. But however much they made fun of him I genuinely believe he was held in a lot of affection by greater numbers than those that disliked him. I, for one, think he'll be sadly missed as one of the last real, true characters!"},
{"title": "All good stuff!", "date": "Monday 5 April 2021", "text": "Did anyone see the amazing pictures coming out of Cairo yesterday where they were moving the sarcophaguses (sarcophagi?) of 22 Egyptian pharoahs to a new museum? They made a huge show out of moving the bodies of 18 kings and four queens to their new resting places and oh man, would I have loved to have seen that! Birmingham, where I grew up, had the most amazing library (goes with being a big city I guess) and what to me, as a young girl, was the most fabulous natural history museum. Before I got my Saturday job and was forever working, my mom used to let me catch the bus into town and wander round the city. I would go with my friend, Joy, with a whole 50 pence (I know!!!!), 16p of which would go for bus fares and we would spend the rest of the day wandering round the museum, the library and then on to Birmingham's Bull Ring market where we'd wander round the \"rag market\", take a few naff photos in a booth and then catch the bus back home. But the highlight of my day was always the natural history museum, and the ancient Egyptian section in particular. They had at least one complete mummy (that I remember - there may have been more) and displays of the jewels and barrettes that the ladies would wear in their hair and all I wanted to do was pick them up and handle them - which I wasn't allowed to do of course. That would be like taking a bone out of the T-rex exhibit's leg I guess! I know that part of the Cairo show was intended to generate interest in Egypt as a tourist destination, but I swear if I could have flown to Cairo yesterday I would have done! It's only a few hours' flight after all (damn the coronavirus)!The other day I had a call from my friend, Marilyn, who wanted to know what she could send as a gift for the Munchkin. I've mentioned her before but Marilyn (American) was married to Philippe (French) and lived in the house opposite when we moved into the house where I still live. Times moved on, Philippe was head-hunted and they moved to the States where, sadly, he became seriously ill and eventually died. Marilyn's daughter is now married and working in London and Marilyn moved to Ireland with her son when he was transferred to Cork for his job. Her son is now married and has a step-daughter but it has long been all their ambitions to move back to France which, since Marilyn also holds French citizenship, should not be a problem for her. Well we spoke on the phone today and her daughter-in-law found out her transfer request to France has been approved and they are looking to rent in Annecy, where Marilyn and Philippe already owned an apartment which they rented out. So the good news is that Marilyn will be moving back to France, into her own apartment in Annecy, hopefully sometime in the summer. I am so looking forward to it as we have been friends for over 30 years. Circumstances separated us for a good many years but our friendship always remained solid. So I guess as soon as she moves back we will be careening round France like a geriatric Thelma and Louise (but without the yucky ending)! As long as we don't look in the mirror I guess we can pretend we're both still 30 again! I can't wait!And the even better news is that Jordan just sent me a message to ask if they could leave the Munchkin with me for a few hours on Wednesday afternoon as they have a few appointments in town. I asked if he was out of nappies already but it turns out he might be a bit slow. André said to tell them no because he'll get no work done (he is even more gaga about that kid than I am), but yay me, he's only a week old and I'm already getting to babysit. Does life get any better than that? I don't think so!"},
{"title": "Here we are again!", "date": "Sunday 4 April 2021", "text": "As of Saturday at 19h the whole of France has been put back into lockdown. Not as severe as the first two we endured, but lockdown nevertheless. All non-essential shops are to shut again, I'm not quite sure what's going on with schools/universities as I don't pay much attention to that, the 7 p.m. curfew is being maintained and people are being required to remain within 10 km of their homes unless there are mitigating circumstances and they have the required attestation with them. Oh well, I guess we'll just have to get on with it won't we. At least it's not \"one hour to exercise per day within 1 km from home and with a permission slip\" again, so I guess that's a positive. It strikes me that countries impose restrictions/lockdowns, the numbers go down and then as soon as they start easing out of lockdown the numbers start shooting back up again. I guess I'm just curious to see how many \"waves\" there are going to be before we get to the end of this nightmare!The vaccine situation in France is woefully poor, and I'm not sure whether it's EU-cock-up related or for some other reason, but either way, they are way behind other countries in getting people vaccinated. Just out of curiosity I went on the government's website to do a \"simulation\" of when I could expect to get vaccinated and by the time I got to the end of the simulation, the site basically burst out laughing and said \"see you next autumn sometime\". I can't say I'm bothered one way or the other. If I have to stay home then so be it - that really doesn't bother me too much - and when the time comes that a vaccine is available for me, well then I'll take it. There's not much else I can do anyway is there!When I went shopping the other day I noticed that some of the supermarket shelves were emptier than they had been, but I'm pretty sure it's not panic buying. I mean, everyone knows now that the stores are staying open and there is no reason to over-stock, so I was wondering if it was linked to the backlog of cargo ships stuck in the Suez Canal. Maybe - who knows - but if so, it would kinda show just how dependent we in the west have become on goods from Asia wouldn't it!So with another lockdown ahead of me for the next month, I've been looking through my cookbooks and trying out new recipes. I've also decided that however far off my interview for French citizenship might be, now would be a good time to spend 30 minutes a night going through the potential background questions I could be asked if I ever get a date for my interview. A \"baffle them with my knowledge\" kinda thing! Of course I have the luxury of not worrying about money because I'm retired, and both my kids and Jen are also pretty safe, and I realize that is not the case for so many people. It got me thinking, though, back to my trip to Rhodes with Steve a few years ago and how we used to chat to the waiter at our hotel every day. He worked in the tourist industry during the summer months and as a fisherman during the winter months and he told us how the cost of the licence to sell his catch at Lindos (beautiful place) had doubled overnight, and while he could maintain this work schedule for the time being as he was still young, he didn't know how he was going to manage as he got older. Well seeing how the tourist spots have been hit by the travel bans, I was wondering what had become of him and his family. They and so many others will surely be having a difficult time, which brings home to me just how lucky I am!I've also been continuing to watch Grace and Frankie and have to admit I'm liking it more than I originally thought I would. It was hard to stick with at the beginning as I thought it was so contrived, but it's definitely improved over time, so thank you to those who told me to hang in there!With spring blossoming here my allergies are starting up again and even though they're not too severe it's bloody annoying when my left eye (always my left eye) itches like hell and swells up like a gargoyle for about an hour. It happened to me the other Thursday when I was on my way to meet Biboo for the first time (I guess he'll have to grow into the name Charlie because at the moment it's still Biboo or Munchkin). Oh man is he sweet, but I hate to think what he thought meeting Grandma Redeye for the first time! I actually don't remember the last time I held such a tiny baby - you know where their bum and back fit into the palm of your hand - but it surely was precious. With the new 10 km travel limit I won't be able to go to visit him for a month as they live 30 km away, but as Jen said, they make exceptions for child care, so I can use that reasoning a couple of times with me looking after babe so they can go out and do their running around without taking him along. Sounds good to me!I did finally get round to meeting up with Marysette from sewing club on Tuesday and we managed an 11 km walk along the Arve river, which was a new one to me. It was a nice flat walk but I somehow managed to burn my right arm as it was so hot (I must walk with a list if I only managed to burn the right arm, I reckon). Then on Friday my friend came over and we did a 12 km walk into Cluses again and sat on a bench in town to have a picnic lunch, and yet again he loved it (I can see I'm going to be seeing more of him)! And then yesterday Isabelle, my neighbour, asked if I wanted to take advantage of our last day of \"freedom\" to go back to Passy for a walk, and while it wasn't what I had planned I'm so glad I did. It was pretty cold and the wind was howling but it was so, so pretty. There were a few people wind- and kite-surfing, and even one (fool)hardy (mad?) soul swimming! Not for me but why not? I'm so glad she suggested it as I got in another 12 km walk which was so invigorating!The lake at Passy yesterday!When we got back Isabelle was bemoaning the fact that we'll be limited to 10 km from home for the next month, so I took her round to my back garden and pointed out that Cou (one of the mountains you can see from my back garden) was well within 10 km from here and the hike up to the Chalet de Balme could easily be our next outing. I hiked up there many years ago in about 45 minutes but I reckon I'd be looking at about two hours now, what with me being older and fatter but who knows. If you don't try you'll never know, will you!Cou (as seen from my terrace)!The chalet at Balme!"},
{"title": "Biboo!", "date": "Sunday 28 March 2021", "text": "Biboo arrived safe and sound at 12.50 this morning - well what should have been yesterday evening I guess because we put the clocks forward today. The first 12 hours were apparently horrendous as Jen threw up with every contraction but then an angel in human form descended from above with an epidural in his hand and both Jen and Jordan got to enjoy the rest of her 21 hour labour, with Jen being allowed to pull the baby out herself. Turns out Biboo is a little boy (I was right!!!!) and weighed in at 3.2 kg. When I looked up \"3.2 kg to lbs\" it suggested cooking time for turkey (ha) but that's just over 7 lbs, so a good weight for a first baby, particularly given that Jen is so tiny. His name is Charlie, but I suspect he'll be Biboo to me for quite some time. Oh and tonton (uncle) André is so totally in love already it's something to behold! I'm now officially the (second) happiest woman in France today (with Jen being the first)!"},
{"title": "Life's little pleasures!", "date": "Saturday 27 March 2021", "text": "André had his appointment in Annecy on Thursday to hand in his paperwork for his resident's permit. I was going to go with him since I've already been to the Préfecture twice and with Annecy being all dug up at the moment I thought it might help. That was when he told me it wasn't necessary as he'd be fine (he was), but I had to laugh 'cos I guess you never stop being a mom do you. I mean, I moved to Switzerland at age 21 for a job and I travelled around Australia for six months with a backpack and a $50 tent when I was 24 (the parents of every young woman's worst nightmare I imagine) and here's me fretting about my 33 year old son finding his way round Annecy, which is all of 30 minutes drive away! Ha ha, do ya think I'm turning into Howard's mom in The Big Bang Theory? Anyway, everything was in order so he should get his permit in a couple of weeks. Hats off to Annecy though because they seem to have done a great job dealing with the extra workload caused by Brexit and have been very efficient. I think he had the same young black woman handling his dossier as I did and she was a real sweetheart. So that's one thing crossed off his endless to-do list at the moment!Today he was going to lunch with a mate and then on to band practice afterwards so he asked me if the ski pants he'd borrowed last week for the trek up to La Clusaz would be dry by this morning. They were, but it's a good job I checked them because I'd just bunged a whole bunch of dark clothes into the machine together and I found three pairs of my knickers stuck to the velcro at the bottom of the leg of the ski pants so I'm sure Max would have done a double take when he handed them back. Or maybe not - I don't know - Max might think he'd become a \"kinky\" dresser - who knows!Then the other day I got a message from the MJC (community centre) where I do my Italian lessons and it looks like they'll be reimbursing us for most of the course pretty shortly. I'm assuming my other courses will also be doing the same then, although for the independent young yoga teacher who is not part of a major organization I'm more than happy to let that pass. No-one could have predicted covid and if not reimbursing me helps her then I can live with it. That being said, I should also be looking at about €1,600 in reimbursements for our cancelled trip to Holland and Germany last year. Now that I will be very glad to receive back - it's a lot of money after all. With that in mind, I decided to take a trip out to a large garden centre near here where André had gotten me a gift voucher for Christmas. So I toddled round to my neighbour as I knew she wanted to go out there and we headed out together. She never goes anywhere (even pre-covid) so I know she thoroughly enjoyed herself and since I'd managed to get her out I then told her we'd be taking a trip to the fabric store and again she was like a little kid in a sweetie shop. I think she's just grown so used to never doing anything different that it's hard for her to accept that yes, she CAN go out occasionally and NO she doesn't have to ask anybody's permission! I went a little nuts because while I was only looking for a few plants I actually went slightly crazy and bought a whole new set of wine and water glasses. Mine were ok but very much a hotch-potch and my new ones are lovely. And then, since I'm obviously going mad anyway, I stopped in at a lovely shop and bought a complete new set of dishes in very, very bright colours. I didn't need them, of course, and it does make my decluttering exercise a bit moot at this point, but I thought \"why not\". Since I haven't travelled in over a year, and am unlikely to do so for another year, I may as well go slightly nuts and get a few things I've wanted for some time. I then stopped in another store and bought a couple of baby things to keep at my house, as well as a flower arrangement for Jordan and Jen's balcony and a fluffy Easter bunny for Biboo's first Easter. So yeah, my bank card is creaking a bit right now but gosh it felt good!These are the kinds of plates/bowls/dishes I bought in three differentcolour configurations. They're much prettier than the picture though!Jordan was asking me the other day how he should go about registering Biboo at the US consulate. I told him he'd got time as they would need specifics - name, dob, sex and so on, and that's when I got to telling him about my experience at the British consulate in Geneva. André was born in the US but Jordan was born in Geneva (although he's not entitled to Swiss citizenship). I handed in all the paperwork to get him a British birth certificate and passport and they told me it would be ready in about 30 minutes so to just take a seat. Thank God I checked this stuff before I left because the birth certificate had his date of birth down as 21 May, when he was born on 31 May, and when they handed his passport over he was down as \"female\". Can you imagine trying to correct this stuff after the event - although André said I could always have raised him as a girl and not gone through the hassle (ain't big brothers rotten)!Then two days ago Jen sent me a message to say that Biboo had been accepted for a place at the crèche 100 metres from their home as from August so all is well with the world - 'cos ya see, Biboo is on his way. Mom and dad have been at the hospital since 4 a.m. this morning and it's now 4 p.m. and I'm still sitting here waiting, and waiting and excited as hell!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 22 March 2021", "text": "It turned into a lovely weekend this weekend, both weather-wise and socially, with the weather being just glorious, if a bit chilly. André was invited up to a friend's family chalet in La Clusaz with the mates in his band for a birthday celebration. He showed me pictures of the chalet and it was lovely - not modern at all but rather a rustic old chalet which has been in this friend's family for many years. It was actually located right on a ski slope, so I'm guessing it would be worth quite a bit if they ever wanted to sell, but that doesn't seem to be of any interest to them from what he was saying - they get too much fun out of the place. Because the ski lifts are still not running (to discourage crowds), they had a 90-minute hike up to the chalet carrying all their supplies with them - now that's dedication! I think he said there were eight of them in five bedrooms so they weren't crowded at all. While a few of the lads set up ski jumps, the others got the BBQ going on the terrace and started getting dinner ready. André was saying he now realizes exactly how unfit he is because he was the last one to make it to the top, but then he has to realize most of these kids have been doing this all their lives, and while he actually grew up in this region, he's spent the last 10 years living in Geneva \"going soft\" (as I so kindly put it). Still, it's motivated him to go to the sports shop to get kitted out with winter gear because - as he admitted himself - he was woefully ill-equipped for the weekend and trudging through 60 cm of snow! Ha, and to think I've got brand new snow shoes sitting downstairs and we never even gave them a thought? He did say though that there were loads of people in the resort snow-shoeing or doing cross country skiing - and even a few hardy souls lugging their skis to the top of the mountain in order to get just one run in! I'm pretty sure you wouldn't see me doing that - I couldn't imagine trying to hike up to the top of a mountain in heavy ski boots and carrying my skis! Those days are long behind me!That being said I got a message from my friend on Wednesday asking if he could come over the following day and do the 8 km walk along the river I'd told him about!!!! I know!!! The daft thing is, I knew that once I'd got him out here just once on a local walk he'd want to do it again! He lives in France on the other side of Lake Geneva at the foot of the Jura mountains and they are also really beautiful, but I just don't think he's ever taken the time to get out there and explore. When we first came back from the U.S. in 1989 we lived in Switzerland for a year just below the Jura and there, again, we were out exploring every weekend with André as a little kid, so I know there are some lovely walks out there. This time we drove out to the lake at Thyez and then did a walk along the River Arve which had been measured out at 8 km. We managed to get a coffee in the town of Cluses (had to drink it outside and standing up of course) but it was a pleasant walk, totally on the flat, and we ended up walking for about two-and-a-half hours. I got in almost 14 km total that day, or over 17,000 steps, and was well pleased, but he kept banging on about how his phone mis-measured his km (most likely true, they say smart phones show an approximate 10% under-estimate in the distance walked), but I told him surely the only thing that mattered was that if you walked 7,000 steps a day last week then the aim should be to walk 8,000 steps a day this week. In the end I told him if he didn't shut up he'd get more steps in than he bargained for because I'd leave him there and it was 25 km back to my place! Still, we had a good time together and I sense he'll be more amenable to other walks once the snow starts melting. I also sent a quick message to one of the ladies from my sewing club asking if she wanted to go out walking sometime now that the weather has picked up. We had planned to do this last year (she knows loads of great hikes round here) but covid happened, then lockdown, then winter, so it's only now that we can really think about it. The end result is that I'm going over to her place for lunch on Tuesday and then we'll head off out for a walk near where she lives. She and two of her sisters get together every Thursday for lunch followed by a walk/hike, so she invited me to join them next time, which is really nice as I've known her one sister for several years through the sewing club and I really like her. So it seems like things are starting to fall into place again - or maybe that sense of optimism is just spring starting to break through!Then yesterday I had a call from Carol, a lady I met when I went to Sicily for my 60th birthday. We clicked immediately and had plans to visit each other (she lives in London) before covid intervened. Still, it was nice to chat with her and make tentative plans to get together when it's safe to do so! She's already been vaccinated as the U.K. are way ahead of France in that respect (I'm still just a tiny speck on the covid vaccination list). That being said, my nephew was telling me that his partner had her first jab the other week and has been violently ill with it, almost to the point of needing hospitalization. That's not very reassuring as she's only in her early 50s but she already had covid at the start of the pandemic and was very ill with it for about four weeks. Thankfully she's getting better now, but it seems to bear out the theory that those that have already had covid are the ones having the strongest reactions to the vaccine!In other news, yesterday I was out putting peelings in my neighbour's very swish new wooden compost bin (you know, after I melted the other one) and asked his wife how much they'd paid for it because I wanted to pay half. When she said €15 I thought I'd misheard, but it turns out that the local community of villages (they call them communes here) is offering rather nice wooden compost bins to local tax payers for €15, with the commune picking up the tab for the rest of the cost. Splendid initiative right, so I've gone ahead and ordered one of my own so that we can have two on the go at the same time. I'll have to make a concerted effort not to burn these two down!I've also taken to watching various series on either Netflix or Amazon Prime for about an hour before I go to bed. At the moment I've watched the first few episodes of Grace and Frankie as I heard rave reviews about it, but as yet I'm not sure. It seems to be a bit \"formulaic\" (is that a word?) to me so far. You know, just take a standard formula, stick a few different actors in it and basically punch out another cookie-cutter comedy series. I hope I'm wrong but right now I'm not feeling it. You know, as much as I loved Friends, when you see something like The Big Bang Theory afterwards it just strikes me as \"take six people - three men and three women - stick them in an apartment eating - unbothered by trivialities like having to go to work, write some smart-arsed script and voilà, you've got a new series on your hands\". Anyway, I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it improves, otherwise I think I'll just move on!Yesterday I was invited up to my former neighbour Valérie's place to spend a few hours playing board games. We haven't had a board game evening since last October, for obvious reasons, so seven of us got together at her place to play for a few hours. She's got a huge place overlooking the mountains so we were well spread out, but it was a nice way to spend a few hours, even if we did have to be back home by the new later curfew of 7 p.m. I stopped in at the supermarket on the way there as I had volunteered to bring the bread and cheese. Maybe I'm just becoming a crab but I have to admit it does annoy me when I see older kids sitting/standing in shopping trollies when they have no business being in them. Toddlers and babies, of course, but to see a kid of about eight standing in the cart with dad pushing him around kinda turns my stomach as I'm thinking \"how much muck is on the bottom of his shoes and then someone's going to be putting their groceries in there afterwards\"? There was nothing wrong with his legs either, as was proven when he pushed the trolley back through the mud to the trolley stand! I guess it's just one of my pet hates and there's not much I can do to change it so I'll just have to like it or lump it!The view from Valérie's living room!Her back garden!So all in all it was a nice week, and an even nicer weekend. Last night I watched the programme Secret Eaters on TV, mainly because there was nothing else on. You know, all these people who can't for the life of them understand how they've put on so much weight because \"they don't eat that much\", and then the TV crew follow them around and secretly film them for them to see just how many calories they really were getting through. With that in mind I went on to the Myfitnesspal website to check out the calorie content of some of the stuff I've been picking at in the evenings these last couple of months - out of boredom really - and oohhh errr, I think it's a good job I've got some long walks lined up because man was I in denial!!!! So no more snacking for me I guess. André too from the looks of it. We'll see how long that lasts but so far (day 1) it's working a treat! Ha, just another how many days to go?"},
{"title": "Just waiting!", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2021", "text": "The other day I received a strange FB message from André - strange, because it really wasn't his style and stranger still, because he was sitting about 10 feet away from me. Turns out he'd been hacked, of course, so he spent the next 30 minutes messaging his FB friends telling them not to open the link. What was really nice, though, is that as he was sending the messages he started getting replies from friends all over the world. See, having attended an international school here in Geneva his friends are all different nationalities, and within minutes he got a reply from Macnos, who is working in Australia, Chris in Dubai, Abdelazziz in Saudi and so on, and it was really nice. I guess that's one of the positives of FB really, isn't it. A friend's son went to the Hotel School in Lausanne (which is hellish expensive) and as a result has friends working all over the world. One time he wanted to go to Hong Kong (I think it was) for a vacation, so sent out a message asking if anyone could put him up for a few days and bingo, a mate replied offering him a room. It's all very different from our family camping holidays in Stratford-on-Avon, I can tell ya! Still, I shouldn't whinge because my former boss just sent me a message telling me to \"reserve the date\" in order to go to Edinburgh in August to celebrate his and his wife's 50th wedding anniversary. Covid-permitting, I'll definitely be going!In other news, it came out this week that the young girl who had gone home from school last October and told her father that their teacher had shown them the offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons in class in order to talk about freedom of speech, hadn't actually been in class that day! Apparently, the teacher, Samuel Paty, had asked any of the kids who wished to leave class at that point to do so, but the girl in question had been suspended by the school for absenteeism so lied to her father to try to get herself off the hook. The father started ranting on FB and this \"inspired\" a young lunatic, who took it upon himself to behead Samuel Paty as an act of revenge!!! And all that stemming from a young girl's stupid lie!Samuel Paty!The other day I received a copy of the monthly Haute Savoie Magazine, which lets you know what's going on in the region politically and economically, and also has a section promoting tourism. I actually tore this page out because I'm thinking I might start a \"let's visit local châteaux\" gig in order to check out the sights and see if there are any interesting walks. I spotted two châteaux that took my fancy, all the more so when I realized that the Château de Clermont is only about 50 km away, when for some reason I'd had it in my head that it was in Clermont-Ferrand, which is about five hours away! Covid-permitting, it'll be opening up on 1 April so I think that could be on the agenda pretty soon!Château de ClermontI guess I'm getting a little bit \"antsy\" in general, because I've started looking up potential trips for next spring. I'm thinking Mexico, Thailand, Viet Nam or Cambodia at the moment - although that could change - but in any case I won't be going anywhere until this whole pandemic business settles down. Maybe potentially somewhere in Europe in the autumn but, again, it depends on so many external factors. Then just last night I was watching some gardening videos on Youtube (spring is in the air I guess) and somehow got sucked in to two blogs, one by an American retiree who has made his home in Costa Rica for the last five years and the other by a Canadian lady who went to Guatemala at the age of 52 and is still going strong out there six years later. I don't know, sometimes I guess I just get the \"itch\" to try something else. In reality I know I won't be leaving France because I have everything I ever wanted here - my kids, my soon-to-be grandchild, my friends and my life in general and I'm happy here, but I can't help it - I still do sometimes get that Backpacker Granny feeling (you should check out her blog, she's amazing)! I suppose it might have something to do with the fact that most of my long haul trips have been around this period of the year and FB keeps reminding me of them. Yesterday it also reminded me that Jordan and Jen got married two years ago on 16 March and then, sadly, that André and Lily got married four years ago on 17 March. That's life, I guess! Still, André's having a blast picking out stuff for his apartment and I can tell he's happy so he'll be all right!I finished watching The Crown this weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it, and since whenever someone recommends a series/film I write it down I ended up watching the first two episodes of Unorthodox the other night, and boy is it hard going! It's about a young woman who runs away from a Hasidic community in New York and how her husband and someone who looks like a mafia hitman try to find her and bring her back. I haven't watched all of it but it is pretty raw. That being said, I have enjoyed seeing some (although by no means all) of the rituals of their daily life! I remember many years ago, when Jordan was about four, I took my family up to Zermatt for the day to see the Matterhorn. It was scorching hot and we were at goodness knows how many metres altitude so the sun's rays were fierce, when all of a sudden an Orthodox Jewish family passed us, all dressed in heavy clothing, with the females also wearing black woollen tights. When I made an \"oh my God\" remark to my brother because I was just dying from the heat, he said \"don't feel sorry for them, they don't envy you at all\", which I thought was a weird thing to say, but actually I think he was right! I've downloaded to my kindle a sample of the book this series is based on, but I'm pretty sure I'll end up buying it as I just know I'm going to want to read it!Talking of books, I seem to be playing \"book tag\" with someone at the local supermarket. I was hesitant to leave my books at their book exchange shelf, thinking that as mine are mostly in English they will just hang around cluttering the place up - but not a bit of it! Every time I stop in at that supermarket I have a quick look and they seem to disappear every week, so it's nice to know that someone is getting pleasure out of my second-hand books. Well it's either that or they just throw them away once I've left the shop, I guess, but somehow I doubt it!And finally, I saw an article in the paper the other day where Stephen Fry was saying that since he's taken up serious walking, he's lost five stone (70 lbs) over a period of about a year. Damn - well, good for him really, but somehow I think he must be transmitting his lost pounds to me telepathically because I haven't shifted an ounce despite all the walking I've been doing. Gotta start upping my game methinks! That's the trouble with men actually - as soon as they make up their mind to lose weight it just seems to fall off them. It's not fair is it ladies (and Dave, I'm looking at you, you know that, right?)! Not that I've been getting much walking in this week. It's snowed and/or rained all week, and I've also been running Jen around quite a bit as she's afraid to drive now, what with getting fairly constant contractions. I took her out to get some blood work done today and she is very uncomfortable so here's hoping Biboo will be putting in an appearance pretty soon and that all goes well!"},
{"title": "Eureka!", "date": "Thursday 11 March 2021", "text": "It's been a strange week this week. It seems like everyone is complaining about being fed up and depressed and I'm raring to go like the Energizer Bunny and I have no idea why. To that end I've been continuing in my bid to \"get this place sorted\" and so I've been spending an hour every day working on something in the house and also working another hour in the garden while the weather's half-way decent. It's amazing what you can get done in just one hour! This week I started on my bedroom, pulling all the furniture out, sorting/throwing, vacuuming and scrubbing and it already feels great. I guess it must sound like my bedroom was filthy but it really isn't. I keep my house pretty clean and picked up actually, but you know once you start moving stuff, how that works right. One rather nasty surprise I had though was when I pulled out the armchair I have in the corner of the room and started scrubbing behind it. As I was pulling the covers off to wash them I noticed a small \"mass\" attached to the back of it, and bugger me if it wasn't some kind of insect cocoon. I've had these things before (I occasionally get hornets' nests on the balcony - I burn them off), but this kind of bug seems to like fabric and places where that fabric \"doesn't move very often\", so the back of that chair would have been ideal and it's right next to the balcony door where the hornets build their nest. I took a picture of it next to my finger so you can see the size. My neighbour tells me she gets them too and you have to be really vigilant looking out for the little sods anywhere the fabric doesn't get moved about - like decorative curtains, for instance, that you never close. In French they're called guêpes maçonnes which literally translates to \"mason wasps\" (I really have no idea what they're called in English). They're easy to remove but not nice to find, all the same. She was telling me that they also get ladybird infestations for about three weeks this time of year and that's what I'm also dealing with at the moment. Damn! I guess it's a good thing I started this cleaning malarky!Guêpe maçonYesterday morning, just as I was waking up, I heard a couple of buzz sounds on my phone to indicate two missed calls. When I looked to see who it was it was \"Albert\" in England so I knew that must have been an accident. And that, in itself, is a whole other story. Ya see, my older cousin, Dorothy, dated and eventually became engaged to \"gorgeous Bert\" when I was just three years old (so in 1961). She was plain looking - not physically attractive, but a lovely person - and Albert was a drop-dead gorgeous young man who was head over heels in love with her. Seen from the outside they really were a strange-looking couple. Anyway, the years went by and whenever anyone asked when they were getting married Dot's mom always used to say \"oh they're in no hurry\". So they waited and waited but \"were never in any hurry\"! My mom always said that her mom didn't want to lose the rent money Dot paid them (we called it your \"keep\") and that could well have been true. So they got engaged in 1961 and in 1977 her mom died of cancer. In the meantime, they're not living together, have never been on holiday together and I'm pretty sure never slept together. They saw each other every evening and then he went back home to his parents' house. Of course when mom died Dot would be expected to take care of dad, Uncle Jim, which she did until he died somewhere around 1990, I would guess. So you'd think they'd now be free to get married wouldn't you. But no - Dot had an older brother, Barry, who was perfectly healthy but as was often the case with that generation he expected her to take care of him also - despite the fact that she also worked full-time her entire life. She and Albert would catch the bus into the city on Saturdays for a wander round and I remember one time her brother balling her out when she came home because \"he was starving\". When she said she'd left his dinner in the oven and all he had to do was warm it up his answer was \"well I don't know how to do that\". He \"couldn't\" even make himself a cup of tea! Now I know this sounds ridiculous (well it is ridiculous) but it was very much the way things were with many of that generation and very definitely the way it was in that household, with my Uncle Jim ruling the roost (and also running around behind his wife's back sewing his wild oats). So Dot's perfectly able-bodied blob of a brother couldn't get off his backside and take care of himself, right (anyone ever read Marilyn French's The Women's Room?)? Well eventually even they realized that it was ridiculous for Albert to go home every night and since they had a three-bedroomed house, Albert moved in with them, but into the third bedroom???????? I know, see what I mean! But Albert continued to adore Dot and she continued to adore him - and that's when fate truly was cruel because a couple of years after Albert moved in, Dot fell sick and died of brain cancer, leaving Albert devastated. At mom's funeral he told us that many years later, well into his 70s, a woman had asked him out for coffee and he said that while it felt nice knowing he could still \"pull\", there was only ever one woman for him and that was Dot. He and Barry continue to share the same home to this day. Every year they drive down to the south coast to stay with my sister and every year my sister says \"Albert any time, Barry - bloody hell\". He is such hard work, rarely gets off his backside and has no conversation! Anyway, all that to say, when I saw that Albert had called me the other morning I called back. He couldn't believe I had his number, but I pointed out that I had got it at my mom's funeral. Turns out he was messing around with his phone checking his credit and must have accidentally dialled my number, which in itself is a miracle because they both turn their phones off at 6 p.m. every night because they \"don't want to run up any charges\". No matter how you try to explain that leaving your phone on doesn't incur charges neither of them will hear of it. They really are living in a time warp you see! Anyway it was lovely to chat to \"gorgeous Bert\" who even though he's nearly 80 now still refers to me as \"bab\". When he said, \"here I'll pass you to have a word with Barry\" my heart sank as he's got no conversation at the best of times and I was only just waking up and not really thrilled at the prospect. Fortuitously Barry is also pretty deaf so in the end I never got to speak to him, but can you just picture those two living together. Albert walks everywhere as he doesn't drive, does all the shopping and cooking and every Sunday he goes to the cemetery to put flowers on Dot's grave. In the meantime, Barry sits on his backside like a statue of buddha while being waited on hand and foot by Albert - who oddly enough doesn't seem to mind. Talk about The Odd Couple, though what a waste of a life for gorgeous Bert as I'm sure he and Dot would have made wonderful parents!Changing the subject somewhat, André came downstairs last night and said that Youtube has a documentary channel called Vice and a girl he was at school with is one of their roving reporters. He'd just seen her in one of their programmes covering a man in Chile who has lived off grid for the last 40 years. So he was saying \"you remember Adri don't you?\", but no, of course I don't. He told me that one weekend Chris had stayed over at our house and Adri and her friend Carolina had called when the lads were out. When they called back later apparently I'd told the girls that he and Chris were \"out playing guns\" and the boys were mortified. I genuinely don't remember saying that but if he said I did ... - \"and couldn't you have said we were out doing something \"manly\" like repairing someone's scooter or something?\" Ha, the answer is never have your mom answer your phone, I guess. Mind you, that's nothing to what my dad did to my sister the first time she brought a date home. He parted his hair down the middle and Brylcreemed it to his head, took his false teeth out and sat there in his undershirt and braces (suspenders in the US), with a chamber pot (my grandma's metal po) on the table with plastic daffodils in it! Apparently my sister burst into tears and didn't forgive him for months! Ha, God love ya dad (although I'm glad you never did that to me)!Today I decided to go into town to the market as I wanted to buy some dish towels and have a wander round. I couldn't find parking so ended up parking way up the road at the railway station - which is fine when you're going downhill but not too much fun when you have to slog your way back up carrying a basket full of fruit and veg - although \"every little helps\" in the fitness quest doesn't it. I knew I wanted to get bread too and ended up getting the most beautiful loaf of artisanal bread - although I think next time I'll ask him to cut it in half. I'd guess that thing was about two feet long but by god it was good!We'd already eaten some of it when I took this picture!Just as I got home my friend showed up for the first time in about a year. We kept promising we'd get together my side of the lake to go walking but - covid! Anyway he couldn't get over how good the bread was so all three of us ended up eating huge chunks with salted butter before he and I set off to the lake at Passy. Just on the off chance I stopped in at the Quechua store and miracle of miracles, they had just received about 10 pairs of snow shoes. They were all the same type and suitable for men or women up to a maximum weight of 120 kg (thank God, that's not an issue). So I grabbed three pairs (two for my two walking partners) and the lady then took her time to get me fitted out for suitable hiking boots to use with them, so eureka, we're set to go! We had a lovely walk round the lake (twice round the lake actually) and just made it home before the heavens opened (it seems we're due crap weather all week, even snow). But having finally convinced ol' Clog Hopper to give it a shot he's now totally enthused (told ya) and is going to come back over so that we can do a 10 km walk out at Thyez as soon as the weather picks up again. Why I ever had to nag him I will never know but at least I got eight miles in today so I'm well pleased!"},
{"title": "Yeah, that's just what you'd do isn't it!", "date": "Saturday 6 March 2021", "text": "My immediate neighbours on either side are the \"R\" family, with whom I am very close, and the \"S\" family who, while not as close as the Rs, are still very nice and we have done things together socially in the past. One thing I've learned over the years, though, is if you want something spread all around the village, tell it to Mrs. S in confidence. So while I will always chat with her, if I want something to stay private I never mention it to her. Not that I have much that I'm desperate to keep private, mind you - I'm pretty much an open book - but not everyone feels the same way do they. Anyway, about a month after André moved in with me I spotted her in the garden and she asked what André was doing here so much. So I told her he was getting divorced (I figured she already knew, actually) and was going to be with me until he got his own place. Well a couple of days later I went to the market in the next village over and bumped into another neighbour who I don't see so often. She asked how I was coping during these never-ending lockdowns and I said it wasn't so bad as André was getting divorced and was living with me for the time being. That's when she said that she had already heard because Mrs. S had told her the day after she found out. Not that these two are friends at all, it's just that they had bumped into each other in town and got chatting. And this neighbour said how absolutely disgusted she was that this was the kind of tittle tattle that Mrs. S liked to gossip about. So I told her it was fine as it wasn't a secret anyway but she insisted that as she, herself, is a private person she thinks Mrs. S needs to keep her mouth shut about other people's business. But that was the end of the story as far as I was concerned. Well that is until I bumped into Mrs. S this week out walking the dog on her own. Now she never goes anywhere without Mr. S, never, because he is insanely and irrationally jealous. If she wants to have a coffee in town with a gf he goes along too. He goes to the market and shopping with her and they always walk the dog together. She told me this herself, many years ago, because he at one time figured she was having an affair with Mr. R (my neighbour on the other side) and then decided it was actually my husband she was having an affair with - and all because she used to wash the bed sheets on a Monday, so that must have been when she saw her lover! I know, it's crazy-making isn't it! But all that just to say that you never see one without the other - until yesterday that is. When I commented that she was on her own she told me that he had been taken to hospital on Monday after having what is, hopefully, a minor stroke but I was to keep it to myself in strictest confidence, as nobody was to know! She then told me that she'd been in such a state that she pulled out onto the main road into the path of another car and while she was okay, both her and the other car needed repairs. So I told her if she needed me to run her around just to let me know as I was free any time. She thanked me for the offer but again reiterated that no-one was to know about him being in hospital. And that's when it struck me. I wonder if she will ever see the irony between the fact that she feels free to tittle tattle about everyone else's business but when it comes to them, she expects everyone to respect their privacy! I, of course, will keep this to myself (I reckon everyone will find out eventually anyway - it just won't come from me), but somehow I still don't think this will change her!When I went out to fetch the mail later that day I bumped into my other neighbour (Mr. R) returning from a short walk. He's been pretty good about walking lately after recovering from his third or fourth operation to put stents in his groin to open the veins up. I commented that I'd seen him out and about quite a bit and \"good for him\", and that's when he told me that this summer he intended to walk from the lac Vert up to the lac d'Anterne - and I nearly fell over! It's one thing to have a stroll round the neighbourhood every day but I think he is seriously deluding himself that that hike will be within his capabilities by this summer - if ever! He's smoked for over 50 years (hence the stents), and while he did get out walking when he was a much younger man, over the 30+ years that I've been here I've never seen him go out hiking once. But I would love to do that hike so I told him if he was game for it I'd go with him. I don't see it happening, to be honest, but I would like to have a shot at it (again), despite the fact that it is rated as \"hard\" on the local hiking review. I've been up to a refuge called le Réfuge de Moëde before, and the lac d'Anterne is a good 90-minute hike above that, but who knows. It's spectacular scenery and maybe I can persuade Isabelle and/or my other neighbour to have a shot at part of that hike with me (the bit that I know) once the snow has melted!The Réfuge de MoëdeThe lac d'Anterne is only small, butabout another 90 minute hike past the refuge!I've been doing pretty well lately at sticking to my one-hour-a-day schedule for getting things sorted/cleaned/decluttered, but there's obviously still an awful lot to do - not that there's a deadline of course. Still it's nice to see things slowly starting to take shape. Today I got all the bed linen washed and hung outside to dry for the first time this year. It wasn't warm enough to dry completely, of course - not yet - but doesn't everything smell wonderful when you bring it in from outside! After that I thought I'd give my sister a call as I haven't spoken to her in a couple of weeks, but blow me, what had she done to her hair? They're still in lockdown in England and she was explaining that the hairdressers are still out of bounds and will remain so for a good while yet. So as she was totally sick of her hair she'd taken her almost-bald husband's hair clippers to her head and ran them all over. Crikey, she definitely went a bit nuts! I doubt her hair is half an inch all over, but while she'll never win any prizes for Home Hairdresser of the Year, by god she could give sheep shearers a run for their money!And finally, as I was watching the French news on Youtube yesterday, some abstract algorithm decided that I might be interested in deleted scenes from the film Love Actually - and lordy were they right! The one I watched involved \"mom\" (played by the wonderful Emma Thompson) being summoned to her son's school over \"an incident\". It turned out that the children had been asked to write an essay describing what they would wish for if they had a magic wand and could wish for anything for just one day. Well most of the kids wished for world peace, of course, and one child wished that his sick sister would be healthy for just one day. But not Emma Thompson's son of course. They made her read it out loud in front of him. No, her boy wished that just for one day, whenever someone farted, little bubbles would start floating up around them so that everyone would know who it was. They showed grandma at Christmas lunch with the little bubbles, the vicar giving his sermon in church with little bubbles and then - oh heresy - the Queen bending over to pat one of the corgis with little bubbles all around her!At this point Emma Thompson asks if she can speak to her son in private and they leave the Headmaster's office. When her son says \"sorry mom\", she turns round to him and says \"no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for putting you in a school with a bunch of pricks who can't see your story for the comedic gold that it is\" - and then she completely cracks up. And that's when André said \"yeah, that's just what you'd have done too isn't it\" - and you know what, he's right - 'cos I'm a pleb!Why they deleted this scene from Love Actuallyis totally beyond me - it's hilarious!"},
{"title": "Where did the time go?", "date": "Thursday 4 March 2021", "text": "Wow doesn't this pandemic make time seem like it's standing still? I suppose no-one is doing much of anything and each day kinda merges into the previous one and just drags along doesn't it! Well that was how I felt until FB reminded me the other day that it's now been eight years since I went to Peru! Crikey, March 2013 saw me flying off on only my second \"solos\" holiday to fulfil a dream of mine, which was to visit Machu Picchu. It was bloody hard work though, the altitude sickness being difficult to navigate, but I did, indeed get to see Machu Picchu and the floating islands of the Uros - and enjoy wonderful weather on what was a bit of an \"iffy\" vacation weather-wise. Peru was also where I met Steve (RIP mate) and gave me the confidence to try out the longer-haul solos trips and not just the European ones! Gosh I'm starting to look forward to travelling again, although who the heck knows when that will be!The floating islands of the Uros!Machu Picchu - not my picture sadly, but Icouldn't find where to attribute it!Since any kind of travelling isn't on the agenda right now, but with spring on the way, I'm looking forward to getting back up to the higher walks I'd been attempting before the snow came because I'm not getting any fitter just slobbing round here am I!Max finally stopped by yesterday to replace the pump on my heating system which should prevent the condensation leaks I've occasionally been getting in my basement. He also took away the four BMW tyres (tyres and rims) that a friend of his wanted and that I had had in my basement for ages, so I also talked him into taking the final two tyres to the tip for me, figuring he owed me one, what with all the hassle I've had with my heating system. So yay me, I've finally got rid of - I think - 10 tyres/wheels from my basement so that's a move in the right direction!Then today I drove my friend down to Annecy for her to hand over her paperwork for her resident's permit and we were yacking so much we ended up taking the \"scenic\" route again (i.e. we missed the turnoff)! Still we made it just as the immigration offices were opening up and all in all I would guess it only took about 40 minutes for her application to be processed. She was telling me that one lady from Côte d'Ivoire starting kicking off and yelling at staff because \"there is obviously something wrong with the ticketing system, as some people have got numbers in the 100s and mine is number 550\"! They tried explaining to her that each of the six different desks dealt with different situations so the numbers weren't consecutive. For instance, they had one desk specifically for Brexit Brits which moved pretty quickly because we would all have at least five years' residence in France at this point. Then they had a second desk for new immigrants, and others were divided into zones for people coming from different countries. But she was having none of it. In the end the head honcho told her to just keep it up and he would have her removed from the premises and she could start her application all over again - and lo and behold she must have figured it was probably a smart idea to shut up. I always think unless you've got a very good reason to be ranting it's always a better idea to remain civilized and polite because (a) these people are just doing their jobs, (b) she was not being discriminated against, and (c) in the end they hold the power ultimately don't they! But as I say, all in all it only took about 40 minutes for my friend to get her paperwork completed and I got to sit on the lake front at Annecy admiring the view in very pleasant weather!I'm trying to make an effort to be more au courant with what's going on in France, despite not having French TV, so I'm at least picking up the news and a few documentaries online every couple of days. I was watching one report the other night to try to understand more about the proposed reform of French pensions and why there were massive protests. Well I can't say I understand all the ins and outs of what is going on but to see how some people are struggling along on tiny pensions is really sobering. And while much talk might be given to improving the lot of the little man, I'm not so sure that's how it works really is it! And then how about ol' Sarko getting a prison sentence???? Just in case you missed it, former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, has been sentenced to three years imprisonment for trying to \"influence\" a judge (read \"bribe\") investigating allegations of improper funding for his 2007 presidential run. His getting millions in campaign funding from the l'Oréal heiress, Liliane Bettencourt, was the main focus of their investigation - although not the only one - and apparently they have recordings of him offering \"favours\" to one of the judges involved in return for information on the investigation. So yeah, two years' suspended prison sentence and one year under house arrest (during a pandemic? yeah, that'll teach him)! He's been on the news doing the rounds these past few days saying how he intends to appeal and \"defend himself vigorously\" as it is all \"fake news\" basically, but either way, you can bet he won't be struggling to get along on a presidential pension of around €750 a month!Former President Nicolas Sarkozy!And finally, I saw the other night that Amazon Prime had Florence Foster Jenkins showing so as I'd wanted to see it when it originally came out I thought I'd sit and watch it. I didn't get all the way through it as it was late but I have to admit it's \"watchable\". Well anything with Meryl Streep in will do it for me. Hugh Grant - well he just plays Hugh Grant really, but I have to admit the real hit for me has been Simon Helberg (Howard, from The Big Bang Theory)! I think he's a talented comedian and watching his facial expressions when he hears Florence's singing voice and realizes he has to accompany her on the piano is a real treat. I've got the last part to look forward to tonight, but when you realize it's based on a true story it makes it that much funnier. So truly \"light\" entertainment!"},
{"title": "The kibbutz!", "date": "Sunday 28 February 2021", "text": "Talking of my \"silent to-do list\", I finally got around to sorting the last of my ex's paperwork the other day and while I've thrown some of the \"neutral\" stuff, the rest - the stuff that didn't need to be kept - I need to be putting through the shredder as and when. Gosh I wish I had access to the big shredder we had at work which would make short shrift of those papers but I don't, so I'll have to make do with shredding what I can with my crappy little paper shredder. Then André and I got to chatting about work and different stuff and how it takes a while to get accustomed to the lingo used in your particular work setting. When I first worked at the large international organization where I spent most of my working life, the \"members\" were referred to as \"the contracting parties\", later to be changed to \"member States\", and I remember one huge document that had been sent out where someone must have messed up on the spell-check because \"contracting parties\" had been changed to \"contracting pastries\" all the way through the 250-odd page document. Then the other night, when we were watching an old episode of The Big Bang Theory, Amy and Sheldon were playing verbal ping pong and using the expression ipso facto. This is wording that could easily have been used in the large agreements that we typed up where I worked and I remember someone - some poor young sod - sent out a whole document where ipso facto had been changed to if so fatso! But damn we had some fun - maybe not at the time but can you imagine sending that document out to government agencies all over the world!Yesterday, I and two neighbours decided to set off back down to the lake at Passy in order to stop in at the Quechua store to buy snow shoes. When we got there would you believe it but they were sold out yet again! I reckon since people can't go downhill skiing at the moment because the ski lifts are not running, if they aren't doing cross country skiing then everyone and his grandmother must be buying snowshoes. I'll give it another try during the week to see if they have been restocked but at the moment snow shoes are rarer than hen's teeth. Either way, my neighbour Isa, and my other neighbour D (who had been ill this week), decided to have a quiet stroll round the lake at Passy and again it was wonderful. The weather was glorious and so sunny, even though the wind was absolutely howling. I commented that we looked like Charlie's Angels plodding around the lake in the wind, but in reality I reckon we probably looked more like The Three Stooges!The Three Stooges!Then yesterday morning I got caught out for the second time slobbing around in my sweatpants and mucky t-shirt. As I was taking stuff out to the car to take to the tip a young gendarme stopped by and asked if I had seen anything unusual last night because the D family had had two of their car's tyres slashed during the night. I explained that while my bathroom looked out towards their home and I did, indeed, go to bed very late, I hadn't seen or heard anything. At this point he asked me if I was English because he detected \"un petit accent\", but when I said yes he said said the cup of tea in my hand also gave me away. I laughed and told him that I had put in for citizenship and apparently at some point I will have to have a visit from the gendarmerie so I hoped he would be nice to me! But seeing how it was the D family that got their SUV tyres spiked I can't say I'm really surprised. I have to have dealings with dad as he is the President of our Home Owners' Association and I am the Treasurer, and for that I have no problem, but I don't trust him any further than I can throw him. If it's his son who was targeted in the \"tyre stabbing\" I can't say I'd be overly surprised either because, apparently, he's an arsehole just like his dad. He drives around our little neighbourhood like a lunatic, never thinking there might be other cars on the road and - who knows - little kids playing on their bikes. So yeah, I can well imagine that someone, somewhere, doesn't like this family. I'm just glad to keep out of it!Not sure if you can see the two flat tyres on the SUV!Which reminds me of years ago - I was dating my lovely Algerian medical student/doctor/now surgeon. We were great together but I was getting fed up of feeling that we were never going anywhere. Goodness knows the fact that he was (nominally) a Muslim while I was (nominally) a Christian made no difference to either of us. He was, and still is, to this day, a great guy. But I got fed up of waiting. Waiting to live together, waiting to maybe establish a family together. Hell, I didn't care if we didn't get married. His mom loved me. His dad hated me, but then his dad hated everyone so that didn't bother me too much. But in 1982 I'd had enough of waiting for Karim to make his mind up what he wanted to do so I applied to Australia to get a six-month working visa for the under-25s and off I went. My idea was to break with him completely because as lovely as he was (and still is), it was going nowhere. So off I went to Australia for six months, had an absolute blast, but ultimately I knew I wanted to come back to Europe to live. So Karim picked me up from the airport after six months apart and then took me out to dinner. But damn, he was so formal! In French if you address someone as \"tu\" it's informal, but if you address someone as \"vous\" it's formal, and I remember asking him if he would be more comfortable addressing me as \"vous\" because he was so weird! That's when he told me that he had met someone during my absence and he wanted to continue seeing her. And that's when I told him I had met someone in Australia and that was fine by me. WELL, you'd think I'd let off a nuclear rocket because all of a sudden he no longer wanted to break up with me, he bought flowers every single morning and waited outside my house every morning to take me to work because my car was still in storage. He begged me to get back with him and in the end I relented. But damn, I'd gone to Australia to get away from him right? Buuuut, what I didn't know is that the girlfriend wasn't totally in agreement with them splitting up. Now at that time in Geneva my surname was the only one in the phone book so I'm guessing the gf found out where I lived. I remember getting a phone call at about 4 a.m. one morning asking for Dr. F and when I said I would pass him to her she hung up. Next morning when he went out to go to work he found he had two flat tyres, but when he took the car to the garage it turned out that someone had slashed both of them. Yikes, someone was a bit hormonal I guess!Anyway, yesterday André went to band practice at his mate's house and stayed over because of the 18h curfew here so I had the evening to myself. I decided it was finally time to get back to watching The Crown - series 3 and it was great. It's the new series with Olivia Coleman as the Queen. It was really interesting seeing the \"reality\" of the 1964 election win of Harold Wilson - who I remember of course - and the story behind the Anthony Blunt spy story. As I say, I remember all this but as I was just a young girl it didn't have any meaning for me so as time goes on it has more and more meaning. One thing I have to say is how wonderful I think John Lithgow was as Winston Churchill. Oh others have done it, of course - equally well probably - but he really captured not only the gruff Churchill but absolutely nailed the accent!John Lithgow as Winston Churchillin The Crown!Gary Oldman as Churchill in The Darkest Hour!Then today Jen asked if they could bring over a baby car seat for me - only five weeks to go folks - so I invited them to eat over at my place. Jen had agreed with Anaëlle, our neighbour's 15 year old daughter, that she would clean her car for pocket money so they stopped over at 10 a.m. While we were chatting Jordan set to and tried to break up the tyres that I have hanging around with my new angle grinder in order for me to take them to the tip. Then Marylène, my other neighbour, came out and was showing me how her hand was still bothering her after her operation so Jen, as a nurse, came over and reset her splint in order for it to stop bothering her. Then I stopped in at Marylène's to drop off some French books that Jen had given Isabelle, so we all ended up outside in the spring sunshine chatting away and doing all the different things that needed to be done. I pointed out that it was like a kibbutz and Marylène and Isa said that yes it was, indeed, like a kibbutz, and did I remember when .... But you know, I now realize how much I enjoy that. Oh, I'm perfectly fine not having a partner and I really do enjoy my own company, but today brought home to me how much I enjoy being part of a society that just pitches in to help each other and shares whatever they have. I just loved it when the kids were little and I would have goodness knows how many little kids in my house playing together.  Heck, as Jordan and Jen were about to leave they couldn't get Jen's car started so another neighbour came over with jumper cables and got it started that way. So yeah, I like being on my own, but I think it's sooooo nice to have the \"look out for your neighbour\" experience. Oddly enough, it seems that that's one of the selling points for our little lotissement, as one of the new buyers pointed out the other day - we all look out for each other and it feels like a little kibbutz! And you know what, that's fine by me!With the neighbours, trying to get Jen'scar started!"},
{"title": "\"Grab a handful and start stuffing!\"", "date": "Thursday 25 February 2021", "text": "I guess everything is relative but, \"relatively speaking\", it's all go here at the moment. On Monday afternoon my friend who lives opposite me called and asked if I could come over as she wasn't feeling very well. She was complaining of having a pain like a really tight belt wrapped around her chest (oh, oh), but on the right side of her body, not the left, saying it was becoming hard to breathe, it was so painful. Thinking back on it, oddly enough covid didn't even pop into my mind, I guess because I know this friend has probably even less contact with the outside world than I do. So no, my first thought was \"heart attack\", not covid. I could see that she was having a hard time holding it together so I asked her permission to call the emergency services and she agreed. That alone told me that it was serious because \"stiff upper lip\" and all that. When I called them they asked to speak to her and she tried to explain her symptoms to them - but when she was put on hold for what seemed like ages, we hung up and decided to just take her straight to hospital ourselves. To be fair they called back almost immediately but we told them that we'd make our own way there. I would say she was admitted in less than 15 minutes, so the hospital was very impressive. And that was the last I could do because, of course, I wasn't allowed to go with her. Thankfully André was waiting for me back at the parking lot so we were able to make it home before curfew, although I think under those kinds of circumstances we wouldn't have got into trouble for being out after 6 p.m. Despite poor internet connection, she managed to send me a message later that night to say they had done a scan and discovered a pulmonary embolism and were keeping her in. I managed to get hold of her sister in Spain through FB and let her know what was going on, and she, in turn, kept the family in England in the loop - although maybe a little less \"in the loop\" for her mom and dad who are both 91 and who she didn't want to worry, since both have their own health issues. Next day mom called me to find out the latest news, so I told her they were keeping her in again to do more tests and promised her I would call her back when I knew something. So with my friend's permission I called mom later and told her about the embolism and that they thought it might have some kind of link to the fall she took on the ice recently. Who knows - I don't know how these things work. Anyway, they kept her in for a third night and it turns out she was also in the early stages of pneumonia so hell it was a good thing we took her in when we did! I called mom this morning to let her know that I was just leaving to pick her up and bring her home and that my friend would call her later. I know some people have mixed feelings about letting family know, but having been on the receiving end of not being informed when my dad was (frequently) in hospital because of being in Switzerland, I know that I would always prefer to be kept informed. At the very least I could call every night to find out how he was doing right? I obviously wasn't going to tell mom anything without my friend's permission but I do feel very strongly that it was the right thing to do! Anyway, it'll be all anticoagulants, antibiotics, blood tests and more check-ups for my friend for the foreseeable future, but at least she is now receiving the treatment she needs!And while we're on the subject of hospital stays, M, I don't suppose you're out of hospital just yet but I bet you're glad that's over too aren't you. Get well soon mate!In other news I realized this morning that I think I might be turning into my dad. When we lived in Birmingham our house was at the end of a short path that led down to just three houses, but it seemed like every time dad heard footsteps on that path he bobbed up out of his chair to see who was there. While I was living at home it was a poor, but not particularly rough area, but I understand it changed quite a bit (i.e. became rougher) after I'd moved to Geneva, so I guess I know why dad did it - and why they were both so relieved when they inherited a little money and were able to leave the inner city for a quieter coastal area! But now I seem to find myself doing the same thing. Oh I'm not worried about being murdered in my own bed, it's just that I have this terrible habit of going to look out the bathroom window when I hear a car stop outside. I think it's because I tend to live on the first floor and the door bell always makes me jump and then start dashing downstairs to answer it. But still, yeah, I think I might indeed be turning into my dad!The other day I heard the expression \"the silent to-do list\", meaning all the things that you keep thinking \"oh I must get around to doing ...\" and yet you never seem to get round to - and it bugs the hell out of ya because it's constantly going through your mind. One of my main bugbears is my basement and yet I have been clearing it bit by bit - although admittedly not lately. Then there's the box of my ex's papers to go through and that's just sitting there looking at me screaming \"sort me, sort me\". So today when I returned from the hospital I decided I needed to get back to spending about an hour a day on what I now refer to as my silent to-do list. An hour really isn't very long is it, especially for someone who's retired. So here's hoping it'll stick this time!In the spirit of dealing with irritating things, I took more pictures of my heating system in the basement which is yet again, leaking. It's not a tremendous amount of water - more leaking condensation I would guess, and it will dry, but I thought nope, Max, you've got to come back and get this sorted. Jordan seems to think he needs to put a more powerful \"condensation pump\" in than the one he installed, but either way, he's got to come back and deal with it. So I sent him the pictures with a \"guess what\" text and we'll see what happens. Then this morning, just as I was about to leave for the hospital, I saw that my neighbour's cleaning lady yet again parked partially blocking my driveway. At first I asked André to move his car, which would allow me to pull out, but then I thought nope, she can park her bloody car like a grown up because we shouldn't have to move two cars to be able to get off our driveway. Why the hell she parks like that I have no idea - I mean, it's not like there isn't tons of space here to park. Hell, she can even park in the driveway of the neighbours whose house she cleans! So I sent Isabelle a text message asking her to ask her cleaning lady to move her car because I couldn't get out. I don't know where Isabelle was but she didn't get back to me immediately so we ended up again moving our own two cars. This bloody woman does it every damn week! Eventually Isabelle got back to me, apologizing for the delay and said she will ask her cleaning lady to park properly in future as she hadn't realized that was how she dumped her car!My driveway is off to the left but by parkinglike this she blocks me up againsta wall/hedge. Hell, why doesn't she park in front of the black car? Her car's small enough and that'sthe house where she's cleaning!Anyway, the good news is that I received my carte de séjour (resident's permit) from Annecy after just 15 days, thereby confirming me as \"legal\", and I now have everything I need to apply for citizenship. So thinking I'd start checking off paperwork, yesterday I went on the naturalisation site and just started uploading the documents they requested at each step. They didn't want the whole shebang first time round but they would need all 27 pages of my divorce decree because wouldn't you know the stamp that shows it was a notarized copy issued in the last three months is on the last page. Do you ever have that sinking feeling when you're dealing with officialdom, you've got all your paperwork together and you hit \"upload\" and then sit there biting your nails hoping page 18 of your bloody divorce decree doesn't \"crash\" the site? Well luckily it didn't and hopefully I can upload the next stage shortly while my time-limited documents are still valid!And finally, André had to weigh himself the other day in order to fill out forms relating to the life insurance necessary for his new mortgage. When it turned out he was 10 kg (22 lbs) heavier than he thought I just cracked up. Well that was until I realized my usual pair of jeans have just about had it so pulled out an old pair from the cupboard - and nearly cut off my oxygen supply when I tried to zip them up! Cue André's turn to laugh, but I told him not to be so smug because if my zipper went when I exhaled I reckon the shrapnel would kill anyone within a 10 metre radius! It was just like the scene in The Big Bang Theory where Howard's (never-to-be-seen) mother, Mrs. Walowitz, goes clothes shopping and yells from the changing room \"It's this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub. We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful and start stuffing ...!\" Maybe Karl Lagerfeld was right when he said women who wear sweatpants have \"just given up\"!"},
{"title": "Just lovely!", "date": "Saturday 20 February 2021", "text": "The weather these past few days has been glorious - and it's forecast to continue next week, from what I can see. Today we had 17°C (62°F) and bright sunshine, so as hard as I tried I just couldn't come up with an excuse not to get off my backside and go out walking. Actually it was a bit of a cop-out because I should have left earlier and I should also have chosen a place to walk that is somewhat more challenging! But what can I say, I ended up back down at the lake at Passy again this afternoon. Well that would be me and half of Haute Savoie, from what I could see! When I got there the first parking lot was pretty full, but there was still plenty of room in the second one. Then I realized it was busy because it was spring break. France divides its school districts into three zones and, under normal circumstances, this would be spring break for our zone. For the next six weeks we would normally have a constant influx of foreign and out-of-state registered cars coming here for the skiing, but since the borders are closed and the ski lifts aren't running, it's been pretty quiet round here! That's great for the likes of me, of course, but it must still be devastating for the resorts which desperately need the winter season to make their money!Just before the turnoff to get to the lake there is a large sporting goods store (Quechua) that supplies most of the local sports outlets round here, so I decided to stop in and check it out. It's very spacious, has everything you could wish for in the field of sports and pretty reasonably priced, from what I could tell. I was thrilled to see that they had a large selection of snowshoes, since Isabelle and I had looked for them a few weeks back as we'd agreed we'd like to try it out up at the Plâteau de Glières. I sent her a photo and she replied telling me to \"get her some\", but in fact you need more specialized assistance as there is a difference between snowshoes for men and for women, the kind of terrain you want to walk on and your weight (I guess this is one area I shouldn't lie about my weight then)!  I did get myself a pair of cheap, bright green, wrap-around reflective sunglasses which apparently cut the UV rays, and while they are not \"designer\" (as if I care), they did a great job given the bright sunlight and its reflection off both the lake and the snow!The lake was great, with loads of people sunbathing, picnicking, BBQing, fishing and even a few hardy souls in the water - mainly little kids who decided they needed the water for their sandcastle-building endeavours. It was really just a stroll for me, but it gave me a chance to mess around with my Peakvisor app again and I finally figured out which of those mountains was really the Mont Blanc (the tallest mountain in Europe at 4,809 metres). Funny, I had it more over to the left (\"left\" obviously not being a technical geographical term)!This picture makes it look like the Aiguille du Midi ison top of the toilet building!The Quechua store - it was half empty!There were actually a few hardy souls in the water!I had to keep an eye on the time in order to be back before curfew, but leaving around 4 p.m. I made it back in time to stop by the DIY store. I asked one of the employees where I could find the angle grinders and he kindly took me there and asked what I wanted it for (\"I'm making a patchwork quilt\")! He was a bit bemused when I told him that I had a bunch of tyres that I needed to separate from their rims in order to take them to the tip and that even with the help of both my sons I hadn't been able to do it, so I was going to cut them off! Not sure what he thought of that but I got the angle grinder and with a 10% discount! Actually Jordan had to go to the bank yesterday to deposit his $600 covid stimulus cheque  - thank you US treasury - and as it's a $$$ cheque being deposited into a €€€ account he has to go in in person. So he stopped up here for lunch with André and me and spent a good hour yacking with his brother. Again, it was great to have them both here, and when they got to talking about their first (piece of crap) cars, or the time Jordan was driving my car in the winter and the handbrake froze, they were doubled up laughing - me, not so much, when I heard that last bit!The other night I spotted that they were showing a film on TV starring British actress Sheila Hancock. I think she's lovely and a very underrated actress so decided to sit and watch it as I had nothing else planned! Just like Shirley Valentine, it's not really a \"man's\" film (you would probably be bored out of your minds), but I actually enjoyed it. It's about an 83-year old widow who had been a lover of the great outdoors as a young girl, going hiking, fishing and canoeing with her father as a child. She met and married a man her family didn't particularly like and who proceeded to cut her off from them and the outside world, and turned into a monster she admitted she hated. In an effort to get her to start living a little again, when she was in her 50s her father sent her a postcard from Mount Sullivan in Scotland saying \"one day we'll climb this together\"! And she decided she would do just that! Except, her husband would hear nothing of it, went ballistic, and provoked a horrible argument, with him stamping his foot and throwing a fit when he realized she wouldn't back down. But the very next day, while still in his 50s, her husband had a massive stroke and never walked or spoke again - and her father died a couple of months later. She took care of her husband for the next 30 years, all the while hating the man, and when she one day decided that at the age of 83 she would, indeed, climb Mount Sullivan, everyone thought she'd gone stark, raving mad! Anyway, without giving away too much, Sheila Hancock did indeed climb up Mount Sullivan at the age of 84 (she's 87 now), often having to do several takes in order for them to get the close-ups and the distance shots. So ladies, if you would like to watch a gentle \"ladies only\" film, you could do worse than to watch Edie, Scottish actor Kevin Guthrie, as Sheila's co-star, also being very easy on the eye! Sheila HancockKevin Guthrie!I'm also reading an excellent book in the Jodi Picoult genre called The Wife Between Us! I haven't finished it yet but it's turning into the kind of book I can't put down. I think it was a recommendation on The Richard and Judy Show (UK daytime chat show - that I never watch), but if you like some easy, but gripping reading, I can highly recommend it!And finally, I recently saw on Youtube an interview with Ernestine Shepherd - \"the world's oldest competitive female bodybuilder\"! I don't know if she still holds that title but ... She only started working out at age 57 and is soon to be 85 and still going strong. She's a lovely lady and I find her so inspirational - well I guess that would be more believable if André wasn't staying over at Jordan's tonight and I hadn't discovered that he'd left a couple of beers in the garage! Ah well, there's always tomorrow!Ernestine Shepherd!"},
{"title": "Rough times!", "date": "Wednesday 17 February 2021", "text": "Some days are just so much rougher than others aren't they. I know the weather has a tremendous influence on people's psyche, but sometimes it seems that bad news really does seem to come all at once. I'm not talking about me personally, thank goodness. I'm doing fine, André and I are getting along famously (telling jokes at the moment - it's nice to get reacquainted with my son), and the weather is glorious - no clouds, bright sunshine most days and the stars are so pretty right now! But the rotten news just seems to have kept on coming these last few days!The first thing I heard this week was that one of the ladies in our FB walking group \"lost her battle with depression\" recently. I didn't know this lady, of course, but I'd seen some of her posts and like many people, I think maybe she was trying to use the walking challenge to help her emotional well-being. Sadly it didn't work. We all get \"down\" sometimes, of course, but real clinical depression must be hell, and while there are treatments/therapies that can help, how sad for this lady that she just wasn't able to make it through!Then the other day I knocked on my neighbour's door to let them know that they'd left the car window open - not good when snow is forecast and the temperatures are well below zero. When she opened the door I asked if she was okay and she said yes. I just said \"so that's why you're crying then\" and she smiled. I didn't want to intrude but invited her to come round for a coffee if she needed to chat. She didn't immediately but I'm sure she'll want to get what's bothering her off her chest at some point. It could be the tension in the house, I know she's missing her grandchildren in Switzerland, or it could just be this damn pandemic getting on everyone's last nerve! Who knows!On Saturday André met up with the others for band practice at Max's house and said he would be back before curfew (6 p.m.). By 6.30 p.m. I'm starting to think something's wrong, because maybe the police might forgive 15 minutes, but 30 minutes past curfew was definitely pushing it. Thankfully he called me shortly after and said that he was going to stay the night at Max's. Their friend, Alexi, had set off to make the short drive home after practice, lost control of his car on the snow, hit a guardrail (above a drop down the mountain side) and called them to come dig him out! Damn! André said Alexi (and his car) were okay and \"it wasn't such a bad drop\", but even so, who really thinks skidding into a guard rail on the side of a mountain \"isn't so bad\"!Then yesterday I had two messages pop up. The first was from our retirees' association announcing the death of a former colleague and while I knew of this colleague (you get to know everyone's personal details when you work in HR and do payroll), I didn't really know him. But he was only 61 and retired about six months after me, so he got to enjoy just 18 months of his retirement and then bam, gone! I know I've said this before, but I really would encourage anyone to retire as soon as it's financially feasible (if that's what they actually want), because cases like this colleague's bring home that nothing is a given!The second message was from my friend, Marilyn, who is currently living in Ireland to be near her son and his wife. She wanted to let me know that her older brother in Texas had just died of covid. They are all devastated, as you can imagine. He was the brother who very kindly welcomed André into his home for a holiday when he was just 10 and André had the most wonderful time. I last saw him a couple of years ago at Marilyn's daughter's wedding here in France. He and his first wife had divorced, he subsequently remarried, and as an English-speaker I was sat at the same table as them. They were a lovely couple, even if I found the wife's first comment to me that \"we're from Texas and voted for Trump\" a strange way to greet someone you've never met before. I just said I'd heard it was rude to talk politics or religion at the table so I figured we'd be fine. Sadly she was also a \"covid-denier\", stating (apparently) that it was just a bad case of the flu - and now just a few weeks after he got sick, and despite excellent medical care, her husband is gone, killed by the \"hoax\"! I talked to Marilyn today and she said she and this sister-in-law have not been particularly close, mainly because of vastly divergent political views, but that she reached out to her during her brother's illness and since his death but SIL hasn't been much inclined to respond. So now, sadly, it looks like there will be additional distress for his three children from his first marriage (he has no children with the second wife) and it could get pretty unpleasant! It's so sad - another person taken early by this damn virus!On the positive side, Marilyn's son and his wife desperately want to move back to France (as does Marilyn) and since she also has French citizenship it should be relatively easy once the issue of medical coverage can be sorted and they can find somewhere to stay. They're looking at Annecy, which is just down the road from me, but of course first her son has to get the job. I can't wait as I know Marilyn and I will have so much fun together! And you know the other day when I was talking about getting caught out looking like a slob, well Marilyn can go one better (not that she's ever looked like a slob). Years ago her husband's job saw him responsible for sales in certain Asian countries and at one point, just after the birth of their son, they were staying in a hotel in Hong Kong (I think it was). Anyway, she was in the elevator holding the baby and had baby spit-up on her shoulder (a permanent feature for new mothers), when the elevator door opened and guess who stepped in! You can't guess? Piers Brosnan - James Bond himself! I know!! I would have passed out!! And she said that while he's still an absolute hunk, 35 years ago he was even better looking in real life than in film! At least I only got caught out by Stan!And finally, as I was scrolling through looking at what's on tv (nothing, basically), I saw that Fifty Shades of Grey was on. I know!!! I never bought the book (I thought it was a sample book for you to pick your paint from)! But I clicked on the film anyway for the hell of it and landed right on a \"juicy bit\" - just as André came into the room laughing. Damn, I felt like he'd caught me watching porn or something - and I wasn't even interested in it to begin with. But whatevs, as they say! Anyway, he started to tell me something he'd just read about a couple of guys who were out fishing on a frozen lake in Estonia when they spotted a half-frozen dog struggling to get out of the water and back to dry land. Somehow they managed to fish it out, wrapped it in a blanket and placed it in the back of their car in order to get it to a vet. When the vet came out to take a look at it he told them they'd just driven 20-odd km with a slowly defrosting wolf in the back of their car!"},
{"title": "Squeaky!", "date": "Monday 15 February 2021", "text": "Do you ever wish you'd gotten into the shower just a few minutes earlier? Yeah, me too! I was still slobbing around the other day around 11 a.m. when the doorbell rang, and who should be there but Stan, my Nigerian friend. He retired a couple of years ago and spends most of his time back home in Nigeria, but comes to France for a couple of months every year to be with his wife and his three adult kids who are all now parents in their own right. It obviously works for them, and when his (French) wife retires in a couple of years I guess she will spend much of her time over there, although I'm guessing she'll still want to spend most of her time here in France where her grandkids are. Like I say, it works for them. But it was lovely to see Stan again. I was sitting there (unwashed and pretty pungent I would suspect) in t-shirt and sweats and he was sitting there in a big puffy coat and scarf - I guess the temperature difference is that great right. But André was there and we all got to sit around chatting for about an hour and it was really lovely. I miss having Stan's coffee shop/bar to stop off at, and despite what was apparently promised, nothing has been set up to replace it. Maybe that's an opportunity for some enterprising young person once this damn pandemic is over!I also got a call from my long-term friend the other day, which I couldn't answer because I was at the Préfecture for my permit, but when I called back, there she was sitting with her hair in curlers saying she didn't mind because it was only me! Now that's friendship! She had her naturalisation interview a year ago and still has heard nothing so I guess I've got plenty of time ahead of me. The other day I spent a good hour going through the \"100 most likely questions to be asked at your interview\" and while it was ok it was also incredibly wearing. I like history and geography but am not so interested in culture and politics, so that will be a challenge. I like reading about different political candidates' leanings but how the whole system works - nah not so much. I remember having to read \"The Corridors of Power\" about the UK political system many years ago and absolutely hating it. I don't know, maybe it gets more interesting with time! I certainly hope so!We got quite a dumping of snow the other day, but 24 hours later the sun was out and most of it was starting to melt so \"yay me\", no more shovelling that stuff! I noticed that when I took stuff up to the partly-burned-out compost bin the other day primroses were valiantly trying to poke their noses up through the snow. A sure sign of spring on its way! Spring is my favourite season so I'll take that as a positive even if realistically I know we've got a good six to eight weeks more of winter to deal with!When I woke up the other day I realized I was stiff all over, and tired of hobbling down the stairs like a 90 year old woman - well the first few stairs at least. So I spent 15 minutes doing a short yoga work-out immediately after getting out of bed and guess what, it worked. Fifteen minutes and I feel great again! André has obviously been feeling bored lately so every time he comes downstairs he yanks the door on the landing back and forth so I get to listen to it squeaking. So the other day I thought I'd get the bugger and brought the DW40 out and sprayed those hinges. The poor kid's lost now! That'll teach him to mess with me. In the meantime, if I find something that works on those knees I'll be sure to let you know!"},

Someone should write a song about that - someone did? Sting? Oh damn, I thought I was on to a good thing there. But guess what, I really am a legal alien in France now! Yep, I had my appointment today in Annecy to do the necessary and it all went swimmingly! For important things I tend to set off chronically early and of course getting my carte de séjour (cds) (residency papers) in order is probably the most important thing on my (non)jam-packed agenda right now. They had only asked for my passport and two \"South American drug mule\" photos and everything should be in order, but being just a tad anally retentive I grabbed a whole bunch of other stuff (almost needed a Sherpa to carry them) and set off for Annecy. Annecy is the \"capital\" city of Haute Savoie - and very beautiful it is too. So I was feeling pretty smug when I arrived there one hour ahead of time thinking I could just have a wander around. Well that was until I realized that half of Annecy is dug up with road works and I was \"deviated\" (\"detoured\"? sounds better doesn't it) all over the place until I ended up at Galleries Lafayette and decided to park there anyway and walk. Now Annecy is a city but it's really not very big - just labyrinthine - so I knew I wouldn't have very far to walk either way. After I started going through Galleries Lafayette I asked a young security guard (\"mask and sanitiser obligatory\") how to get to the Préfecture and he very kindly took me down to street level and showed me where to go. Sadly, I hate to think I look that much of an old biddy that I needed help - I prefer to think he was just a very kind, but bored, young man!On the way there I noticed green signs painted on the sidewalk saying \"masks are obligatory\", and also on billboards all around town. I had my mask on anyway but as I learned from André when I got back home, different municipalités have different rules, as defined by the Mayor, so in Annecy it was mandatory masks everywhere. When I got to the Préfecture they couldn't find my name on the appointment list despite my email rdv (please tell me they don't still have me under my married name), but they added my name there and then and told me to wait. Well all in all it took about 20 minutes for me to be called in to the very efficient young woman who was handling all the expat Brit shrapnel. And yes, she did indeed only need my passport and mugshot (so no proof of income or medical coverage then). All in all it took about 10 minutes and I was done. While I was waiting I asked her if Brexit had caused them a lot of work and she just laughed. Apparently so far they have issued over 3,000 Brit permits in this area alone, and that's not counting anyone who arrived after 31 December, or people like my friends and my kids who have so far not received a rdv! So considering the extra workload, all I can say is hats off to them, they've done a good job. And I should get my permit in a couple of weeks! After that I decided to have a wander around Galleries Lafayette (because \"sales\" you see) and got drawn into the babywear section. Trouble was, I don't know the sex of my soon-to-be grandchild and most of the clothes they had were pretty sex-specific. In the end I fell in love with a complete set of gender-neutral baby clothes that were soft as a baby's bottom. When I got to pay for them, however, I found out they were cashmere and cost the equivalent of two weeks' groceries. What? Did they have a Himalayan virgin milk the goat (yak?) that produced that wool? Oh well, whatever. It's for my Biboo. It will be the one and only really expensive thing that baby gets from me because I know (hope) mom and dad will be sensible enough to dress that baby in second-hand clothes so that Biboo can get dirty and nobody cares - yeah I know, that'll be the case! Give me The Little Rascals any day!Once I receive my resident's permit I can go ahead and request citizenship. And even though that will likely take a couple of years (it's a possibility, not a right), I will still go ahead with my request even if I keel over on my zimmerframe on the very same day they hand me my citizenship paperwork. Hell, I've told me kids if I die to bury me with both a French and British flag - but to make sure they get that whisker on my chin before they decide to have an open casket viewing!In other news, I have to say that I started this blog because I wanted to have a record of my life to look back on after I was pushed to do so by a lovely English lady I met in Turkey in 2010 (I hope she's still belly-dancing and singing in Welsh at 91) and Chris in Cuba (lying in the sea knocking back Cuba Libres was when she really convinced me to start my blog). Hell knows my kids don't seem interested, but hopefully one of my grandkids might like to read it someday. It doesn't matter to me how many \"hits\" I get, but goodness knows how much my life has been enriched by \"meeting\" people from all over the world. But still, I wrote this blog for me - a kind of personal diary if you like. So it's been odd seeing so many new people commenting on my blog lately but ladies (and gents) all I can say is welcome to my blog. I hope you stick around, and if you have your own blog please let me know so I can hop over to your world. One of my lovely new commenters (commentators?) mentioned that she, like me, lives alone and that I seem to have been through a rough time. Well yes I did. My marriage was a living hell for about 15 years and I honestly didn't expect to survive it. But I did, and, thanks be to God, I no longer hate my ex-husband. It's one thing to be divorced and eternally grateful to be so, it's another thing to be widowed or having to deal with the very real grief of living with someone who is so very, very ill and being, essentially, alone. So yes, I live alone (well as soon as I can get rid of my kid) and am very happy to do so. For many years I hated my ex-husband. But you know what, the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference, and I've been indifferent to him for a good few years. And goodness knows that makes life easier. I blew a fuse the other day when I read what his skank had \"testified\" about my abusing him financially, but it took all of 10 minutes to calm down because in the end, who cares what irrelevant people think. As they say, \"Why wrestle with a pig? You get covered in shit and the pig enjoys it\"!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 7 February 2021", "text": "When I was still going to my local MJC (community centre) for pilates classes I spotted that they had instigated \"repair cafés\" twice a month. Now I knew they had them in Geneva already but I wasn't aware of any here locally in France, so I was keen to stop in and see how they work. Amongst the myriad things that are \"wrong\" with this world, recycling is something that has always interested me. Oh lots of other things interest me too but since I don't feel that I, personally, can make much difference in the larger scheme of things, it's better to start local, right? Unfortunately the pandemic threw the world into chaos and everywhere has been shut down, opened up, shut down again and so on. But one thing I did do was join the group responsible for the repair café called \"TransitionlaRoche\" (or something like that). They seem to be pretty active on many fronts actually - encouraging the use of public transport rather than the car (difficult round here though), they've negotiated with the Mairie to offer up to €400 to anyone wishing to purchase a bike for commuting purposes, they are active in local government and so on - but it's the \"zero waste/recycling\" part that interests me. Anyway, since we're not in total lockdown (although still subject to curfew), I see that they are again holding repair cafés on Saturday mornings and will shortly be having another meeting on how to encourage zero waste, so I think I might go along. I am a bit leery of getting more actively engaged with such a group because while I'm happy to volunteer, pre-covid my life was pretty full anyway, and with a new grandchild shortly to put in an appearance my time will be more limited - but I guess we can see how it plays out. It's nice to find a group locally that appeals to your interests though isn't it!On Tuesday I have my appointment with the Préfecture in Annecy to (hopefully) finalize my resident's permit. Apparently I only have to bring my passport and two photos but I will be taking a whole bunch of other stuff to justify my claim to residence \"just in case\". Mind you, seeing the photos I had done the other day I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they won't burst out laughing and just refuse me on the grounds that the don't accept \"battleaxe\" photos. I know you're not allowed to smile anyway but seriously, I'm going to be left with that mugshot for the next 10 years? Eeww!On Wednesday my neighbour asked me if I wanted to get in a quick walk before curfew as she was going stir crazy so I thought why not. We stayed out of the woods though as it has been raining pretty heavily and we wanted to avoid the mud, so walked around the local neighbourhood and got in a good one-hour walk. Well that is until we passed a house just down the road from here where a dog came crashing out of the garden and bit me on the back of my leg! My guess is that someone had driven out and not closed the gates behind them, but this rather large hunting-type dog came snarling out and actually drew blood and ripped my trousers! While I wasn't hurt my neighbour yelled for the woman owner to get out here and take a look at what her dog had done. She apologized profusely and said she would pay for any damage (to my trousers or medical costs), but it was only a minor wound and as for the trousers - well, I'm not that bothered. But my neighbour read her the riot act about controlling her dog, particularly as it could have been a child that was attacked. My friend says I should report it to the police anyway but the jury's still out on that one! I probably will though, I just need time to think about it! That actually reminds me of when I was in Alice Springs on my \"round Australia\" trip in 1983. I spotted a nasty looking dog with froth coming out of his mouth and was just about to tell my friend to \"watch out for the dog\" when he turned around and bit me too (I guess my left calf muscle must look pretty tasty to dogs then). We went to the local hospital where the nurse told me that as my tetanus shot was up-to-date they wouldn't do anything as \"they don't have rabies in Australia\". It must have been true because I'm still here, but getting bitten by a rabid-looking dog is not particularly confidence-inspiring, I can tell you!Other than that, there's not much going on of course. You know you're probably getting covid boredom when you're pleased that you can now recognize the sound of the post van coming down the road don't you! André came downstairs the other day and asked if I had seen the amazing colour of the sky - sepia coloured, he called it. And it was indeed sepia coloured, due, apparently to a phenomenon called the Sirocco Phenomenon (I did not know that, but then again there's an awful lot I don't know), which picks up sand in the Sahara and dumps it in Europe wherever the rain is heading that day. Mind you, when I saw the state of my windows and car, \"sepia coloured\" didn't immediately spring to mind. \"Crap coloured\" was more appropriate I think - you should have seen the line waiting at the car wash!And finally, in response to Northern Living Allowance's blog post (nice to see you back) about covid weight gain, heck I thought my dryer was shrinking my clothes - turns out it's my fridge!"},
{"title": "Easy come, easy go!", "date": "Tuesday 2 February 2021", "text": "I was watching the news earlier today and see that Captain Tom, the nation's covid hero, has just died of pneumonia after being hospitalized with covid. Of course at 100 years old it was logical that he wasn't going to live for many more years, but as someone who will have been shielding at home it makes me wonder how he actually caught covid all the same. The sad thing is, with the pandemic still raging he won't be afforded the kind of funeral that I'm sure many would have wished to give him. Nevertheless, RIP Captain Tom!Captain Tom!As I once again figured I'd have a go at losing a bit of weight (or even a lot of weight), I decided to do a repeat of Dry January this year and again found it surprisingly easy. I have to admit I did have one drink - a glass of mulled wine when I was out walking with my neighbour in the mountains the other week - but other than that nope, not a single drink since just after Christmas. While I didn't expect miracles I thought I might lose a few pounds, but despite \"instantly\" losing 4 lbs, a couple of days later I was back up 4 lbs so I'm back to my starting point, even though I've been out walking and eating pretty healthily. So I guess it's portion control from here on in but, damn, it's hard when you've got a human hoover living with you!Bit by bit I've been going through more files that my ex left behind and so far there've been no more horrible surprises, although some of the documents he left behind should actually be important to him - tax documents and such - but hell, since when did it become my responsibility to sort and file that stuff? I did find an entire file relating to various campers we've had over the years so kept the buy/sell paperwork and pitched the rest. Looking at the papers I see that we bought our first camper in 1996, when the kids would have been four and eight. I remember our second outing in the van, when we were still trying to figure out what all the buttons and switches were for, we decided to leave straight after work on a Friday night and head down to a reservoir called the Barrage de Serre-Ponçon. This involved a five-hour trip down the route de Napoléon and us ending up arriving around midnight. We'd called ahead to let them know we'd be arriving late so they told us to just pull in and hook up without making any noise and we could register in the morning. The kids were already fast asleep at that point, but that night the wind picked up and ended up blowing a hoolie, rocking the camper from side-to-side and me wondering what the hell we'd let ourselves in for. That is, until the next morning when we opened up the blinds to the most magical view of the reservoir against a mountain backdrop. It was just stunning! I was talking to André about it this morning and he said he remembers how much fun it was playing with other kids in the swimming pool and running around the camp site all day - it felt like a week's holiday crammed into a weekend!The view from the dam!Our camp site!The reservoir at Serre-Ponçon!In other news, I was reading the other night when I saw that The Pirates of the Caribbean  - Salazar's Revenge was on. I think I might have seen the first film but none of its sequels - I usually don't have the patience to sit and watch TV anyway. I have to say, though, that however messed up Johnny Depp may be in real life, he absolutely nailed Jack Sparrow! In addition to that I realized that Javier Bardem was playing Salazar and I just love Javier. I find him so sexy (although maybe not in full Salazar make-up) and deliciously evil so I did watch a bit of it just to drool! He kinda has the brooding good looks of a young Al Pacino in The Godfather and the sexy voice to go with it! Salazar!Javier Bardem - gorgeous right?Then the next night Skyfall was on and yet again Bardem was playing the baddie. I really don't like him \"as a blond\" but still, he was a great baddie, even if I don't care for the Bond films at all! There's been some talk about who should replace Daniel Craig as the next Bond and I have to say I'd have a hard time choosing between the two potential front-runners - Tom Hardy and Idris Elba. They've both got that kind of twinkle in the eye that to my mind Daniel Craig lacks - but I don't suppose anybody cares what I think do they!Tom Hardy!Idris Elba!I stopped over to see Jen again today and she's doing well, although still being good about laying on the sofa as much as possible and not going out. She's 31 weeks pregnant today so it's going in the right direction thankfully. The weather's been crap here for the last few days but just as I was heading home the rain stopped and the sun broke through the clouds so I had to pull over and take a quick snap of the mountains as they were so lovely!When I got back Max was at the house, having come over to check on my heating system (or, more likely, to have a beer with André)! He was asking what all the tyres were doing in front of the house and I told him that André and I have been lugging them up from the basement so that I can throw them in my car as and when and take them to the tip. Yesterday I asked at the tip where I should put the tyres that were on rims and when he told me I had to separate the tyres from the rims first I just thought \"here we go again, something else that I've got to figure out how to do\"! Max was somewhat incredulous that we wouldn't even try to sell the tyres/rims that were in decent shape. I don't care about the money but I agree I don't like the idea of just throwing out something that can be of use to someone else. Admittedly that kind of stuff gets put to one side at the tip but still. So while he was standing there Max took a few photos and posted six tyres/rims on Le Bon Coin (a local buy/sell/exchange paper) and within five minutes he'd gotten three enquiries, so hopefully they will sell pretty quickly and be taken off my hands. If they do sell, any money they make will be put towards more musical equipment for their band so I might get Max to come over next time I've got a load of stuff I need to get rid of. I guess some people are \"sellers\" and some are not - and seemingly André and I fall into the \"not\" category. Like I say, easy come, easy go, right!"},
{"title": "The gift that keeps on giving!", "date": "Friday 29 January 2021", "text": "It looks like we're finally in winter right now. Not what I call \"February/March winter\" of the howling winds and freezing temperatures, but more the \"January winter\" of the grey skies and constant drizzle. To be honest it isn't always grey skies even if at the moment it's definitely \"January winter\", with the constant rain, rain, rain! I went over to Jordan and Jen's this afternoon (lasagna and garlic bread for dinner) and driving along the road next to the Giffre river I was amazed to see how fast flowing and how high the water is. It's beautiful fishing and rafting water, of course, but it's kinda frightening how the water levels can rise so quickly!Le GiffreAs I was setting off out this afternoon I noticed that this little red car is still on the island in the middle of our housing lotissement. It's been parked there for a few days now right next to the sign that says \"please don't park on the island\"! We keep the grass cut and the island tidy as it's a nice place for everyone to meet up (covid permitting), so parking on the island is discouraged, particularly given that there are plenty of parking spaces available. Still, there's always one isn't there!The red sign says \"please don't park on the island\"!The French aren't known for being great respecters of rules but I have to say I've been pleasantly surprised at how people have been wearing masks and using the hand sanitizers available at the entrance to every shop. There's a UK blogger who I quite like and who is a tad eccentric (which to me is a good thing), but she is of the opinion that this pandemic is more or less an attempt by governments to \"control the plebs\" (maybe, maybe not) and that the virus is no more serious than the flu (on that I do not agree with her at all based on first-hand testimony from front line staff). She doesn't like wearing a mask and so goes shopping with a paper she downloaded from the government's website to say that wearing a mask causes her distress (which she is perfectly entitled to do)! She posts about this kind of thing occasionally but I'm beginning to suspect she does it to stir things up as while many people agree with her, a few slap back and tell her how selfish she's being. One lady commented that she presumed she wouldn't be getting the vaccine shot then since it was all a hoax and the whole bloody blog blew up into a fair old handbag fight! I didn't comment as I tend to keep my opinions to myself, but needless to say I don't agree with her stance. She wouldn't get away with not wearing a mask in shops here though because I'm pretty sure you've got to have a paper signed by a doctor in order to exempt you from having to wear a mask on health grounds, and again, to be fair, everywhere I go people seem to be following the mask and the curfew rules! I saw in the paper today a short article on how the Chinese might introduce \"anal swabs\" to better detect the virus - maybe the French follow the rules because they've also read that article. The \"anal swab\" visual gives pause for thought though doesn't it!About an hour ago the French Prime Minister addressed the nation and surprisingly they are not ordering another lockdown. He said the curfew seemed to be working, although maybe not as well as they would like, but as from Sunday they are closing the borders to anyone coming from outside the E.U. (I presume that means also the Schengen area is exempt - i.e. Switzerland for us) unless the travel is essential or the person is a cross-border worker (like André). So the same rules apply: continued curfew, wearing of masks, any non-food shopping centres over 2,000 square metres to be closed (so small businesses can stay open), and mandatory covid tests less than 72 hours old for anyone having to enter France under one of the exceptions above. I guess the ski lifts are still closed, as are gyms, restaurants and the like but what can we do - at least we're not back in bloody lockdown! I do miss my gym and yoga sessions though as I'm starting to creak, but I recognize that those are very definitely first world problems!After I got home tonight I saw on FB that there was yet another traffic jam on the motorway that I used to take to go to work. People were saying that it had taken them 45 minutes to do 1 km and again, I'm so, so glad I no longer have to do that journey on a daily basis! In other news André came in the other night and asked me if I had bought a ticket for Saturday's lottery because someone in the local area had won €11 million. Sadly, it wasn't me - well I won €2.20 - but it's nice to see someone local hitting the jackpot isn't it! André has been off this week in order to use up some of his leave and it looks like he might finally have gotten all the paperwork sorted to get his Swiss car plates switched to French. He also made two trips back to the apartment he shared with Lily in Switzerland and emptied out the storage area/bicycle shed, so I leave to your imagination what my basement looks like yet again! In amongst the stuff he brought back was a box of his dad's paperwork that he left on the table when he upped and abandoned his rented farmhouse five years ago. Seriously, he just upped and left everything - even left coffee grounds in the pot and washing in the washer! I know I've mentioned this before but I went over to his place every weekend for two months to empty that and the two-car garage, so yeah, I had a good idea what was in that box as I had packed up and moved most of it! But, what I hadn't seen was some of the crap regarding his last DUI in March 2010. He left me and moved in with someone I affectionately refer to as \"the fat-ankled skank with a face like the north end of a camel going south\" in January 2010 and in March 2010 he wrecked not only his own car but also the car the garage had lent him while fixing up his car. So two cars in one week! When he had to appear in court he must have got some of his drinking buddies to write \"testimonials\" for him, saying what a great happy-go-lucky guy he always was, until recently when \"he had separated from his wife and appeared very depressed\". Well yeah, buddy, maybe the split with your wife had something to do with you shacking up with The Downgrade (\"fat-ankled skank with a face like the north end of a camel going south\" being way too long to write out every time). But meh, whatever. Well I was meh until I saw The Downgrade's testimonial. She wrote that he was staying with her \"as a friend\" (a kinda cosy \"friendship\" in the same bed though don't ya think) and \"yes he was depressed by the break-up of his marriage\" (not that she had anything to do with it of course, she was just his bar ho/drinking buddy) and \"his depression had probably caused him to drink that night, exceptionally\" (ha!), \"something he very much regretted\"! What this didn't explain though were the three or four other DUIs he had before he became \"depressed\" by the break up of his marriage. But get this, the bitchy cow, she also wrote that he had also \"just found out about the high level of \"hidden debt\" that he and his wife were in, and she (The Downgrade) would like to point out that it was Madame who handled all the finances\"! Sub-text, Madame (me) was syphoning off money and hiding debts. Ha!!!!! I wonder whose salary she thought was really paying for all those rounds of drinks in the ho bar, and wasn't it strange that when the assets were documented for the divorce Monsieur was driving a €60,000 car while Madame was driving a car generously valued at €1,000 (not that I cared). Also Madame didn't have 10 guitars and thousands of €€€€ worth of musical equipment lying around, her only \"vice\" being buying second-hand books off Amazon! Damn, he certainly spun a tale didn't he. Oddly enough, when Madame blocked his access to her salary quite a few of the friends dropped off the horizon as I guess he wasn't buying so many rounds. Indeed The Downgrade didn't last too much longer before she cheated on him! Oh dear, never mind, how sad! It's also telling that his pension is double that of Madame's, but the latest gf has had to get a job after initially thinking she could retire, and Monsieur has been training to become a school bus driver because he wasn't making it on the money he was bringing in! And guess who has a 25 year mortgage aged almost 60 and no money in the bank, and who has no mortgage and a decent amount in savings. Go on, I bet you can't guess! I tell ya I was furious when I read that this afternoon but in the end I just thought who cares, either that's what he was telling them (I know he told them I was violent), or that's what he truly believed in his alcohol-befuddled state. In the end there're no tag backs, I'm no longer his Chaos Manager, nor do I have to adult for a toddler in an adult body! Maybe I should suggest to The Downgrade that she gets her next covid swab in China!And finally, after this epic rant, Anne in Alabam was saying that she is trying to learn Swedish but was finding it quite difficult as she \"keeps getting her words wrong\". Nah, learning languages is easy, particularly Swedish. If you don't believe me ..."},
{"title": "The walking wounded!", "date": "Wednesday 27 January 2021", "text": "I stopped in at my neighbour's yesterday to see if she needed any help. Her hand was operated on on Thursday and she has to keep it dry for around six weeks (I think), so life's a bit difficult for her at the moment, all the more so since her husband was taken in to hospital on Sunday. She said at the moment she's all set but might need some help tomorrow so she'd let me know. When I asked about her husband she said his operation had gone well (putting more stents into his groin), but he was apparently being pretty obnoxious to some of the nurses, so I guess he's not going to win any popularity contests. He told her he was cold the first night in hospital and when the nurse found him all dressed up in extra clothing the next morning she asked why he didn't press the call button, to which he replied that they should have thought about that and made sure there were extra blankets in the cupboard. Strangely, for some reason I don't think it's a good idea to be rude to people who are either going to be operating on you or taking care of you post-op, but that could just be one of my little foibles. It's odd really because he has never struck me as someone given to being overtly rude as, superficially at least, he is always charming (narc much?), but maybe he's forgotten that he's no longer the director of a big bank and is now just another retired \"nobody\" like the rest of us! Anyway, I told her to just give me a call and André and I will be only too willing to help!Then my friend who lives opposite sent me a message to say that she'd been inspired to get going with the walking again but damn it if she hadn't slipped and fallen on the ice and now has knees like two black and blue basketballs! Luckily for her a passing couple stopped and helped her to get home, but while she says she's ok I think I'll be popping over there too tomorrow morning. I actually like the winter but snow - or more precisely, ice - can be lethal can't it!Then today I got a weird FB message from my sister (apparently). I figured it was a bit suspicious as \"she\" just sent a Youtube video with no message and that was it. So I gave her a call and of course she'd been hacked. They must have done a pretty good job of it because they'd apparently managed to post a \"boob\" photo on her home page - which she took down pretty quickly - and she has now changed all her passwords. Bloody hell! I don't intend to get off FB (well not yet anyway) because it's the way I keep in touch with my family, but it does make you think twice doesn't it. So then she told me that on Sunday my brother also had a fall and while he wasn't injured he got completely soaked because he couldn't get up and was just lying there in the snow until they found him. This brother is autistic and every Sunday he goes to my sister's for lunch and, as she says, you can set your watch by him. He arrives every Sunday at 10.10 a.m. and when it got to 10.20 and there was no sign of him she knew something was wrong. For whatever reason she walked into the bedroom that looks out over the back garden and that is when she saw a pair of legs sticking out from behind the garden fence - and there was my brother lying like a beached whale in the snow! As I say, thankfully he wasn't hurt but he couldn't get up as it was so slippery and if she hadn't gone in to that bedroom when she did goodness knows how long he would have laid there. Actually, not long I suspect because him being a creature of such regular habits I'm sure they would have headed out to their car quite quickly to go off looking for him, so I guess being \"predictable\" does have it's good side!On Sunday I again drove down to the lake at Passy just to get a bit of walking in and while it was glorious - freezing cold but sunny - I also started having a few regrets when I got over to the far side of the lake in amongst the trees because the path was treacherous. I did think about doubling back but in the end I waddled on like a pregnant penguin and was so thankful when I finally made it back to \"dry land\"!The lake actually froze!Messing around with my new Peakvisor app!On a happier note, Jen is doing fine but absolutely respecting the doctor's orders and spending her time lying on the sofa. To save Jordan from having to come home from work and start cooking I've been either taking food over or having André take it when he stops by. Yesterday I sent over sweet and sour pork and today it was lentil soup, followed by chicken curry, naan and raita, with cream cheese cookies for dessert! Don't tell anybody, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself!I mentioned a few posts ago that I follow a FB group that I joined when my husband left. It's kinda sad to see people still going through this crap but a sort of solidarity has seemed to evolve amongst long-time members of the group. I know a few have met up in the US and in Australia and there is even talk about having a larger group meet up and maybe even some solos travelling. Now that sounds right up my alley! I mentioned that I have done 12 solos trips since my husband left and so many people were asking who I went with, what was it like and so on so there is obviously a real interest. Who knows, maybe we can form our own international Meetup group. Anyway, later today someone posted a \"karma\" post about a police chief from a place called Stinnett in Texas whose fiancée found out that he had been cheating on her with another \"fiancée\" which, as it turns out, was news to his wife and four kids. As far as they know he had two (maybe three) \"fiancées\" and potentially a couple of girlfriends also, each of whom were busily planning their weddings and buying rings and so on. These ladies became aware of each other because a friend of one of the ladies knew the guy's daughter and let it be known that he was very much still married, despite producing a supposed marriage annulment document to show to one of the fiancées. So these ladies started working together to piece together his lies and began bombarding the Stinnett police department's FB page with comments (there were nearly 500 comments when I looked). I feel so so sorry for his wife and children, and for the ladies he lied to, of course. They didn't ask for any of this. But sorry for police chief Jason Collier of Stinnett, Texas for the hammering he's getting? Nah, not so much!And finally, President Macron was supposed to speak to the nation tonight to update us on measures regarding the current covid situation. Anyway it now turns out that he will speak \"in the coming days\" but there are mixed opinions as to what he will say. Maintain the current rules or new lockdown? Who knows, but I think there is seriously little appetite for a further lockdown. God knows the thought of having to download permission slips in order to go out and being confined to within one kilometre of home again fills me with dread but what can I say, que sera right!"},
{"title": "Busy doing nothing ...", "date": "Saturday 23 January 2021", "text": "The weather has been crappy here again today, a perfect day for just sitting around doing nothing. If I'm being really honest I probably could have gotten a walk in this morning before the rain/snow started if I'd put my mind to it but I didn't (put my mind to it) as it turns out, so there's now a bum-like indentation on my sofa from where I've been parked most of the day reading - and I have to admit, it's been rather nice! I've done so much cooking with André being here that I've got tons of leftovers, so while he's gone I'm going to try to eat those up. So no cooking, and not much else of note was achieved today!We had a bit of a drama earlier in the week though. Tuesday night (or more exactly around 1 a.m. Wednesday morning) Jen started having pretty strong contractions that were coming around five minutes apart. She's only 29 weeks pregnant so now is absolutely not the time for Biboo (as she calls him/her/it) to put in an appearance. It got so bad that Jordan ended up taking her to the emergency room, where they kept her in. They gave her something to try to stop the contractions and also cortisone injections to boost the baby's lungs in case he decided he couldn't wait, but so far so good. She was beside herself with worry, of course, all the more so since if a mother goes into labour earlier than 32 weeks round here they take them to the hospital in Chambéry (about an hour away) as it's better equipped to deal with extreme preemies. She had a good night's sleep but was still having contractions the next day so they ended up keeping her in for four nights. Long story short, the contractions have calmed down now and after doing a scan of her cervix (which is fine), they've allowed her to come home but on complete bed rest. Thank God for that! Actually Jordan asked André if he would move back in with them for the time being since he can work from home and he (Jordan) will be more reassured if someone is with Jen during the day (although \"André\" and \"emergency\" are not words that would trip off my tongue easily together). I plan to go over pretty much every day and cook/clean and I'm sure Jen's mom will do the same as she's off on sick leave at the moment, although she is not currently here in Haute Savoie right now. I'm more than happy to help out and I think Jen will be reassured having André around. Ha, I never thought anyone would see the day that they would be spoilt rotten by my kids! Still, all's well that ends well and the longer Biboo decides to \"stay in the warm\" the better!It's all go at the moment though. My neighbour was scheduled to have surgery on her hand on Thursday but the same day her husband came home in a panic as he was struggling to walk. He has had several operations to insert stents into the veins in his legs as they keep collapsing. So he ended up going for emergency tests at the hospital which showed a build up of \"plaque\" in the stents which could cut off blood supply. I offered to take her to hospital on Thursday and pick her up but her daughter did the necessary and I've offered to come in and help her if she needs it because she can't use her right hand. Then he has to go into hospital on Sunday to have his legs operated on again and should be in probably until Wednesday. She can't drive anyway and even without the operation to her hand she can't/won't drive in the dark, nor will she drive to Annemasse. She was telling me that her son would come and take his dad in on Sunday but the French are implementing a ban on all non-essential travel to France as from Sunday (the son lives in Switzerland) and for those having to travel they must now provide a covid test less than 72 hours old! And all that's in addition to the 18h curfew! Actually, even though this region now has an R number of 1.2, it's looking more and more like we might be forced back into lockdown again sometime soon. So it's all go at the moment and I might be seeing more of the inside of a hospital than I've seen in the past 10 years but at least I'm here and I'm free to run her/them around. Hell, it's not like I've got much else to do is it!On Friday I picked up my mail and saw I had a letter from the \"divorce registry\" people and was delighted at the prospect of getting the copy of my divorce certificate so quickly. Except yes, they had handled it quickly, but had returned my request because they wanted a copy of my ID! Well why didn't they state that on the bloody form then? It's not like I \"misunderstood\" the form - they didn't ask for it! Grrr! But talking of \"misunderstanding\", I was reading a new-to-me blog today and the lady was bemoaning the trials and tribulations of living in a country where you don't speak the language fluently. Well one of the comments was from a lady who had lived in Spain for a while and she was saying that one day she got her \"churros\" and \"burros\" mixed up and ended up asking for \"donkeys and chocolate\"! Ha, that tickled me because we've all been there!\"Churros\"!\"Burros\"!And finally, I saw in the news that President Biden will be attending the G7 to be held in Cornwall in June but they won't be using \"The Beast\" (the presidential limo) because it can't handle the narrow Cornish roads. I love narrow country lanes. I think the first time I ever saw such tiny roads was in Herefordshire on the way to the village where my brother-in-law grew up. Talk about picturesque! I'm a bit baffled though as to why they are having an in-person G7 to be honest, and holding it in a place like Carbis Bay, which must be a logistical nightmare when so many heads of state will be attending!Carbis Bay, CornwallChurch Cottage, Coddington. Built in the 1600s and the house my brother-in-law grew up in. It was totally \"renovated\" when his parents moved out and is now a B&B!The issue of not being able to use The Beast for the presidential visit reminded me of the time in 2011 when President Obama visited Ireland. As the presidential convoy was leaving the US Embassy The Beast got stuck on a speed bump - and it was hilarious, if embarrassing. I would have loved it if he had gotten out of the vehicle and gone over to greet the crowds but I guess the Secret Service would have none of it! Shame that!"},
{"title": "Different perspectives!", "date": "Friday 22 January 2021", "text": "André's car has been in the garage this past week to have a few things fixed. One of the parts had to be sent away to the Netherlands to see if it could be repaired, failing which that part alone will cost him around €1,100 to replace! In the meantime we've been pottering along using just my car, which hasn't been a problem in and of itself because André has been working from home and I have about two \"outings\" a week where I need my car - grocery shopping and trotting down to the recycling centre. Yeah, I know, some of us just live the high life don't we. Anyway, he took my car to run into town the other day and when he came back he told me he had spotted his old girlfriend, Annabel, begging at the entrance to the supermarket. Now I didn't know about any girlfriends before Lily as she was the first one he ever introduced to us, but apparently he dated Annabel - who lives(d?) nearby from about the age of 16. He was telling me tonight that she dumped him to get back with her ex the first time, they got back together again and she dumped him a second time, presumably for her ex again, after which he met Lily. Apparently she called sometime later asking to get back together again but he hadn't bothered answering as he'd had enough of her (aaahhh, young love). Well it turns out that she must have gotten into drugs and has gone totally off the rails. I think she must be the young girl I've spotted begging a few times as I've only ever seen her and a man with a dog begging outside that particular store. He said he was shocked and saddened to see her like that but as he was driving out of the car park he didn't stop and speak to her, and in any case he wouldn't have known what to say!So then we somehow got talking about his childhood and he told me that \"it was an absolute dream\". I'm so, so pleased to hear him say that because my memories of my kids' childhood is marred by the screaming matches between me and my ex and the physical violence towards me (but not them), so maybe there were good times before all the bad times kicked in. He said how wonderful it was to grow up in an area with so many mates (there were loads of young boys round here) and having access to the woods, the mountains and the lakes was fabulous. At school he had a great crowd of mates too, and when we got home the first thing he would do was look out the window to see who was outside and then dash off to meet them at la branche (their hidey-hole/meeting place). Again, it gives me so much pleasure to hear him say this because, as I say, I guess my guilt complex only allows me to remember the bad times!So then I started telling him about how it was the same for me. Oh we were poor all right and I grew up in the inner city as opposed to a small rural village, but in the six row houses where I grew up there were 40 kids, believe it or not, so we always had someone to play with and, being in a city, we always had places to go - the swimming baths, the cinema, the ice rink, the huge central library in our city or, in my case, Birmingham's fabulous natural history museum, which I absolutely loved! It reminded me of Scottish comedian, Billy Connolly, saying how he had the most wonderful time growing up in the Glasgow slums because no matter how poor they were, he always had tons of mates!As I say, I grew up in social housing where large families were the norm but it seemed everyone looked out for each other and there was much more of a community spirit than there is today. Two doors away from us was the Farley family who were the \"rough\" ones, but even if some of the boys got into trouble with the police on a regular basis (minor stuff usually), they never gave any of the neighbours any hassle. I giggle when I remember that as my bedroom was at the front of the house I was privy to many a night visit by the police to the Farley family looking for one of the boys. One of the best ones, though, was one night the police rang the doorbell at around 1 a.m. and Mrs. F must have answered the door in the nude and all I heard was one of the police officers saying \"of for God's sake woman, put some clothes on will you\"!In other news, the weather here has taken a turn for the worse again and we have a storm blowing a right hoolie at the moment, with more snow forecast, so I don't know if I'll get much - if any - walking done this weekend. But damn it wouldn't you know that I totted up my miles walked tonight and I've totalled 99.85 miles so far this year! So close and yet so far! I'll be spending the weekend alone as André is going to stay over at Jordan and Jen's so they can play guitar and hang out for a while. I think it'll do them both good to break up the covid routine a bit. When I got back from dropping André off (at 18.02h so two minutes past curfew - don't tell anyone), I saw that I'd received an email from the French authorities asking me to stop by their offices in Annecy on 9 February, complete with passport and two photos, in order to finalize my request for my resident's permit. So that's not bad timing at all. After that, I should get my 10-year, renewable permit in about two weeks' time! Yay me!And finally, did anyone see that sweet story in the news this week about the man in Turkey who was hospitalized and his devoted dog waited for him outside the hospital every day for six days? Oh the family kept taking the dog back home with them but every day he escaped and waited outside the hospital doors until his master came back. How sweet is that?Man's best friend!"},
{"title": "No longer marking time!", "date": "Wednesday 20 January 2021", "text": "After my comment the other day about \"marking time\" I was somewhat reassured to realize that I'm not the only one that feels this way. I guess it's normal given the horrible times right? So on Monday I decided that if I don't want to stay stuck in a rut I needed to start knocking off some of the stuff on my \"to do\" list, rather than the just routine stuff of daily living. So I got onto the new website for requesting French citizenship and pulled up the complete list of documents I will require. I knew I had most of them anyway but was missing a copy of my divorce certificate and form P237 from the tax people to prove that I am up-to-date with my income tax. So I downloaded the form from the French government website to request a copy of my divorce certificate, and filled in another form on the tax website requesting said form P237, stating that it was in connection with my request for citizenship - and whadda ya know, the tax people have already gotten back to me with a statement showing my up-to-date tax status for the last three years! Wow, that was fast. The divorce registry will only have received my request today (if I'm lucky) so that will take a little longer, but once I get my carte de séjour (resident's permit) - which hopefully should come soon - I'll be ready to submit my documents for citizenship. I actually prefer doing this stuff online anyway, but it's a shame it set me back 18 months in my timeline. Still, there's not a lot I can do about that and moaning won't change a thing will it!Yesterday I received my copy of Haute Savoie magazine and was surprised to learn that between 16 and 23 December they had set up 1,300 covid test centres and tested 626,000 people, 29,000 of whom had apparently tested positive!!!! They even organized shuttle buses for rural areas to ensure as many people as possible were tested. Well done whoever was responsible for putting all that together, it can't have been easy!My neighbour, Isabelle, also seems to be coming out of her \"funk\" because she's pretty gung-ho about walking at the moment, even though it means trying to fit in a walk during her lunch hour. We're only walking locally during the week because of her work hours, but as the weather has been glorious it's been quite exhilarating and I'm regularly getting in 10-11,000 steps a day!We spotted this \"tiny home\" in the woods near La Bénite Fontaine!Not a very good photo but this is the local day centre for mentallychallenged/disabled adults and someone decided to build a \"Knights of theRound Table\" snowman, complete with sword and armour!I also spent time in my basement and got the old fridge down there cleaned up and one of the two freezers so I'm obviously feeling quite motivated at the moment. Then I downloaded the Peakvisor and Plantsnap apps because I've finally had enough of never knowing the names of the mountains round here. Oh I recognize some of them, but maybe only three or four, so with my new mountain and plant recognition technology I reckon I'll soon be a walking encyclopaedia!Tonight André was messing around putting salt down on the back terrace and asked if I wanted to have a snowball fight. Yeah right! So I told him not now as I was making dinner but I would be up for it in August if he liked! The upshot of that is that we made a few snowballs and have put them in my newly-cleaned freezer to save for an as yet unspecified date in August when we'll have that fight! I love that my kids both have a great sense of humour. Then he pulled out a few old photo albums and we were having a good laugh at some of their younger photos but now that's added something else to my \"to do\" list - scan and upload more old photos into Snapfish albums! This is a blurry old photo of Jordan, who must have been about 10,coming down to dinner dressed as \"Larry Potter\", Harry's younger brother!When we'd finished scattering salt outside I picked up the bag of salt to put it back in the garage and nearly fell over. I only bought a 12.5 kg bag because I couldn't pick up the 25 kg bags but crikey, considering that's about the amount of weight I'd like to lose it really brings home how much I'm lugging around when I have to lift it in \"bag of salt\" form! Also in the spirit of no longer treading water, I called a bathroom installation company on Monday and the guy came out tonight to get an idea of what I would like to do with my bathrooms and what is feasible for my budget. Turns out he lives about 200 metres from me in the same village. Small world isn't it. I'm under no illusion that this is going to be cheap but as long as it's within a reasonable budget I'm pretty sure I can find something I like (I'm not difficult in that respect). I think I'll probably go for it because once the bathrooms are done all the \"big stuff\" will be taken care of, and anything else will, hopefully, just be cosmetic!I watched parts of the inauguration today and was so glad to see that so far it has gone off without a hitch. It was, of necessity, very understated for several reasons of course, but I thought Joe Biden hit the right note with his speech and is now, hopefully, ready to hit the floor running. He and Kamala have a huge job ahead of them!And just a quick note to thank Judi in Canada for the Christmas card and chatty letter. I don't know when you posted it but I received it yesterday (Tuesday), but thanks so much, it was a lovely surprise!Finally, my Words With Friend buddy in New York sent me this joke, which kinda tickled me, so I'll leave you with it in the hope it makes you laugh just a little too!A husband walks into the bedroom to see his wife packing a suitcase so he asks, \"What are you doing?\"She answers, \"I'm moving to Nevada. I heard that prostitutes there get paid $400.00 for what I'm doing for YOU for FREE!\"Later that night, on her way out, the wife walks into the bedroom and sees her husband packing his suitcase.When she asks him where he's going, he replies, \"I'm coming too. I want to see how you live on $800.00 a year.\""},
{"title": "Timing!", "date": "Sunday 17 January 2021", "text": "In July 2019 I sent off a request for an appointment with the French authorities to submit my dossier for French citizenship. I got an automated response and then nothing else but since I knew the delay would be very long I wasn't too worried. I have pretty much everything ready anyway, but two of my papers have to be less than three months old when the file is submitted so I've had to hang fire before getting them - a notarized copy of my divorce and an attestation from the tax people! Then my friend sent off her request in October last year and in the automated reply they said to re-send the email if it was a second request, putting the word \"resubmit\" in the heading. This she did and they got straight back to her with an appointment for December 2021! So I sent in a \"resubmit\" email and got bugger all. Then, yesterday I saw on FB that as of 1 January 2021 all paperwork must now be submitted online and the Prefecture in Annecy will no longer be taking appointments. Damn! I've waited, what, 18 months and now this. I looked up the link on the website and it looks pretty easy actually so hopefully if I get the two missing papers I can get that sent off in the next couple of weeks. Just as well really, I suppose, because the pass on my French language exam is only valid two years and then I have to take it again (I guess you forget how to speak French after two years then right)! And all this just to submit your dossier. The actual interview to see if you're integrated into French society will probably take another 2-3 years (seriously), but I suppose that at least gives me time to brush up on French history!Things are still pretty quiet round here though. André has had two appointments with kitchen companies to see what he wants/can afford to get installed in his new apartment and is quite stoked. Then yesterday - as I handed him a coffee and a piece of cake - he suggested I might like to move in with him when the apartment is ready??? Yeah, right, buddy, it's either that or you learn how to cook right? Still it's been nice having him here and we really have been getting on very well so it's been a definite positive. I suppose, having someone here during this second lockdown has probably made it easier, I guess!I see on the news that the NRA is in the process of declaring bankruptcy in New York and setting up again in Texas as a \"non-profit\". New York's Attorney General, Letitia James, has apparently been quoted as saying \"you can't escape me with bankruptcy\" so I guess there are fun times ahead! Seeing all the security precautions they're taking in D.C. makes me kinda sad though. Of course they would have to have enhanced security with any inauguration, but seeing all the barriers in front of the White House hit me somewhat. When we got married in 1985, after a short stint in a law firm I got a job at the World Bank, which is located just a few blocks away from the White House. So when I had nothing planned at lunch time I would walk down to the park to have my lunch, feed the ducks and sometimes stroll past the WH and there were none of those horrible security fences you see now. I know times change and security has had to be increased everywhere but... Heck where I worked we went from having a few overweight retired firemen posing as security (they were glorified parking attendants really), to being totally fenced in with a kind of \"moat\" on the lake side to prevent anyone from breaching the security fences, installing turnstiles we had to badge through and real security guards and ex-ray machines located in the main entrance (we used to get the anti-globalisation protesters whenever there were big trade meetings). Maybe the world has become a safer place for it, but it's a sad reflection on today's society isn't it!In other news, my neighbour and I had planned to go walking yesterday since she has every second Friday off, but the day was wet and grey so we didn't go. Well that's not strictly true because around 4 p.m. the rain eased a little and I decided to get an hour's walk in along the railway line before our new 6 p.m. curfew (in force as of yesterday). Today, however, was totally different. The rain had stopped and the sun poked its nose through the clouds so she called me and asked if I wanted to go out. Sure! I would have liked to go up to La Clusaz but I saw on FB that there had been a landslide half way up the mountain gorge and the road was closed. So I suggested we go to Sixt Fer à Cheval and she said she was up for anything because - much to her shame - in the 18 years that she's lived here they have never been out exploring. Now I'm divorced and God knows my husband and I were at each other's throats at the end (I didn't like his girlfriend), but in the early days we were both very much up for getting out and discovering all there is to see around here - something which her husband just isn't interested in. So we set out and stopped off in Samoens so we could take a quick walk on one of the bridges above where they do white water rafting. I remember being one week away from giving birth and André (then four) went running off towards the bridge saying \"look mommy, big\", and when I got there I almost fainted as the drop over the side of the bridge was about 100 feet! He wasn't in any danger as he couldn't climb that high and I was only a few lumbering metres behind him but I got a fright anyway!You can't really tell from this angle,but this is a shot taken over the side of the bridgeand the drop is about 100 feet!We tried to get up to the waterfall called Cascade du Rouget but the road was blocked part way up so maybe we can have shot at it another day by walking up - there just wasn't time today! It was such a pleasure to take Isabelle up there though because she kept saying \"thank you so much for bringing me up here, it's fantastic\" - and it really is!When we got to the end of the gorge we parked up and managed to fit in a 90 minute \"trudge\" through the snow. If you stuck to the main paths it was okay but go slightly off to the side and you sank up to your knees in the snow, so we both agreed that we'd go looking for snow shoes this week so that we can go back and head out further. It was quite fascinating (to me at least) that in places where something had made a hole in the snow it was actually blue inside and so pretty. And \"blue\" definitely beats \"yellow\" as in \"never eat the yellow snow\" (dog pee)! When we got back from our walk we stopped off and had a glass of mulled wine but we really couldn't hang around too long (a) because of the curfew and (b) because when the sun went behind those mountains it got cold and dark really quickly!Eerily quiet!Don't go off piste!On the way back we just had time to stop in at Picard, the nicest frozen food store around here, where we picked up \"truffled mashed potatoes\" and ice cream to take home. Isabelle kept saying how much she'd enjoyed herself. I think she's frustrated actually because she has a very stressful job (she's the main breadwinner) and would like to get out and do things during her time off but the kids aren't interested and sadly neither is her husband - although he's a really nice guy. Oddly enough as we were walking back to the car we were both saying how we often don't feel like we've achieved anything. We both cook and clean and keep our homes up but rarely feel like we achieve anything other than the mundane stuff. Maybe other people feel like that too, I don't know, but I sometimes get this odd feeling that I'm just \"marking time\" somehow and I don't like it. Maybe if we keep plugging away at the walking it will help us both!When I'd made dinner I saw that Shrek was on TV so André and I sat and watched it. Gosh Eddie Murphy was wonderful as Donkey! I remember one time switching the DVD over to Spanish to see how the Spanish Donkey handled it and I have to say he was also brilliant. In any case André and I had a good laugh. After that Bill Nighy was continuing his documentary series on the world's most beautiful railway journeys and in this episode he was in Sri Lanka, and more specifically Kandy. Gosh that brought back some memories. While not being able to travel hasn't bothered me too much, and goodness knows I've saved an absolute fortune because I haven't been able to take any trips, I must admit I'm quite looking forward to when this bloody pandemic is over and I can scratch the itch that is the travel bug once again!"},
{"title": "Not much going on here!", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2021", "text": "The French Prime Minister spoke to the nation tonight to announce an extended curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. throughout the entire country as from Saturday in order to try to bring the covid numbers down further. The situation will be reviewed again in two weeks and there have been rumours of weekend lockdowns being introduced or even another total lockdown if the new variant covid continues to gain ground. André was saying that they are trying to discourage people from socializing for an apéro before the 8 p.m. curfew so that's why they've extended the curfew to 6 p.m!\"Due to the new lockdown, exceptionally 'apéritif' timehas now been brought forward to 9 a.m.\"!I told him if they do introduce weekend lockdowns it'll be just me and him and won't it be fun spending time discussing politics together (not - we have very different political views)!On Tuesday night we got our first real snowfall of the season - about eight inches I would guess - but by the next morning temperatures had risen enough to have thawed most of the snow on the roads, but still leaving great pools of slush! Great fun! I was leaning out my bathroom window watching the snow falling when I noticed paw prints that had me somewhat intrigued, so André and I were trying to think of an animal that has four linear legs that \"hops\" about half a metre every fifth step! I don't know - the gaps between the sets of prints had me intrigued, or could it just be that covid isolation is getting to me!I guess maybe I am getting bored since little things seem to amuse me at the moment. My sewing teacher sent our group a picture of a car covered in heavy snow and I commented could you imagine getting home late at night piddled out of your brains and seeing that? No? So I guess it's just me then!My neighbour told me about a new store that has opened up selling imported Italian produce so I decided to check it out when I went out shopping. It was bloody cold though (-4°C) and when I went to wipe my hands on the disinfectant wipes I keep in my car I opened up a packet of solid ice instead. I guess I'll have to keep them in my purse for the time being! The store was nice and I'll be interested to see if their fruit and veg have the wonderful taste of the stuff we buy in the market in Turin as the season advances. If so, it'll be a definite \"yes\" from me. After that I went on to my usual produce store - which is also lovely - and yet again I bumped into Chantal - she of the long fur coat and shedload of make-up. This is the third time I've bumped into her while shopping so I might have to change my shopping routine I guess. I don't understand why but yet again she had on six inch stiletto heels and came skidding into the shop through the snow and slush like an Olympic speed skater! Compare that to me with my thick winter boots and newly-acquired Yaktrax! I guess one of us is doing something wrong then! A few years ago we had another colleague who frankly made Chantal look \"understated\" and she was the same. Weighed about 200 kg and always wore stiletto heels, whatever the weather. Of course one day she fell on the ice and broke her ankle and when the work's doctor gently suggested she lose some weight (and offered to get her help to do so) and wear appropriate footwear for the snow she went ballistic. Then she tried to claim for a cleaning lady on the medical insurance and tried to have leave days recredited to her for Christmas because \"everyone else got to enjoy themselves at Christmas and I didn't\"! And this despite the fact that no leave days had been debited from her account because we closed over Christmas. There is a mentality amongst certain people that your employer \"owes\" you so much and these two were the specialists!Much as I like Sarah Jessica Parker, what this picture doesn'tshow are the aides basically carrying her to her car!To add to the winter experience, my bloody heating started playing up again last week. Oh the heating downstairs is fine but the radiators in the large bathroom and the three bedrooms on the first floor started coming on at 10 at night and going off around 6 a.m., and this despite the fact that the daytime temperatures were below freezing. I hadn't touched the settings at all so I figured we'd better get Max to come back out but would you believe it, as soon as I called him the bloody things started coming on during the day again as programmed. I have no idea what's going on here, but at least the house is warm all over again!I've been keeping up with the walking even though I haven't been too enthused lately, and Isabelle and I are planning to go out again tomorrow despite snow being forecast. She's quite keen and since she has the day off I'm up for going if she is. Other than that there's not much going on. Oh I'm doing a lot of cooking and André can sure put the food away (hollow legs I think). I told him if he keeps going like this he'll have to get the doors widened in his new apartment to get his belly through! I finally managed to finish sealing all the windows and doors, putting in new sealant strips on every one. To be honest it wasn't a very difficult job but I'd just do one door then forget about it for a while and so on, but at least they're all done now. And I finished my latest 1,000 piece wasgij - you know, \"jigsaw\" backwards. To be honest, when I first start doing it it's a pain in the butt and very frustrating, but once I've plugged away at it for a few hours and the pieces start slotting into place it ends up very satisfying. Would you believe I got all the way to the end - so 999 pieces fitted in - and one bloody piece was missing! Then I remembered that Jen had knocked a few pieces on the floor so I looked under the sofa where she was sitting and voilà, I found the last piece.

{"title": "Oops!", "date": "Sunday 10 January 2021", "text": "As I mentioned previously, all of France has been under a 20h - 6h curfew for the last few weeks, with 15 département (states/counties) in the east of the country having their curfew extended to 18h - 6h because of the covid situation. I was fairly sure Haute Savoie, where I live, would become subject to the extended curfew when the situation was reviewed this week but somehow we seem to have \"slipped through\" and get to maintain the later curfew. A curfew is still a curfew of course, but I can live with this one (well I don't have much choice really do I)!It's probably the time of year but I seem to be really tired at the moment for some reason, although goodness knows I haven't been doing anything exciting to warrant it - apart from nearly burning the house down yesterday! Well not really, but I did manage to start a stupid fire in the garden! Ya see, I'd been working in the basement again yesterday evening and decided that it was finally time to get rid of some of the paperwork concerning the house we owned in Florida. We bought it in 1999 with a view to renting it out and sold it, finally, in 2003 because I was fed up of the work involved in maintaining a rental that was so far away and I didn't want to have to spend every vacation we ever had in that house. So we sold it. Anyway, yesterday I pulled out the files relating to the purchase and sale of the house and while I will obviously keep those papers, I felt it would be ok to get rid of the files relating to the holiday rentals. Rather than lugging them all upstairs and putting everything through the shredder I decided I could just as easily burn it in the composter at the bottom of the garden, thinking that the ash would be a good addition to the compost. So I started putting in a few sheets of paper and over time it took off a little, although why I choose to do this kind of stuff at nine in the evening, in the pitch black and -4°C I have no idea! Still, it was moving along quite nicely until I came out of the garage and suddenly realized that there was a helluva a lot more flame than a few measly sheets of paper would warrant. Well it turns out that the actual composter had started to burn! I know!!! I reckoned with all the rotting veg in there it was quite safe and never thought for a minute that the bloody plastic bin itself would start to give up the ghost but it did! I had a bucket of water in the garage and put the fire out post haste and with it being at the bottom of a frost covered garden there was no real danger that anything would catch fire but still I reckon it'll be fun explaining that to the neighbours next time they go to throw stuff in the compost!I've been pretty good about keeping up with the walking so far, just missing one day when I got back from shopping so late that it was starting to get dark and I don't like walking in the dark round here because there are no street lights. The other day I took myself off on the longer Tour de Saint Sixt walk and was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't as hard going as I imagined it was going to be. I was a bit surprised though when I was trudging up a path through the woods and a deer came hurtling past me because it would seem that I had taken him (or more likely \"her\") by surprise, rather than the other way around. Considering how much I huff and puff up that path I can only assume that that deer's survival instincts were a bit rusty or she might have needed a new battery for her hearing aid! But while that was a lovely sight it suddenly dawned on me that it might just still be hunting season - which generally runs from September to February-ish and I probably should have had a yellow jacket on even if I was on a public footpath. And then I got to thinking about how lucky I was that it was a deer that had crossed my path and not a wild boar, so I starting scouting out trees to make a possible run for it if a bad tempered boar decided to come running at me. So while everything worked out well and I got a good walk in, it probably wasn't the best thought-out plan I have ever made!That being said, a better plan was put into action today when my neighbour called to check if I was still up for going out walking with her. We set off to one of my favourite little lakes at Thyez and when we got to the end of my usual one hour circuit I showed her the notice board where four different \"fun run\" circuits were laid out. It was odd because the maps were actually upside down compared to where we were standing in relation to the river but once we (she) figured that out we decided to do the shortest of the four walks along the river. And it was really nice, I mean, with all that yacking neither of us really noticed how far we had walked nor how cold it was (-3°C). Isabelle had five layers of top clothing on to my three but we were both comfortable and ended up getting in a good eight mile walk all told (plus a bit of messing around on the exercise machines dotted along the river)!The lake at ThyezPhotographs dotted around some of the  bridges we had to cross!Isabelle trying out the exercise machinesjust before we got back to the car!Our route - the shortest one!Isa is all motivated to keep going (as much as she can while still working) so it'll be nice to have company when she is available. My car has to go in for its contrôle technique (MOT in the UK) on Tuesday and as it's right next door to a sports shop I'm going to go and look for some Yaktrax, which are kinda like snow chains you put over your boots for walking on the snow and ice! There'll be no excuse for not getting out there walking after that will there!YaktraxAfter dinner this evening I saw that there was \"30th birthday\" tribute for Mr. Bean, since it was 30 years ago that he first appeared on our TV screens. He was/is incredibly silly and funny, particularly at the beginning, but what is so interesting is that the real Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is much better looking in real life, very intelligent (he is a chemical engineer by training) and so very well spoken. So happy birthday Mr. Bean, it's been fun!Mr. BeanRowan Atkinson"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 4 January 2021", "text": "As usual, there's not much going on here for obvious reasons. At the moment I'm listening to Boris on TV announcing a complete lockdown in England again, just a couple of days after the same was done in Scotland. President Macron is going to speak to the nation on Thursday I believe so I guess we'll see what he has to say then! One thought that did cross my mind though is that given that there has been significant activity in and around Prestwick Airport (Scotland), it would appear that Trump might be planning on flying to Scotland ahead of the inauguration. The thing is, Scotland is in complete lockdown for the next month so I wonder if he will still go. Even if he does rock up (poor Scotland) I have no doubt whatsoever that he will disregard lockdown rules anyway (see Mar-a-Lago). Hell, show him a rule and he'll show you how to trample all over it right?I was talking to my sister in England this weekend and she was saying that despite all the trumpeting about how smoothly the new Brexit situation is running, the truth might be somewhat different. Her daughter works for Brittany Ferries, which has ferry routes all over Europe, but mainly to France. She only deals with freight trucks and was saying that the truck drivers are doing their nut because they have been given conflicting information about what paperwork they now need to enter the EU. Add to that, Kent has now seemingly introduced a £300 congestion charge which they sprung on the truckers at the last minute while they were stacked along the motorways, so they're not only getting hammered by additional paperwork but also additional, unforeseen charges. In Poole, where my niece works, access to the port is through small back streets so they are having to stop the trucks well away from the port in order to verify paperwork. Talk about stressful! Then today I've been reading about Brits resident in the EU who have been denied access to their flights in the UK while trying to get back home because certain airlines have insisted that their proof of residence in their chosen country is no longer valid. This seems to have been more the case with Sweden, Holland and Spain, but I have to say the British Embassy in Paris have been very much on the ball trying to ensure Brits trying to get home to France are able to do so without hassle. \"Piss up\" and \"brewery\" does spring to mind though. One thing's for sure, I won't be leaving France for the foreseeable future unless something very major happens!André was a bit bored on Sunday so took himself for a drive up to La Clusaz - and he said the place was packed. None of the ski lifts are open but people are doing cross country, snow-shoeing or just walking in the mountains, although he did see a few brave souls actually climbing to the top of the slopes in order to at least get one downhill run in (sooner them than me). He also said the restaurants seemed to be doing a roaring trade in mulled wine and take-away snacks (good for them), but since the car park in La Clusaz was actually full he drove further up the mountain to a lovely spot called the Lac des Confins and had a walk up there! It's one of my favourite spots!Chalet du Lac - picture l'InternauteLac des Confins - pictures Carcalons EnsembleI've been very good about going out walking so far (I'm 4 or 4), even if it is only for an hour locally. As luck would have it, I got talking to my neighbour, Isabelle, the other day and she was moaning about (a) her weight and (b) the fact that her husband and kids never want to go out walking/exploring and she is itching to get out there. So long story short, it looks like I might have found myself a walking buddy. While I'm happy to go out alone, it is nice to have company sometimes too. She is still working so it would only be on occasional Fridays and at the weekend but I'm happy with that. So yesterday I took her down to the lake at Passy and although it was overcast and very cold we managed to get a good couple of hours walking in. It's a shame it wasn't as pretty as it is when the sky is clear but I'm sure we'll go back again! We also had the foresight to take thermos flasks with tea as it was so cold, and by the time we'd gotten back to the car and it had started snowing, we managed to steam up all the windows in my car with the tea. I bet that gave any passing walkers something to talk about!Me looking like a lephrechaun!The view towards the beachThe same shot taken in summer!When we got back Jordan and Jen were at home as Jordan wanted to record some drum tracks with André for their group. They ended up staying for dinner (but had to be home before the 8 p.m. curfew). I had been having a cook-fest the other day so I had tons of leftovers to eat up and it was lovely to spend time with the three of them. Jen was telling Isabelle that after the baby is born she would like to go walking with us and knows loads of places we can walk/hike, so that'll be something for us to look forward to!And finally, I was sorting more stuff in the basement yesterday (I can actually see some progress now) when I came across packs of pre-stamped envelopes in among my ex's stuff. Actually there were several packs of the smaller 20g envelopes (with 100 in each) and another 100 pack of 50g window envelopes. So today I stopped in at the Post Office and explained that my ex-husband had obviously bought them about 12 years ago and could I still use them or did I have to make up \"the difference\" (the price of stamps went up again on 1 January) and believe it or not they are still valid as is as there is no \"end date\" for stamps and I don't have to make up the difference to what the cost would be today! So, by my calculation he left behind around €430 ($530) worth of pre-stamped envelopes, which I have already split into several bundles to share with my kids! Hell, while I'm incredibly grateful I will probably never have to buy stamps again for the rest of my life, just how many letters did he think he was going to write in retirement?Two packs of 100 (20g) envelopes at €1.08 per stampOne pack of 100 (50g) envelopes at €2.16 per stamp!"},
{"title": "Being a human tennis net!", "date": "Friday 1 January 2021", "text": "Happy new year everyone. I guess we all hope it'll be better than 2020, and while you can't flip a switch and make everything hunky dory immediately, like everyone else I'm so so ready for this pandemic to be over! I had a quiet night in on my own on new year's eve, which is just the way I like it anyway. The kids went to friends - Jordan and Jen stayed over with another couple - so just four people there - and André went to Max's house and stayed over - so just three in that group. I could relax because I knew they weren't on the roads driving, even though they are sensible. More to the point, we've had a curfew in France for the last few weeks, so between the hours of 20h and 6h we are not allowed to be out, unless there is a valid reason for it. I'm guessing/hoping, therefore, that there were fewer deaths on the road last night because of it so that would be one positive to come out of this bloody pandemic. There have even been talks about lengthening the curfew in certain regions from 18h to 6h but I haven't heard any more about it as yet. Crikey, if this keeps up we'll be allowed to get up in the morning, have breakfast and a pee and then be told to go back to bed!At midnight I stuck my head out the window to watch the fireworks and I may be imagining it but it seemed to me that there were more fireworks going off than usual. I guess people with big gardens then. I could hear the fireworks in the mountains behind my house, which was lovely as they really echo and sound just like thunder! Other than that I didn't do much. I spent a fair bit of time looking at recipes on Youtube but finally had the bright idea to write the ones that interest me in a notebook and where I spotted them. I have so many recipes I think I might like to try and then can never remember where I saw them! So it only took me how many years to figure that out?Then I got sucked down the rabbit hole of watching videos about scammers. There was a lovely Youtuber in the Czech Republic showing people how tourists get scammed, particularly in Prague. Then I moved on to an American anti-scammer who used to set himself up to get calls from \"Bill Jones\" or \"Jane Smith\" from Amazon or Microsoft to get the \"$500 reimbursement they needed to send him\". Oddly enough Bill Jones and Jane Smith often had Indian accents or spoke fluent Bangladeshi! Anyhow, he would use a fake screen and \"accidentally\" allow them to delete all his icons and files and then try to blackmail him into buying Apple gift cards to the tune of $500 before they would \"reinstall his computer\". The thing is, while they were messing around on his screen he was getting into their computers and deleting their files and/or changing their passwords! In one particular instance he deleted over 2,000 of the scammer's files while pretending to be filling out the required reimbursement form. Incidentally that is how we found out that this particular lot were Bangladeshis because a few commentators translated the cussing that was going on in the background. He obviously loved what he was doing and listening to him laugh while he was playing them at their own game was a treat!Another anti-scammer was named Jim Browning (I think) and who, I would guess, is from Northern Ireland, judging by his accent. I have no idea how he does what he does - of course I don't. I think I'm a genius for being able to log my walks in excel in km and convert them to miles! Anyhoo, he allows himself to be set up in the same way as the previous guy but while he's playing along with them he is also checking out who they are scamming at the same time. One time he saw that they were in the process of scamming a guy in Canada and watched as he eventually logged into his bank account with Wells Fargo, even though he was rightly very wary. At this point the scammers basically created an interactive picture of his bank account which \"showed\" them wiping out nearly $9,000 of his savings. It hadn't happened of course but it certainly looked like it had. So the Canadian guy, realizing that he has been scammed, immediately does what they tell him to do and goes to the nearest store to buy four $500 Apple gift vouchers. Now the clerk at the store queried this and tried to stop him but he was so distressed that he said he had no choice. At this point Jim Browning was able to get through to him on the telephone and explain what was happening, that the scammers had not been able to take his savings and walked him through what he needed to do to block them. The distress in this man's voice was palpable so I'm sure he now worships the ground Jim Browning walks on. He also contacted another lady who had sent $38,000 to \"a company in Thailand\" and when he tried to warn her and her bank she left him a phone message basically telling him to mind his own business. He even managed to send her pictures of the \"Thai\" guy she spoke to proving that he was actually an Indian but she wouldn't have it. That is, until about a month later, when she got back to him and apologized as she had indeed been scammed. So that, as you can see, is how I ended up staying up until 1.30 a.m. last night!In other news, thank you for the sweet comments about my mom's lovely knitting. She was indeed a wonderful knitter but she couldn't sew to save her life. As was proven one day when the zip on my dad's black work pants went and she put a new one in as best she could but forgetting to locate it underneath the little flap that covered it and the zip was white - because that was the only one she had! Frankly I'm surprised my dad wasn't struck by lightening in the crown jewels! Then my dad used to like to take my brother-in-law's old police trousers to use as work pants because they were so comfortable. Problem was, my brother-in-law was quite a bit taller and slimmer than my dad, so my mom cut about eight inches off the bottom (again sewing them up with white thread!) and split the seam down the back, cut a triangle from a different fabric and sewed it in to make it fit. My poor dad! I would have thought he might have been the laughing stock but I reckon all the men were pretty much in the same boat, to be honest!Finally, the other day I went shopping to the Fresh store that I love so much. Just as I was about to walk in I spotted a woman in a long, floor length fur coat, three trowels full of make-up and a bird's nest hair do - she looked like a mobile bearskin rug - and I just knew, knew it was Chantal! You know, the woman who sent my tax information to the tax authorities and who told me it was easy for me to retire as I earned more than her but then went on to tell me how she went to Italy every weekend clothes shopping. Yes, that Chantal! Anyway I tried looking inconspicuous in my jeans and ski jacket (the same as everyone else in the shop except for Chantal) and hiding behind the cauliflowers for a good while because all she ever does is whinge and I just wasn't in the mood. In the end, I knew I couldn't avoid her forever so had to walk up and say hi. And that was when I spotted Mrs. Tupperware, so called because she used to sell - you guessed it! Now I have more time for this lady as she has had some truly sad events in her life but she also never shuts up, is incredibly nosy and indiscreet and bangs on about people I've never met and have no idea who they are! So I introduced the two of them, and ended up becoming a human tennis net stuck between Chantal and Mrs. Tupperware playing the final volley of \"I was there for 31 years and they treated me like shit\" and \"and then I spoke to Marie-Jo and she thought she might have given it to Guy but Guy said he hadn't seen her that night\". Neither of them were interested in what the other was saying, and just talked over each other. And to think, all I wanted to do was buy a cauliflower!Probably a good impression of what Chantal looked like,minus the top hat!How everyone else was dressed!"},
{"title": "Natural good looks!", "date": "Wednesday 30 December 2020", "text": "I've spent a few days offline over Christmas so I'm only just now starting to catch up on all my favourite blogs. While it's been a strange and unpleasant year for most people I hope that everyone got to enjoy at least some parts of Christmas with family and friends. The kids came to me on Christmas day and it was really nice, except I managed to massacre the Yorkshire pudding again. Think I'll have to give up on that one, which is a shame because my kids love them. Jen and Jordan have been looking into the local day-care for the baby and she was telling me that they might be stuck for the month of July as the day-care can't take the baby before September. They are going to take August off anyway and that works out well because the day-care closes for the whole month, so Jen asked if I would be willing to step in for July (would I????). They know I'm not ready to do full-time baby-sitting because I feel having worked for over 40 years this is my time now. But of course I'll help them out whenever they need me, if the baby is not well or whatever. So the plan looks to be Jen will drop down to 80% work and take Mondays off and I will take care of the baby on Fridays so that will mean only three days a week of day-care. Sounds good to me. When I was going through stuff in my basement the other day I came across a bag of baby things that I had hung on to. I found the sweetest baby jackets that my mom had knitted for me when I was pregnant with André, so I washed them and showed them to Jen and she has taken a couple. Now to be honest, they're incredibly old fashioned - heck they were old fashioned 33 years ago, but I kept them and put them on both babies when they were new born for a while. Obviously you can't put them in them for too long but it would be quite sentimental to me to see the baby in one of them at least once!In other news I've signed back up for the \"Walk 1,000 Miles in 2021\" challenge. I want to give it another go with (hopefully) this pandemic being kinder to all of us. Who knows, maybe I will aim for 1,500. That might be pushing it a bit but I'm pretty motivated (but then aren't we all on New Year's Eve)!It's cold and pretty bleak here at the moment so I haven't exactly been knocking all those things off my \"to do\" list lately. But the other night I actually sat and watched a programme called something like \"Christmas at the Castle\" and they were filming at Highclere castle, which was the location for the fictitious Downton Abbey. They have a staff of about 35 and were showing how they organized everything getting it ready for the Christmas tourist season (covid willing - it was, luckily for them). While I have mixed feelings about so much wealth being in the hands of so few people, I have to say everyone worked really hard - including the owners - the Earl of Carnarvon and his wife - and they all seemed to be such a nice, cheerful group. It certainly brings home to you though just how hard they really do have to work to generate the income to keep these places running!Highclere Castle - \"Downton Abbey\"Next week, apparently, they're showing the filming at Warwick castle, which I really would like to watch having grown up just down the road from it. It was funny really because when my husband's family came over from the States for our wedding we took them to see it, and my dad was saying he had spent the last 60+ years living right next door and had never visited it. But then, isn't that always the way!Warwick CastleAnd finally, just when I thought I had done all my Christmas shopping I spotted these masks and just had to get them as stocking fillers. The boys and I decided to model them - I'd say natural good looks run in the family wouldn't you!"},
{"title": "Well at least one of 'em's useful!", "date": "Friday 18 December 2020", "text": "I just happened to stumble upon a programme called Wartime Farm Christmas the other night and it made really good viewing. Obviously in Britain during the war food and resources were in very short supply so the programme had them recreating the ways people coped. Rabbit - which the \"posh\" people had turned their noses up at previously - became a staple, combined with 1,001 uses for potatoes and carrots, because there wasn't much else available in the way of vegetables. They showed them making beer out of potatoes (smelly but good, apparently), using matchboxes to make furniture for a doll's house as a Christmas present and making Christmas decorations out of old newspapers.To show them eating their \"Christmas dinner\" they filmed inside Chiselhurst Caves near London, which provided sanctuary for around 15,000 people per night during the bombings. I found it so fascinating I might buy the book - but then again, since I have goodness knows how many books to read already maybe I should just put it on my wish list (edit to add, it's not a book it's a dvd)!Inside Chiselhurst Caves\"Christmas decorations\"Homemade beerOne of the books I'm reading at the moment (I usually have a couple on the go at once) is called Round Ireland With a Fridge, by Tony Hawks, and it's just as daft as it sounds. On a drunken night out with a mate in England Tony accepted a bet from his mate, Seamus, that he couldn't hitchhike around Ireland with a fridge. Drunk as he was, he accepted. I mean he must have been really drunk because the bet was for £100 and the fridge alone cost him £130!!!! I haven't gotten very far into it but it's well written and very silly. I don't know when it was written but there were obviously still \"tensions\" between north and south and at one point he needs to take the road to Donegal which, apparently:\"... dipped in and out of Northern Ireland, and I was anxious not to find myself hitching in that part of the world. Apart from the fact that I'd been told that drivers rarely stop for hitchers there, I was conscious of the interest a small white container might hold for the security forces. Of all the romantic and heroic ways to leave this world, being part of a controlled explosion with a large kitchen appliance rated very poorly.\" (taken from Tony Hawks' Around Ireland With A Fridge).It's very daft, but I have to admit I'm enjoying it immensely.I saw in the news the other day that for the first time ever UNICEF has donated money to the UK to help feed children. It's not a tremendous amount in the grand scheme of things (£25,000) but I guess it shows just how bad things are (for whatever reason) in certain parts of the UK. Whether or not you believe feeding poor children is the responsibility of the government (it is if the parents can't do so), either way that money was very welcome apparently. But then you get dickhead politician Jacob Rees Mogg making some snide comment about how UNICEF was using that donation to score political points and it wasn't appropriate. Yeah, this from an AH who is apparently worth over £100 million and likes to lie down when he's \"working\" in Parliament. And these are the people who are \"running\" the country? God give me strength!And yes, he is just as much of a dick as he looks!My new oven was delivered the other day but since my old oven was attached to the electrical wiring by a domino and my new oven came with a plug the delivery guys wouldn't touch it so they just put the oven on the floor of the kitchen and left! So that left me faffing around trying to get a plug onto the old wiring and then trying a small mixer to see if I'd got it working. I hadn't, and I was starting to panic a bit about how I was going to make Christmas dinner with an unplugged oven in the middle of the kitchen floor (ham sandwiches anyone)? So as Jordan is off for a few days he came over and soon figured out where I'd gone wrong and together we lifted it into its spot and voilà, I'm the proud owner of a brand new oven, which seems pretty easy to use, having tried it out for the first time tonight. So then I asked him if he could take a look at a couple of electrical sockets which were starting to pull out of the wall. I've an idea they were the original sockets from when we moved in and I guess over time they'd started to come loose. So in a couple of hours he went all over the house and tightened up and secured every single socket in the house. It was such a relief and I realize it's things like this that have been getting me down lately - the kinds of jobs I can't do myself and you can never get anyone to come and do for you. When I told Jordan I'd been thinking of trying to hire a DIY guy for the entire day he said he didn't think I'd get one even for a full eight hours because what they actually want to do is sell you the parts - that's where they make the money - not on the labour itself! Damn, I'm so glad I've got him to help me out. Now compare that to André. He's been complaining for a couple of days that there's a loose nail sticking up at the top of the stairs and he keeps catching his foot on it. So as he was going upstairs I handed him a hammer and told him to just hammer it back down. Bang, bang, bang and it was fixed. Then when I asked where he was going he said \"to lie down because I'm exhausted\"! Ha, I knew he was joking but I tell ya, sometimes I think he's neither use nor ornament that one!"},
{"title": "Misheard lyrics!", "date": "Tuesday 15 December 2020", "text": "I was in a bit of a funk last week. Well a lot of a funk actually. Didn't even go grocery shopping (if you can believe it), so yeah it was bad!!! I know it's normal and I realized the state of the house was getting me down big time. André has been very good while he's here but he seems to have these ruddy great boots that just drag muck through the house every time he breaths out, and as for cutting a baguette, well he seems to religiously miss the board or the bin and all the crumbs get strategically scattered all over the floor every time. I shouldn't knock him because he really has been no problem at all - and I knew it was just a normal funk. What I did eventually have to acknowledge, of course, is that I still want to get rid of so much crap in this house and I really don't think it was fair that I got all my ex's crap dumped on me with five days' notice to \"get rid of as you will\"! Yeah, thanks for that!Still, I just received a Christmas card/letter from my former boss and I think he wrote very well about the current situation (he always had a way with words). They are both British and when he retired they moved back to the UK - to a beautiful place in Edinburgh. I'm pretty sure he didn't want to move back though - I think it was more his wife's idea, but they seem to be making the best of it - enjoying it actually, after so many years living away. It helps that they have more than decent pensions and can come out here pretty much as and when they want (I mean, who else can afford to get \"trapped\" by the pandemic for five weeks in Zermatt in spring without too much hassle (it's beautiful but very expensive)?ZermattHe made the very valid point of just how beautiful Edinburgh was without the crowds, the traffic and the noise, and how nature started assuming it's (rightful?) place again, with birds expecting you to step around them! They found plenty to occupy themselves and seem to be doing okay during this bloody pandemic. Then of course there's Brexit coming up (will there, won't there be a deal)? They were both very much against Brexit and he wrote about how they were trying to deal with the aftermath of a decision they were against and in which they, like me, had no vote. So now, while they are disappointed, they're dealing with it - have to don't they/we! They're even talking of food shortages in the UK, but I suspect there's an awful lot of brinkmanship going on on both sides! I just hope Boris is up to it - it remains to be seen!In other news, the French lifted the strict lockdown today. No more permission slips needed to leave home, we can cross into other départements and so on so it feels, yet again, like we've regained a little freedom. However, we are still going to be subject to a curfew between 20h and 6h, the only exception being 24 December (since that's when the French really celebrate Christmas). That kinda leaves me in the doodah because everyone is coming to my place on Christmas Day and it looks like it'll be an awfully short-lived celebration then, with everyone having to be off the roads by 20h! They're not even giving anyone a break for New Year's so I think my kids will be going to a friend's house and staying overnight. Cinemas, restaurants and gyms will hopefully get to escape from purgatory on 7 January, as well the ski lifts/slopes. It's hard on them getting to miss out on the Christmas/New Year trade but people are being very strongly encouraged to go snow-shoeing/cross country skiing in the resorts. They just don't want the crowds around the ski lifts!Then tonight I received a note from the administration of this région (Auvergne-Rhone Alpes) to say that as from tomorrow there will be free covid testing for anyone that wants it and giving the address of the locale in my town! Very efficient I thought. I'm just hoping I never have to use it!I did get my tree up last week, despite being an \"ungracious shrew\" at the time, so at least that's done. I also got some cleaning done and put away a shedload of things on the bathroom vanity. It looks better already. I think my problem is I want everything done now, so I charge in like a bull in a china shop, wear myself out and then just give up! I think André could see I was in a funk so I told him, \"just look at all these bloody CDs I got landed with from your dad and now it's my problem to get rid of them\"! There must be over 200 left being very un-feng shui around my house and they are driving me nuts because I just don't listen to them. Plus an awful lot of them are country music and I honestly don't know any French people who are interested in hearing someone sing about the farm, the truck, the train or mamma! Luckily André stepped in and said to give them to him because while country isn't really his taste either he said he would have fun going through them when he gets his own place (he should sign on Thursday). I'm so glad because I don't think anyone wants CDs nowadays and I felt bad about throwing them away!I don't quite know how we got on the subject but I was telling him about one time my ex was singing along to a John Denver song - \"and so he talked to the fish in the creek\" - and I burst out laughing because I'd always wondered what the fish were doing in the trees in John Denverland!!! Then I told him about my ex-BIL who used to sing \"home, home on the range, where the deer and the cantaloupe roam\". So then he told me couldn't sleep last night (I know, I heard him roaring laughing and I knew he was listening to Peter Kay). Peter Kay is a very funny comedian from the north of England and an astute social observer (i.e. he can take the piss - albeit kindly - out of anyone)! So, André had me watch this sketch about misheard lyrics and it's hysterical. He might not be that easy to understand to anyone outside the UK but just look at the crowd's reactions. He's a gem!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 8 December 2020", "text": "There's not much going on here of course as we're still in lockdown. Hopefully that will be eased a little on 15 December but who knows. If not, it'll just be me and André for Christmas dinner I guess. I already told him it'll be baked beans on toast (and he's fine with that)! Actually that's a real treat as we were never \"allowed\" to eat that because my ex thought anything \"beans\" was disgusting. My answer was \"just don't eat it then\" but nope, it had to be banned! When I was walking with my neighbours last week we got onto the subject of \"beans on toast\" and they were horrified at the thought of it - and this from a nation that eats frogs' legs and snails. Each to his own I guess. André and I are invited to Jen's mom's for Christmas eve and I seriously hope snails and frogs legs are not on the menu. What the heck do you do? I don't even particularly like seafood so I sure as heck am not going to eat snails! My new oven was delivered yesterday but they didn't actually install it because it needed a \"female\" plug rather than just the wire-in domino that I had. So I ran down to the DIY store and asked what kind of plug I needed and the guy sold me a rather sturdy plug, suitable for an oven. Trouble is, he sold me a male plug, so I had to run back down there and get a female one. But now I can't open the bloody thing to get it hooked up so I'm hoping someone (Dave, I'm looking at you) can enlighten me. I took the screw out of it but I'll be damned if I can get the thing open in order to hook it up! I guess I'm looking at another trip to the DIY store tomorrow! At least the bloody thing is delivered, but it does bring home to me how little I actually need an oven, except maybe for cooking the Christmas turkey! When I got home André told me that my gardener had stopped by as I had told him I had an envelope for him (over €500) so I guess that's a nice sum for him to pick up before Christmas. I'm not sure how much is declared but that's not my problem I guess. He used to come by about twice a month when I was working so I never actually saw him and just paid him when I caught up with him and we seem to have continued that tradition. But good for him, it's a tough job and I'm glad I found someone willing to do it!Then today I got news that a former colleague had died aged 72. I worked with JM when I first came to Geneva in 1980 and he was a nice guy. We had our \"moments\" later on when I worked in HR and asked him to fill out paperwork that we needed (he was definitely onto a scam) but all in all he was a nice guy, and I was so sorry to hear of his death. And then today I read that former England rugby player, Steve Thomson, has been diagnosed with dementia at the young age of 42!!! Damn, it makes you wonder what all that trauma to the head does doesn't it! I'm a big rugby fan and those guys wear very little protection so it makes me think is it worth it? What with that and \"Nobby\" Stiles (England footballer) being just the latest sportsman to have died while suffering from dementia!Just now I received a text message from my friend to say that he had passed 1,500 miles. I told him it would be hard for me to make up another 400 miles between now and new year but after that we could plan on walking together out my way when this damn lockdown is lifted (he lives in another département/state/county) and he said he would look forward to that. Damn, I haven't seen him for how many months now!And finally, I see that tonight's euromillion lottery is worth over €200 million. I've played, but damn, I wouldn't want all that money. I reckon it would be better to have 200 winners but then I'm not making the decisions am I. We always used to joke about winning the lottery with my family, and I actually dreamt the numbers (believe it or not) when the UK lottery started up. I had got all six numbers and saw the last number as 42 or 49 so it would have been no problem to play either, but then I just poo-poooed it. Never again I tell you. But it's nice dreaming about what you'd do with that money isn't it. My brother, Phil, who died two years ago, told me once, after I had got into it with him, that he was knocking another \"0\" (zero) off the amount he would give me if he won so I was now down to £10!! Ha ha, it's a fun dream isn't it. If I ever did win a large amount of money I would sort out my family first but not so much that my kids could ever give up work. I believe you need to work to appreciate what you have - which is why, I believe, so many who are born into wealth are unhappy. I have about seven UK-based charities who would be first in line for my \"Secret Santa\" donations - RNLI (life boat), air ambulance, Red Cross, Sally Army, The Anthony Nolan Trust, Help for Heroes, The Battered Women Refuges, but I would need to find more charities in France. The local food bank is an obvious choice but other than that, I'd need to find more. Actually, I don't need to win any money because I have everything I need and most of what I want, but I sure would enjoy giving it away!"},
{"title": "A language lesson for the neighbour!", "date": "Saturday 5 December 2020", "text": "My neighbour knocked on my door earlier this evening to ask if I had any star anise and cinnamon sticks as he wanted to have a go at making mulled wine. I had both (I've got most things as I'm a spice-a-holic) but it brought back memories of this time last year when we went to the Christmas market in Alsace and got to drink mulled wine while walking round. Making it even better was that you could actually buy hot white wine, and since that is my absolute favourite it was just heavenly - all the more so because of the wonderful aroma. Not that any of that has happened this year of course, but it's nice to look back over my blog and see what we were up to. And talking of white wine, I'm up to almost three weeks without touching a drop and believe it or not I haven't given it a second thought. Just proves, I guess, that opening a bottle was simply a habit that needed knocking on the head a little!When I wandered over to my neighbour's to take the spices she invited me in for coffee and while I was there the house phone went. She made the mistake of picking it up just a bit too quickly because next thing I heard her giving some poor bloke on the end of the line a piece of her mind, saying she \"thought that with lockdown we could at least be spared, just for a few weeks, from having your bloody religion pushed down our throats\"! Jehovah's Witnesses then! Actually I hadn't realized that one of the few positives of lockdown was that we would not have them ringing the doorbell for a while! And yet, when I got back home, my own phone went and since the number was withheld I just let it go to answering machine and lo and behold I get a message urging me to check out this wonderful website (www.jw.org, if you're interested) to \"cure my depression in these difficult times\". Hey buddy, I'm not depressed, but I may well end up that way if you lot don't bugger off and leave me alone!Then I got a message from Jen sending me a picture of the latest baby scan, with a full-face \"can you see me looking at the camera\" image which was just lovely. I didn't say anything but I seem to have also counted six arms but that may just be my eyesight! Still, it was lovely! She then told me that her mom wanted to know if we wanted to go up to a local ski resort called Les Gets on 19 December (assuming lockdown is again eased on 15 December) to see the Christmas lights, so all being well we won't totally miss out on a little Christmas cheer this year, even if it's not exactly a long weekend in Alsace!Les GetsPicture by PeakretreatsI'll have to check though to see if we need snow chains. I have winter tyres on my car but if we also need chains I'll have to run out and buy some as I'm pretty sure the ones I have downstairs don't fit my tyres!On a side note, just a quick shout out to T'Pol to say that so far I've gotten rid of 30 items of clothing. I still have a way to go (and it's getting harder) but three bags of clothes have already gone to the charity shop. When I look at some of the things I put in the bags my only thought is \"what on earth was I thinking\"!And finally, it started snowing quite heavily last night so the snow plough made it's first run out in the village and we had a decent covering this morning. Decent enough to need shifting with a snow shovel anyway. I spent two hours out there clearing my driveway (and starting to clear the communal bits) before my young neighbour came out to give me a hand, followed by his dad a bit later. And I was knackered! We were just about done and starting to put our shovels and salt buckets away when there was an almighty \"crack\" and all the snow on one section of my roof gave way and slithered down onto my driveway. Which was when I let out a loud \"oh sh*t, damn and blast\", and that was when dad said \"and that, my son, is how you say 'dearie, dearie me in English - or words to that effect\"! Time for a little hygge I think!"},
{"title": "Keeping busy!", "date": "Monday 30 November 2020", "text": "There's not a lot going on around here, for obvious reasons. Even though lockdown has eased a little since Saturday, we still can't mix with other people, although we are now free to go out shopping, as non-essential shops are slowly opening up. Bars, restaurants and gyms will remain closed until 20 January at least (ouch) and my various classes are still off limits until then, although the yoga teacher has sent round classes for us to do and I can log on to do a pilates \"zoom\" class if I want to. Trouble is, I don't really want to - zoom just doesn't seem to do it for me! From what I understand they are hoping to get our Italian classes going again shortly via remote - there's not really much else they can do is there but at least they're trying! So since we're still in semi-lockdown I thought I should get my act into gear and tackle some of the UFOs (unfinished objects) that have been hanging around here since forever!So with that I pulled a card table up to one of the sofas in the TV room and finally opened up the \"wasgij\" puzzle I bought about six months ago. If you remember, a wasgij is \"jigsaw\" backwards, which means the picture you see on the front of the box only slightly resembles the finished puzzle. It's a bit painful to start with but it gets more interesting as you get more pieces in. Actually, André and I were having lunch yesterday and I saw him sidling over to the wasgij and try to find a few \"obvious\" pieces, so I'm thinking I might buy him one for Christmas, although who knows if he will ever give it a shot. I doubt it somehow!Knitting bag - finally finished!Quilt - unfinished - a recurring nightmare!Jen would like me to make this bag for her - not even started!Darn it, I have so many things I could be doing (should be doing, really) that if I don't do it now, during lockdown and with winter on the horizon, when will I do it? A friend and I also bought a couple of cross-stitch projects about three years ago, so I pulled one of them out to finally get started on it. What a nightmare. You start in the middle of the fabric with cross-stitch so I stitched in the letters \"O\", \"P\" and \"Q\", but now I've started on the teddy bear in the car it's starting to look like a big ball of knotted thread plonked on top of a car. It's much trickier than it looks!Sorting the thread!There are three sheets like this. Alreadythe teddy driving the car looks more like a cow pat!I've just finished reading a book called One Man and His Bog, which was written in 1986 and describes the author's hike along the Pennine Way in England. It's extremely well written and very funny, but to be honest there's only so much you can say about trudging through 250 miles of bog isn't there!So now it's on to Michelle Obama's book Becoming (I've had it for a year already)! I've only just started it but I very much like the fact that she came from a poor background and made her way in life through intelligence and sheer grit. Of course marrying Barack didn't exactly hold her back either but I sense that she is a woman who was always going to be a success even without Barack in her life!In other news, the oven that I bought just over two years ago started playing up (I bought it 30 months ago to be exact, so no longer under guarantee), so I dashed out today and ordered a new one, which should be delivered on Monday. The old one was a Whirlpool and I have to say I wasn't at all impressed with it from the very beginning, so the fact that it's just conked out after such a short time just confirms to me that I won't ever be buying Whirlpool anything ever again!Other than that, there's not an awful lot new here. We've been keeping the walking up every day, if not all four of us then at least me and one other person, so that's a plus. Then today I saw John's post over at Going Gently reminiscing about Christmases past and what were your best/funniest memories of Christmas? We first moved to D.C. in 1985 after we got married and the Marine Corps shipped my furniture but it took over four months to get there so my then-husband and I spent four months with no furniture. I remember on Christmas Eve we went to the cinema to see White Nights with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines, and featuring Lionel Ritchie singing Say You, Say Me. It was a great movie and when we came out it had started to snow - something that didn't happen that often in D.C. It was a truly magical evening. For Christmas lunch we had spag bol on paper plates sitting on the floor. We had nothing and yet we were happy! Funny how that works isn't it. Another Christmas, when I was just a little kid in junior school, unbeknownst to me my parents had bought me an upright piano and hidden it in the garage at the back of the houses. Now these were council houses (subsidized rental for poor families) and the garages were not attached to the house but round the back and down a sloping road. After I had gone to bed that night they tried pushing my piano up from the garages but it had started to snow. My sister's description of my dad and my brothers trying to push that bloody piano uphill in the snow was like something out of The Keystone Cops but it's a sweet memory nonetheless!And finally, about 10 minutes ago I got a call from my ex to tell me that his cousin, Danny, died yesterday from covid after a four week stint in ICU!!! Bloody hell! The expression \"only the good die young\" certainly applies here as he was one of the kindest, gentlest men you could ever wish to meet. The sad thing is that his wife and family hadn't been able to sit with him all the while he was in hospital and like so many others he died alone! His daughter just posted that when they were clearing out his papers at the hospital they found a note to them saying \"Peace and love, see you in heaven\"! RIP Danny!"},
{"title": "A right pea souper!", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2020", "text": "I'm so glad my neighbour set up our little Whasapp group for a few of us to meet up to go walking. I've been out every day this week and am loving it as I love walking in the cold weather. Today we ended up plodding through the woods for around 90 minutes. Don't tell Mr. Macron as it's supposed to be for an hour or less, but as my neighbour couldn't keep up we ended up taking longer than we thought! It's been cold and sunny, if a little foggy early in the day but that soon picks up and it's just perfect to my mind. And would you believe it, on 19th November I actually passed my 1,000 miles in 2020! I'm dead pleased because it hasn't been easy with all the restrictions. Since I knew I'd make it I sent off for my medal and certificate a while ago - and I'm going to hang the darn thing on the wall right next to the cycling proficiency certificate I got when I was seven!I wore my medal to go out walking with my neighbours today and they cracked up laughing!It's just a bit of fun really but I'm definitely signing up again next year and maybe aiming for 1,500 miles (2,000 would be wonderful, so who knows)! As I was about to head out I mentioned to André that it's around this period that the firemen stop by to sell their calendars for next year and if they did happen to come by while I was out I always leave cash in a bowl by the front door just in case. It's always one of the local lads that knocks on my door and he's an old friend of my kids. So I told him if \"Zoreille\" (\"Ears\") knocks, to take that cash and buy one off him! I think he's kind of hoping Zoreille does stop by because they haven't seen each other for years!There isn't much on TV that interests me at the moment (or ever really) but last night I was watching Saving Lives at Sea, which features rescues carried out by the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Association). They are my favourite UK charity, are self-funding (because they want to organize themselves as they see fit) and manned by volunteers. Well last night they featured an incident where an idiot had gone out surfing during Storm Ciara and got into difficulty. The Hastings' lifeboat was launched and after over an hour searching in horrendous conditions they got word that the surfer had somehow washed ashore some six miles down the coast. All well and good for him, but then the lifeboat had to try to get back ashore during a storm and avoiding an approach to the beach that was known as \"the washing machine\"! It was stomach churning to watch their attempts to get back to land, and at one point a massive wave knocked the boat onto its side - and all this while the men were wearing bodycams and we could see what they were experiencing! Thankfully the boat righted itself and they ended up making it safely to the lifeboat station in Eastbourne. They made me laugh though because at the end they said the reason they were desperate to get back into Hastings was because they knew they'd have a cup of tea waiting for them!Hastings lifeboat!The idiot who nearly cost the lifeboat crew their lives!I mentioned recently that I've finally signed up to Netflix and have started watching The Crown. In the episode I was watching last night the story developed around the 1952 \"pea souper\" smog that hung over London for three days killing thousands of people. Using Churchill's inability (or unwillingness) to deal with this crisis (remind you of anyone?) they tried to introduce a vote of no-confidence to oust him. Britain is often foggy (I'd say that's an understatement) but a convergence of unusual weather conditions and the fact that most people heated their homes using coal meant that the acid smog was basically trapped over the city and many thousands of people died. They refer to these fogs as \"pea soupers\" and at best they are depressing. At worst, as they saw, they can be deadly! Mind you, as André said after having been to Delhi, we in the west have nothing to complain about compared to some parts of the world where you can actually taste the sulphur in the air!A \"pea souper\" in London!The 1956 Clean Air Act was passed as a result of this incident, but even so when I was growing up these were pretty normal. I will never forget one time, though, when I must have been about 13, we had the densest pea souper I had ever experienced and to top it off all the street lights were out. I remember having to walk the couple of miles from the school bus back up to home by feeling my way along hedges and railings in the dark, dark fog. I knew that route inside out, of course, but it was so scary nonetheless! Not that you would have guessed it by my mom's reaction, which was more or less \"oh there you are, what took you so long?\" but then, as Bill Cosby used to say, \"our parents walked five miles to school each day, uphill, both ways\", but I do remember being so frightened! We were asked to write a story about it in school shortly after that. What I wrote was crap but my friend wrote a beautiful short story which ended with \"and a blind man walked me home\"! She went on to become a teacher, as you might imagine!In other news President Macron went on television last night and since the rate of infection is heading in the right direction he will cautiously allow all shops to open as from this Saturday, although attestations will continue to be required and masks, of course, remain mandatory. The big difference as far as I'm concerned is that we can now travel up to 20 km from home to exercise and can take up to three hours to do so. It's pretty selfish that that's what I'm concerned about but .... Then, on 15 December, if things are still going in the right direction, cinemas and so on will be allowed to open up, although gyms, restaurants and bars will remain closed at least until 20 January!!!! I guess it's a start and much as I hate it I do feel he's right to be more cautious this time round, however much the French call him an idiot who doesn't know what he's doing! Frankly would any of you want to be responsible for making that call? I know I wouldn't! He also stated categorically that although the vaccine should be available shortly there will be no mandatory vaccination. Thought as much, although how any (democratic) government could force over 60 million people to be vaccinated is beyond me anyway. Just scaremongering I guess!Like everyone else's I'll be glad when (if?) we can get back to a more normal life and am really looking forward to next spring. That being said, I took some stuff up the garden to my composter and when I came back to the house I caught sight of myself in the window. Damn! The legs of my sweat pants had ridden up over my socks and I looked a dead ringer for Eminem! Ha, I always thought his name was \"M&M\" so I did wonder who \"Einaman\" (as I called him) was that I read so much about in the papers! I put André's baseball cap on sideways and fished out my 1,000 miles medal and André burst out laughing. I think it's time I got out of these four walls before I go completely insane!"},
{"title": "Eeww!", "date": "Sunday 22 November 2020", "text": "My bloody computer seemed to have screwed up my \"favourites\" file today, it was just such a mess to find anything. At one point it seemed to indicate that I had 563 \"favourites\" - no way! So after lunch I started messing around trying to get everything back into some sort of order and managed to get them back in an alphabetical format so I thought I'd just start deleting those I hadn't looked at in ... well, forever I guess. I reckon I deleted about 100 files and now I'm much happier with how things look. Then just as I was finishing up a neighbour sent me a Whatsapp request. She's decided to set up a \"lockdown walking group\" and so three of us ended up going out for an hour's walk together this afternoon. The weather is glorious, if cold, and it was so lovely to just get out there and breath some fresh air!Like most people I have certain blogs and FB groups that I follow. One of the FB groups I got into after my husband left me so you can imagine the kinds of stories that are on there. Today, however, one of the male members of the group sent round a post basically saying \"ok, so you got dumped after how many years of marriage, but what is it you are soooooo thankful that you never have to put up with again?\" OMG!!!! By the time I'd finished scrolling through over 350 comments only about five of them were from \"dumped husbands\" as far as I could see. Some of the comments were so gross I wouldn't write them here but .... The guys tended to write \"she would make a cup of tea and just dump the teabag on the kitchen cabinet\", or \"she always moaned at me about the state of the house, all the while sitting on her backside messaging her affair partner\"! But the comments from the women!!!! \"My ex only used to brush his teeth once a week. When I commented one time that it wasn't fair to his employees he just said he was going to drink coffee before he got to work so they wouldn't notice\". Then the guy that only took a shower once a month, having to wipe snot rockets off the shower wall, the toenail clippings on the kitchen counter (if she was lucky and if he hadn't already eaten them). Another lady's husband was a lay preacher and as soon as they opened the front door he dropped to his knees and said \"thank you God\" and other prayers, but he had to say each one 10 times and each one lasted about a minute. Never mind that she was struggling to carry in the baby or the groceries and that the older children would have to step over his splayed legs to bring their school stuff in. Given that this guy was also screwing around I guess it gives a whole new meaning to the words \"lay preacher\" doesn't it! Oh they were so gross - but the ones I've posted here are tame compared to the worst. Makes you wonder doesn't it. And oddly enough it would seem one of the main reasons that your spouse just had to cheat on you was because you stack the dishwasher all wrong. I was guilty of this apparently so it's no wonder I'm still single isn't it!Anyway, all this to say, I was on zoom with some old friends this afternoon and we were chatting about scam phone calls/emails and so on, and I mentioned the \"die boomer, die\" troll doing the rounds in blogland at the moment. Well it turns out my friends didn't know I had a blog (why would they?) and asked to read it. So under strict confidentiality conditions I'm going to send them the link. Say hi to Janet, Patters and Maureen if you get a chance!"},
{"title": "Not sure how I feel about that!", "date": "Saturday 21 November 2020", "text": "I had a call from my old friend yesterday for a catch up - not that there's much to catch up with at the moment is there. I mean, if you're not going out and not seeing people! G was the girl I met at the hotel my first night in Geneva when our employer flew us both out on temporary contracts. She stayed with our employer for a couple of years and then moved to the World Health Organisation, from where she retired a few years ago. She had gone ahead and requested French citizenship way before me and had her final interview about 18 months ago so I asked if she had had any news. She said not (not that that's surprising at the moment as everything is delayed), but said \"she was slightly concerned about the proposal to make the new covid vaccine mandatory and how it might affect future administrative decisions\"! Say what? I hadn't heard that, but then again I don't have French TV so ... again, no surprise there. When she asked how I felt about that I said I wouldn't like it at all. Heck I never got the annual flu vaccine which was offered free at work because it's just not my thing. Thankfully I've only ever had the real flu once in my life so maybe that's why. So I looked it up, and apparently a French politician has proposed making it mandatory and has received support from several others. When I started reading about it, for me personally, I think the French will have another revolution if they try to make it mandatory and I honestly don't see it going too far. I mean, Liberté, égalité, fraternité starts with \"liberté\" doesn't it!  So I asked G why she felt the same way. She said that when she retired she had been working in one of the \"vaccine units\" of WHO and knew that it took two to three years for the side effects of such vaccines to be known! And I'm with her on that one. So I mentioned it to André (who had already heard) and he said \"yeah, that's why the CEO of Pfizer sold off over 60% of his stock when the vaccine was heralded a success\"! Make of that what you want - and I'm not saying anything negative about it - it's just that I feel it's too much of a new vaccine for me to want to rush to the front of the queue to get it as yet, even if it means continuing to live the way I live for a while longer!https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/pfizer-ceo-sold-stock-6-million-30-percent-compensation-vaccine-2020-11From today's Sky NewsYet again last night André forgot to lock the door when he came in from outside so yet again I told him we could have been \"murrrderred\" in our beds. At that he did his impression of Private Fraser from Dad's Army. I can't win with this kid!There's a big hoo-har in France right now about whether we wait until 1 December to ease the restrictions, because businesses are pushing back, saying that they would at least like to be given the chance to make some money from Black Friday if they can - although I never thought Black Friday had caught on much over here. Well it certainly hadn't when I was in Italy this time last year. Aaahhh Italy - seems like a dream to me now! I know what I want to get for the kids for Christmas so I'm looking forward to being able to go out and get that sorted, plus I want to get myself a chainsaw at the local DIY place before my 10% discount offer runs out. But more than that, what I really want to go out and buy is new socks. Mine have pretty much had it. The thin ones aren't suitable for walking and the thicker ones are all starting to look like this (the legs too)! Never thought I would get so excited about the prospect of buying socks!Picture courtesy of Dreamstime.comI made garlic mushrooms yesterday and as there are some left I'm going to use them up to make stuffed baked potatoes for lunch. After that off for my walk and I'll try to do a bit of sewing, although I really have lost my mojo there. There's bugger all on TV that interests me so I might sign up for Netflix in order to watch The Crown, and other than that I'm back to reading and trying out new recipes. Even Words with Friends on Facebook is getting a bit boring for me now as all I seem to get is a load of vowels. E-I-E-I-O! Pity that isn't really how you spell \"farm\" isn't it!"},

While I was in the middle of the pedicure André came in and asked what I was doing, so I told him I was shaving my feet. His response - \"what are you a hobbit?\" Damn I'd forgotten how quick he can be. When he's on form - which is most of the time actually - he can be so much fun! Since he's planning on going in to work tomorrow I asked what time he planned on getting up, to which he replied that if he couldn't get out of bed in the morning he would work from home in the morning and go in in the afternoon. \"And that's one of the disadvantages of working from home, you get out of a routine and you end up working from bed\". So I suggested that if that was how he preferred working the only alternative occupation I could think of for him was prostitution, but he might need to have a shave occasionally! Said he'd give that a miss - well he definitely will in my place anyway!He's been binge-watching The Crown lately (I must start watching that as I've heard such good things about it) and said that if he watched much more he'd have to start speaking with a British accent. And oddly enough I'd just come across this clip on Youtube not five minutes before. Sandi Toksvig is actually Danish (but lives in England) and did this brilliant clip of how Donald Trump is possibly just misunderstood - in the literal sense of the word!We're into week four of this lockdown and while the government said it would be \"reviewed\" on 1 December they're not giving any indication that much will change then, even though they've managed to bring the R number down dramatically to less than one. Trouble is, I guess, we can't keep going into a severe lockdown then lifting it and having people start taking silly risks and we get hammered again. Maybe there's a chance we might be able to start going to DIY places or garden centres - who knows, because at the moment all of those are off limits. And everyone seems to agree that it's much harder this time round, maybe because we're heading into winter rather than spring, maybe it's because ... who the hell knows anymore! We're just so tired of it!I was doing ok with the walking but just like the last lockdown I resent the hell out of having to carry a \"permission slip\" on me every time I leave the house, being limited to how long I can go out and how far, so the walking just started dying a death here - which was silly because I know how much good it does me, however cold the weather. So tomorrow I'm going to get back at it and start trying to get a few things achieved round here too. Heck, I looked tonight and I've only got four miles to do to achieve my 1,000 mile goal, so if I give up now I might as well give up 100 metres from the finishing line right! I've also been pretty lax about cooking, not making much effort (although we eat of course) and housework too, although again we don't live in a pigsty. So tomorrow, as André is going in to Geneva to the office I'll try to get the house sorted and make something more interesting for dinner!Then today I received an email from the André Rieu group to inform me that the concert that had been postponed from October to January (for obvious reasons) was now being postponed again, but this time until January 2022. So knowing that the friend who was going with me has serious health issues I decided to just write them back and ask for a reimbursement. I don't know what will happen, if they're allowed to hang on to the money for 18 months like here in France or what. We'll see. So I wrote to T and told him that I had asked for a reimbursement ($200). He responded saying he was having a hard time in this lockdown too, had been in a bad car accident (although uninjured thankfully) and was missing his new grandson. And then he sent me another email and said \"you know what, if we get reimbursed why don't we just give the money to a charity of your choice\"! Isn't he great! So I replied and said that was a wonderful idea and that I donated to the local food bank every week and had given them money before so would he agree to that? It'd be a nice gesture (and frankly pretty typical of him)!Then, in an effort to get more forward motion going, I went online and bought the pattern for a bag that Jen had told me she liked ages ago. I seem to have lost my sewing mojo and when I hear about what others are achieving I could kick myself. I know you can't be \"up\" all the time but you've got to start somewhere haven't you!And finally, I saw that our FB walking group has a subgroup aimed at walking to lose weight so I joined up. Again there are no rules and you can go as fast or as slow as you want, but people are getting impressive results. Heck even half a pound a week would give you 26 pounds wouldn't it. Apparently you send in your weight loss (hopefully) to the lady that runs the group (and only she sees it) and she keeps a tally, so I'm going to start logging that in January along with my walking miles again, as I obviously ain't capable of doing it on my own. So with a view to hopefully getting off to a good start I've decided to see if I can go \"wine free\" until Christmas. Admittedly the wine has been flowing rather ... ehhmmm freely these last few days, so here's hoping!"},
{"title": "I think they may have got it right!", "date": "Sunday 15 November 2020", "text": "We've just completed our second week of a four-week lockdown and I see in the news that France's R number is below one - which means the virus is in recession. From what I've heard we're still going to be obliged to stick with the lockdown for another two weeks but if that's all it takes, I'm on board. Oh I'm under no illusion that this damn virus won't come back roaring once we're all allowed out again, and I definitely get the pushback from smaller businesses that have been obliged to close. To my mind though, that is where the government steps in and helps them out. As for the rest, wear a damn mask. It's not much to ask to kill this damn thing off!"},
{"title": "Do they ever just go gently into the night?", "date": "Wednesday 11 November 2020", "text": "So André and I have almost completed two weeks of lockdown together and it really has been ok. He has to work anyway so I just do my own thing and he does his. Yesterday he was complaining that his feet were cold while he was working so I mentioned that I had bought a pair of slippers that you can heat up in the microwave and did he want to give them a try? Ha ha, with his baggy sweat pants and steam coming from his slippers he looked a real sight! I don't know if I mentioned it before but he actually works for the World Health Organization (in one of the units dealing with covid, no less) and when I commented on the difference between what he looked like and what he was working on he just said \"WHO, here to help\"! Actually I was able to help him a couple of times because he has been trying to put together large documents for publication and since that was what I was doing before I retired I've been able to help him figure things out on occasion - or at least stop him from pulling his hair out! This morning I told him to bring his washing down as I was throwing a load in, and when he emptied the pockets of an old jacket wouldn't you know he pulled out an envelope containing $700! He reckons he hadn't used that jacket since he and Lily were in Korea and hadn't realized he still had that cash hanging around. I swear if he fell in a barrel of sh*t he'd come up smelling of roses that one!Then yesterday Max sent me a message to say he was coming over to take another look at my water heater. Found out later that André had bought him some tobacco in Switzerland (apparently it's cheaper there) so now I know how to get Max to come over a bit quicker! He switched my water heater back from the old electric system to the fuel system and when he came back into the house he showed me a tiny rubber washer, about the size of a ring, that had a cut in it and he thought that was where the leak was coming from. All that damage from such a little washer! Anyway, he's coming back over in a couple of days to check it out and put everything back together so (hopefully) that has now been sorted! Then yesterday my nephew sent me a message to ask if he and his girlfriend could come out next April (covid-willling) because flights to Geneva are currently going pretty cheap (the prices will soon go up again if lockdown is lifted and the ski season starts). I told him to go ahead and book because I can always work around them if and when, and you know, it actually lifted my spirits a bit making plans for the not-so-distant future! Fingers crossed!I've been pretty good about going out on my (limited) walking escapades and as my yoga teacher sent round a link to a 90 minute routine I also gave that a shot yesterday, although it's not as good as doing it in person. As I was coming home from my walk today my neighbour's daft old dog came down to the mailbox to greet me, and then started to follow me home. I turned round and very sternly told him to bugger off because he wasn't coming with me - but as you can see he took no notice and just rolled over in the middle of the road waiting to have his belly scratched! I have to say I'm a sucker for that old dog!Playing dead!In other news, about 18 months ago I discovered a US blogger that I quite liked. Her blog was called something like \"adventures with D\" or \"retirement with D\", but the more I read I reckon it should be called \"rollercoaster ride with D\". She's pretty abrasive but I quite like her all the same, and she talks sense for the most part. She had a previous blog which she took down for some reason but I see she's back again now. This is a lady whose father came to the US from Europe as an impoverished immigrant, made good on the American dream and she inherited around a million dollars when he died. With that she was able to buy a place in a wealthy part of the US and start her own business which, unfortunately, went bust in 2008. Her house saved her because she was able to sell up and buy something cheaper. Then along came another business, then another bankruptcy - and she's a real rollercoaster to follow. Last week I thought she'd closed her latest blog down but now I see it's back up again and on Saturday she was going to divorce her husband because \"just look at how messy he leaves the kitchen\"!!! Now (or at least yesterday) she was going to apply for a European passport and move permanently to that country because \"America's a shithole and people are awful and now that Biden's been elected we're all going to have our property taken off us, and if we do have gardens we're gonna be told what we'll be allowed to grow, and the state and big business are gonna be listening in on every aspect of our lives\"! Wow, but you know what D, they're already doing that. Just the other week John over at Going Gently wrote that \"alexa\" (Amazon) wished him \"good night John\" one night and he swore he'd never mentioned his name when setting it up. And André and I were looking at beds on the IKEA website the other day and now that same bed keeps popping up every time I open FB or a news site! So ya see, we're already being spied on and I'm not sure how keeping the orange buffoon in power in the US would change any of that - you know the guy who looks like he's becoming more of a national security threat himself as each day passes!And what is it with these wealthy/powerful/important men who can never let go? A couple of years ago I remember seeing a retired former, very highly placed colleague in my local supermarket pushing round a shopping cart with at squeaky wheel. Now this guy was an internationally-known person and would have been featured in the newspapers, although not particularly prominently, and here he was pushing his cart around just like every other unimportant person. Just like Rudy Giuliani! How did he go from being \"America's mayor\" to the caricature that he is today, having an unintentional staring role in the new Borat movie and then ending up giving a press conference outside a garden centre located between a crematorium and a sex shop (although they would appear to be fitting book ends for Giuliani)!When is enough enough for these people? I know money is a big factor, but when you're a multi-millionaire (or at least pretend to be), don't you have enough? How much more do you need? But I think it's about more than just money for them. It's about power for sure, but I wonder how much of it is about \"staying relevant\". They don't seem capable of just going gently into the night and enjoying what's left of their lives while they still can. Or maybe the thought of walking round a supermarket pushing a cart with a squeaky wheel is truly more than they can bear!"},
{"title": "Relief!", "date": "Sunday 8 November 2020", "text": "It's seemed a very long week here this week. So much sameness and yet different because we've been staying up half the night watching the elections. At least tonight (or maybe tomorrow) I'll go to bed a bit earlier (it's already 1.30 a.m. here)! I bought some lovely meringues the other day thinking André and I would enjoy them, but so far it's only been me!!! \"Luckily\" for me, as I was putting the groceries away I managed to put a knife into a small carton of cream so thinking \"waste not, want not\" I had a rather lovely dessert of meringues and cream tonight - and now guess who's feeling a bit sick!I mentioned to André this morning that my yoga teacher would be sending me links to ongoing classes that I could do at home and would he like to join me? Nah, didn't think he would! Trouble is, the best place for me to practice is in my living room and I think that's where he'll be setting up office as of next week when he's back to work. I'm not sure he'll be wanting to see me attempting to do the \"downward facing dog\" though so I'm going to have to figure something else out!Illustration by Mark ArmstrongToday again I was restless and chomping at the bit to get out so I told André I would run into town to pick up a few groceries. He said that he would like to take his car out for a run too so believe it or not I ran into town and got a bunch of celery and an avocado and he went afterwards and picked up some goat's cheese. If you add in the price of the petrol I guess that makes for pretty expensive groceries doesn't it! Dave mentioned on his blog how nice it was not to have to do a health check because he was off work, and I feel the same - I'm starting to get a pissy attitude about having to take a whole two minutes to download an attestation in order to leave home. It's silly really but I think it's the lack of control which gets to me, although I understand the reasoning behind it. I mean, it's designed to prevent people from going out and mixing as much as possible, so I guess I'll just have to put up and shut up! I did go for another walk today which did me good, although always walking in and around the village gets old. After my \"strenuous\" 45 minute stroll around the village and feeling the \"need to rehydrate\" when I got home, André just handed me a beer. I guess he's got my number huh!In other news, the other week my friend came over with a thank you gift for looking after her house while she was in Spain. It was all closed up initially but has now started to flower and it is just beautiful!It's a beautiful amaryllis - I just have tofigure out how not to kill it!Then after dinner tonight the film Outbreak was on TV. I enjoyed the film the first time I saw it but wondered if the timing of putting it on now was coincidental or not. It's very pertinent to today's situation don't you think. Scary stuff, and just getting worse, sadly!From the film Outbreak!And finally, the obvious closing thought has to be just the sheer relief that the elections seem to have been finally decided. Of course they're not final as yet but certainly looking like it. It was lovely to see people celebrating in the streets today, although I guess there were many that weren't! When I bash on Trump it's not because he's a Republican. I'm more liberal-leaning and would most likely have voted Democrat had I ever got US citizenship. No, I bash Trump because he's an odious human being, his latest statement issued today being just as ungracious as you would expect! So while I doubt that Joe Biden was the best person the US could have gotten for the job, and God alone knows what a horrendous mess he has to try to get a handle on (starting with the pandemic) I, like so many, am just relieved to think Trump and his toxic family will shortly no longer be front and centre stage. It's encouraging that Biden will apparently be naming his covid team on Monday, as that has got to be the most pressing issue, well that and a million others. I can only wish him good luck!"},
{"title": "God I think this guy's great!", "date": "Saturday 7 November 2020", "text": "It's like a bloody roller-coaster here at the moment, but not for the reason you might think. Jordan and Jen phoned last night and Jen mentioned that Jordan had been off work for three days with dizziness and vomiting and that she was \"glad she'd got her ob/gynae appointment tomorrow\" because she was again having contractions! She's not a panicker by any stretch of the imagination (and thankfully neither am I) but I was moithered last night I reckon because she's only 18 weeks pregnant! Bloody hell! Anyway, the good news is that Lily's covid test came back negative, Jen's midwife wasn't worried about her or the baby and the work's doctor saw Jordan and confirmed it wasn't covid either, but did not make a diagnosis. By Thursday he was better and back at work but - and I'm not sure if this makes sense since I'm not a medical person - but his symptoms sounded to me like some of those that can be associated with problems of the inner ear. So then I got to thinking about the (frankly god-awful) music they play in their band at heaven only knows how many decibels and even though they all wear ear plugs I was wondering if that could have similar effects at some point. My ex would be in the living room playing music with his headphones on, I would be in bed with ear plugs in and I could still hear it and he is most certainly pretty deaf, although of course he denies it. Thankfully that is no longer my problem. His gf can enjoy the delights of constantly having to repeat herself and listening to the TV at full blast. Anyway, all that to say, at least we had somewhat \"calming\" news today chez moi!Since the weather was glorious I decided to take Monsieur Macron up on his kind offer of a one hour walk. I walked along the railway line down towards the church, but very conscious of making sure I didn't go over my one-hour limit or further than 1km away from home as the crow flies, (but since I'm not a crow I can't be sure I totally conformed there)! As I was walking I noticed a man a little further down on the other side of the tracks walking his dog about 10 metres one way, turning round and walking back 10 metres and so on, so I reckoned this business about \"not being more than 1km from home\" was definitely getting to him. Ha, when I got up closer I saw that he was mowing a strip of grass running along the side of the railway line! Methinks I might be overdue a new pair of glasses! When I was about 50 metres from home I bumped into the neighbour whose garden backs onto mine. Well, basically most of the field you can see in my header picture belongs to her. So she asked me in for a coffee. When I explained to her that Monsieur Macron said I only had another 10 minutes of exercise time left she just laughed and said \"have you seen the size of my garden, we can keep a distance of about a km between us and then you can skip through the hedge back home\". So I stayed and had a coffee with her and guess what, I didn't get caught! Talk about living dangerously - a bit like the Englishman who eats his After Eights at 7.30! Since I don't have French TV she was telling me that there was a more than likely possibility that the French would extend the state of emergency until mid-February! I was horrified but then as my son explained to me, it simply means that the possibility of maintaining or imposing covid-related restrictions remains within their remit, not that they would necessarily be doing so! Still, at least when Macron spoke to the nation he reiterated that it was his decision and j'en accepte pleinement la responsabilité! Now this is pretty difficult to translate into English because you hear it so rarely, but basically it means \"it's my decision and I take full responsibility\"! See what I mean about it being \"difficult to translate\"!André is getting excited about the possibility of getting his own place and has another meeting at the bank next week. So tonight he's been rattling on about furnishings and decorations and I convinced him to start looking at various stores online to get an idea about what he might need and how much it would cost. Of course what he might like and what he eventually gets will be two different things but it's good to see him so happy. He's been bobbing up and downstairs getting himself a beer, then another one, and then ..... so last time he passed me I told him I'd had a lightbulb \"time and efficiency\" idea and suggested that if he just took the bottle of beer and poured it directly down the toilet it would cut out using him as the middle man. It doesn't look like he was too impressed though!And finally, because I couldn't sleep again last night (bloody elections - like everyone else I wish they were over), I got to listen to Trump's verbal diarrhoea at the press conference. I hadn't realized that all but two networks actually cut away from him after about 20 seconds, but I heard the whole 17 (I think) minutes and lord was it terrible. It was also very noticeable that he referred to Joe Biden as \"Mr. Biden\" and \"Joe\" - I wonder whatever happened to \"sleepy Joe\"! He then stormed out like the coward that he is and I think it was Jim Acosta that shouted after him \"are you such a sore loser\"? After that Donny Jr tweeted something about \"daddy it's time to declare war\" (not sure if that tweet is still up) and then I heard about Bannon \"musing\" about the possibility of beheading Dr. Fauci!!!!!!! Don't those tweets constitute incitement to violence? Dear god, what is this election coming to! Buuuuut shortly after that I saw Anderson Cooper describe Trump as \"an obese turtle on his back flailing in the hot sun realizing his time is over\" and my anger at what I'd just heard just went up in a puff of Anderson smoke. I've always liked him anyway, but now? God I think he's great!Anderson Cooper!"},
{"title": "Meh! I'm ready for this to be over!", "date": "Wednesday 4 November 2020", "text": "By \"this\" I guess I mean the bloody election, the lockdown, the pandemic, you name it. Oh, and I'm sure I'll find a few more things to whinge about if you give me time!  Yet I know I have nothing to be complaining about but here we go again. There's a lack of energy - a sadness - in the air this time round. I suppose having the colder weather here doesn't help and then not being able go out into the mountains when we do get good weather since we're limited to one hour and 1 km from home yet again. Still see the positive I guess, we're almost one week in although how much does anyone think that we will be let back out on 1 December? I'm not sure I'll be betting on it! I think this time though I'll have to start walking locally because I'm getting cabin fever and I can sense it in André too, but then I realized he didn't go through the first 12-week lockdown because he was in Switzerland. He's been a bit \"prowly\" and has indeed taken himself off to walk in the woods a couple of times already. It's kinda sad when the highlight of your week turns out to be going grocery shopping with your mom to Lidl isn't it! Well that and getting out of your sweatpants. At least we had a good laugh this morning when we realized we were both dressed like a his-n-hers version of Vicki Pollard from Little Britain!I have quite enjoyed cooking for someone again though, but he has never been difficult anyway. I bought a \"first night\" gift for when he arrived - although we could probably both have done with laying off the wine judging by the headaches we had the next morning!People have been panic-buying a little I would guess but it hasn't been too bad this time round because everyone knows the stores are staying open. Traffic was horrendous when we first got locked down, with people trying to get where they had to be and back to their families. I'm just glad that Jen is on sick leave, André can work from home and just poor Jordan is still putting in all hours God sends at his plumbing job. Still, his last pay cheque was pretty nice, so I guess you can't have it all can you!People trying to get out of Paris on Thursday night!Wouldn't you know though that sod's law would dictate that André and Lily had their appointment at court on Friday to finalize their divorce - yeah, the first day of lockdown! There was some concern about whether he would be allowed to cross the border but everything went okay for that and within a month they should get their papers. Then on the afternoon he had booked an appointment at the bank to find out how much he could borrow if (when?) he decides to buy a place and it's looking very healthy - as long as he sticks to his budget because there won't be a second salary there to split the bills with this time. Still, he's seen a place being built that should be available next summer, so as soon as we're allowed out again he's hoping to go see a show home. He knows exactly where he wants to be, which is on the side of a mountain called Le Faucigny so that narrows things down a bit and is exactly where this second wave of buildings is going up!Le Faucigny and the Arve valley!We both stayed up half the night last night to watch the US elections - which was pretty stupid really because even now, 24 hours later, they still haven't called it. Then he saw that he had two missed phone calls from Lily and damn it but didn't she just find out that one of her close colleagues has tested positive for covid and she has been trying to get a test ever since - although thankfully not suffering any symptoms at the moment (and hopefully never). They hadn't seen each other in months and wham, they meet up again in court and that's what she finds out. More worryingly I saw that my ex has posted on FB that a lovely cousin of his is in hospital and on a ventilator??? I haven't seen D for years, of course, but on their 20th wedding anniversary they threw caution to the wind and treated themselves to a trip out to see us. We had a great time as they are such a lovely couple. God I hope he makes it through this. So no, seeing what other people are going through, even at a distance, makes me realize that I have nothing to whinge about. Two-by-four to the head duly applied!"},
{"title": "And here we go again!", "date": "Thursday 29 October 2020", "text": "As we suspected would happen, President Macron confirmed a new, initial, four-week lockdown starting tomorrow. From what we know so far it will be pretty similar to the previous one. We will, yet again, need a time-stamped attestation to go out; exercising allowed for only one hour a day, one time, and within 1 km of our homes (good job I went walking yesterday then); and going out for \"essentials\" only, although what is now considered \"essential\" will apparently be defined today by the Prime Minister. The difference so far this time around is that schools will remain open and people in most (essential?) industries will be allowed to continue to work. Poor André has to cross the border tomorrow to sign his divorce paperwork, and then in the afternoon he has an appointment in France at the bank. I'm assuming the court case to sign his divorce would be considered an \"essential\" activity, but who knows about the bank appointment. Problem is, he still has Swiss plates on his car so will almost certainly get stopped both at the border and running around here in France while trying to get his paperwork in order (which will allow him to change his plates). So I guess he should expect a bit of \"hassle\" in the coming days!That being said, when he moved back into France we put my address down as his temporary home, even though he has been staying at his brother's these past few months. To me it made more sense to put my address because he spent over 20 years living in this village and they know him at the Mairie, and also because should important paperwork be delivered for the divorce or his moving into France I would be at home to receive it. So as from tonight guess who's moving in with me again - yep, André! That's no problem of course but it will be weird having someone live here again as I've lived on my own for over 10 years now. There will be pluses and minuses re cooking. I have missed having someone to cook for but then it's been nice being able to just throw any old thing together when I haven't felt like cooking, so we'll see how that goes. It will also be pretty \"full on\" as he will be working from home full-time until further notice so we'll either get pleasantly reacquainted or have each other by the throat by this time next week. I'll let you know, but if you don't hear from me between now and then it will be determined to have been the latter! So with that said, I'm off to see if I can find where I threw my bra the day after I retired! Speak soon, and stay safe - it's getting nasty out there!"},
{"title": "Bad lip reading!", "date": "Wednesday 28 October 2020", "text": "So now it looks like we might be heading back into a total lockdown. I can't say I'm surprised but we should find out tonight when the President speaks to the nation. I was at one of our local markets this morning when I saw the Maire of the commune where we have our sewing club and he was telling me that rumour has it that that's what's coming our way (again)! Not that it will bother me too much if it does happen, but then I know how lucky I am given my personal situation. I was in the local tobacconist's and two employees were having a back-and-forth about how \"if a new lockdown hits this Saturday will she get paid for Saturday as it's her day off?\" One was saying yes and the other was saying no - and I couldn't help but hear the distress in their voices. When you maybe aren't in a great financial position to begin with it has got to be so stressful! Tonight we have the AGM of the Amancy Leisure Associations and I have to go as the sewing club rep. I think the meeting will be short and sweet, with everyone handing over their club's accounts and, hopefully, the commune handing out the annual subsidies that they very generously give each club (in addition to making the venue available free of charge)!When I woke up yesterday morning I saw that I had managed to sleep almost nine hours without a break! Crikey, I knew I slept well but nine hours is a lot even for me! I've pretty much always been able to just roll over and go back to sleep - as have my kids! In fact, I never met any other family where mom and dad had to go up and wake the kids on Christmas morning because they obviously preferred their beds to anything Santa might have left downstairs! I tell ya, if sleeping were to become an olympic event, we've got Team GB right there! So thinking that I really should make an effort to get something done I decided to pressure spray my terrace to get all the accumulated muck off it before the really cold weather sets in. I don't mind doing this at all, but it's quite a faff getting the hose and the pressure sprayer all untangled. Then by the time I've done the whole terrace I realize I'm starting to get very wet, so it's a good job it only takes me around an hour all told to get it done, as by that time I'm just about ready to strip off and take a hot shower to stave off the frostbite!Earlier this week my niece posted photos on FB of what I suspect is their half-term break down in Cornwall and my how those photos brought back memories. They were in Tintagel and had taken the walk up to King Arthur's castle. What really drew my eye though was the most amazing sculpture of King Arthur. I never know how people can have the talent to create such works of art since I don't have a creative bone in my body, but I just love that sculpture. The bridge and the walkway weren't there either when I was last there (I was 15, I think) so we had to climb up and down the cliffs to Merlin's cave rather than take the \"lazy way\" round!King Arthur, with his sword, Excalibur! I just love this sculpture!I couldn't resist including here these photos of André, when he had just turned seven, being picked by Merlin in Disneyland as \"the only person with the magic to withdraw Excalibur from the magic stone\"!Tintagel, Cornwall!If King Arthur actually existed it was towards the end of the 5th century/early 6th century. The castle referred to as \"King Arthur's castle\" was built in Tintagel in 1233, so not King Arthur's castle at all, but apparently the traditional seat for a royal castle in Cornwall!\"King Arthur's Castle\"!Merlin's cave!In other news, with my yoga and pilates classes already cancelled until further notice and the gym also closed down - plus a potential new lockdown on the horizon and another storm looming - I decided to get back to walking for a while as there doesn't seem to be an alternative form of exercise available right now. So I took another trip down to the lake at Passy and managed to get my walk in before the storm hit!The \"sunny\" end of the lake!The storm about to roll in!On the way home!Saint Laurent - the next village to mine!Home!Getting back to the news, I've been picking up the US election news off Youtube lately in order to get just the highlights, rather than the whole caboodle, and I've been watching Obama campaigning for Joe Biden in Florida and man is he good! Like him or hate him, the guy's an orator, and he seems to be having so much fun laying into Trump as the two obviously hate each other! After I'd watched some of his speech, the next clip to come up was from a site called \"Bad Lip Reading\" and it is hilarious. One of the dubbed clips I watched was of Trump's inauguration and you get to hear what they were \"really\" saying (not)! Probably what they were really thinking more like, but those clips are funny. I didn't bother posting it here because it's easy enough to look up, but then I got side-tracked watching clips of Mock the Week and in the clip below you can see the talented British comedian, Hugh Dennis, doing a voiceover of world leaders at the G20 showing, perhaps, \"what they were really thinking\"!"},
{"title": "A few visuals!", "date": "Monday 26 October 2020", "text": "A few years ago I used to follow CNN for US news until I realized I was getting sick of reading about the news all the time in whatever country so I stopped. I also stopped reading a few UK sites also as I think I was beginning to overdose. For the period of the US elections though I've gone back to watching CNN although yet again I'll be glad when \"I can stop\" (as if I couldn't stop any time I want right)? But the other night the CNN weather report was on and I realized they were showing a picture taken from near where I used to work looking out over Lake Geneva towards where I live - and of course it was a beautiful picture. I couldn't find the exact picture but this one is pretty much on spot. While I don't live in the fancy homes right on the lake obviously, it was fun to see \"my home\" on TV all the same!My home is off to the right, in front of the lower mountain!Sadly I couldn't find where to attribute it!By this time I guess we've all seen the reaction to Mike Pence's continuing to campaign even though at least five of his closest staff have tested positive for the coronavirus and despite the fact that he, himself, is the head of the Coronavirus Task Force! What can I say, they aren't even pretending they care any more are they! I guess I really have been overdosing on CNN though because last night as he was arriving in North Carolina for another rally it was raining and he started running as he got off the plane. Me being weird my only thought was ...... oh, they look like Del Boy and Rodney (from Only Fools and Horses)! Time to turn the TV off I guess!And finally, I saw this yesterday and since I'm gullible I thought I'd give it a try. Nothing happened the first time, but I definitely saw it the second time. Let me know what you see!"},
{"title": "Very efficient!", "date": "Sunday 25 October 2020", "text": "I've just taken a look at my walking tally for 2020 so far (I'm keeping track of my km in excel and then occasionally check how many miles that works out at) and would you believe that despite a strict lockdown where I didn't go out walking even once, I've almost reached my \"1,000 miles in 2020 target\"! Yay me! In truth, I know it's not that much of an achievement because I should be capable of so much more, but I decided to keep logging anyway and I reckon I will get there in a couple of weeks! You can \"self-certify\" on the website, after which they will send you a medal and a certificate and you know what, I think I'm going to do it! I think I'll put that certificate on my bedroom wall next to my 25 yards breaststroke certificate, just above the cycling proficiency I got at school when I was seven! Or maybe not, I'll have to give some thought to the aesthetics of it first I guess. While I'm disappointed they weren't all \"boots on\" miles (i.e. deliberate mileage), seeing my mileage increase has indeed pushed me to walk when I wouldn't otherwise have done so. Not that I ought to be bragging about that though because today was beautiful and I should have been out there walking but chose to work in my garden and get my Hallowe'en decorations up instead! Hopefully next year will be 1,000 boots on miles (yeah, I'm going to sign up again). Some people have been just amazing actually and are really logging wonderful achievements, but the only rule is that there are no rules. If you want to aim for 500 miles, or 500 km or even just 100 it's up to you, but I have to say what a lovely FB group it has proved to be. I see some of them are signing up for 2,021 miles in 2021 but until I get my bionic legs charged up I think I'll give that a miss for now!Taken from the home page of the \"Walk 1,000 Miles\" websiteStephen Fry: \"Walk1000miles is an idea without flaw ...,and you might find it brings 1,000 other benefits too!\"\"Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right!\" Henry FordThe French finally got the website up and running on Monday for we Brits to request our residency permits and I have to say after many jarred nerves things seem to be working out ok for most of us. There are still a few people in very particular circumstances who don't seem to be able to find answers to their status questions, but on the whole the French site has been very informative, the British Embassy in Paris have done sterling work, and within 10 minutes I'd got my request sent off and received back my confirmation ID that shows I have done the necessary. I actually only provided them with three pieces of paper so I'm expecting the dossier will be forwarded to Annecy who will then want to see proof of income and proof of medical insurance, but all in all it really has worked well. André is in a different position to Jordan and I in that he only moved back into France in July (the 20+ years he lived in France previously don't count), but once I'd provided him with a copy of my passport (as the justification for why he came here as a minor), he sent off his request tonight and within 15 minutes had also gotten his ID number/confirmation. Dixit André: \"if all admin in France is like this it's gonna be great\"! I told him that was a big item to tick off his \"to do\" list and that he could now begin to think about looking for a place of his own to buy. He's pretty stoked about it and is going to take a few days off at the beginning of November to get caught up with the rest of his admin. I told him I was looking forward to going apartment hunting (and then furniture shopping) with him and spending his money - and it's true, I am. Oh, he'll have to make do with a lot of second-hand stuff to begin with but I know that at the large charity shop up the road from here, while there's a lot of tat, you can also find some great buys too!Finally I actually saw in the British news this week an item about a yodelling competition in the Swiss canton of Schwyz which has been blamed for a huge spike in covid cases in the canton. While there haven't been any deaths (thankfully), I have to admit the visual of a yodelling competition being a superspreader event is quite mind-boggling isn't it. I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere, but I bet you never thought you'd hear the words \"yodelling competition\" and \"superspreader event\" in the same sentence did you?Yodelling competition in Schwyz!"},
{"title": "Well that was weird!", "date": "Friday 23 October 2020", "text": "I guess like most places the world over, we're just now getting hit with the second wave of the pandemic. Last week the government imposed a curfew on Paris and eight other major cities and now, as from midnight tonight, it's also being imposed in Haute Savoie. Well actually in another 38 départements (states/counties) affecting 46 million people. As from tonight, and for the next six weeks, there will be a curfew from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m. with fines starting at €135 for anyone caught outside during that period without the appropriate exemptions. I already received a message from my gym saying that they have been obliged to close down for the duration (again) and I just feel so sorry for them. They're a new gym that was set up by a group of young people so they're getting hit hard - as are restaurants, bars and pubs etc. If I think I've had enough of bloody covid I can't even begin to imagine how difficult it is for so many others! In fact my neighbour came round for a coffee yesterday and burst into tears. I think that's more to do with her marital situation than anything, but I can't imagine being confined with someone you so obviously detest makes matters any better. I've said it before, but damn I'm glad I'm going through this on my own!My friend arrived back from a month in Spain on Sunday, and I reckon it's just as well she came when she did because who knows what's going to happen in the upcoming weeks re borders and so on. She and her sister bought a house in southern Spain so that her sister can take up residence there before 31st December. It was an 18 hour drive back for her and I bet she was feeling the cold when she arrived here as it's turned rotten again. Oh the leaves are just stunning but I haven't been able to get any decent shots of the mountains because it's pouring so hard. It was interesting to hear her saying how cheap Spain is (that's why so many Brits move out there - well that and the weather of course) and how you could have an excellent set menu in a restaurant for €5!! And here's André saying how cheap France is because he eats his lunch most days in the restaurant near Jordan's place for €10! I guess that's because he lived the last 10 years in Geneva of course. Then again, Spanish prices reflect Spanish wages also, and not everyone is lucky enough to have a Swiss salary or pension!In other news, on Wednesday I went out to lunch with Jen's mom and she took me to a relatively new vegan restaurant just 10 minutes up the road from here that served the most fabulous food. They seem to be \"all in\" with the vegan lifestyle, giving yoga and pilates classes, as well as courses on meditation. I'm thrilled to discover this place because they will also be doing vegan cookery classes come January and it's something I've wanted to get into for a long time. They have vegan restaurants and cookery classes in Geneva of course but then again you're looking at Swiss prices, and the longer I'm away from Geneva the more it's brought home to me how truly expensive it is!When I stopped in at Jordan and Jen's the other day I saw that she already had a kind of baby walker/baby seat with wheels in the living room. She said she'd been to a local vide grenier which was specifically aimed at selling children's clothes and equipment and picked it up for a couple of euros. There are some things she wouldn't dream of buying second-hand but I'm so glad she's not precious about it and is happy to buy \"gently used\". Heck, my kids pretty much grew up in hand-me-downs (as did I, having two older sisters) as most of my friends had older sons and I see nothing wrong with it. At least that way they were free to play and get dirty and nobody cared that much!I had my car at Ford this week too as I wanted to get my snow tyres put on before the inevitable rush when it has already started snowing and everyone gets \"taken by surprise\". I also had it serviced and the bloody bill came to over €800 (ouch - but that did include new tyres). Crikey, it's a good job I budget for this stuff. While I was there Thiery told me that next spring would be another \"ouch\" moment as although I don't have the km on my car it will be 10 years old and I will need to get the courroie de distribution changed. Thiery speaks pretty good English and he thought that was called \"the timing belt\" in English but wasn't sure. Either way, if it goes you can pretty much kiss your car goodbye as (apparently) the pistons will destroy the engine, so there's that to look forward to come the new year!Since I haven't had much excitement in my life recently I decided to live dangerously and try out the new minibus service that has been set up in the local villages. The \"L\" bus goes from our village to right outside the Ford garage in town and only costs €1.50. Trouble is it seems to visit just about every little hamlet round here before getting anywhere near town, so although it was cheap it was a bone-shaking 45-minute trip back up home. And I mean bone-shaking. I actually realized that 18 months ago I was all over bumpy little roads in Sri Lanka in a comfortable minibus and here I was having my teeth half rattled out of my head back in France! On the way back to town to pick my car up I thought I would try out the app that goes with this bus service but what a palaver that was. Download the app, put a bus ticket in your cart, input your bank card to pay for it, then take your photo and when you see the bus approaching scan the barcode. But oh my word, what a bloody photo! I reckoned once the driver saw that picture he wouldn't let me on the bus. Talk about looking like a battle axe! Still, I figured it out eventually, managed to scan the barcode on the front of the bus and I was all set for another 25 minute bone-rattling ride!My photo looked something like this!In other news, did anyone else see the recent comment by the Pope where he stated that he \"supports same sex civil unions\"? Wow! I know as the Pope he can only do/say so much but apparently this Pope has long voiced his support for same sex civil unions - not marriages of course - but I was very pleased to hear him say this publicly all the same!And finally, I was getting ready to go into Geneva today to have lunch with some friends when my phone rang. When I answered (I don't always, I usually let it go to the answering machine if I don't recognize the number) the lady called me by my married name, so I knew it was someone who didn't actually know me. So then she asked me if I was Spanish \"because you spell your name with 'll' at the end, and 'll' is very common in Spanish???? Say what? I figured she was just making chitchat before moving on to trying to sell me something but nope, that was it. She must have seen my name in the telephone directory and decided to call me and ask if I was Spanish because of the 'll'! So I explained that that was my ex-husband's name and he is American, and in any case I had gone back to my maiden name many years ago. And that was it! She apologized for bothering me and hung up. What was that all about do you think? The odd thing is, my maiden name has \"ll\" at the end of it too but nope, it still doesn't make me Spanish!"},
{"title": "Just lovely!", "date": "Monday 19 October 2020", "text": "When Jen and I got back from IKEA on Friday Max was still at my place working on the heating system. He reckoned he had finally got it all figured and explained to me that there was a clapet de non-retour in there that had no place being there. Yeah, that's what I was thinking too! The closest I can get to it in English is a non-return valve? (I'm sure Dave will correct me), but once that was removed it now seems that my heating is up and running smoothly again. He also agreed that it was better to let the heating system run continually for most of the day on a low temperature rather than have it set on a timer as the system would have to work harder to get the room temperatures back up after continually stopping and starting. So that's where I'm at, although he still needs to get his supplier out to look at the water heater. And talking of water, I asked what the water was all over the basement floor and he explained that he had purged a few litres of water into a bucket and when he picked it up the handle had broken off, so all in all I guess he was having another bad day at my place! The water in the basement is no big deal as it's a stone floor and it dries easily, but I sense Max will be glad to see the back of me at some point (as I will him, of course)!It's weird though because as time goes by I'm picking up more and more technical words/phrases in French that I have no idea how to translate back into English because I never had my own home in England. My dad used to roll his eyes when we were all together because my sister has lived in Denmark for over 40 years and comes out with things that sound like \"hurdy, gurdy, wurdy\", and then I get stuck on a French word and he would say \"does anyone speak English round here anymore?\" and we'd just laugh. It's even weirder because my mom's first language was Welsh so I'm sure he'd crossed that bridge more than once right?Today is the first day that the online application for resident's permits is up and running, and taking a quick look at it, assuming the site doesn't crash, it doesn't look too onerous. André will have to provide a few more papers than Jordan or I because although he lived in France for 21 years, he had been living in Switzerland for the past 10 years so will be treated as a \"new resident\" I guess. Still, he should be able to provide everything pretty easily too!In other news, the kids had told me to reserve 18 October for a birthday surprise. It turns out they were taking me and Jen's mom to the hot springs in St. Gervais for the afternoon! These are true hot springs that have been used for therapeutic purposes for many, many years and there is a slight odour of sulphur when you first walk in, but that soon abates. The springs are right at the foot of the Mont Blanc and with the weather being cold but gorgeous it was the perfect day to go. When we got there Jen told us that she'd booked us all massages (say what?), so she went off first for a \"pregnancy massage\" and then her mom and I were taken to another room for a joint massage session. We had the option to insist on individual rooms but we both just said \"what the hell\" and went in together, although I have to admit it's a bit weird to be getting semi-naked with a woman I hardly know but hey, what can I say. So we got to have a lovely massage also, and then André and Jordan went in for theirs. We spent about four hours there all together and I have to admit it was great to spend time with my kids again. I had forgotten how funny they can be and how they really spar off each other. A very helpful older employee was explaining to the group in front of us that they should take note of the number on the dressing gowns they had been provided with in order not to mix them up. When I said that we didn't have a number on ours he explained that we had been given grey gowns because that meant we were getting a spa treatment also! So André does this routine about \"move over there if you don't mind, grey dressing gowns coming through\" and we just doubled up laughing. The only \"down\" side was that I washed my hair in the shower before we left and only then found out that we weren't allowed to use the hair dryers because we couldn't be blowing hot moist air around. They had also closed down the Turkish baths for the same reason, but everything else was open to us. So I left there with wet hair thinking \"damn I'm going to get sick tonight\" but it was fine in the end. As we were heading back towards home, Jen told André to \"park up over there\" and that was when we found out that we were also going out for dinner. Now pretty much the only restaurants open on a Sunday in France will be the \"immigrant\" restaurants, so the Chinese or the Indians, and that's where we ended up, having wonderful Indian food and all paid for by my kids! What a great way to spend a (belated) birthday!You can just about make out the Aravis mountain chain from the parking lot!The hot springs at St. GervaisThat's not my picture but the little \"gypsy caravan\" barrelsare saunas for up to six people!The Indian restaurant!This morning I contacted the Mairie in Amancy regarding our sewing club and the new covid restrictions that have been reintroduced in order to try to contain the upspike. All things being equal we can still continue to meet, but masks will be mandatory everywhere, with the limit of six people being allowed to meet up at any one time only applying to outdoor events. But as soon as I'd got off the phone with them I received an email notification from the gym I signed up at to say that Ben (my trainer) has tested positive for covid19 and that they would be closing down until 26th October! Looking back at my dates, the last time I actually saw him at the gym was 12 days ago (when I just said hallo) so I will stay away from anyone until this Wednesday as that will complete my 14 days of no contact with him. I'm really glad I didn't find this out yesterday though before setting off to St. Gervais. I don't have any symptoms anyway so I'm sure everything is fine, but I hope he's ok, and in any case I will give sewing club a miss tonight also, for obvious reasons!"},
{"title": "10%!", "date": "Thursday 15 October 2020", "text": "Would you believe it was 7°C (44°F) today and windy and I've been without heating since Saturday! I know, that's what I was thinking! I know Max's company is flat out (Jordan's been working weekends) but thankfully he sent me a message yesterday to say he was on his way over to have another look at it and he still couldn't figure it out! I've been solving the problem by meditating and drawing on that British stiff upper lip (nah, not really, it's called loads of layers and keep moving)! For the most part I can deal with it because I have a couple of small electric heaters and I only need to put a few layers on and embark on getting stuff done to keep warm, but I must admit it's \"nippy\" (to say the least) in the mornings. Well after yet more cussing Max ended up face down inside the bowels of the \"mechanical bits\" of the central heating/hot water system and suddenly I realized the radiators were coming on. I called down to the basement to tell him and he said that couldn't be right, but when I confirmed to him that they were, indeed, heating up he figured that somehow the water heater pump had been hooked up to the central heating pump and the fact that he had turned the water heater off on Saturday because of the leak was what had caused the central heating to stop working! So he has to come back and redo that and bring the supplier back with him to sort out the leak in the water heating system. I also need them to look at the timing programme because while I had heat from 6 a.m. this morning until around about 9 a.m., it didn't come back on again until 6 p.m. and went off again around 8 p.m. so I think they really have to reset the whole bloody thing back to the manufacturer's settings and start again. In the end I thought \"sod it\" and for the first time in 10 years I lit a fire in my fireplace and have had that roaring away for the past three hours. I checked online first about the \"no more open fireplace edict\" (I'm still waiting for the quote to get the cassette insert for the fireplace), but it seems that we are no longer allowed to use open fireplaces as \"our primary source of heat\", and since my fireplace isn't my primary source of heat (hardly, right, if I haven't used it for 10 years), I got a rather nice fire going this evening and very pretty it was too. All I was missing was a couple of bottles of wine and some good company!Today I had my pilates class in the morning and I have to admit that it is probably my least favourite class, although I do get what it's trying to achieve. Finally, after four weeks of consistent attendance at my various classes, I'm starting to enjoy them more - or \"get the point\" of it all I guess. I know myself well enough that it usually takes about three weeks of \"oh bloody hell, I really don't want to do this\" before I get to this point and begin enjoying it and, hopefully, seeing some progress. I say \"progress\" because my weight has barely moved but I definitely no longer ache after the classes and I actually feel rather good - which is the whole point really, I suppose. Losing weight would be great, but feeling well and able to do whatever it takes to live my life easily on my own is more the point. The picture below pretty much sums up my whole logic of why I'm doing all this! I'm still making it to the gym at least once a week, although I suspect Dave is going to leave me standing on that one, but I'm already at the point of wanting to push myself a bit harder, so I guess consistency is starting to pay off!After pilates I dropped some stuff off at the recycling plant and then dashed off to buy a new gas bottle as the old one just ran out. I remember last year - 1 July to be precise - was when I first hooked up this gas bottle. It was the night of the horrendous storm which knocked out my electricity for 24 hours just three days before the wedding, the same day as my family were flying in from England and with all my shopping for 10 people for 10 days loaded up in my slowly-defrosting freezers, and my gas cooking bottle decided to conk out. It was laugh or cry at that point (thankfully I laughed) but I would say that bottle lasting from 1 July 2019 to 14 October 2020 wasn't bad going for €34 was it!After that I headed out to do my weekly shop. While I was at the supermarket I wanted to get a tape measure for my sewing kit because I seem to have lost mine, but when I looked at the cheap little retractable tape measures for €6.20 I thought I'm not paying that! About a km up the road is a small \"sell everything\" type of shop and I got the exact same tape measure for €1.50! Pretty much everything is cheaper at that shop, so when André's closer to getting his own place I think that will be where we will head to first to get the basics for his apartment. Talking of which, he and Lily have an appointment at court to sign off on the divorce on 30 October (how sad is that!) and then in the afternoon he has an appointment at the bank to look into how much he can borrow to buy his own place. I'm going to go with him as he's not used to French banking, after living in Switzerland for the last 10 years, but it'll be interesting to see just what he can afford on his own!I'm in the mood to cook at the moment, so if I have time, tomorrow I will run out to the large Asian store near here to get everything I need to make mapu tofu. My mouth just waters when I see some of these recipes, but when I get looking at too many I end up making none of them so I'm going to try to go with just one and actually make it. After that I'll pick Jen up as she is off this week and wants to go to IKEA in Geneva as she has her eye on a few things from the catalogue I picked up last week. I'm happy to go back anyway as I may well buy a few fittings to start the business of changing my bathroom sinks and buying a hand basin for the toilet, but I guess it'll depend on how much we can fit in the car. Haven't we all done that - gone to IKEA with a a car the size of a mini and come out with enough stuff to fill a small moving van? Or bought the biggest Christmas tree we could find and then wondered how the hell we were going to get it home? Or is that just me?Anyway, in a rather serendipitous coincidence, I received a notification two days ago from a local DIY store called Bricomarché saying that as I'd now spent over €500 in the last however long (it must have been over a long period as I hardly ever go there), they were offering me 10% off everything in the shop bought on one ticket and within three months so I may well go back there and look for bathroom fittings if I don't find what I want at IKEA. To my mind many of the DIY stores round here are much of a muchness, but I have always been really happy with the service I get at Bricomarché. In fact a few years ago I wrote to their head office to commend the staff at my local store saying that they may not be the biggest store round here but they were certainly the most helpful. Credit where credit is due I guess! If I do decide to use this 10% I will probably get quite a bit of the bathroom stuff from there and a chainsaw, as I have loads of wood downstairs in my basement but once the new cassette is installed in the fireplace I will be limited to smaller logs. I guess it's right what they say isn't it, a woman's work is never done!Oddly enough, I can't tell if this picture should be attributed toMike Peace or Mike Pence (do you think he has a side gig going already for when he gets kicked out?)"},
{"title": "Feeling a bit blah at the moment!", "date": "Monday 12 October 2020", "text": "I know it's completely normal to feel down sometimes, especially in these difficult times, but I really don't like it and get annoyed at myself actually because I realize just how good I have it. I know - whaddaya gonna do? Well I know what I need to do and that's get out and start walking in such perfect weather - cold but sunny, so perfect walking weather. It's hard to give yourself a virtual kick up the butt though isn't it. Talking of cold, I finally got through to Max that he needed to come and look at my heating system/water heater as it is still leaking. He came over on Saturday morning with a new part, but four hours later he was cussing and swearing and he now reckons that there is a fault in the water heater and he's going to need to have the supplier come out and take a look at it. As luck would have it, when he switched me over to the fuel water heating system I hung on to my electric heater as it was only a year old and I reckoned Jordan and Jen might take it if/when they buy a fixer-upper. So now my water heater has been switched back to the electric heater but, since Saturday I no longer have any heat at all in my radiators! Bloody hell! As it stands right now I have two electric heaters running and hopefully Jordan will be showing up any minute now to take a look at the heating system. I suspect it's just a minor thing but since that stuff is all Dutch to me (as yet), I'd rather have him look at it than have me potentially screw it up!On Friday I drove into Geneva for my two-yearly mammogram (aren't they fun ladies?) but I have to say I don't find it the least bit painful and I had the lovely South African lady doctor I had the last two times who is a blast. Last time she was telling me she was hoping to take a solo trip through Morocco in a camper van and maybe even chuck it all in and hit the road for a couple of years to enjoy her freedom. Well that didn't go according to plan since the two young Scandinavian women were murdered by \"terrorist\" thugs while out camping in the Atlas mountains (in Morocco) shortly before she went to book and as of Friday at least she still hasn't chucked it all in. She had planned to go back to South Africa for a vacation this summer too but obviously with the pandemic that was cancelled. She said she was lucky that Air France refunded the international portion of the trip but the domestic flight on South African Airways was lost since they have gone bust (I didn't know that)! Anyway, she told me that everything looked fine and she would send my results to my gynae the same day. And I was struck once again by just how luxurious this clinic is. It was where I had Jordan and it really was a pleasure to be in such a nice place, but then as I've mentioned before, it reflects the difference between Swiss health care prices and French prices I guess! After that I drove on to IKEA to have a look at the bathroom set-ups and it was actually ok. Not too crowded at all with everyone wearing masks and plenty of hand sanitizer available all over the shop. I held the lift doors for two women as I was going back down to the parking lot and the older woman and I laughed when we both took off our sweaters in the lift because the whole shop was just too hot. Or maybe as the lady said \"ain't hormones wonderful\"!On Tuesday night I stopped in at the food bank in town as I had a case of goods to drop off. One of the ladies there knows I'm English and has started keeping English-language books for me and on Tuesday night she came running over with six nursery rhyme books for me! And I'm thrilled. Ok I won't be reading nursery rhymes to anyone anytime soon but it has been lovely just sitting looking through some of the old stories anyhow! Then on Sunday I stopped in at Jordan and Jen's as I wanted to give Jen her birthday present and have the three of them sign a birthday card for Ammy (grandma in the States). I thought it was sweet that Jen printed off a picture of her latest baby scan with the baby \"waving\" and put that in with the card. She was telling me though that her doctor is already talking about signing her off sick as she has been getting contractions caused by stress!!! Apparently they had another \"incident\" last week where they had to call security in. She works in a psychiatric hospital and some of the patients can be aggressive and even violent, so I guess if they can't take her out of that environment for the duration of her pregnancy she'll be signed off as a precautionary measure! Then she asked if she could ask me a favour (of course). When the baby is here she wants to drop down to working 80%. She would be allowed to take Mondays off and \"would I be willing to take care of the baby on Friday mornings until Jordan gets home at lunchtime?\" That way they could put the baby down for a place in the local crèche just three days a week. Would I??? Damn, I thought they'd never ask! I wouldn't be willing to look after the baby full-time because (a) I live too far away and (b) I've worked full-time for 40 years and this is finally my time and she/they absolutely agree with me on that. That being said, I told her I'd be free on Wednesdays and Fridays and obviously any time they needed help for whatever reason. I think it was a relief to her because she was saying that taking the baby to a sitter would cost them around €600/month and the crèche would be around €200 - probably less - and she was more inclined towards the crèche because she had heard horror stories about some sitters. Now I know I'm biased because my neighbour took care of Jordan and it was a wonderful experience all round but I think all things being equal I'm more in favour of a crèche too. That being said, heck, you can sure tell the difference between socialist France and non-socialist Switzerland. I found a place for André in a Swiss crèche when we moved back here in 1989 and even then it was over 700 Swiss francs a month. The going rate when I left work was around SF 2,000/month and I've seen up to SF 3,000/month too, so €200 doesn't seem that much to me!As I've been sitting here typing this I've just listened to Kamala Harris' speech at the SCOTUS hearing and I have to say she impresses me more and more, putting it out there and saying it like it is. I also recently saw a few Youtube clips of Pete Buttigieg and damn he's impressive too - and young - and while it didn't work out for him this time round I definitely reckon he's got a future in politics that's for sure!And finally Facebook reminded me the other day that this time three years ago I was in Rhodes with Steve! Damn, that brings it home to me that he's been dead over a year now. I guess that might have had something to do with my feeling down the past couple of days!That's actually Steve in the left hand side of the picture talking to an older couple in a restaurant in Lindos. To my mind they had the perfect set-up. He lived in the south of England and she lived in Scotland and they used to fly up and down the country to see each other regularly and head off on holiday together a couple of times a year. Had he lived, I could have seen that kind of relationship working for Steve and me. We were both very independent and neither of us had any interest in living with someone again, but we got along so well. Sad really, I wish he had had many more years to enjoy his retirement!And talking of FB, I've mentioned before that I play Words with Friends with quite a few people. It seems to be etiquette that you don't chat back and forth with people you don't know, except I do chat occasionally with a chappie in New York. Anyway, a couple of days ago, \"handsome\" popped up and asked me to play a game. Immediately I get kinda suspicious because mostly I'm playing against women, so I'm already expecting something funny. Well sure enough after a couple of moves I get a message \"Where are you located? Are you married? Do you have kids?\" etc. and I'm thinking \"oh oh, here we go again\", and sure enough today I got the old \"Can we try communicating on Whatsapp as it's easier?\". You may remember I mentioned the guy in Texas who wanted my email so we could \"get to know each other better\". It's happened about four times now, so I sense I'll be blocking someone later. Judging from the things women have said in some of the groups I'm on I'll either be getting a request for money at some point or receiving an unsolicited dick pic! Yeah, that'll be fun!One of the ladies made me laugh because she got the dick pic and this is what she sent back to the guy!Pure genius huh!"},
{"title": "Autumn's cancelled due to lack of interest!", "date": "Saturday 3 October 2020", "text": "2020 has been such a weird year I guess somebody forgot to mention to Mother Nature that autumn is supposed to come between summer and winter! But nope, it looks like we're heading straight into winter just for the hell of it! Or at least, that's what it looks like according to the weather forecast for the next two weeks. Rain, rain, and guess what, more rain! That being said, at the moment it isn't raining all day long. For instance I've been able to get out and work in the garden for about an hour each day so it's liveable, but in the evenings it pours down and right now the wind is howling! Oh well, there's nothing we can do about it is there!Today I decided to take a run out and have a look at a few bathroom supply places, and to be honest I haven't been very impressed. The two I went to are the places that Max deals with with his company and while they're expensive I'm told they are quality suppliers. Hmm, I'm not so sure though! A bit too pricey and not appealing enough for my taste maybe! On the way home I thought I'd take a trip out to a big DIY place here called Leroy Merlin and then I had the inspired idea to maybe take a trip out to IKEA, Geneva, next week and have a wander round. I don't know about you but I really like IKEA. I think they have bright, fun and well-coordinated stuff and while I'm not too keen on their sofas, everything else seems to hit the spot for me, at far lower prices than the places I went to today. There's no rush but if I do find anything I like there, I would have to order it from IKEA, Grenoble (France) as I couldn't get the €€€€€ amount of stuff I would need to order through the border duty-free. Still, if I do go ahead with IKEA Grenoble I'll have them deliver it too! I did that when my husband moved out (he took our bedroom set) so I had them deliver it all and carry it upstairs for me. After that, it was assembly time (I did it all on my own). I was telling my old boss that I probably would have gotten it assembled quicker without the wine but he told me that IKEA and wine go hand in hand just like IKEA and meatballs (he's Danish, so he should know)! Still, I'm in no rush anyway, and once I narrow my selection down I might get Jordan to take a trip out there with me (I'm sure he'll be thrilled)!In other news I've almost finished the \"sunbonnet Sue\" baby quilt I started a year ago! I guess it was wishful thinking, but I had wanted to make a baby quilt for ages so I downloaded three pictures off the internet, cut and quilted all the little individual pieces and really had fun doing it. I started sewing the border on it last Monday but wasn't happy with it, so what you see here is just tacked on, but that'll soon get done. I would also like to sew a photo of Jordan and Jen on the back of it, but I haven't got round to it yet!You can't really see it from the picture but things like the skis, the leaping fish, the cow, the lollipop and the dog are like buttons that I sewed on, and if Jen decides to use it for the baby (rather than just for decoration), those will have to come off, but that will be up to Jen!On another note, I saw in the newspaper today a story about a young woman (university student no less) who had had a few drinks with her mates when one of them bet her she wouldn't fit her bum in the dryer (as you do)! Yeah, that's what I was thinking too! So apparently she managed to get her legs and hips into the machine, crossed her legs at the knees and got stuck! I mean, who couldn't have seen that coming? So her mates ended up having to call the fire brigade out, and they spent 20 minutes freeing her from the dryer while her supportive mates filmed the whole episode. Now quite a few comments were of the type \"she should be ashamed of herself, wasting their time like that\" and so on, but the firemen were actually laughing and I got a good giggle out of the video too. Hell, if you don't do stuff like that when you're young, when do you do it? I'm sure it's a story she'll be able to dine out on for a good few years!This young woman got her head stuck in a drying rack.I don't think the fire brigade were needed this time though!Which reminds me (of course it does, I couldn't let this one pass could I)? When I was 16 I went hiking/youth hostelling with my friends in Cornwall. It was a hot summer's night and my friends and I spotted a bunch of other young people sitting round a camp fire on the beach. They invited us to join them and someone offered me a glass of scrumpy which, little did I know, is pretty lethal Cornish cider. After a couple of glasses of that we all started packing our things up when I commented to one of the young lads that I was feeling rather hot. And that was when he pointed out that I was sitting on the embers of the camp fire that they'd just kicked sand over! So no more scrumpy for me then right! But oh to be young and foolish again!"},
{"title": "I'd want my money back too!", "date": "Wednesday 30 September 2020", "text": "Last week \"the guy\" came out to my house to see what kind of cassette would be best suited to insert into my fireplace. Well there wasn't much choice as it turns out. I don't want to knock out the fireplace and put in a free-standing stove (all the more so since I only had my floor redone a few months ago) and the actual opening in the chimney is not big enough to take the majority of the models available, so I'm going to have to go for a smaller, wood-burning rather than granule-burning cassette, but I'm fine with that. I'm just waiting for the quote and then having that installed will be more upheaval to look forward to this winter! The good news is that the French government are apparently offering a €1,000 incentive for this kind of work (i.e. sealing in an open fireplace), and I can take a tax deduction for it, so that sweetens the pill somewhat. Then this Friday I'm going to start the initial run around looking at bathrooms/showers as both my bathrooms are in a pretty sad state. Even though Jordan is willing to install everything, I'm more nervous about the cost of that project but they really do need a major overhaul so I'll have to get started on it some day. After that I reckon that'll have to be it for quite a while as the money tree will need to go into hibernation for a looonnngg time!Sometime ago I bought sealant strips to replace the badly worn-out window sealant on some (most?) of my doors and windows and finally got round to having a bash at the window in my bedroom this week. I figured it made sense to actually get this stuff done before winter right? Well I had the strip all meticulously applied and then when I went to close the window it wouldn't shut. I thought shutting the window would squash it down somewhat but nope, there was nothing doing as it was too thick. So I had to take it all off and put another, thinner type of foam insulation in instead. It doesn't look great but it's an improvement over what was there previously. So I just need to seal another how many then to get them all done? Plus I need to get a few light fixtures replaced, and then I realized it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to start re-sealing some of the wooden surrounds on my windows as a lot of that could do with a makeover too. Gosh, there's always something to do isn't there, but at least with the colder weather coming along I should hope I will get my backside into gear and get some of it done!I read in the press the other day that Michael Schumacher's wife has moved him from their property in Geneva to another property they own in Spain. Poor Michael! He spent most of his professional life competing in an extremely dangerous sport and look what happened to him in a \"simple\" skiing accident! I very much respect his wife for keeping his circumstances/physical situation private though - she and their children have been amazing! But seeing him mentioned in the press along with a photo of their Geneva home, I realized that it was indeed true that the Schumachers bought that house off the father of a friend of my son, André. André had spent some time there and was dead impressed - their own private beach, a helicopter landing pad in the grounds, plus the massive house of course, and I remember him saying that when they put it up for sale (something to do with \"tax evasion in the UK/prison time\"!!!!) a representative of Michael Somebody-or-other had come to look at it. Now somewhat stupidly I reckoned it was Michael Jackson, but nope, it was Michael Schumacher and seeing the photo of the house in the news this week made me realize that that was where André's friend had lived up until maybe 18 years ago! (I bet they never worried about wind-proofing the windows huh?)!Michael Schumacher's house in Gland, Switzerland!Then on Monday night we had our second sewing club meeting and had to take over the kitchen as well as the sewing room in order to spread ourselves out sufficiently. I got chatting to a lady called Marysette - who had been planning to retire in June - and asked her if she had, indeed, retired. She said she had, but while it was great to no longer be working, she'd had a nasty fall almost immediately after quitting work and had spent quite some time doing physio and attending doctor's appointments ever since! Since I knew she lived in a small town near here called Bonneville I asked her what she thought of the walk along the River Arve there (I've done it a few times) but she said unless she had her dog with her she wouldn't do it alone because it's quite isolated, with lots of trees and bushes and she didn't feel safe. Actually, that's why I asked her, so I guess she got the same vibe as I did from the place. I know, however, that she does lots of walking in her spare time (knee-permitting) and we've tentatively made plans to go out walking in Samoëns next Wednesday if the weather is half-way decent. As much as I love my walks in Thyez I'm getting a bit bored with it, so if we can get some longer, new-to-me walks in on the flat I'll be well pleased!Sixt Fer-à-Cheval, SamoënsThe ladies were also talking about the French government floating the idea of another two-week total lockdown in December to \"get this thing over and done with once and for all\". I hadn't heard any of this because I don't have French TV but it must be very worrying for those struggling to keep businesses afloat. Apparently they've also talked about shutting gyms down again, but my neighbour was saying that was more aimed at south-eastern France for the time being, but again, picture the gym where I've just signed up and I can't even begin to imagine how much money they must have sunk into that place, so I hope it doesn't prove necessary to shut it down again!As I was heading out to said gym this morning, I spotted the local postie's van all festooned with balloons so I reckoned he must be about to retire. Actually I saw him a couple of weeks ago training a new, younger guy so that looks about right. I used to see the postie at Stan's sometimes when I came back from the market. He'd be there having his lunch (and a glass of wine) and though I didn't speak to him that much he was a nice guy. In fact, he was the person that when dropping off mail at a neighbour's house about five years ago realized that the guy's face didn't look quite right, so after about 10 minutes he doubled back and knocked on the door again. Turns out the guy was having a massive stroke (at age 54) and our postie effectively saved his life. So I'd say he's earned a well-deserved retirement wouldn't you!The sign in the window says \"retirement convoy\"!And finally, after yesterday's bombshell New York Times article about Trump's taxes, today the wires are all abuzz with last night's \"presidential\" debate, which was anything but \"presidential\"! I tried watching some of the \"highlights\" when I got up this morning but after a couple of minutes I realized there was no amount of money in the world you could pay me to sit through more than five minutes of that stuff. Talk about stooping to a new limbo low - it just makes me sad that whatever their differences, the behaviour was just appallingly lacking in class (and yep, I guess I'm talking about \"Mr. $70,000 hair do\"). Damn, $70,000 in hair-styling expenses!!! Mind you, if my hair looked like that I'd be falling over myself to reclaim that money too! Trouble is, they say it ain't over till the fat lady sings and I sure as heck can't hear Montserrat Caballé singing anywhere can you?"},
{"title": "Brrr!!!!", "date": "Sunday 27 September 2020", "text": "I've been keeping an eye on my friend's place as she and her sister drove to southern Spain last week where they've just bought a house. Her sister will be staying on as she intends to make her life in Spain (she's lived there before) and my friend will be back shortly. I sent my friend a message to say everything was ok and she mentioned that she had already received an appointment for 1 December for Annecy to check her paperwork in connection with her request for French citizenship! Say what????? She only sent her request in about 10 days ago and she's already got an appointment? I sent my request in July 2019 and not a peep. She did mention that as soon as she sent her email she got an automatic reply saying \"if you've already made a request please send another one with the word \"reminder\" in the subject line\", so I've now done that too. I don't actually mind too much as other than my French test I already had everything pretty much ready to go and I'm sure I'll get an appointment soon, but heck, it's a good job she mentioned it isn't it!On Wednesday I did my first stint at the gym trying out the workout programme my coach drew up for me and I actually really enjoyed it. It certainly made a difference being shown how to use the machines correctly and while it was hard work it was good fun. The young coach was working on the ground floor and said if I had any difficulties to give him a yell and he would come upstairs and show me what I needed to be doing, so I'm pleased with the \"service\" too. My idea is to go to the gym on Wednesdays and Fridays but then they also seem to be the only days I will have to meet up with friends and set up appointments so I reckon I'll be lucky to get two days a week in at the gym, to be honest! That being said, I was aching pretty badly come Friday so I was more than pleased to have the excuse not to go as I was meeting up with friends in Geneva for lunch. As it was my birthday on Thursday they kindly paid for me but it is always a treat to catch up with these particular friends anyway as we've known each other for years and have a lot to catch up on. Well saying that, it was all great until I walked back out to my car and discovered I had got a parking ticket. Stupid idiot that I am I had forgotten to put my blue \"free parking\" disk up, and since Swiss parking attendants are like grey ghosts I got stung. Actually (and I think this is pretty horrible, to be honest) they even pay people who live locally to \"snoop\" (as I put it) and dash out and put parking tickets on cars for them. One old lady has a dreadful reputation as the local snitch as she lives just above a bakery and is forever dashing out of her house and giving people tickets. Still, I'm sure it gives her a lot of pleasure right? And in any case, although I would have been allowed to park free of charge for four hours, I did indeed forget to put my blue disk up, so more fool me!When I got home from grocery shopping on Thursday my neighbour and her daughter had left a beautiful flower display outside my front door so I went round to thank her and have a coffee and a chat. But man-oh-man, did I get an earful. I've mentioned before that they are one of the unhappiest couples I know and she really let me have it so I guess it was more of an opportunity for her to get things off her chest than for us to have a chat. I hate to see her like this as I sense she is verging on a breakdown but what can I do? I hear the yelling either out in the back garden or through my wall but .... My only selfish consolation is that it is no longer me and my husband screaming and entertaining the neighbourhood, but I feel so sad for my neighbour as I think the world of her!My friend hasn't been well so I guess I will see him when he feels a bit better, and the kids have told me to block 18 October as they are taking me out for the day - oh and \"you'll need your swimsuit\"! Damn, I wonder what my chances of losing 10 kg between now and then are - zero right? It's going to be a kinda group birthday outing as it's Jen's birthday at the beginning of October and also her mom's so we're all going out together. I'm thinking a hot springs somewhere - they have a lovely one at Chamonix I'd love to go to - but I guess I'll have to wait and see! I had my André Rieu concert lined up for 17 October but that has just been cancelled so at least there is a \"positive\" in that I won't be in Zurich that night!My \"Walk 1,000 Miles in 2020\" FB group is still going strong and I'm loving some of the pictures these people are posting - they really are putting me to shame. Someone recently posted a picture of their hike over Crib Goch in north Wales and it was beautiful. My mom was from a small village in Snowdonia National Park and I really would love the chance to go back there to see the place as an adult rather than through a child's eyes!Crib Goch - can you believe this was classed as a\"mountain walk for novice walkers\"!I guess everything is relative but I remember going hiking with the school to the Lake District when I was 11 and they took us over Helvellyn, with us having to walk over Striding Edge to get to it!!! Maybe I'm just older but looking back I do wonder about taking kids over such hikes. I think also in the UK the bigger problem than the actual difficulty of the walk is the constantly changing weather conditions, but again, I still can't believe we went over Striding Edge at such a young age and probably not properly equipped!Striding EdgeHelvellynMy sister called me for my birthday and she was asking if I'd noticed how ill Boris Johnson looked. Well he's just gone through a nasty divorce (which is what happens when you get your girlfriend pregnant while still married I guess), he must still be feeling the effects of having a serious attack of covid, but I also think he thought he could \"buffoon\" his way through being Prime Minister and is probably only now realizing just how hard it is! I actually used to quite like him when he was just \"Boris the Buffoon\" but now? No way! If you do everything in your power to take on that kind of job you'd better damn well be serious about it - or at least have the gumption to surround yourself with competent people who know what they're doing. Remind you of anyone?I see too that yet again the UK Government are promoting an anti-obesity campaign, partly as a result of the dreadful state some people are in in the UK and partly because they are trying to push people to understand that obesity is a pretty crucial factor in just how ill you might get if you have the misfortune to catch the coronavirus. I think it's a commendable aim, but when they post pictures on the TV more or less saying \"your aim should be not to look like this\", my mind always jumps to wondering if some of the (headless) people they are showing photos of might actually recognize themselves because of their clothes! I know that's not the point of the whole campaign but can you imagine just how mortified you would be (or maybe not - who knows) if you actually recognized yourself as the \"face\" (belly?) of the anti-obesity campaign!! (First thing I'd do is burn that bloody T-shirt, just in case anyone recognized me)!And finally, our temperatures have dropped like a lead balloon these past couple of days. Last night as I was shutting my shutters I saw that it was only 6°C (42°F) and it's \"nippy\" to say the least. I actually don't mind it being cold as I now get to bundle up and start working outside in comfortable temperatures, but to already see snow on Cou (the small mountain behind me) makes me realize that winter is well and truly on its way!"},
{"title": "Veet  - removes hair, dignity and self-respect!", "date": "Tuesday 22 September 2020", "text": "Life is pretty much back to normal now - or as normal as anything can be during a pandemic I guess! Sewing club started back up last night and damn if I didn't get there 30 minutes early (to set up tables and disinfect) only to find my bloody key wouldn't work! Oh I could get into the building all right as the front door was open, but when I got up to our sewing room I couldn't open the door - there was no beep, beep sound at all. So I tried opening up the toilets and again no luck. Damn! I had sent round an email earlier that day reminding people that we were starting up again so I had no choice but to stick around and wait. As luck would have it Patricia, the teacher, showed up first and fortunately her keys worked, so we were able to have our first get together - and very popular it seems to be too. It looks like everyone from last year is going to return and we have maybe another four newbies. I mentioned at one point that we might have to refuse any more requests because of space constraints, but a couple of the ladies just said \"nah, we'll take over the kitchen too\" - so that's what we might end up doing. Heck, I never knew it was that popular, but I have to admit we have a good laugh too. Patricia had asked if a colleague of hers could come along (no problem), but boy is she a bit weird. She hadn't actually brought a sewing project with her as she wanted to get an idea of what she might attempt, but when she spotted my now almost-finished baby quilt, she basically sat glued next to me and started pinning the border (badly). I'm thinking \"back off lady and please keep your hands off my quilt as I've spent a year making this thing\" (she had no idea what she was doing as she can't sew anyway), but ultimately I think once we can get her started on her own project I may be able to keep her away from my quilt!I figured the battery in my key fob was gone but called the Mairie (who graciously let us have the room for free) just in case and she told me to come over for them to take a look. Oddly enough I keep a battery in my car in case my car keys conk out on me, but I didn't want to mess with this one as it wasn't my property. In the end it was easy enough to fix with a sharp tool to split the fob and I'll know what to do next time. Still, I think I should start carrying my Swiss army knife in my purse again just in case!Talking of keeping my Swiss army knife on me, this past week I've been seeing FB reports (yet again) of the proverbial \"broken down Mercedes\" on the side of the road with some guy holding out money to try to get someone to stop. It's always a Mercedes or a BMW and they always have either Romanian or Bulgarian licence plates and you do not stop! It does make me a little uneasy driving back late at night from sewing club and my Italian lesson now, so I make sure to stay off the backroads - which pisses me off because you shouldn't have to do this should you! A few new incidents have also been posted of two \"white van men\" being stopped in a petrol station, one of the white vans having poorly painted \"emergency medical supplies\" on the side and then approaching a lone woman to buy petrol for them. On occasion they will also have a young child with them, but people are being warned not to have any dealings with them as they are con artists. So here we go again, more bloody scammers, potentially dangerous, and now I can't stop at night if I need petrol. Damn, they make me bloody mad!In other news, I've almost finished Michael Cohen's book and I have to admit it is good, very revealing and, as I said before, surprisingly well written. After that I've had enough of Trumpanomics so I have indeed ordered the book of Doctor Zhivago and apparently it will be here very shortly. Oddly enough another book I've meant to read for years is All Creatures Great and Small - which has been sitting on my bookshelf since I was knee high to a grasshopper, so I think it might be time to up the ante a little and get back to the good stuff. Talking of speedy delivery, the other day I ordered a 2021 diary from Amazon UK because I like to have my diaries in English and I also get the important UK dates by doing it through them. And I'm thrilled to report that it arrived from the UK in 24 hours so I was very impressed as I can already start transferring dates/events. I don't write an actual \"memories\" diary (I consider my blog to be that), but it's the way I keep track of everything going on in my life. I know most people now put this stuff in their phones but I don't because I don't feel I can count on my phone half the time and would be in a real mess if I lost it. Call me a dinosaur (I guess my envelope budgeting system proves that right?) but I like a visual of what's going on in the coming weeks and I rarely, if ever, forget anything (well not as long as it's in my diary)!My gardener showed up yesterday as the rain had let up, and in a few hours he got my hedges and my grass cut, so I'm well pleased. After a while the heavens opened up (yet again) but as I don't mind the rain anyway I stayed outside with him as I wanted to clean up more of the garden and get some seeds planted that my friend had given me. It's called love-in-a-mist and is a member of the buttercup family, self-setting and very sturdy so if it takes it will go a treat in my hard to manage soil. Fingers crossed as I find it beautiful!Love-in-a-mistI've already done two yoga classes this week and am planning to hit the gym tomorrow for my first trial run with the programme the coach has set up for me. But guess what, I am (finally) starting to feel a difference, in my legs at least. I can actually feel muscles in my thighs starting to develop and it's a good feeling, because I honestly believe I've been working quite hard lately. Nothing else has changed as yet. Oh I've lost and regained the same six pounds over and over again and since I carry my weight on my belly I still look like a boiled egg in a pair of shorts, but the legs are starting ever so slightly to react and I'm delighted - even if I still have a helluva long way to go!When we came back from yoga today my neighbour commented that she wished she'd shaved her legs before going. I'm not at all hairy so I barely notice, but she has dark hair and you can see it. Still, who cares, we're just a bunch of old women and I doubt anyone's eyesight was good enough to be checking out her legs anyway. Still, that reminded me of a few years ago when I was in England and my sister was getting my mom ready for a doctor's appointment. Now you ladies will know that once you hit menopause you start discovering hairs in places you never knew you had places, and my sister had my mom sitting there with Veet on her upper lip and chin to get rid of the old lady whiskers. With my neighbour mentioning shaving, I remembered and pulled up on the computer an Amazon review I'd seen years ago. It was sent in in 2012 by A. Chappell (a man) in the UK giving his review of his experience with Veet and it's a hoot - very much \"toilet humour\" - but then I'm like that anyway. Now I'm English but even I had to think twice about some of the expressions he used, so when my neighbour asked what I was laughing at damn was it hard trying to translate things like \"Rastafarian dangly bits\" into French. If you're interested, his review is below!\"After havingbeen told my danglies looked like an elderly rastafarian I decided to take theplunge and buy some of this as previous shaving attempts had only been mildlysuccessful and I nearly put my back out trying to reach the more difficultbits.Being a bit of a romantic I thought I would dothe deed on the missus's birthday as a bit of a treat. I  ordered it well in advance and working in theNorth sea I considered myself a bit above some of the characters writing theprevious reviews and wrote them off as soft office types...oh my fellowsufferers how wrong I was.I waited until the other half was tucked up inbed and after giving some vague hints about a special surprise I went down tothe bathroom. Initially all went well and I applied the gel and stood waitingfor something to happen. I didn't have long to wait.At first there was a gentle warmth which in amatter of seconds was replaced by an intense burning and a feeling I can onlydescribe as like being given a barbed wire wedgie by two people intent onhitting the ceiling with my head.Religion hadn't featured much in my life untilthat night but I suddenly became willing to convert to any religion to stop theviolent burning around the turd tunnel and what seemed like the destruction ofthe meat and two veg.Struggling to not bite through my bottom lip Itried to wash the gel off in the sink and only succeeded in blocking theplughole with a mat of hair. Through the haze of tears I struggled out of thebathroom across the hall into the kitchen. By this time walking was not reallypossible and I crawled the final yard to the fridge in the hope of some form ofcold relief.I yanked the freezer drawer out and found a tubof ice cream, tore the lid off and positioned it under me. The relief wasfantastic but only temporary as it melted fairly quickly and the fiery stabbingsoon returned.Due to the shape of the ice cream tub I hadn'tmanaged to give the starfish any treatment and I groped around in the draw forsomething else as I was sure my vision was going to fail fairly soon. I grabbeda bag of what I later found out was frozen sprouts and tore it open trying tobe quiet as I did so. I took a handful of them and tried in vain to clench somebetween the cheeks of my arse.This was not doing the trick as some of the gelhad found its way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle wasrunning its engines behind me. This was probably and hopefully the only time inmy life I was going to wish there was a gay snowman in the kitchen which shouldgive you some idea of the depths I was willing to sink to in order to ease thepain.The only solution my pain crazed mind could comeup with was to gently ease one of the sprouts where no veg had gone before.Unfortunately, alerted by the strange gruntscoming from the kitchen the other half chose that moment to come andinvestigate and was greeted by the sight of me, arse in the air, strawberry icecream dripping from my bell end pushing a sprout up my arse whilemuttering...\"Ooooh that feels good\"!Understandably this was a shock to her and shelet out a scream and as I hadn't heard her come in it caused an involuntaryspasm of shock in myself which resulted in the sprout being ejected at quitesome speed in her direction.I can understand that having a sprout fartedagainst your leg at 11 at night in the kitchen probably wasn't the specialsurprise she was expecting and having to explain to the kids the next day whatthe strange hollow in the ice cream was didn't improve my status...So to sum it up fellas, Veet does indeed remove hair,  - but also dignity andself respect.......!\"Hair removal for men!"},
{"title": "Easy come, easy go!", "date": "Sunday 20 September 2020", "text": "I'm messing about with my blog at the moment - just in case you see any weird things going on before I get this sorted. Is anyone else having problems uploading videos with new blogger? I'm not even sure if this one will work but if not, please bear with me!So where was I? Oh yes, Russia! It has started raining today and I think it's scheduled to be wet all week so I suspect I'll be spending much more time indoors, which isn't a bad thing as goodness knows I have loads to do indoors (too)! Not that sitting down watching Dr. Zhivago achieved much but God I love that film. It is visually beautiful (I mean, who wouldn't fall in love with Yuri and Lara, as played by Omar Sharif and Julie Christie?) but the music is just so amazing it seems to transport you right there with them! Oh and the story's \"not bad\" either, although truth be told I haven't actually read the book. I suspect that will shortly get added to my reading list as it's a classic. Not exactly the same genre as Michael Cohen's book which I'm currently reading but the beauty of not belonging to a book club is that I get to read what I want - even if it's an eclectic mix!Julie Christie and Omar Sharif in Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago!Talking of Egyptians (we were weren't we), the race is on to elect a new top boss at my previous employer, and up until very recently an Egyptian former colleague had been in the running as a potential candidate from Africa. After many years living in Switzerland he is also now a Swiss national but was running on the African ticket. It turns out he is now no longer in the running and this was announced in the local Geneva newspaper. But, I was absolutely horrified when I saw some of the comments below the article (admittedly not many)! Comments such as \"oh he looks like a typical Swiss doesn't he\", or \"I wonder how he can afford to live in Switzerland without working\" (he's on a pension you idiot), and \"oh I suppose he'll be trotting off back to Morocco now to sign on for unemployment\" (????? since when was Egypt part of Morocco?)! I was well and truly disgusted because he is a nice man and I believe he would have been a good candidate. Whether he was the best candidate I have no idea but he certainly knew the organization inside out and was well-liked. But to hear such casual racism from people who had obviously never met the guy - well, it just defies belief (to me at least). I know people the whole world over are subject to such racisim, but it hit me hard that if any of these cave trolls actually knew the man they might see that he was a good guy! God give me strength!Heading off on another tangent, somebody made a comment recently to the effect that now that I'd passed my French test \"I would soon be French\"! Ha ha, as if! I haven't even had my initial appointment in Annecy for them to look over my paperwork (although surely that can't be too much longer right? I mean, it's been 15 months in the making already). But today on FB a couple of people in the local area posted that Annecy had just accepted their paperwork and they were told that Grenoble would get in touch with them for their final interview \"sometime in 2023\"! Ha ha, good job I've got a sense of humour isn't it! I want to become French mainly because I want to remain an EU citizen, but also because thanks to the cock-ups of the so-called \"politicians\" in the U.K. I now no longer have a vote anywhere in the world! That's right, women died to get the right to vote and with the stroke of a pen some dickhead in London took that right away from me, although to be fair it wasn't Bojo - he's just a dickhead in his own right. So, long story short, if I ever do get French citizenship it looks like I will be at least 65 - I just hope I still have all my marbles at that point so I'll know who to vote for!In other news, I was paying some bills yesterday and was surprised to see that instead of the usual over €1,000/month deduction being made as my automatic deduction for 2020 taxes (it's catch up time since the automatic deduction was only set up in June), this month, and until the end of the year, the tax people will \"only\" be taking out €602/month. I've tried to figure out the reasoning behind this and in any case I'd decided that I would put the \"savings\" into a savings account for taxes as I still don't understand it, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless! Well that was until I saw that Jordan was overdrawn €300 and he has another 10 days to go to pay day! I have always been able to see his own, personal account since he was a kid (not their joint/married accounts obviously) and told both my kids that I was happy for them to remove this access any time they wanted, but as I've said before, we're very open about finances and they aren't bothered that I can see their accounts. (On a side note, it's gratifying to see that André's sticking to the \"envelope\" budget we set up a couple of months ago, and even he's both surprised and delighted to see how easy it is to follow.) Anyway, that said, Jordan's being off work for a month during lockdown hurt his bank account because although he received some money, it was nowhere near his usual salary. Then of course he was off work for over a week when he put the nail through his hand, so again his account took a hit and he's been playing catch-up ever since. So I took a look at my new-found \"excess\" money and thought \"sod it\", and transferred €300 into his account to bring him back up to solvency. I sent him a message and told him what I had done and to consider it a belated gift from the tax man as I hadn't bought him much of a birthday present this year. He said that I didn't have to do that but I can sense he's relieved too! So since he has more need than I do of a few extra €€€€ at the moment, I guess it really is easy come, easy go as far as I'm concerned isn't it!"},
{"title": "They certainly know how to put on a party!", "date": "Friday 18 September 2020", "text": "I couldn't seem to get a handle on what time the Tour de France was supposed to arrive in La Roche yesterday so around lunchtime I thought I should head on down into town. I couldn't have gone up to Glières or La Clusaz if I had wanted to as the roads were closed off and only the already-fully-booked shuttle buses were allowed in, so on foot it would have to be. And it was hot! After about 20 minutes I ran into a young girl who was manning one of the barricades across the road and asked her about timings. When she told me that one of the media vans had just gone past and they were expecting the peloton in town anywhere between 5-6 p.m. I thought \"nope, I'm not going to hang around in town for the next five hours\", so I walked back into the village and decided to have lunch in our one-and-only restaurant. My friend always refers to this place as \"the restaurant that's never open\" because it did indeed seem to be closed half the time. Now I don't know if it has changed hands or if the owners have had to pull their fingers out to make up for the covid closures, but now it seems to be constantly open. The owner's wife runs another restaurant further up the mountain so I guess they will have been hard hit by the lockdown!The village school - now up and running again!So I sat and ate lunch while reading the Michael Cohen book, and you know what, I'm actually enjoying it! He pretty much admits he was a slimeball and doesn't appear to be making excuses for himself, but he writes well and it is, of course, quite a story he has to tell! After killing a good hour or so I decided to walk back down into town - about a 30 minute walk but boy was it hot! This is when it started to get busier - people were out walking to \"their spot\" along the road to watch the arrival and everybody and his uncle who had a bike seemed to be cycling to better vantage points too! When I got to town everything was ok - it wasn't overly crowded as yet (I'd say people were more lining the roads then congregating in town) and it was fun! I think that's why I prefer living in France to Switzerland actually (where I lived for six years). They know how to have fun. Sure they sometimes go over the top but it seems to me that they also like to have a good time and do it well!Picture from Le DauphinéLeaving the Plâteau de Glières - picture from Le DauphinéLa Roche - picture taken from the Tourist Office websiteLe Pont Neuf - arrival into townGod, when I think I have trouble walking down to town (and even more trouble walking back up home), I can't even begin to understand how these young men can cycle up mountains in this heat, all the more so since it's now September (and obviously cooler) and the original race had been planned for July! I guess that explains the constant whirring of helicopter blades overhead though!They always decorate the traffic islands!So despite the fact that I had to slog my way back uphill to get home, I have to say it was a fun time. Like I said, I'm not that into cycling (I don't even know who's top of the leader board!!!) but I had a pretty good time (and a couple of glasses of wine to complete what was a rather nice afternoon)! The icing on the cake though was when I got home the postman had dropped off the results of my French test that I had to sit for my citizenship and I got a C2 - a good pass! So that's one more thing crossed off my seemingly never-ending to do list!"},
{"title": "Almost there!", "date": "Thursday 17 September 2020", "text": "I went to my first Italian lesson of the year last night. There were only three of us, although I think one lady from last year will be coming next week. One new guy has also signed up so we agreed to more or less go back to the basics, both for his benefit and for ours to rehash what we learned what now seems so long ago. Still it was a good start! Then this morning the sewing club teacher sent me a message to ask if a colleague of hers could join us on Monday. I wrote back that that was not a problem but as I've also had two potential newbies contact me we might need to put a hold on any new enrolments since we're obliged to follow distancing requirements now. In any case we don't have enough tables even if the room were big enough. I mentioned to her that I had bought hand sanitizer and a few masks, just in case anyone showed up without one, but she said frankly if someone who can sew shows up without a mask it doesn't bode well for them does it! Ha, I hadn't thought of that! My thought was more along the lines that if someone forgot to bring their mask at least we wouldn't have to turn them away!Then this morning, despite being tired and still pretty stiff, I made a good faith effort to get down into town for my first pilates class of the season. And would you believe it, despite them being in the process of setting up to welcome the Tour de France, I actually got a place right in front of the building! Problem was, when I went to the front door there was a sign up saying \"no classes today due to the Tour\"! Bloody hell, don't you think a group email might have been in order? Oh well, it wasn't that far anyway and at least I was up and showered I suppose. So I came home to faff around for a bit before I walk back into town to have a shufty. There was no Thursday market today for obvious reasons, but they're already setting up the drinks stands, bouncy castles and so on so it looks like it could be fun. Actually I'm not really that interested in the race to be honest - although I probably shouldn't put that out there on the internet before I get my French citizenship should I, especially given that Catholicism seems to take a distant second place to cycling in France. But, as Steve told me when he retired, he decided that whenever there was the possibility of doing something that might be fun, his mantra was always to say yes. To walk to the one spot where they should be coming down from Glières is only about a 15 minute walk, and if I want to go down into town (that will depend on how crowded it looks), it will be another 15, so given the good weather I'll head out in a little while!Up at Glières they're already setting up for their arrival, although if I had realized they would be cycling through La Clusaz this year also I would probably have driven up there earlier in the day as I love La Clusaz. At this point no cars will be allowed up anyway, and from what I can see all the shuttle buses are fully booked, so walk it will have to be. That being said, my 80+ neighbour was all kitted out in his cycling gear when I came home as he was obviously off out to greet the Tour (that man is like a human mountain goat). When I offered to come with him he just laughed! Somehow I suspect he doesn't take me seriously - you think?Pictures taken from the TdeF official site and FB page!Plâteau de Glières this morning!"},
{"title": "Well that wasn't so bad!", "date": "Tuesday 15 September 2020", "text": "While not everything has opened back up here (sewing club starts up again next week), most things are up and running so I'm getting into a better routine - which now I think of it, I actually quite enjoy! We had our latest board game evening at my neighbours on Saturday and it was fun, even if we were only eight this time, what with people being away on holiday and whatnot. We played a new-to-me card game that Jen brought along and I enjoyed it, even though, yet again, I came last. Still, someone's got to make everyone else feel good haven't they!The weather is absolutely beautiful at the moment, much cooler than it was, hovering around 28°C (in the 80sF) and so much more pleasant. Long may it last as I have so much more energy in these kinds of temperatures. I finally decided it's time to empty my little swimming pool but I didn't want to just \"unplug\" it as I'm not totally sure where all that water will end up (it's untested territory as yet). Instead I've been carrying buckets of water out back and front and finally my garden is getting the kind of watering it probably should have been getting all summer long, and I have to say it seems to be appreciating it!Ages ago I took up the rose bushes by my back window and planted simple winter plants for the most part, but as it's a real sun trap and up against a white wall, my tomato plants seem to do really well there. This is probably the only time I eat tomatoes, to be honest, because unless I am getting them from Italy I don't think the plastic things you find in the stores are worth wasting money on!I've been having some pretty strange dreams lately involving my mom, who died in 2015. The dreams themselves are ok but I end up wondering what they're about as I tend to think most dreams have some kind of meaning. It would have been her 99th birthday in October but I don't think that's it. Still, I'm sure it'll come to me at some point. Or maybe she's just stopping by to say hallo, who knows. I used to have the most dreadful nightmares when I was married - and for a long time after the divorce - but I could easily figure out what they were about. But mom, I'm not sure. As the saying goes, \"I'll have to sleep on it\"!I also think, like most people, I've been getting an overdose of politics on the TV lately. Actually I've had a bellyful of both Cheeto and the blond idiot in Downing Street. The accents are different but the antics seem to be pretty much the same sadly and I don't think you can trust either of them. So I've tried to stay away from the TV as much as possible because - well just because. That being said, I've been reading a few of the books that have come out about Trump, and they are fascinating. I read Mary Trump's book and found it really interesting. I've also just finished Melania and Me, and while there was way too much use of acronyms and back and forth of emails, I can see why she wrote the book. Boy was she set up (and subsequently exonerated it seems) to take the fall for the missing millions from the inauguration coffers. I don't blame her for writing her book actually because I know I would want to set the record straight, but more than once she said she was told not to have anything to do with the Trump family - and she admits she wished she had listened because they nearly destroyed her. I think I will also download the Michael Cohen book because each of these people tells their story from a different angle, and while Cohen was obviously as thick as thieves with Trump, I think his book will probably do the most damage. We'll see when I read it I guess!After my Monday morning yoga yesterday I managed to fit in another hour's walk also. It seemed a shame not to as the weather was just perfect. Then I figured that as I was going to be pretty booked up for the rest of the week it would be a good time to run out to a local chimney installation place. I have a wood-burning open chimney in the middle of my living/dining room, and as of fairly recently they are apparently no longer legal in France. Having a fireplace that just emits wood smoke directly into the atmosphere is no longer allowed, so while I can keep the fireplace as is, it would be against the law to actually use it now (not that I have for the last 10 years anyway). So I now have an appointment set up to get a cost estimate to have what they call a closed cassette inserted into the fireplace that will burn granules instead of wood. I wanted to keep the fireplace as I think it's more attractive than having something that looks like space ship in the middle of the room, and apparently doing it this way would allow me to heat the large downstairs area very cheaply if I choose to. I don't really heat it too much anyway because I tend to live on the first floor, but I'll see what they say and how it might work out when they come next week I guess! On the way home I stopped in at a store I don't use very often and when I looked at the bill I noticed they had this printed at the bottom and thought what a great idea it was!If you are a victim of domestic violence, call 3919Then last night, just as I was getting ready for bed, I got a FB message apparently from an gent in New York with whom I play Words with Friends. We chat sometimes but instantly I thought this message was a bit weird. Out of the blue he's asking me if I've heard of the rgg programme? \"He has used it, it's linked to the \"Rotary Fund\" and he was able to claim money from them without paying it back\". First thought, well he's an older U.S. veteran so maybe it's linked to the situation in the U.S. and he had included me in the message by accident. But then I thought, nah, something about this sounds pretty fishy, so I sent him a message including a screenshot via another account and asked if he was indeed the author of the message and he said \"never in a million years\". So I told him in that case I think he'd been hacked and he might want to warn his friends and change his password. At that he told me that his credit card had once been hacked to the tune of $3,500, only $3,000 of which he was able to claim back. His bank told him that the scammers had tried putting through small amounts at first to see if they went through, so when he was reimbursed he received hundreds of individual cheques in one go! Wow, talk about having to watch your back!My screen shot!His reimbursements!And finally, tonight I had my one hour session with a coach at the gym where I recently signed up for him to set me up with a work-out programme. To be honest, it was much better than I expected. I guess I'd been put off by seeing this one trainer in particular at our work's gym. To my mind she was alienating some people by being so dogmatic in what she insisted they do. I mean, it's not because she found it easy that others would also and I know more than a few people who dumped her. Anyway, Ben was just lovely. He sat with me and asked me what I wanted to achieve (lose the bingo wings for one) and what I wasn't interested in. I told him my only no-no would be running on a treadmill (a) because I hate running and always have, and (b) because I think I should take care of my knees which sometimes give me a bit of gyp, but other than that I was open to trying anything. So he walked me through maybe six machines and four floor exercises that would form my programme for the next few months - or until Christmas at least - when he would expect me to be able to move it up a notch. He explained what the objective was for each machine (and how to use it correctly) and told me that the one machine I particularly like (to build the inner thigh) wasn't of much use to me as I didn't need it if I used the other machines. I had to bite my tongue not to make some crack about the last time I'd used my inner thigh muscles but you'll be glad to know I managed to show some restraint! So all in all it was a much better experience than I was expecting. On my way home tonight I tried to take a picture of the setting sun as it was going behind a cloud. Not sure if it came out that well as I had to grab it really quickly, but I thought it looked a bit like a space ship at one point!When I got in I turned on the computer to catch up with my blog reading, and saw that our \"die boomer die\" troll is wanking online again from mommy's basement. I had to laugh though because had this guy watched me tonight trying to hold a plank at the gym for one minute he'd have seen that he almost got his wish!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Thursday 10 September 2020", "text": "Or, how to make every bone in your body ache in three easy lessons! I mentioned in my last post that most (though not all) of my activities started up again last Monday, so I had Monday morning yoga followed by Tuesday afternoon yoga (with my neighbour - who was delighted to be starting back up again) and that was when Sylvie, who takes both classes with me, asked if I wanted to go walking with her on Thursday, as she had a free day in her schedule. She looks after children after school, helps with homework, gives extra tuition (she used to be a teacher) and does drop off and pick up on school days - so as you can see she's an absolute treasure for working parents! Things being as they are at the moment, her schedule is all over the place so I knew if I wanted to go walking with her it would have to align with her schedule rather than mine. So I said let's go for it!As I drove through the village of Saint Laurent to meet her this morning, I saw that in the small, newly-built apartment building opposite the Mairie there is now an artisan baker's also. I think that's a masterpiece of a business plan because it's also directly opposite the village school so I imagine they will do a roaring trade. It's kinda sad, in a way, for the little baker's that has been in the village for many, many years. It's a stunning place - exactly how you would picture it - set up off the road in a quaint little building at the foot of the mountains. I've known the owners for over 30 years so I sincerely hope there is room in the village for two bakers!Sylvie was born and raised in this area and offered to take me on a relatively easy hike (a word to the wise, never take the word of a local when they say \"relatively easy\") up to a place called Plaine Joux, about 30 minutes from here (and just 20 minutes from Jordan and Jen's place). Obviously anywhere round here you've got to climb a little so in reality it probably wasn't that bad, but I still had a hard time of it for the first 30 minutes or so - although the heat and trying to talk and walk at the same time probably didn't help either. We made our way round a circuit which took two-and-a-half hours and oh were there some lovely chalets up there. Really old and weather-beaten, but they all had the most beautiful displays of flowers - they were just stunning. I tell ya, if you wanted to cut yourself off from most of civilization, that's the place to be (in the summer at least - in winter they have cross-country and downhill skiing up there). But it really was just lovely!Pointe des BrassesLooking toward the Môle, where Jordan and Jen live!Wild horses!Not so wild cows!On the way back down!By the time I got home I realized I'd put in 20,000 steps today and boy do I know it! I've also just washed my face and pulled my hair back and see that I've got a rather fetching bright red face to boot!I read in the British press yesterday about an 80-year old hiker who had been out walking on the Yorkshire moors with friends when he got separated from them during a hail storm (yep, that's England in summer for you). He was apparently stuck on the moors for three nights, while search and rescue teams were out looking for him! But, he has just made his way back to civilization, unharmed apart from a bump on his head and a desire for a pint and something to eat! As he explained on the news, he was well-equipped and well trained so he knew exactly what he had to do. He found shelter, pitched his tent and stuck it out until the weather cleared enough for him to make his way down. Compare that to me hiking half the time in flip-flops and ending up with a burnt face, I think I've got a lot to learn don't you!Harry Harvey - made it back safe and sound after spendingthree nights on the Yorkshire moors!And yesterday I felt I had to put my money where my mouth was and go to my first try-out at the gym I've just signed up for. I ended up being one of just two people using the machines on the first floor, which is good as it gave me time to walk through each machine and try them all out. I have my session with the coach next week, but even so it was good to have some time to get my bearings. I'm also going to try to go tomorrow as I want to have a full week of it to see how it feels, but right now I think a hot shower and an early night is probably as much as I can manage at the moment!"},
{"title": "But what happened to the fly?", "date": "Monday 7 September 2020", "text": "So I finally made it out to a vide-grenier on Sunday - my first of the year probably - but it was disappointing, to say the least. They were selling the usual tat, except for a few nice glasses I would have been happy to buy if I needed more desert glasses. But, nope, probably not. I wasn't sure if masks were mandatory -  as I understand it, outside they're not. That being said, I would say 90% of the people were wearing masks so in the end I decided to put mine on and go with the flow. I didn't buy anything but I did have a glass of wine on the way out. While I sat on the side drinking it, two little boys were trying to beat the hell out of any grasshoppers they found. They were catching them and then burying them in sand, only to smash them with stones later. I didn't want to get into it with them but eventually I said that if that grasshopper had made it through all that alive maybe they should just let her go and live in peace! I don't know, I was never that cruel as a kid but who knows!And the other night I watched the first episode of a new series of All Creatures Great and Small that is now playing in the UK and I'm thinking I will probably enjoy it. This series was around in the 1970s and I really loved it. It portrays the life and times of Yorkshire vet, James Herriot, and while those times were physically much more difficult, I do wonder if they weren't happier times emotionally, although believe it or not, I have yet to read the book!In other news, I see that Kaing Guek Eav (also known as Comrade Duch) died in his prison cell last week. He was one of the principle protagonists responsible for one of the worst prisons in Cambodia during the reign of Pol Pot. Comrade Duch had apparently been a maths teacher, but for whatever reason, got sucked into the evil that was the Khmer Rouge at the time!Comrade DuchSome of the young people killed by the Khmer Rouge!I mention this because when I first went to Geneva I ended up working with the sweetest, kindest, most gentle man I will ever meet, and he was Cambodian. He was one of seven children (I think, maybe eight) and all of those children - except for him and his sister - were massacred by the Khmer Rouge - along with his parents. T had managed to make it out of Cambodia, but told me that any people with even slight \"indentations\" in their noses - which would indicate that they wore glasses and that they could read - were massacred in order to \"level down\" the intelligence of the population. What struck me most was that the Khmer Rouge also killed their children, because they didn't want the children coming after them years later to exact revenge! This is oddly reminiscent of the initial film of The Godfather, in which Vito Corleone's father had been shot, and when his mother went to plead with them to spare her son's life, the Godfather's response was to kill the mother, and try to kill Vito, \"so that the son does not exact revenge later\"!So when I first arrived in Geneva I ended up working with sweet T. At that time, he had made it out of Cambodia but his sister and her husband were still in concentration camps back in their homeland. So a Vietnamese colleague was doing the rounds collecting money trying to raise enough money in order to bribe prison guards to let them out. Apparently it worked - although my memory of this is not clear -  because his sister and her husband made it out and ended up as refugees in Zurich. But, for some reason his brother-in-law went back to Cambodia to try to get more family members out - and that was the last anyone ever heard of  him! So whatever Comrade Duch's justifications were for running a concentration camp that killed 14,000 people, I'm glad he never saw the light of day again - and that my lovely T did and lived to tell his story and find any happiness he could with his lovely Italian wife!And today I had my first yoga lesson in probably six months, but you know what, it only took one lesson for me to feel totally relaxed again! Okay, maybe I was a bit squeaky, but by golly it felt good. After that I drove out to Sallanches as I wanted to visit le Vieux Pont and cross that off my \"to visit\" list. I managed to get a good walk in there before I got a call from Max saying he had the spare part to repair the leak in my heating system and could he stop by? I told him I would arrive as soon as I could but as the garage door was open anyway he could just show up whenever. On my way back home I got stuck behind a van with a sign which read \"Gérard Bastard - mechanic\". Oh, I remember those days, thinking I could never marry that guy, what with having him introduce me and my kids as \"this is my wife and these are the little Bastards\"! Still, it's better than living in Wankdorf in the Swiss German part of Switzerland, where all the Brits have to stop and get a picture, isn't it! All the same, I was glad when I got home to see that Max had parked properly on my driveway, given the recent tensions with my neighbour about his blocking my driveway/parking in front of my garage! Le Vieux PontThe Mont Blanc!Since I knew I would be having to get up early for my yoga class, last night I decided I wouldn't stay up late reading the news and surfing Youtube - that only ends up with me having nightmares about Donald Trump. So I ended up watching a video of Gina, the Italian nonna, and spent half the night dreaming I was stuffing mushrooms instead!And finally, I saw a rather sad article in the French news this morning. Apparently an older gent had been having problems with a fly that was driving him nuts. So he went into his house and came out with an electric fly swatter and tried swatting the living daylights out of that bugger. Trouble was, unbeknownst to him, there was a gas leak in his home and the electrical spark from the fly-swatter ignited the leaking gas and blew half his house away. He emerged from it pretty much unscathed - but apparently no-one knows what happened to the fly!"},
{"title": "God bless you Scratch, wherever you are!", "date": "Thursday 3 September 2020", "text": "I had my French language proficiency test today in connection with my request for French citizenship. Up until April of this year anyone over 60 didn't have to take the test, but on 1 April all that changed and now everyone requesting citizenship has to take it. I can't say I was particularly bothered but it was just one more hoop to jump through all the same. Then again, if getting citizenship gives you the right to vote I think it's only right that your French should be good enough to understand French politics don't you? Not that I do actually understand French politics but .... I certainly consider my French up to it should I ever show an interest!I set off really early because although it was in a town not far from here I didn't know the exact location. On the way there I saw a Buffalo Grill steak house so I thought I'd stick one to the ex and have lunch there. I've written about this before but we used to go to Buffalo Grill sometimes when we were shopping in Annecy (they make a mean margarita), but my ex always used to do his nut because they put CORN in the free salad they gave you before your meal!!!! Damn, CORN??? My solution to that problem was either refuse the free salad or pick the corn out of it, but NO, his solution was that we should never set foot in that den of iniquity ever again! And he stuck to it! So, with a \"devil may care\" attitude I decided to eat at the Buffalo Grill before going on to my French test (although I passed on the margarita since I needed to keep my single brain cell alive for the test). And guess what, nobody died and the world didn't stop spinning because there was corn in the salad!It's a good job I set out early though as it was a real pain to find this place. I was supposed to show up at 14h and 20 minutes beforehand I'm still driving round in circles looking for it. I finally found it though and was still in good time for the test. I'd guess there were about 20 of us in the group and it was very well organized - all covid-compliant and stuff. They walked us through the mechanics of the test and then we set to with the first part, which was the oral comprehension. I mentioned before that that was the part that most bothered me because while I understood everything that was said, as the questions became more difficult I always felt that the answers were ambiguous and several could have been right, and that was certainly true this time. That being said, the test was actually much easier than the practice tests I had been sitting, so that was a positive. Then we had the written comprehension test which, again, was pretty straightforward (although French can get pretty \"flowery\" - you know, why use one word when 100 will do?), followed by an exercise where we had to write three paragraphs on three different topics - which was fine, except for having to deal with a French keyboard. Still I managed. When I'd finished I turned to look out the window at the kids walking past and I realized that I could see the screen of the guy facing the window. He had his screen set up in a really huge font and that was when I realized that we didn't all have the same test. I could actually read his questions from where I sat (not that I was cheating of course) and he wasn't sitting the same test as me!This test had never particularly worried me and for that I can only send praises up to heaven for my old French teacher, Mr. Etches - who we all referred to affectionately as Scratch! He was incredibly strict but very fair, and he used to wander up and down the classroom singing verb endings (how to conjugate French verbs) and as daft as it sounds those bloody songs stuck. Ten trillion years later, when I joined my friend Ian in Bulgaria, we got to talking about Scratch and Ian started singing Scratch's \"verb conjugating songs\"! When I got my job in Geneva at the age of 21 I took the time to write to Scratch and thanked him for his wonderful teaching, which \"was absolutely instrumental in helping me to get my fabulous job in Geneva\". He wrote back to me, addressing me as \"Treaders\", saying how I was a delight to teach and that he was so glad that he had made an impact on my life. I learned that he died shortly thereafter but I know that somewhere I still have that letter!Anyway, thanks to Scratch I wasn't particularly worried about writing in French. I make mistakes, of course, but not that many, so I'm pretty confident about the written part. The good thing was that the oral and written comprehension part was easy to mark as we went along, so at the end of the test we got our results. A1 and A2 are basically \"you speak basic French\" and are not accepted as sufficient fluency to become French citizens. At a minimum you need B1 - and I couldn't believe it when I got C2!!! That's not the definitive score because the written and the oral interview have to be marked first but I'm pretty damn pleased with that anyway. Apparently I got 699/700, and the Algerian guy next to me asked me if I was French when he clocked my score (so why would I be applying for French citizenship?)!!!! I didn't dare look at his score because it didn't feel right, but I'm assuming it should have been ok - I mean, Algerians speak French anyway right!After that it was the one-on-one interview on three different subjects. She asked me what my hobbies were, so after \"patchwork, walking in the mountains etc.\" I mentioned reading. So she asked what I was reading at the moment, and when I said Donald Trump's niece's book she asked me to tell her the \"juicy bits\". I told her that Mary Trump certainly didn't hold back and it was a good read, and she just laughed.This lady gets to mark me on my interview with her but the recording of it is then sent off to Paris and they will have the definitive say-so for the marks. So I'll have to wait a couple of weeks for the final results (they have to mark the written test also) and then I'll know if I can proceed with my citizenship request.The campus was in a beautiful spot alongside the Salève mountain with a view over the city of Geneva. House prices (I imagine) are higher around there because of the proximity to the Swiss border, and there are some truly stunning houses around, but I don't think I would like to be negotiating those little winding roads every day, particularly not in winter!As I was driving back I noticed that the mountains were particularly spectacular today, with clear blue skies and a fabulous view of the Mont Blanc. I couldn't stop to get a photo though, but by golly some days are just diamonds. But you know what will probably bug me for a long time? If I got 699/700 on the test that they were already able to mark, what was the question I got wrong?"},
{"title": "I swear I've got \"frickin' idiot\" stamped on my forehead!", "date": "Wednesday 2 September 2020", "text": "As I had a hair appointment this afternoon I decided to go into town early to stop at the bank beforehand to get some cash. Since I was really early I figured I had enough time to have a drink before walking over to the hairdresser's. When I got to the café I spotted a guy called Stephan who I used to see quite a bit when Stan had his little bar in the village. Now Stephan has the most piercing blue eyes I have ever seen and was probably a pretty handsome guy in his time, but the Stephan I got to know was just plain weird. He was obviously pretty intelligent and spoke several languages, but for some reason he got it into his head that as I was English it was ok to speak to me in German. I know some German but in the end I had to tell him \"hey, I'm English ok. If you want to speak English to me fine, but please quit with the German\"! It didn't work though - I reckon it was just his way of showing off. I came to find out later from Stan that Stephan - who is about my age - had worked as a language teacher but had been placed on a disability pension some years ago (due to schizophrenia I think). While that was sad he had a more than decent pension and in any case he lived with his wealthy parents in town and wanted for nothing. He was also, sad to say, an alcoholic and alcohol had obviously ravaged his looks over time. Still, I got on ok with Stephan - or at least that is until my husband moved out. At that point he must have seen me as a good target and I remember being shocked one time when he asked if he could borrow €100. I decided to give it to him, writing it off to myself as a bad loan, but to be fair he paid me back about a month later. Stan told me I was a fool as Stephan probably had more money than I did but at least I learned from the experience. Shortly thereafter Stephan again asked me for €100 but this time I just said no, that I was not a bank, and that if he needed money I suggest he speak to his parents! Then, I found out that his parents took his car off him because of his drink-driving, so while it is more than feasible to walk up from town to my little village, after that I didn't see him very often unless he came to Stan's with his dad.A few months later I saw him again and he had the nerve to ask if he could rent a room from me \"because you've got this big house with so many bedrooms\", saying that he was tired of living with his parents. Thank God I learned long ago that \"no\" is a complete sentence, rather than faff around trying to find excuses. So I simply told him that it had taken me a long time to gain my independence and that I treasured my privacy so sorry, but the answer was no - regardless of how many bedrooms I might have! Actually, another guy contacted me about the same time asking if he could rent my camper and live in my driveway when my ex moved out. This guy lived about 200 metres from me with his stepfather in an identical house to mine but yet he wanted to live in my camper? So I wrote back saying that I had bought my camper for my personal use so the answer was no! I already had him figured, I reckon, because when I would want to be out in my camper he would be thinking he could move into my house - and then presumably never move out again! Not long after that Stephan phoned me, but since I had an idea as to why he was phoning I never answered and that seemed to be the end of it. That is, until today!As I mentioned above, I was early for my hair appointment and I went off to have a drink, and that was when I spotted Stephan, who said hallo to me. I figured after all this time it would be ignorant not speak to him so I sat and ordered a drink for him and me and we chatted for a while. He told me that one of the guys I used to see at Stan's was a relative of his and had died about 18 months ago of a heart attack at the young age of 52. I was shocked as he and his partner were pretty nice people - but 52!!! He'd been walking in the mountains when he had the heart attack, but even the air ambulance was unable to save him. What a shock! Anyway, as I went to pay I saw Stephan look at my wallet - and that's when he asked if he could \"borrow\" €10 to \"buy some smokes\"! Damn, any time I ever saw him in town he would be at the bar, and he must have smoked five cigarettes while I was with him! He told me he would stop by on Saturday to give me the money back but as I don't want him coming to my house I told him I would be out and that he was welcome to keep it. But there you go, never again. He's a user and I just can't be bothered with this shit any more!So then, as I was walking back to my car, guess who came running up behind me - if you guessed \"white van man\" you'd be right. If you remember, he was asking for \"a few coins in order to get out of here\" when I was doing my shopping last Thursday. It's not as though he needed money for the parking because parking was free - and then I saw him in the shop with a €50 note. Nope, this time he was \"€2.30 short and needed to buy his train ticket\". I was a bit more with it for once so I asked him where his van was .... and at that he just ran off. Next I saw him at the Post Office pulling the same stunt. Damn I get so fed up of these people!Anyway, after that I seemingly had no choice but to head off down to the gym to sign up for the year. It's a bit weird at the moment because if you want a shower you have to \"book it\" in advance as only so many people are allowed in the locker rooms at once. I also have to let them know via their app that I'm intending to go the gym (because of contact tracing), but I guess these measures won't last for ever. So there will be nowhere to leave your valuables because the lockers are out of bounds, no showers and the need to use a contact tracing app to boot. Still, I signed up anyway and have my appointment with a coach on 15 September (I think). But get this, as I was walking out I heard a voice behind me asking if I had a spare mask. Oh damn, here we go again. But when I turned round it was a young girl who I reckon had forgotten her mask and couldn't get in to the gym without one. As luck would have it I had put a spare mask in my bag so just this once I didn't mind handing it over!When I got back home my neighbour (the wife) was out front of her house so I stood and chatted to her for a while. So then, as I'm sick and tired of her husband's \"aw shucks did I park in your driveway again\" routine, I thought \"in for a penny\" and said \"would you mind asking Jan not to park in my driveway when he comes next time only it's getting to be pretty annoying having to ask him or your husband to move when I come home\". She was surprised and said she hadn't realized they were doing that because \"oh you know men, they don't think\". So I just said \"well thankfully we're here to think for them, but just so you know, I'm getting fed up of having to ask them to move off my driveway when I come home with my groceries\". Not that I should have to have an excuse like groceries for wanting to be able to park in my own driveway of course - but at least it's a start don't you think!"},
{"title": "You win some, you lose some!", "date": "Tuesday 1 September 2020", "text": "Today I decided to head off down to the large mall near Annecy to buy a new phone, even though I still hadn't decided exactly what I wanted. All I knew was that I didn't want to spend a lot of money. There have been (and still are) loads of roadworks going on in that area and now I can no longer get to my usual mall entrance so I have to go a different way. This takes me to a much more practical entrance and that's where I spotted \"him\"! It was a small stand advertising quick repairs to phones and so on so I went over and showed him my phone, which was down to about 30% charged in just a matter of hours. He said it was most likely the battery but beyond a certain point there was just no saving a phone in some cases. However if I wanted to leave it with him for about an hour he would take a look at it. So I took myself off for an unplanned lunch out and a little wander, and wadda ya know - it was indeed just the battery and he was able to replace it and recharge my phone, all for the princely sum of €40 - as opposed to €400-€500 for a new phone! As you can imagine, I'm well pleased because I knew if I went into the SFR shop (my mobile carrier) they'd try to get me to change my contract (the one I just recently negotiated down), or try to sell me a much more expensive phone. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money because planned obsolescence annoys the hell out of me! I also spotted an Yves Rocher shop - a new one to me - and was able to pick up some of my favourite products there too. I like Yves Rocher's products and they're not at all expensive, so it was a double win!When I got back to la Roche I stopped in at the gym and wadda ya know - it wasn't open! I had a walk around because I wondered if maybe they had gone out of business since my last visit, but when I looked them up on my now fully-charged phone it seems they actually close from noon to 4 p.m! Obviously there isn't much demand for lunch time fitness sessions by the looks of it, and 24/7 access? Ha, as if! This is France after all! I did wonder if this was maybe God's way of telling me \"oh you look just fine, you don't need the gym\", but then I reckoned even God wasn't that blind!When I got home my neighbour's friend was now parked across my driveway, so as I must have been in a somewhat more tetchy mood than usual I just sat on my horn till he came out, apologized profusely and moved his truck. What is it with these people? I mean, if it's a question of just running in to the neighbours to, say, drop off a parcel I have no problem with that, but I will never get why you park in someone else's driveway, especially when there are plenty of parking spaces around! Once I had calmed down I saw that my roofing people had been back to finish up the sealant on the remaining 15 square metres that they had missed first time round (an easy mistake to make as that part of my roof actually looks like it belongs to my neighbour) - so that put me in a slightly better mood. I have to admit I'm pathetically grateful when I receive good service/follow-up, but in reality isn't that the way it should be everywhere? And then my gardener showed up with his son to get my lawn sorted. With it having rained for the last four days he has been hard pushed to catch up while the weather is holding. I do wonder what he does in the winter though - snow clearance maybe? Who knows! I asked him to give me a quote to cut my hedges and he's given me a decent price so I'm happy to let him do that too. I have to say though that I do wonder about his health. He has an enormous belly on him - the kind that hangs way down over his trousers in a kind of fat flap - and with the kind of hard physical work that he does, particularly in the heat, I'd be concerned for his health somewhat. He's a decent enough guy so I hope he proves me wrong but having all that fat, especially around his middle, would be worrying to me. So yeah, I think I've just talked myself into going back to sign up at the gym tomorrow - maybe I'd just had a vision of the ghost of Christmas yet to come!"},
{"title": "I'm so glad we didn't make it!", "date": "Monday 31 August 2020", "text": "I think my bloody phone is on the blink and while I'm not exactly a phone fanatic, it does feel a bit like my life support is slowly being turned off, so it looks like I'm going to have to buy a new one. I reckon I've had this one for three years and it galls me to think I've got to replace it already. Somewhere I have a spare battery for it but when I looked up how to change it on Youtube I'm pretty sure I'd mess up the phone anyway.  So I'll be heading out tomorrow to get a new one. I really couldn't give too much of a toss about phones as long as I can call with them, send messages and take a few photos. I don't need to be able to programme my central heating with it so I've been looking at what's available in the cheaper versions. I'm also not sure I want another iPhone to be honest, as I've heard good things about Samsung and they're quite a bit cheaper. I guess I'll see what they suggest at the shop tomorrow!Also tomorrow I'm planning on heading down to the gym in town to sign up - and you know what, I'm dreading it!  I'm happy to go to the gym as I like the weight machines and going to the work's gym obviously hasn't worked out since covid hit. Actually, it was touch and go before that because I was very aware of the traffic and the weather conditions so hopefully a gym in town will be better for me. My friend signed up there a couple of years ago and she said they were really nice. I get a free one-hour consultation with a fitness professional to walk me through it, but the big thing I don't want to be doing is running on any treadmill. I hate it, so that'll definitely be one thing I'm going to work up to - if at all. Wish me luck! Yoga and pilates then start up again next week so I'm glad the weather is starting to cool off a bit, even though I expect there'll be a few creaky bones to begin with!I also just realized that today would have been my 35th wedding anniversary. I'd totally missed it until I linked it to André's birthday yesterday. Actually my ex's birthday was 29th, André's is the 30th and our wedding anniversary was 31st August. Being married 26 years at time of the divorce was more than enough and life has been so much better since, so yeah, cheers - here's to our 35th unwedding anniversary. I'm so glad we didn't make it!"},
{"title": "White van man!", "date": "Sunday 30 August 2020", "text": "Damn, I just wrote a whole blog post and new blogger seems to have shot it off into cyberspace somewhere! Oh well, here we go again then! So as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, sometimes I'm really glad we're six hours ahead of eastern U.S. time so that I had no inclination whatsoever to watch any of the RNC. I did manage five minutes of Trump's excruciating monotone monologue before the temptation to throw myself under a bus kicked in, but politics aside, given that there were several hundred unmasked, untested and non-socially distanced spectators I'll be curious to see if \"this whole pandemic is a hoax\" still holds water in about a week's time! I suspect not!And what the hell happened in Kenosha? The idea that a 17 year old (or anyone outside the military frankly) can get their hands on a semi-automatic, walk casually down the street and kill someone with it just blows my mind. The sad thing - apart from the deaths and injuries he caused - is I wonder if he has spent half his life playing video games and thinks he finally \"got to star in his own video\" - you know, the kind where you can just buy a new life and start over if you get killed! Talk about not only destroying several other people's lives but also your own. I just wonder if he sleep-walked through the whole shit show in some kind of make-believe zombie mode! But to the people calling him a \"hero\", in what kind of alternate perverted universe does killing two people and blowing someone else's arm off make him a \"hero\"? Sadly, whoever wins in November, I think this kind of rioting and violence is far from over!In more uplifting news, today was André's birthday and while the weather didn't hold for them to go go-karting, I at least got to eat out with the three of them at a lovely restaurant next to the Lac de la Tour. And the restaurant was heaving, which on the face of it isn't good, but the place was so big that we were, indeed, able to keep our distance from other diners. Not great maybe but I actually feel that as much as possible France needs to start returning to some kind of normality. That being said, Germany and France have again warned today that due to a spike in infections it might be necessary to envisage new lock downs in the future. I guess only time will tell!Talking of France, I have my rescheduled French test in respect of my citizenship request on Thursday. I haven't been particularly worried about it but did think maybe I should do a couple of trial runs these last few days and I'm glad I did. Oddly enough the questions I'm most likely to fail are the aural comprehension ones - which is stupid because I can understand everything they say. The problem is that as you get further along in the test and on to the more difficult \"accents\", many of the answers, to my mind, are ambiguous. So \"is this conversation discussing women setting up a business in Morocco or does it highlight the difficulties women face in a patriarchal society such as Morocco?\" That kind of thing. So today, when I came back from lunch, I did another trial test. When I got to the end and looked at my score I had only got 32 out of 40 - which struck me as very odd because I've never scored that low. But that was when I realized that I had lost my internet connection on question nine and apparently the computer then decided to mark the first eight questions as \"unanswered\" and therefore wrong! Phew! Still, even with that score it was sufficient to pass the test. I'll be glad when it's over though as I need to get back to learning \"all about France\" just on the off chance I ever get an interview. Add to that the selfish bastards have changed half their government ministers since the Prime Minister's resignation so I've got to go through and learn the names of the most relevant ministers yet again. Nah, not really. I think from the naturalization point of view there are only three or four \"important\" ministers, such as who is the Minister for Europe? (Jean-Yves Le Drian, if you're interested)!I'm also making headway through the pile of books I've had sitting on my coffee table for the last however many decades. The other day I picked up one by Stephen Fry and was only \"cautiously optimistic\" about it. I eventually gave up on the last book of his I tried reading because while I think Fry is hilarious the book was just way too pompous. This one is called Mrs. Fry's Diaries, supposedly written by the entirely fictitious Mrs. Stephen Fry (given that he's gay and is married to a much younger man) and their supposed family life with six kids on a council estate. And it's actually pretty good, I have to say. There are such gems as how Mrs. Winton \"told me all about this new Reiki fortune teller she's just started seeing. First she gives you an intense scalp massage, then she reads your dandruff\"! Another one has Mrs. Fry talking about a day out at Aintree (the biggest horse race in the country) where Stephen was pointing out the winners' enclosure \"right next to the royal box\", and the losers' enclosure \"right next to the glue factory\"! Fry is very drôle and I can just hear him in my head coming out with this lunacy in his posh, Cambridge-educated voice. Either way, it's easy reading and I'm quite enjoying it!And finally, white van man. I had an encounter with white van man at the supermarket on Thursday. As I was getting out of my car, white van man came running over to me and asked if I \"had any spare coins so that they could get out of here\". I'm always a bit surprised by this kind of thing so I just said no. Then when I was leaving the supermarket I saw him leaving the cash register with the lady just having given him change for what looked like a €50 note (or at least he had two twenties in his hand). So I loaded up my car and just as I was about to leave another white van man pulled up diagonally behind me, thus effectively blocking me in as there was a car in front of me and one to my right. He wound the window down and asked if my car was for sale, which is odd as there's nothing special about it - it's just a well-maintained nine year old Ford Mondeo. When I told him no, he nevertheless continued to sit there for a couple of minutes, effectively preventing me from leaving! What the flip??? Eventually he moved off but as I was driving out of the parking lot I noticed the original white van pulled over on the side of the road and when I passed him he also went to pull out and swore rather loudly. Now I've no idea what was going on there. I reckon they were gypsies actually, but a few years ago my friend received 21 speeding tickets in the space of about three months, and this after having lived in France for over 25 years and never having got a ticket. So I'm leery, as you can imagine. In her case she's pretty sure someone with the same make of car had duplicate plates made (although sadly she couldn't prove it). She could prove one time when she was supposed to have been speeding near the border that she was actually on the other side of Geneva at a doctor's appointment, but to be honest the French courts didn't want to know. It was a very stressful time for her so I'm very aware of my gut feeling that these guys were up to no good. I hope I'm wrong but .... One thing's for sure, if I do start getting speeding tickets I will contest every one as and when. My friend didn't do this immediately because she genuinely thought she'd made an honest mistake the first couple of times, but by the time she'd hit 21 tickets it was already too late to contest them. I rather hope I'm wrong and that white van man number one was just a gypo trying to scam money out of me, and white van man number two was maybe looking for spare parts! Actually, that's one of the reasons I wanted to write this post - so I have the \"white van man\" incident documented on 27 August. I hope it doesn't come to anything other than my perhaps overly fertile imagination though!"},
{"title": "Well that was rather good!", "date": "Wednesday 26 August 2020", "text": "There's not been an awful lot going on here again at the moment. The weather dropped to 28°C today so it was again bearable. I think they're predicting rain later in the week, I guess as a follow-on from the storm currently hammering Britain and Ireland. I can't say it bothers me one way or the other because I can always find things to do, whether it be in the garden or inside. I've worked a few hours in the garden these last few days putting stuff \"to bed\" so to speak. The veggie plot wasn't that great, although the tomatoes are looking good, and the peach tree is heaving with peaches. I just need them to ripen before the wasps get them all. Once I'd finished for the day I pushed myself to take one of my local walks down to the Bénite Fontaine. It's convenient because I don't have to take the car and I realize, since there's a little bit of climbing, that I need to get back to doing something slightly more strenuous than just walking on the flat. You have to walk down into the dell where the holy water spring is and then climb back out to the church. Nothing much - I mean seriously only about 10 minutes of climbing - but I realize I need to get back to challenging myself a bit more now that it's cooler. When I stopped to fill my water bottle I noticed that a family had brought their cars down into the dell, while another lady was sitting at a picnic table in the shade on her own. I must admit I had never thought of bringing a car down there, but it allowed the family to bring grandma and any number of coolers for a picnic in what is a rather lovely spot!When I got back I noticed that the little island in front of our houses was all dug up and pretty much shredded over. When I stopped to chat with my neighbours they reckon we've now got a badger problem. I must say he's dug it up pretty thoroughly too. I wonder if I could tempt him in to my veggie plot once I've pulled everything up!It's André's birthday on Sunday so I had asked the kids if they would like to come over to me for lunch to celebrate. André, however, had other ideas and suggested we all go out to eat at the lac de la Tour near Jordan and Jen's place as he's heard it is pretty good, and then they would like to go off go-karting afterwards. Suits me, as there is some good walking country round there, weather-permitting!He took the day off today as he and Lily had a meeting with an adjudicator to see if their divorce paperwork is in order - which it is - so they've been given the green light to send it off and they could be divorced sometime in September! That's pretty fast isn't it - and kinda sad! That being said, they went for a coffee together afterwards and Lily asked if Ammie (grandma in the States) would mind if she kept in touch occasionally (not at all) and she told him that her grandma and aunt would also like to keep in touch with him as they were very fond of him. So he said he would stop in and see Abuela (Lily's grandma) as she has really been nice to him, but he told Lily that she has to realize that he won't be seeing them too often all the same. I told him I keep in touch with Ammie myself, although not with any of the rest of his dad's family. I call her maybe three times a year and we chat for about an hour. In the end, it's better to end it civilly isn't it. That being said, Lily asked if they could remain friends and he said that while he wouldn't be upset if he saw her again while out with friends, he didn't want to be around her too much at the beginning as he wanted to move on. That being said, if Pete was on the scene he wouldn't be there at all as Pete has definitely been crossed off the list. Even if nothing happened between Lily and Pete (he has no idea), in his opinion Pete very definitely crossed boundaries within his and Lily's marriage!Moving on to other things, he then told me that he is loving the \"envelope\" budgeting system that we set up together as it gives him a tangible insight into what he has available to him to spend and how he is planning his different expenses. Apparently Lily was so impressed that she is now going to do the same - which is ironic because she's Swiss and works in a bank! But still, if it works, it works - I told him Nanny and Ted (my mom and dad) would be so proud if they could see him using \"their old fashioned ways\" to get a handle on his budget!And finally, I was pulling stuff out the fridge tonight to see what needed using up because I'm tired of wasting food. I had two red and two yellow peppers so figured I'd find something to stuff them with. Then I pulled out a pre-made quinoa salad with pistachios, a packet of bacon lardons I had forgotten to use, half a bag of grated cheese and half a jar of spaghetti sauce. So I par-cooked the peppers and then stuffed them with a mixture of everything else all mixed together and by golly they were good. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to replicate it but I'll sure give it a try as they were a definite hit!"},
{"title": "Busy doing nothing!", "date": "Monday 24 August 2020", "text": "As I'm trying to keep up the walking momentum in order to get to my 1,000 miles in 2020 (I passed 700 miles walked this week), I talked myself into going for a walk down to the lake at Thyez yesterday - my go-to walk when I can't be bothered to drive too far. And again it was beautiful. The temperature dropped down to about 27°C (around 80°F), with a lovely breeze blowing so it turned out to be the perfect day to walk. Again I think they had forecast possible thunderstorms but we got nothing in the end. Even so, it was strange to see how few people were at the lake considering it was such a beautiful day and a Sunday to boot. There was just one man on the beach and six people playing volleyball. A few fisherman and kids playing in the park. Further back at the picnic tables there were quite a few families out BBQing but if you wanted a table in the shade you would have got one. One lady was struggling to carry stuff towards a group of people setting up their picnics and shouted out \"whatever you do don't come and help will you\", so I just laughed and took some of her stuff for her. When I dropped it off they offered for me to have a drink with them, but as I wanted to get on with my walking I just thanked them and said I'd be on my way. I'd guess they were either Turkish or North African and probably about 20 of them all told, and it hit me then how I actually miss being part of a large family. We were a family of seven kids (I was number seven) so there was always someone around and we often went fishing/camping with uncles and aunts and cousins. Of course things change as you get older, my brother in Wales is dead, my sister is in Denmark and the others are in England. I'm divorced and while I have no desire to live with anyone ever again it did hit me a little yesterday that I missed \"all that\". Of course I have my kids but they have their own lives to live. Truth is, I know I like being in the hustle and bustle of lots of people and making plans for picnics and so on, especially now that I have the time. I guess it's just a weird time we're all going through, what with Covid and people having to quarantine if they've been abroad, but yesterday it hit me a little! Never mind, a good walk will soon sort that out!People out BBQing!Another thing that struck me was that the picnickers were mostly (but not all) either Turks or North Africans, as I mentioned above. When we came back to Switzerland from the States in 1989 we had a beautiful 3-bedroomed apartment in the vineyards just over the road from Lake Geneva. As André was only two we would take him down to the lake to play and you would likewise always find the Spaniards and Portuguese down there picnicking too. Then someone pointed out that the Swiss would most likely own their own homes (and therefore have gardens), and many of these Spaniards/Portuguese would be migrant workers so they would be in apartments. Never thought of it like that. Either way, they always seemed to be having a lot of fun!The château in Rolle (Switzerland) - the little town we where we used to live.(picture by 123RF)I remember being down on the lake one time and two Spanish families had loaded up a huge table with all their food and drinks when the table started to keel over. It kinda happened in slow motion and my husband burst out laughing (it was funny) but I yelled \"run\" so we dashed over there and managed to help them hold the table up while the women rescued the food and booze. So they invited us to have a drink with them too! They were happy days!While our apartment was beautiful and in a lovely spot, at the time, in 1989, we were paying SF 2,300 per month in rent ($2,300) and I knew that was ridiculous. So I pushed and pushed for us to move into France where that kind of money would easily cover a mortgage. I didn't really want to move into France as I loved where I lived but I knew moving was a no-brainer. That being said, I wouldn't move back to Switzerland now so we made the right decision in the end. And it seems André is coming to the same conclusion also, from what I was told today. He keeps saying to his friends \"I can't believe it only costs ...... in France whereas in Switzerland it costs .....\"! Finally, he's realizing that while Geneva is lovely, the prices? Nah, not so much!Since I was only 15 minutes from Jordan and Jen's place I stopped by to see them. André had gone into Geneva to see friends so they were having a lazy afternoon to themselves. I mentioned to Jordan again that my heating system was still leaking and he'd better remind Max that I'm still waiting for him to fix it before I post something on Facebook (I wouldn't of course but I did tell him to tell Max that I would soon be French and then the real yelling would start). I mentioned to Jen that I had been cutting back branches on my damson bush and she said she could murder a damson tart right now, so I think I'll make one for her and take it over during the week. It'll be nice to do some baking again!Then last evening I was invited over to my friend's for an apéro since her cousin was over. We had a great laugh telling stories of our various escapades, the cousin having lived in Colombia for a while, her sister having lived in Spain (and the US for the most part) and my friend and I telling our stories about living in France and Switzerland - you know all the stories of how you can screw up when it isn't your language. I may have had just a little too much to drink but ha, what the heck, the stories get better after a few glasses don't they!I went to bed \"early\" by my standards last night but as I was reading around 11 p.m. I heard a \"bang, bang, bang\" that seemed to go on for ages. I thought it was weird to be lighting fireworks at that time, but then I realized it was probably down in the woods behind the church and they were most likely hunters (better that than serial killers, I guess). That would be where I saw my one-and-only deer one time and where the wild boar were coming from when they hit my car last year. Still, I wouldn't like to be out in the woods at night knowing they're down there hunting!Anyway, this morning Jordan sent me a message to say that Max would stop over sometime today to take a look at my heating system, so I decided it would be better not to go out walking today. I did pop down to the recycling centre/tip though as I had quite a bit of stuff to get rid of - apparently so did half the town, it turns out. People were lined up waiting to get in and when I finally pulled in I noticed a woman had parked her car across two spots right in front of the \"green\" bins for the grass/hedge cuttings. Another ignorant driver. By doing that she was taking up two spots and yet people were lining up to get in! So I pulled up on one side of her and another woman pulled up on the other and I thought \"I wonder if she'll get it when she has to wait to get out?\" but she was still there after I left. Again, another ignorant, entitled sod!She was in the dark car at the centre, although by this time we had \"liberated\"more space around her!I had to laugh though when I was pulling in - apparently someone was throwing away a horse!Anyway, Max called me and said he'd come by at 3 o'clock and did indeed show up bang on time. As he walked in he said \"see, I'm right on time\", so I just said \"no, you're three months late\" and he laughed. Jordan had been able to tighten one part of the leaking mechanism up but Max confirmed that he would need to order a new part but it was okay as \"it was still under the one year guarantee\". You're damn right it is buddy! We sat and chatted afterwards and I have to say he's been a great friend to my kids over the years. It was him that offered André a place to stay for as long as he wanted when he and Lily split up. They're all in the same band (he's the bass player, as well as being Jordan's boss) and have been mates for nearly 20 years, so I suspect I'll be seeing a lot more of him in the years to come.And finally, someone posted the other day (sorry, can't remember who) about making \"pot holders\" for a family member. And of course that triggered a memory of when I was living in the States. Aunt Kris used to crochet beautiful blankets for all the new babies and one time crocheted me some \"pot holders\" for Christmas. I was a bit stumped as they looked pretty weird to me, but I didn't want to offend her so I went over to a small plant and put it inside the pot holder. Everyone burst out laughing and she said \"you don't know what pot holders are do you\"? and I said \"I guess not\". Turns out they were for getting hot pans out of the oven. Now if she'd have just said \"oven gloves\" we'd have been on the same wavelength! Divided by a common language, more like!"},
{"title": "Brave ladies!", "date": "Saturday 22 August 2020", "text": "I couldn't get to sleep last night which, while unpleasant, is not the end of the world since it doesn't happen very often. I went to bed about 1 a.m. but ended up reading my book until 4 a.m. - when I finally nodded off - only to wake up at 7.30! If it's only the occasional time I can live with that (well obviously, I just did) but I do feel for people with long-term insomnia, it must be hell! It was raining when I got up and then I remembered I had promised myself I would go out walking today, because if little girls and little old ladies can do it, so can I! I decided I wanted to head out to three small lakes I had visited just before lockdown to see if you can actually walk around all three and how long it would take. There is also a very old bridge nearby that I wanted to visit called le Vieux Pont (the old bridge - not exactly given to hyperbole were they). When I looked it up I see that it was first mentioned in 1225 but it obviously dates quite a bit further back than that.Le Vieux Pont, SallanchesOn a side note, that takes me off on another tangential \"old bridge story\" that I remember from many years ago (can't remember exactly when though I remember seeing it on British TV). There was a very old bridge that had reached an important centenary anniversary somewhere in Switzerland - either the Swiss German part or the Italian-speaking part, but I can't remember that either. So they had all the local dignitaries lined up and a massive ribbon tied across it for the Mayor to cut. The band was playing, the Mayor was holding the scissors - and the bloody bridge collapsed!!!! Thankfully no-one was on it at the time, and I later asked my friend's Swiss husband if he remembered it but he couldn't place it! Funny how it always stuck with me though!Since I was heading out that way, I decided to stop in at the Saturday market in St. Pierre as I'm finding it difficult to store my fresh fruit and veg at the moment. Thinking about it, it might be a good idea to start shopping for it twice a week rather than just once in this heat. Anyway, as I was pulling into the parking lot, the lady just in front of me screeched her car to a halt and parked diagonally across two parking spaces. Now there were plenty of  spaces available where she could have parked well away from other cars if she was worried about her car getting damaged, but nope, she parked directly in between two cars but diagonally! Ignorant cow! I do wonder about people like that though!So I bought a few things - aubergines, courgettes, tomatoes and so on - and decided that since it was a bit cooler I wouldn't take them back home but head straight on out to Sallanches. Trouble is, I took the wrong bloody turn again and ended up back at the lake at Passy where I went a few days ago. Oh well, by this time I was getting hungry so decided to walk round it again since that was the main objective anyway. This time though, there were even fewer people than previously - even though it wasn't busy then. I guess since they had forecast thunder storms people stayed away, but we actually ended up not getting any rain. Obviously for people like me getting the lake almost to myself is great, but for the businesses there it's got to be very hard indeed seeing their August numbers drop so badly, right after such a strict lockdown!When I pulled into the parking lot I handed over my €2 fee and realized that the young man didn't give me a ticket to display. Hmmmmm! He just waved me on through. So I tried to watch if he handed the next car a ticket (can't be sure) but on walking towards the lake I realized that some cars were displaying tickets and some weren't. That's obviously a nice little number he's got going there then. One for him and one for the boss! Since it was so quiet and I was hungry I decided to stop at the little restaurant there, blow my diet to hell with a Ceasar salad (very good!) and add in a glass of wine just to make sure I would feel like an abject failure. Nah, that didn't work, I thoroughly enjoyed myself! I think there were only five tables occupied on the terrace so I got to sit and watch the kids (and at least one dad) messing around on the \"bouncy castle\" kind of thingy!Dad was having to go round each circuit and \"bounce\" his kids into the air.He must have been knackered with three kids!See what I mean, there was nobody on the beach.Everyone fishing on the south side of the lake got their own little pontoon!I made it round in 45 minutes this time and it was more pleasant because the temperature had dropped and the wind had picked up - enough to get some good kite-flying in!You can just about see the kite in this picture!And talking of kite-flying (here we go again), I remember being in Denmark years ago visiting my sister with my then boyfriend. To give her a break we decided to take her little boy to the park and go fly a kite. It was really windy and the little guy and I were having a hard time of it. So my boyfriend - lovely as he was - then decided to \"mansplain\" to me exactly where I was going wrong and indicated that he would show me. Somewhere I have a fabulous picture of him all tied up in knots and struggling to get his arms free from the kite! He wasn't exactly easily given to laughing at himself but I almost peed myself when my little nephew took great joy in explaining what happened to my sister in Danish!By the time I got back I was hot, and as I was taking my walking boots off I remembered my vegetables in the boot of the car. To say that I almost had ready-made ratatouille in my basket would be an understatement!And finally, I see that Alexei Navalny, a Russian opponent of Vladimir Putin, appears to have been poisoned on a plane in Russia. Yet another poisoning, which makes the campaign of the three ladies who ran against long-time Belarus dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, all the more brave. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - an English teacher - assisted by two other brave ladies, campaigned for fair and democratic elections. I believe all three of these ladies' husbands were political opponents of Lukashenko and had all been imprisoned. One of the ladies was also taken into custody just before the elections and had had her young children threatened. It came as no surprise to anyone that Lukashenko - who has been in power for 26 years - won! Very wisely these ladies have fled the country and taken their children to safety in Lithuania, although what \"safety\" means when you are dealing with these kinds of régimes who knows. The EU are already going to impose sanctions against Belarus and I hope Belarus will get to be the next country to indeed be able to hold democratic elections. Either way, the bravery of these three ordinary women is so inspiring!"},
{"title": "Sometimes I'm just inspired - or maybe not!", "date": "Friday 21 August 2020", "text": "I had a few days at the beginning of the week that just knocked me off my feet. It was the heat most likely but I felt inclined to do absolutely nothing - so that's what I did! I pretty much just lay on the sofa and read for two days - which is fine, of course, but then I get so mad at myself because I don't want to become that couch potato. Of course in reality I know (God willing) I never will become that couch potato, but while I'm in that funk I hate it. Maybe the trick is just to learn to accept it for what it is - just my body saying \"hey I've had enough of this heat\", or maybe \"I'm tired so give me a break\". Anyway, this is what I felt like:Still, it only takes a couple of days and I seem to be back up and running, despite the ongoing 36°C (96°F) heat! I suppose I do get more done than I realize because yesterday I did my shopping and then cleaned the entire house (it's not exactly deep cleaning though so don't look too closely). Then I did the washing and changed my bed so yep I guess I do achieve more than I think averaged out over the week. Today I had to go down to the bank to sign for my power of attorney over our Homeowners' Association's accounts, and then I ran to the DIY place as I wanted to pick up \"sealant\" strips for my windows and doors. It seems everywhere I look I see something that needs to be repaired, and at the moment it's the slightly rotting strips that actually seal my windows and doors. Not surprising really I suppose as I reckon the windows are probably 20 years old! And then of course the TV went on the blink for a couple of days, and while I really can \"take it or leave it\", I would at least like it to work occasionally. I've finally learned to just \"leave it\" though when things start getting to me and so a couple of days ago I had a eureka moment and figured out that it was actually the plug to the digibox that had had it. I buy my digibox from the UK so I need a British plug and that had started to go wobbly in the French adaptor. Once I fished out another UK/France adaptor and tried that it was \"Bob's your uncle\" and now it's all working again. Ya see, we women can do these things!The computer is really my weakness, so I'm trying to discipline myself to just read the news and my emails in the mornings and not go down the rabbit hole of blogs/Youtube/US elections until the evening. I have to admit I really do get fed up with the US elections (and the UK elections of course) because they drag on so long, so in the past I've maybe watched a little of what's going on and then just left it. But this time, I've been glued to it and I'm sure you can all guess why. Now putting the politics aside (if that's even possible), I can always agree to disagree on matters of politics. Where my eyes are still popping out of my head and jaw hitting the ground is Trump. And not Trump from the point of view of being a Republican president. No, like I said, I can remove myself from that part. It's the spectacle of such an absolute rampant frickin' malignant narcissist that I'm glued to!I've mentioned before that having had the misfortune to work for an incompetent batshit crazy malignant narc bitch (I think that just about covered all bases), I became fascinated by narcs and subsequently read up so much on them. That being so, Trump still has my eyes popping out on stalks! So I end up going down the rabbit hole of watching The Packman Show, or Trevor Noah, or Jimmy Fallon and staying up half the night. By the way, if anyone is interested, Fallon did the most wonderful Youtube video dressed up as Trump doing a make-up tutorial. It's brilliant! It's almost on a par with the former Italian PM's \"somewhat unfortunate\" plastic surgery attempts!Silvio Berlusconi - of course they're his own \"natural\" good looks!So trying to leave Trump out of it (because I want to get some sleep), I have to say how absolutely impressed I am by Biden's pick of Kamala Harris for VP. That woman is impressive! I watched her putting questions to Barr, who \"couldn't remember if anyone in the White House had asked/suggested/hinted that he might like to make contact with Russia\", and Kavanaugh who \"couldn't think of a single law currently in existence which allowed women to make decisions over men's bodies\"! Like I say, I loved it and will be really keen to see how she gets on - I'm sure she'll more than hold her own! As did Anderson Cooper recently with Mike Lindell of Mypillows fame. Well actually he wiped the floor with him, calling him a \"snake oil salesman\" on more than one occasion. Damn it was good to watch!Harris v. BarrAnd moving swiftly on to other news, tomorrow I think it's supposed to rain and be a little cooler, so I'm contemplating trying to get some real walking in again if I can be bothered. Well, that's what I was thinking until I saw these two pictures posted on my walking group's FB page. So shame on me if I don't get out there tomorrow!Mom posted pictures and a video of her sweet four-year-old daughter walking all the way up Pen y Fan mountain in Wales. She got so many comments on FB that she said she was somewhat overwhelmed - and her sweet little girl was delighted!And then another older lady posted this picture of her and her friend out walking the other day. So like I said, shame on me if I don't get out there!And finally (God I don't half rattle on don't I - you can tell I live alone can't you), as I was doing some paperwork today it got so hot that I decided to switch the column fan on while I was working. Well that is until I took a closer look at it. Damn, I know no-one has slept in that room for a while but the dust - I swear if I had left it on for long they would have found me rolling around like a tumbleweed somewhere out in the back garden!In my defence, this was after digging around with a screwdriver and a toothbrush for a while!So I was inspired to start doing this out on my balcony where I'd had the foresight to install a table, chair and sun umbrella. Actually why no-one uses their balcony is beyond me but .... So I took out all the screws but even then couldn't get the casing apart so had to go back to digging around with a screwdriver and toothbrush. And then I had the second inspired idea of getting the pressurized air can out - you know, the one you use to clean the dust off your computer keyboard - and all hell let loose!This is just some of the accumulated dust!What maybe wasn't such an inspired idea was standing \"down wind\" while I was doing it, having just got out the shower and applied copious amounts of body lotion. As it was flying out it started sticking to my face and body so I ended up looking like The Amazing Bearded Woman! On a side note, we actually had a bearded woman who lived near us when I was a kid and her name really was Mrs. Skull - but that's a story for another day -  I'm off to get another shower!"},
{"title": "\"Swithering\"!", "date": "Tuesday 11 August 2020", "text": "It rained last night bringing with it slightly cooler air for the evening, which was such a relief. Because it was easier to sleep I woke up feeling rested for once, with a lot more energy than usual. So first thing this morning I decided I was going to make a couple of phone calls I had been putting off because ... because who knows why. They were just the kinds of things you're going to get around to doing sometime and then they keep staring up at you from your to-do list as you transfer them from one list to the next. So I made the first phone call and got that issue sorted in about three minutes, and then I decided I wanted to find out what was going on with my French exam - you know the proficiency exam I was scheduled to sit in spring in connection with my request for French citizenship. While I was looking through my emails to find the name of the test centre, up pops an email from them saying they are opening up on 3 September and she had scheduled me for the first day if it was convenient and if I could get back to her within 20 minutes - otherwise they would put someone else in that slot and reschedule me for a later date! Of course I jumped at it and so now I'm just waiting to find out what time. Hopefully that will be one more thing crossed off the list of things-to-do to become French, although at the rate this is going who knows when that will ever happen!So with that under my belt I decided that I needed to get a few more steps in towards my 1,000 mile goal. Since it was a little cooler I packed a backpack and headed off to the lake at Passy, which was where I was heading a couple of weeks ago and ended up taking the wrong route. Well this time I found it, and it turns out I'd only been 10 minutes away from it the last time I went looking. It's 45 km from home heading in the direction of Italy, and absolutely lovely. While it was quite busy there were loads of parking spaces available and people had plenty of room to spread out and \"social distance\". If you had young kids it is the perfect spot to keep them amused all day and all for the very reasonable price of €2/day for parking!Looking towards the Mont BlancSandy beach at the north end of the lakeFishing is allowed at the south end of the lakeIt took me about 90 minutes to walk all the way round the lake and being flat it was an easy walk. I then spent about an hour sitting on a bench reading and watching the world go by, although I must admit these past couple of days I think I need to stay out the sun again because although I don't sunbathe I can feel myself starting to shrivel up (even more) at the moment!When I got home I found that once again my neighbour was parked in my driveway. I don't know why he does it but it does drive me slightly nuts. They have a single car garage and space for two more cars in front of their house, plus they can easily park six at the back, but I spend half my life waiting for him to move his car off my driveway. I mean, it's not like if they had a house party they would even be stuck for parking spaces because we have plenty of parking in our little housing plan! He used to do it a lot when I was at work and forget to remove it before I got home, but now I'm retired wouldn't you think he would realize I'm unlikely to be gone from my home very long on any given day? The only thing I can think is that his driveway is on a slope and mine is flat - other than that, I've no idea why he does it! Still, if that's the only complaint I have about my neighbours it's not bad really is it, but why he does it I'll never know!Then when I was unpacking my bag another neighbour rang to give me a letter. He is the Chairman of our Homeowners' Association and the bank had sent him the codes for the internet banking I had requested for our homeowners' account and he wanted me, as the Treasurer, to have them. While I was chatting with him I looked over his shoulder and saw smoke pouring up into the sky between two houses. I couldn't see what was on fire but we could hear the fire brigade almost instantly and within a few minutes we could even see the flames. I can't tell what might have been on fire but I hope it wasn't someone's home. I think maybe not, because while the smoke was still billowing this evening they seemed to have it under control pretty quickly, thankfully!And finally, I was checking in with my FB walking group this evening, and one lady was saying that she had been pretty disappointed with her walking this year because of the lockdown, and that even though she was wearing her fitbit she hadn't bothered to check it for ages because she didn't feel that she would have accomplished much. However when she did check it she had nevertheless managed to clock up over 700 miles. So she wrote \"to those of you who are swithering - don't! Get your boots on and go for it\"! Swithering? I had to look that one up, but what a lovely word that is. God I love the English language!"},
{"title": "The calm before the storm!", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2020", "text": "On Friday my friend invited a group of 10 of us over to her place for lunch - a semi-annual tradition it now seems. She is a wonderful cook and she and her husband are gracious hosts. Add to that the fact that their son is a professional pastry chef, I'm sure you can imagine just how good everything was. But boy was it hot! We were in the shade but even so it was still stifling! For the most part we were all retired friends from work, with just two of those present not yet retired - although soon to be doing so. Obviously the chat was (mostly) about work, but we managed to squeeze an awful lot of politics into the afternoon too!Next morning, however, I had a stonking headache which I put down to the heat 'cos I only had one glass of wine, what with having to drive. So I took a couple of aspirin and almost immediately I had some kind of reaction to it, something I've never had before. All of a sudden someone seemed to have turned the faucet on in my nose and I couldn't stop sneezing or blowing my nose. Seriously, I must have had to blow my nose 100 times in 24 hours, but I guess at least with my red nose there could be a job for me at Christmas. To me I wasn't \"ill\" in the sense of getting sick, more like an allergy to something (which I get quite frequently) but the bloody thing went on all day and was really tiring!On Saturday I wanted to go out to buy some sports clothes in the sales because (don't laugh) I really am going to sign up to the local gym come September and my \"exercise clothes\" really are pretty shabby. Trouble was, while I was in the sports shop I had to keep pulling my mask down every couple of minutes to blow my nose. It must have looked really \"weird\" to anyone who noticed me, but I tried to take myself away from other people, even though I knew I wasn't \"sick\" in the sense of covid, but more \"sick\" in the sense of allergies. Still, I was glad to make my purchase and get out of there pretty quickly!Anyway, I've signed up for an online exercise coaching programme and in addition to filling out a questionnaire, one of the things they ask you to do is try three simple exercises so they can gauge where to start you off. Ha, I could have told them absolute beginner without going to that trouble, but I did the three tests anyway with predictable results!The first test was about sitting and rising from a seated position without using your hands or knees! It's harder than it looks and for every hand/knee you use you lose a point, counting down from 10. I managed an eight so not exactly great!The second test was the stand/sit exercise using a chair. Not at all difficult of course, but depending on your age you should do X number of repetitions in 30 seconds. This one, oddly enough, I sailed through. It's an indication of leg strength (apparently) so I was glad to know one part of me was working fairly well!The final test was the burpee. I don't think I need to go into any great detail to let you know how I scored on that one. A resounding zero! So as you can see, I'm going to have my work cut out for me. On the plus side, from here on in, the only way truly is up!The programme starts on 17 August and lasts for 12 weeks so we'll see how that works out - or more precisely, if I can stick to it (for once)!Having logged my walking this week I've somehow managed to get up to 675 miles in 2020, which is something of a miracle, all things considered. However, seeing the posts on FB from the walking group some of the people in the group are clocking up some amazing distances even now. One man named Richard posted that he had started his walking on 2 January (1 January being his wife's birthday and party time), and in that time he has clocked up 2,000 miles and lost five stone (70 lb)! He posted it on FB so I hope he won't mind my reposting it here. Well done Richard, you're pretty darn inspirational!Richard in JanuaryRichard in AugustAll the above notwithstanding, I did bugger all today except lie in my paddling pool reading for about an hour and then spend the rest of the time on the sunbed in the shade. So not many miles achieved today (or for the next few days I imagine). Still, the heat can't go on for ever can it!"},
{"title": "He was a good man!", "date": "Thursday 6 August 2020", "text": "For a few days this week I've had one bloody song going round and round in my head on a permanent loop. Do you ever get that? It's quite a nice song but I won't name it because I don't want to infect you too. Now, finally, it seems to have worn itself out, but just yesterday I read the sad case of a man in Wales who actually committed suicide because of \"last song syndrome\" - or \"earworm\", as it's called (I'd never heard of that expression). The poor guy had suffered with this syndrome for years and could no longer take it, so he put his affairs in order, wrote out a list of where everything was with a letter apologizing to his family - and then took his own life! How sad is that! In other news, about 10 days ago I learned that a former colleague, Larry, had been taken to hospital after suffering a sudden serious medical event. He was placed in an artificial coma, I believe, and when they realized there was no hope his husband gave permission for the respirator to be switched off and Larry died 24 hours ago! He wasn't a friend but a very dear colleague who I worked closely with when he first joined our organization. He was very likeable, extremely humble and never forgot a name. After I changed jobs I no longer worked so closely with him, that is, until I ended up in HR dealing with the medical insurance and we had more contact again. Ha, I remember one time in a meeting he asked if I could get him a copy of a document so I went and made a photocopy for him. Trouble is, I forgot to put the photocopier on recto-verso so he ended up with a document with only the odd pages included. He pointed it out to me while I was taking the minutes so I just said \"apparently Larry will have no comments on pages 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10\" - and he burst out laughing!Our organization was never part of the U.N. system but we applied U.N. common system rules and salary scales and so on, and also used their medical insurance. In 1995 we became a new organization, with a new name but more or less the same tasks so it was decided to leave the common system completely, withdraw from the U.N. pension fund and set up our own rules, regulations, salary scales and medical insurance. Our organization had its headquarters in Geneva and no satellite offices, and since the U.N. system was all $-based it made sense to \"go it alone\", so to speak!I'm paraphrasing an awful lot but by virtue of becoming a new organization, the lease with the Swiss authorities for the building where we were located had to be renegotiated. I'm guessing the Swiss assumed that it was a foregone conclusion that we would stay in Geneva - well that is, until the Germans stepped forward and said \"hey, our parliament has now left Bonn and moved back to Berlin, so we've got an awful lot of office space and apartments we could make available to you if you wanted to move to Bonn\"! Well that put the cat among the pigeons because it wouldn't have just been a question of us moving (we were around 700 staff at that point, I guess), but would have involved many, many country missions dedicated to our organization moving also!!! And that would have been a massive loss for Geneva!Up until that point, the Swiss did not offer work permits to staff members' spouses, so if you had a couple where both were professional people, there was a big disincentive to coming to Geneva knowing that your spouse would not be entitled to work. The German offer, however, meant that negotiations with the Swiss got opened up and much tougher than they anticipated. The Swiss eventually offered to give the organization the building and accepted to give work permits to spouses of staff members across the board - that meant to all U.N. organizations also. It was quite the victory!Now my boss ended up doing the bulk of the legwork for drafting the headquarters agreement, the withdrawal from the U.N. pension fund and setting up our own pension fund - and just for good measure, why not let's negotiate with a new medical insurance provider also? He obviously didn't have enough to do! I was on my knees trying to keep up with all the different versions of agreements that were being negotiated with member States, the Swiss authorities, the U.N. pension fund and the call for tender for the medical insurance. When it all started Jordan was three and André was seven and I was working full-time, trying to get the shopping/cleaning and so on done on a Saturday (because God-forbid any stores should be open on Sundays) and then going in to work for a few hours on Sundays to try to catch up. You can do that for only so long and it very nearly did me in. The plus side, though, was that I got to know the details of all these agreements because I'd typed 100s of drafts of each one!Anyway, just when I thought I could see a light at the end of the tunnel (I didn't realize it was more like a train coming from the opposite direction), Larry brought up the issue of work permits for spouses in same-sex marriages. You see Larry was gay and had been living with his partner for many years. The Swiss, at that time, eventually agreed to recognize common law partners, but only in heterosexual relationships. So Larry and his partner decided to fly off to Canada to get married and then the push was on to have same sex spouses recognized by the Swiss, the pension fund, the medical insurance and the staff rules. So just when I thought I was coming up for air, off we go again. I absolutely agreed with what Larry was trying to do, but I do remember asking him if we could have a Sunday afternoon off from manning the barricades just this once as I was on my knees and he laughed. I also remember him telling me that he didn't realize he was gay until he was 36 so I just said \"damn, you were a bit slow weren't you\" and he said \"yeah, that's what my mom always said\". But in the end it all worked out, and he (and many others) were able to get their spouses recognized in the same way as heterosexual spouses were!I remember one time, when André was probably about five, I had brought him in to work with me after school to wait so I could take him home later. Larry got chatting to him and asking about school, and André said that he had gotten 19/20 on his spelling test, his only mistake being he spelled \"chops\" as \"thops\" and Larry cracked up. (As a side note, my kids must both have had problems with spelling words with \"ch\" in them, because one time when Jordan was little he had to come up with five words with \"ch\" in them. So I pointed at my chin and he wrote that one down. Then I pointed at a piece of cheese - and he wrote that one down. Then I asked him what a teacher wrote on a blackboard with - so we got number three. Then all of a sudden he went \"oh I've got one mommy - chruck\")! Anyway a couple of months later I had taken André to his Saturday morning swimming lesson at a pool in Geneva where Larry regularly went swimming. After the lesson I spotted Larry in the cafeteria so I told André to go over to him and say \"hi Larry, how are you\" - which he did! The look of horror on Larry's face at being approached by a little boy at a swimming pool made me realize immediately what I'd done, so I quickly got up and went and sat at his table. His relief was palpable when he realized it was André!And so the news of Larry's death has come out and people are sending in tributes because he was universally liked. One guy just wrote in how Larry would often sign his emails \"your humble servant\" and he commented that wasn't that the truth. He really was a humble - and very likeable - guy. So RIP Larry, you were a good man!"},
{"title": "What a difference a day makes!", "date": "Monday 3 August 2020", "text": "Or what a difference two days make really. Saturday was scorching hot and if I remember right hit 40°. They had forecast storms but we didn't get any - they were saving themselves for Sunday apparently. Even then it was fine during the day, hot enough to sit in the garden and read, and the storms hit late afternoon. It obviously rained during the night although I didn't hear it, but this morning it was so much cooler only reaching 14°C today! So a drop in temperature of 26° in just over 24 hours. I suppose it's no wonder people get sick is it!It's forecast to head back up again starting tomorrow (I think) and then hit the high temperatures towards the end of the week. It's weird (or maybe not), but as soon as the temperatures start dropping I feel my \"oomph\" coming back and today was no exception. I made a point of being in bed by midnight so I would be up and running by 8 a.m. I've made a long list of all the things I neglected last week so will be trying to knock at least one of those off each day. I took a trip down to the recycling centre first thing and even though it was raining I then decided to head out to Thyez to get a walk in too. This is my \"go to\" walk for when I don't want to go up the mountains, and with more storms forecast I definitely didn't want to go up the mountains. So in the space of an hour I got a nice walk along the river bank and around the small lake there to add 10,000 steps to my daily challenge. Except for the fact that my hair turned to frizz it was a lovely walk and definitely the right thing to do, but then do you ever regret going for a walk? Honestly I don't know what to do with my hair because as soon as it gets damp it turns to frizz and I end up looking like a bedraggled rat. I was thinking on the way home that if I really do intend to join a local gym in September I'm going to have to come up with something to do with this mop because I don't want to end up looking like Harpo Marx having a bad hair day!When I got home I thought \"right, that's it, first task on the list - I'm gonna call the IRS\". André received his stimulus cheque about two months ago but Jordan hasn't seen hide nor hair of his and has got it into his head that he won't get one now! The only thing we can think of is that he moved in November so potentially it was sent to the wrong address, the French post office didn't forward it and it was returned to the IRS. I tried tracking it through their site using both addresses but each time it comes up as \"information not available\". So I decided there was nothing for it but to call them. The first couple of times, after going through their spiel, they told me to hold for more information, and after five minutes of total silence I hung up. The third time I did manage to get the \"more information\" never-ending loop so I decided that come what may I was indeed going to hold and keep holding. In the end I finally got through to a very helpful lady after 20 minutes (so I reckon Jordan will owe me half his stimulus cheque just for that phone call as I believe 800 numbers called from outside the States are not free). But at least I got through!The lady on the other end was not able to go into specifics so I explained what had happened and what our thinking was. She told me that the stimulus cheques were processed on the basis of 2018 filings (so they would have Jordan's old address), but since he has filed for 2019 already his address should have been updated. Apparently the \"information not available\" message is just a standard response and I should keep checking until I see a \"processing\" or \"processed\" response - but that could take up to Christmas as they still have millions to complete. Failing that I could fill out a form 3911 to trace it but either way it wasn't \"lost\", as if all else failed he can claim it when he completes his 2020 taxes next year. I know I should leave this stuff to him really but he has no idea about US taxes and I don't mind doing it anyway. Still, it's money neither of the kids were expecting so if/when it does come it will be a bonus!Today was André's first day back in the office and he said he just sailed through in 45 minutes. I told him not to get too confident as quite a few people were still working from home and it was vacation time for many others anyway, but at least he isn't starting back to work with a nightmare commute immediately. He wants to come over tomorrow night so I can go through his divorce paperwork with him, to see if I can think of anything he has missed. He will also bring his codes for his Swiss ebanking and I will show him how to do that too. It was funny because when we all went out to lunch on Saturday he went into his bedroom and came back out with a few euros from his \"spending money\" and said he actually likes the envelope system I had him set up because he can see what's what and what he has available to spend. From looking at my French bank on pay day I can see that he has indeed started sending money to his French bank account (hopefully restoring his reputation with them), and putting money into separate savings accounts to save for his own place. Hallelujah, I finally got through to him - I guess the old ways still work then!My ex called me this morning (mid-day our time, 6 a.m. his time) and I asked him what the heck he was doing up so early. He said he now goes to bed around 9 p.m. (?????) so he gets up early too. That is definitely not the man I was married to, nor is the fact that he has put on 50 lbs since he stopped smoking either, but I guess it's better to have the extra lbs than the tar stained lungs isn't it. In any case, he was so skinny anyway that he actually doesn't look bad with all that extra padding!Like me he's delighted with Jordan and Jen's news and we chatted for a while about family. Then he told me that he might send André $1,000 \"to help him out\". So I said, \"er I don't really want to butt in here (but I will anyway), but can I make a suggestion and encourage you to split that in two and send $500 to each kid? André on his own makes more than Jordan and Jen together, he's starting to put money into savings and he's living rent-free with Jordan and Jen - who've just told you they're expecting a baby, so don't you think they might be hurt if you send money to André and nothing to them?\" He said he hadn't even thought of it that way and indeed that's what he's going to do. Damn I'm glad I caught him before he did something stupid!And finally, talking of losing weight (we were weren't we), I am indeed going to join a gym in La Roche in September (when it's cooler) because I want to learn how to use the weight machines properly. I can do all that at the work's gym and pretty much have the place to myself but driving into Geneva obviously isn't working out so well so I think it'll have to be La Roche instead. Anyway, having got in a one hour walk today and been careful with what I was preparing for food, I decided to log it into Myfitnesspal to see if I was calculating calories/portion sizes properly (I'm getting better at it, but it's surprising how the \"little things\" can add up too). Anyway, once I input all my info and hit save, Myfitnesspal indicated that if the next five weeks were like today I would lose eight pounds - so there you have it! Just gotta keep going for the next eight weeks to find out!"},
{"title": "En avi eh ay et mami!", "date": "Saturday 1 August 2020", "text": "Or at least that's what I heard. Jen had called me a couple of days ago to have lunch with them today so I tootled off over to St. Jeoire to be there by 12, which is the time I usually have lunch with André. Turns out they were in the middle of a game of \"Big Mouth\" so we had time for them to kill before our 12.30 reservation!Big Mouth!It's a game we have played before where you put a plastic mouth shield in your mouth and try to say a sentence and your team mates have to guess it. Well André was in full flow when I got there and absolutely doubled up. It was lovely to see actually, given how rotten his life must have seemed to him lately!Anyway they then decided I had to have a go - which went ok but really - weren't we due at the restaurant soon? Ok soon, but Jordan had to finish up - so I got this!And what was I supposed to guess from?\"on avi eh a et ami\"! So no bloody clue right! I went back and forth and am thinking privately (when are we going to head out for lunch)?So I get on avi (en avril - in April)\"eh a et ami\" (je vais être) and then I couldn't get \"ami\". We kept going back and forth and I still couldn't get it. It did cross my mind that it was weird that André was filming me when it was Jordan that had the plastic doo-dads in his mouth, but ... what can I say! Eventually I came up with \"en avril je vais être mamie\" -  which means \"in April I will be a grandma\"! The buggers. I held it in as best as I could but dammit, I blubbed a little. The funniest thing was it was André who seemed to be the most excited. Well Jen was of course, but Jordan is a worrier so André was all hyped up and Jordan was well, \"oh damn what have I done?\". But I'm delighted. It's early days yet but I knew it was coming at some point (God willing). But damn, I'm ready to explode I'm so happy!Because she's so tiny Jen is already starting to show - and is already starting with nausea. Damn I remember that with my first - on the metro in D.C. with a plastic bag in my hand trying not to disgust the yuppie lawyer sat next to me by barfing in his lap. Fingers crossed that all goes well. I'm fit to explode with happiness!And just to illustrate my happiness, a member of my 1,000 miles in 2020 group posted this photo of him skipping with his granddaughter - a real \"Eric and Ernie moment\"! \"Bring me sunshine ...\"!"},
{"title": "Damn it's hot!", "date": "Thursday 30 July 2020", "text": "It hit 40°C here today (104F). It can and does get up to 45 - not for long, admittedly, but damn it's miserable! Yesterday I drove over to see my friend. I had a second birthday gift that arrived after his birthday so we arranged to meet up and have lunch together. After that, since I'm on a \"walking\" drive, I suggested we went out walking. Now he lives at the foot of the Jura mountains, which are absolutely beautiful. They are totally different to the alps - more brooding whereas the alps are more majestic, in my opinion - but he never goes up there to walk. He walks much more than I do but not in the mountains. While we were walking he commented that \"this is uphill\" - er nah, it was the equivalent of one step up - but then he's 13 years older than me so I guess whatever works for him. That being said, after about 30 minutes he took one look at my face (remember \"puce\") and said \"let's go back, you look dreadful\"! So we made our way back to his place where I stripped off and had an ice cold shower. I told you I looked bad when I walk. That being said, for a couple of months it is really miserable here. The heat is appalling and we generally don't have AC so we put up with it. I've had a couple of cold showers already today so we'll see how it goes tonight. I also made the mistake of telling him I'd like to lose 17 kg (40lbs) by Christmas so I'm guessing he's gonna hold my feet to the fire!In other news, I don't know if it's due to covid or just in general but by golly there are a lot of bees and butterflies around at the moment. I have a buddleia (arbre à papillons - a butterfly tree) by my front door and it is heaving with butterflies and bees right now - just so lovely. I asked my friend if he had noticed and he agreed there really were a lot more butterflies, at least, now than previously.In my bid to switch to a more vegetarian/vegan lifestyle I ordered two bottles of vitamins (mainly B12) off Amazon the other day, as I understand B12 is one of the main vitamins likely to be missing if you switch to a vegan diet. Trouble is, when I opened my mailbox the Amazon parcel was in very poor shape and there was only one bottle in the package. So I contacted Amazon to explain my problem and I have to say their customer service was excellent. I explained that it was a \"packing\" problem as far as I could see, but the young woman got back to me and told me to keep the one bottle I had but that they would credit me the entire amount! I replied that I had indeed received one bottle but she said not to worry, and bingo they credited me back the entire amount. Now say what you like about big business (and I'm all for supporting small businesses) but their customer service is excellent. Well done Amazon!And I mentioned my ex's FB page yesterday - well guess what? Today I got a \"friend request\" from what would appear to be a newly-created FB page by my ex. I have no idea what he's doing (he was probably three sheets to the wind when he created it anyway), but he got his date of birth right except that he put that he was born in 1992 - the year our second son was born. I just deleted it. I don't think it's a scam but I do wonder why he is creating a second FB page in the first place. Hmmmmm! Maybe all isn't well in schmoopieland!Then just a few minutes ago I got a call from Jen asking if I would like to have lunch with them all on Saturday (of course I would) and André asked if I would go through his divorce paperwork with him to see that he hadn't missed anything. No problem there for me - I read everything before I sign it anyway - and so should he!And finally, I may be a bit late to the party but I just discovered Jordan Rabjohn on Youtube. I tried posting a video on here but it doesn't seem to work. Anyway, if you can be bothered, look up this young man. He is a talented singer and musician - but his mother's voice is out of this world - something he readily admits! Try listening to \"Rise up\" by Jordan Rabjohn. They seem to have a lovely relationship. He definitely has the gift of the gab and she seems like so much fun. Damn, I wish I had a talent or a passion like that!"},
{"title": "The road not taken!", "date": "Tuesday 28 July 2020", "text": "My ex and I can still see each other's FB posts but to be honest neither of us post that much. It's just a way, for me at least, to keep in touch with friends and family. I post once in a while - just things that interest me or maybe shots of the kids so that my family can see what's going on in our lives. He tends not to post for a while and then maybe 3-4 posts in one night. And sometimes I just shake my head at what he posts! Not so long ago he did the \"ooo-raa marine corps\" thing praising a bunch of female US soldiers. Trouble was, even I could see that they weren't American soldiers - they were Israelis. There's no way the US would have allowed the pony tails and scruffy appearance on these ladies (who were probably doing their military service), and somebody pointed that out to him. Then yesterday he posted another \"drively\" post about 18 year olds - then and now. Then (during WWII) 18 year olds (and younger) went off to war. Now 18 year olds - the snowflake generation (dixit my ex) - would always seem to be mortally wounded if someone stares at them the wrong way. So the post said something like \"During WWII this 18 year old would have landed at Normandy, while today's 18 year old will probably have a nervous breakdown if his iphone won't work\". Not totally word-for-word but you get the gist of it. I had to laugh when someone commented on his post saying that he doubted very much that the then 18 year old ever saw Normandy because it was a Russian soldier!!! Oh dear, I do wish he wouldn't post such drivel - or at least think about it beforehand! Still, it's not my problem if he looks a fool is it. I also hate the FB posts where people post something \"sensitive\" and then say \"share if you dare\" or \"I bet you won't share this\". Well they got that right because I never share those posts. Like how we're supposedly no longer allowed to say \"merry Christmas\" but will be obliged to say \"happy holidays\" in future. It's all a bunch of crap but so many people quote this stuff as if it's the Bible! I remember reading once about how the EU had supposedly invoked health and safety concerns in order to oblige \"all trapeze artists to wear a crash helmet\", by law. It was all a crock of ... made up by a bunch of drunken journalists in a bar in Brussels! Moral of this story? Don't believe, or better yet, don't repost all the crap you read on FB!Anyway, on to other things. Despite my best intentions I yet again did not get up at the crack of dawn to go walking (no surprise there then). On Sunday the kids went to a place called the lac de Passy, which is probably 20-30 minutes down the road from Jordan and Jen. It's really lovely apparently and since I reckon I've never been there I decided that would be the destination for my walk today. Trouble is, I must have typed too many \"ass\"es into my GPS so instead of ending up at the lac de Passy I ended up at the Plâteau d'Assy! Nothing seriously wrong with that but it really wasn't where I was heading. If memory serves me right I last went up to the Plâteau d'Assy about 10 years ago in my camper van. My ex took our camper in the divorce (I got the kids) and so I bought myself a second-hand one for my own use. It ended up being a waste of money actually because my heart was no longer in it and in any case going camping on my own wasn't really my idea of fun. Nevertheless I did spend a couple of nights up at the plâteau and it was just fabulous to wake up to such a wonderful view, even if I had no-one to share it with! From there you get a full on view of the Mont Blanc and it is just breath taking!You can't see it because of the cloud, but the Mont Blanc isbehind the darker mountain to the right!The Mont Blanc stands at 4,810 metres(pity you can't see it - you can just see it's snow \"apron\")!I had packed a small backpack with water, sunscreen and so on but when I got out the car I realized that I had once again left my hiking boots by the front door! Bloody hell! Here I was all ready to go and all I had on my feet was a pair of flipflops! So what do you do? I knew that there was a pretty little lake just a little further down the road so I figured I'd take the risk of looking like a tourist and toddle down there for a stroll, but sticking to the roads as I didn't dare risk my flipflops on the proper hiking trail. It was actually pretty busy down at the lake oddly enough, but with most of the cars being registered out of state!Le Lac Vert - the green lakeAs it had been threatening storms all afternoon I decided I had better head back up to the plâteau and oddly enough I found it easier going back uphill than going downhill - my footwear might have had something to do with that! Again, as usual, the first 10 minutes are hard and then I get into the swing of it - I just wish I didn't go quite so puce in the face though. You know how people with fair skin get that bright red thing going, well what with that and the sweat pouring off me I had the look of an electrified tomato by the time I got to the top, despite not feeling bad at all! I just looked like I was going to have a coronary!On the way back up!When I was almost at the top I noticed this car with Dutch licence plates. I'd noticed the \"tent on top of the car\" on the way down but on the way back I realized that there really was a fully set up tent on the roof of the car with a ladder leading to the top for them to climb in! I say \"them\" but in fact it turned out to be just one Dutch lady (as I deduced by the fact that there was only one bike and one bike rack) so she must have been travelling around on her own. I don't know if I'd ever be mad enough to do something like that (I like to think I would), but hats off to her anyway. Then I had all the \"where does she wash if she isn't in a camp site\" thing going on, but I'm sure she's got all that covered - the Dutch usually do!Yep, her sleeping quarters are actually on top of the car!Anyway, as a reward for my endeavours I sat and had a glass of wine while admiring the view and reading my book. A French lady about the same age as me, or maybe a little younger, sat at the table next to me and also had a glass of wine while reading her book. Sadly that's where the similarities ended because she had all the right hiking gear (anti-sweat, anti-rain, anti-just about everything), she wasn't puce in the face and her hair just looked \"casually windswept\"! I said au revoir to her as I got up to leave, desperately hoping she wouldn't notice my sweaty back and that my flipflops wouldn't make the same farting noise they'd made all the way back up the road! No such luck! God, sometimes I hate the French!"},
{"title": "Hot, hot, hot!", "date": "Monday 27 July 2020", "text": "No surprise there but it's bloody hot. Yesterday I thought I'd finally better get in my \"pool\" (ha, ha) in order to clean the bottom of it. I've kept up with the chlorine and ran the filter but there were still a few leaves and things that needed scraping off the bottom so in I went - and very pleasant it was too. Pleasant, if not pretty! That being said, it was hot and I can definitely feel the heat on my skin now, even though I was only in there about 30 minutes. When I got out I sat on my sunbed (in the shade) to read (more like nod off actually) when all of a sudden I heard a whoosh and a small bird had fallen into the pool. He was struggling to get out so I very gently reached in, lifted him out and sat him down under a bush - and the frickin' black and white cat that I bloody hate screeched in and ripped his head off! Bloody thing - I hate that cat! I don't hate all cats, in fact next door's adopted feral cat is gorgeous, but there's something about this one that I didn't like from the beginning, and ripping that poor bird's head off did nothing to endear him to me!As for the rest of this post, it's just a mish-mash of thoughts because that's the way my brain is working at the moment! I see the troll/bots are out and about again. Just in case, no I do not want to join the illuminati and as for Mr. \"Die Boomers Die\" - just piss off you inadequate little twat. I've said before I imagine him to be a 40 year old virgin sitting in his underpants in mommy's basement spewing his venom as and when. It won't get through anyway but keep on truckin' sunshine!In other news, did anyone else see the lovely news item about the female teacher in a slum area of Brazil who was going round visiting/checking up on her students and bringing them bags of candy? What a lovely lady, but you know, when you see how these children live and what children in wealthier parts have without necessarily being any happier, it puts things in perspective somewhat doesn't it!I was reading on CNN the other day about the horrific murder of three friends out fishing in Florida. I guess it caught my eye because it was in Polk County and that was where our home was located. It's hard to imagine the cruelty of the three perpetrators isn't it, but when you consider that the 26 year old ringleader already has 260 felony offences against him maybe it's not so hard to imagine after all!The local bus company I have done so many trips with seems to be up and running again and organizing outings, but so far most of the trips are places I've already been and/or am happy to drive to anyway. I'm looking forward to booking a vacation at some point in the future but don't particularly want to do it just yet as (a) it's lovely here in summer and relatively uncrowded, and (b) I'd rather give this pandemic \"thingy\" time to calm down, so maybe next spring. Who knows! And talking of this \"pandemic thingy\", I'm currently reading a book called Eating Animals by Jonathan Saran Foer which was written in 2009. I'm not sure if he's a vegan or a vegetarian but it's a very well-researched book making the case against factory farming (of course) and for going meat-free - which is something that interests me more and more. Check out this one sentence which, as I say, was written in 2009:\"The second public health concern is the more particular one: humans are setting the conditions for the creation of the superpathogen of all superpathogens, a hybrid virus that could cause a repeat, more or less, of the Spanish flu of 1918.\"More and more I'm becoming convinced that going meat-free is the way to go, both from a health point of view, an anti-cruelty point of view and in order to help heal the environment (as much as that can be achieved at this point). I'm not ready to go vegan yet but I'm very interested in and somewhat convinced by the arguments for it so who knows. So to that end, for the last 10 days I've been eating 100% vegetarian. I've done it before on a couple of occasions many years ago and felt so good that I wonder why I ever went back to eating meat. More to the point, I feel like meat today - even organic meat - tastes like nothing unless jizzed up with sauces, because of the crap that is pumped into the animal and the stress caused due to the inhumane conditions in which so many of them live. I love fruit, veg and pulses anyway so skipping the meat hasn't been difficult, although I've gone off the idea of making my own \"burgers\" out of black beans and what have you. All that combining stuff just ends up looking like different coloured mush to me, so every day I've been making a different vegetarian dish and just adding it to the fridge downstairs. Black bean and garlic tofu, sweet and sour braised aubergine (really good), dry potato curry, garlic mushrooms. It's working out quite well at the moment, although there's quite a preponderance of garlic so it's probably just as well I live alone right? I'm not going to be really strict about whether, or for how long, I continue eating like this, but I'm certainly having no difficulties at the moment so we'll see!The lady at the Mairie was as good as her word and hand-delivered both André and my attestations of residence the other day so that's one more thing crossed off André's list. He dropped his car off at Ford on Friday because it's going to need some work for it to pass the contrôle technique (roadworthiness certificate) so he asked to borrow my car to go into Geneva on Friday night. I tell ya, I was so glad when my kids moved out because I finally got to sleep properly without having one ear out for them coming home. Not that he slept at my place of course, but since he was out in my car I didn't turn my phone to \"do not disturb\" that night just in case!! I know, how daft is that? He moved out 10 years ago and I haven't worried about him since, but once a mother always a mother I guess!In other news I'm dead impressed with my medical insurance. I submitted my gynae and dentist bills, plus a bill for prescription medication on Wednesday morning via phone app and by Thursday morning I'd received the reimbursement in my bank account! Gosh that's efficient!I'd also like to do a shout out to Cheapchick and Ms Moon, both of whom are going through health difficulties at the moment. Sending you both good vibes ladies!And finally, on checking my walking log for 2020 I've actually gone over 1,000 km walked in 2020 so far despite the lockdown. Now 1,000 km is not 1,000 miles of course (I need to add another 600 km to get there) but I'm quite proud all the same considering I didn't go out walking at all during lockdown. Today I decided to take a drive over to see André at Jordan's place as I had made a 7-layer salad that they all like and then planned to go up to a place called les Brasses. But, it was 37°C (98°F) when I left André so decided it would be pretty stupid to head up to the mountains and almost certain sunstroke in that heat. Instead I drove up to a pretty little lake nearby called lac de la Tour and walked round that instead as half of it is in the shade. After about an hour's walk I got back to the parking lot and spotted a little drinks stand so decided to sit there for a while. So over a glass of white wine I sat and read my book or watched the people playing crazy golf or boules. It's a lovely little spot because it's out of the way and not exactly touristy. So I'm pleased to say I got 12,000 steps in today towards my next 600 km all the while feeling like I was actually on vacation. Who knows, maybe I'll have a shot at going on a different walk every day this week to try to make up for missed opportunities!Playing boules off to the leftLac de la Tour"},
{"title": "Keep on truckin'!", "date": "Thursday 23 July 2020", "text": "There's not a lot going on here at the moment. It's hot (in the 30s/90s) but at least it's not humid like in Geneva, and if I sit upstairs in my TV room I can get a through breeze going by opening my windows which is quite pleasant (so far). Still, I tend to lose my oomph in this weather so there's a lot of reading in the back garden going on too. At least in this weather I put my washing out this morning and by the time I was showered and ready to go grocery shopping everything was bone dry. It's a definite plus!I stopped in at the Fresh store in Bonneville first thing and man do I love that store. As the name suggests, they only sell fresh items, so no canned goods, washing powder or stuff like that, but all their goods are reasonably priced and absolutely beautiful. After picking up a few other things in my regular store I stopped down at the Thursday morning market in town for a wander and then walked up to the home of my former neighbours to drop off a gift for their new baby. A couple of years ago they moved into central La Roche, just a five minute walk from the train station which, in retrospect was a very smart move. When I first visited their house I didn't really like it from the outside. In fact, seeing only the outside I wouldn't even have bothered to set up a viewing as it looks really drab. However, once you get inside the house it is spread out over three floors, with really quiet, spacious and airy rooms and the back garden has a lovely view of the River Foron and the mountains behind my house - and I'm really impressed. It just goes to show I guess, that you really can't tell a book by its cover. Sylvie and Pierre have two older children (currently staying with grandparents) and the latest little one who is just 12 days old and a real little peanut. Very pretty but so tiny! So I asked Pierre how it was working out for him catching the train into Geneva every day and was blown away when he said that at the moment he's cycling in!!!! Say what??? It's 30 km from home to work and he says it takes him about 75 minutes in the morning and around 90 in the evening, the advantage of where they live being that if he is tired he can always catch the train back in the evening. It's so weird because I was telling him that I was getting fairly frequent dreams (well nightmares actually) for a while wherein I had cycled in to work in the morning (ha, as if) and then was really struggling to ride home! If there's a significance to those dreams I haven't figured it out yet. Anyway, Pierre was telling me that he had bought himself a new, lightweight bike to take advantage of the offer being made by the town of a €400 credit to all locals in order to encourage them to cycle. Now I had read vaguely that La Roche was offering a credit to all taxpayers (which includes me) on any new bike bought at one of three local cycle shops, but I hadn't given it much thought. Who knows - maybe I will look it up. This year, cycling from my village to the next (about 5 km) and next year - who knows - Tour de France here I come!On Tuesday we were forewarned that the mains water was going to be turned off as they were replacing all our water meters. I was told that they would be coming to my place at 2.15 p.m. so I was rather glad that I had got up and showered early as they knocked on my door at 8.30 a.m. I was also glad I had filled up a few bottles of water the night before, as well as a bucket to flush the toilet with as I was without water until 4 p.m. It only took 10 minutes to change my meter but the young man that did mine realized I was a Brit and wanted to practice speaking English so off we went. Now his English was pretty good and he was really sweet, but maybe his English wasn't quite as good as I thought because going on for 4 p.m. I mentioned to my neighbour that it was taking a long time to put the water back on and she said \"it's been on since mid-day\" - he hadn't quite got the message across that after they'd turned the mains back on I had to go down to my basement and turn it back on myself!Then last night I actually got round to watching the final episode of The Sopranos. I enjoyed the series although my goodness it was violent and their treatment of the women in their lives - whether it be the strippers, their mistresses or their wives - was truly appalling. I suspect that was the way it really was - and maybe still is. Who knows! But apart from the violence I enjoyed it for the most part and while Tony Soprano was a sociopathic monster James Gandolfini managed to portray a more vulnerable side to him as well. But the point of mentioning all this is that in the very last episode they are in the middle of all-out gang warfare and Tony Soprano is just waiting for them to come for him. In the last scene the Soprano family are meeting up to eat in a diner and Tony Soprano finally gets killed - or maybe he doesn't! You don't know because they leave you on a cliffhanger. Quite by chance I happened to see a couple of Youtube clips explaining what this last scene was all about and it was really interesting. They pointed out that every time a new person walked into the diner the bell over the door rang - and Tony looked up because he was on edge. When one young man walked in, he walked full-on into the camera, that being the way (apparently) that the director shows the importance of that particular character. Then they changed camera angles and showed where Tony's daughter should have been sitting - and indeed would have been sitting if she hadn't had trouble parking her car, and the fact that she was delayed left any would-be killer with a free shot at Tony. I guess I had always just kinda thought \"oh you point the camera and the director shouts action\", but the way they explained all these Hitchcock-esque manipulations and how they lead the viewer down one line of thinking or another was really interesting. I suppose I hadn't given it much thought before but I never realized just how much goes into making a good movie!And finally, a US blogger whose blog I really enjoy has started putting out Hallowe'en decorations (!!!) and said that she had already received her first Hallowe'en catalogues in the mail! Say what??? I can't believe it - surely not. Here's me sweating cobs in rural France and now I'm being reminded it's only how many days to Christmas?"},
{"title": "Contentment!", "date": "Monday 20 July 2020", "text": "Yesterday I decided it was going to be a day for doing not much at all. My idea of heaven is to spend a day reading and I think I'm finally getting there. I had made a few dishes a couple of days before while experimenting so I didn't even have to think about cooking - so it was bum on seat and off you go. I swear I spent four hours reading on Sunday, all the while knowing I didn't have to be anywhere or do anything - and it was lovely, although I still have that \"guilty\" thingy going on for some reason!While I was reading my neighbour wandered over and said that her daughter, Mathilde, had invited me down for an apéro and if I was interested they would be going down to her house at around 4 pm. To put this in perspective, when I had my second son this neighbour, Marylène, approached me and asked if I would be interested in having her look after him when I went back to work. Now I would have given my right arm to stay home with my kids but it wasn't to be since I earned more than my ex-husband and it was me that had all the expat benefits. So I jumped at the chance. Initially I thought I would be jealous but when I saw how happy he was with her and her family and how much he was loved all that jealousy vaporized. Now she and her husband had two children who were 12 and 14 when Jordan was born - Mathilde (12) and Seb (14) so Jordan grew up with them as older brothers and sisters. And so did André actually, since when I was at work during the summer holidays they looked after both kids. So both my kids grew up knowing and loving this family!Anyway, in January of this year Mathilde married an Englishman, Ben, who she met at work in Switzerland, so when they got married Ben had to go through the whole \"post-Brexit\" shenanigans of moving from Switzerland to France to move into the home he and Mathilde had bought together. So the other day André was saying to me how complicated it was importing his car into France from Switzerland so I told him to give Ben a call. He was just a couple of months ahead of André and could tell him what he had had to do to get his car and belongings into France. So long story short, Mathilde and Ben invited Jordan, Jen and André for lunch on Sunday. The house that they had bought had a swimming pool so when we got there the atmosphere was fairly popping!Now Ben's dad, Chris, has lived in France for about 20 years I guess, further south, in a lovely area near Montpellier where I studied when I was 19. Ben's mom died last year of lung cancer so Chris has spent more time \"further north\" with Ben to overcome his loneliness. Anyway, when I got there Chris and André were in full throttle talking about UK/US politics and Chris was absolutely cracked up laughing. I had forgotten how funny André could be, to be honest. Well both of them. André and Jordan are great mimics and very politically minded so if you think \"Talking Heads\", you've got a rough idea of what they're like!Anyway, I sat with Chris for a while as we discussed the merits (none) of Brexit for us Brits in France and then I asked him how he was doing. He told me ok, but that he missed something. So I said, \"I bet that's human touch isn't it?\" and he said \"what made you say that?\" So I said, \"that's what my brother said after losing his wife of 51 years\"! So he and I got to talking and he ended up crying laughing when I told him my stories of internet dating. Now, it's different for me, I'm divorced and was very happy to be so, but he was widowed so not the same thing. So I told him that I had a very good experience of internet dating, meeting maybe eight guys for dinner or just a coffee, with just one weirdo. So we ended up composing an internet dating profile for him and he just cracked up. I don't know if he will use it but it certainly felt good to make him laugh again!So today I decided to take a trip down to Annecy to go shopping. The other day, at our AGM, I learned that our former neighbours had had a new baby that very day (he's French, she's German) so I wanted to get a gift for them and thought Annecy would be the place to go. Actually, while Geneva is beautiful, I still think Annecy is more stunning. Trouble is, while it is stunning, it also gets very crowded along the lake so when the lockdown was lifted the Mayor of Annecy very wisely (in my opinion) decided to delay lifting lockdown around the lake until it could be determined how the virus was evolving. OK, whether people went into the mountains or not was outside his remit, but the lake definitely was. And so the lake was beautiful - but abandoned for the time being. But now, it's open to everyone so off I went for a wander and God it's beautiful!Lake AnnecyThe \"pointy\" building is the old prison, first mentionedin 1325!Château de Menthon Saint Bernard, above lake AnnecySo after a wander round central Annecy I headed off to the hypermarket there to get a few things I can't get locally. I do this maybe a couple of times a year but I don't think I would bother more often. I know my local supermarkets/markets and can't see me heading down to Annecy to go grocery shopping in order to save a couple of euros.When I arrived there there was a big sign saying that masks were mandatory. Apparently they have become mandatory since today (20 July) but since I don't have French TV I didn't realize. Anyway, not to worry, as I had a couple of masks in my bag. Again, what I hadn't realized until I looked it up, is that now it is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed public spaces, otherwise the fines start at €135 a pop. Good on them, I don't have a problem with that. My only problem is that since I don't have French TV I might have missed it. Oh well!As I was driving back home I realized how relaxed I was, and how much I appreciate not having to rush anywhere any more - one of the great joys of being retired I guess. So then I sat out in my garden reading and I realized how much I had missed the buzzing of the bees and the amazing butterflies that are now coming round my back terrace. Maybe due to the lockdown and no more pollution - who knows!"},
{"title": "Feral People!", "date": "Saturday 18 July 2020", "text": "Last night we held our latest board game evening up at Valérie's house, which is in the shadow of the Môle mountain. Her house is at 1,200 metres altitude so we knew it would be chillier up there, but although the sky was cloudy the peaceful bucolic atmosphere was just lovely. Her partner, Marc, had taken himself off hiking and was intending to camp overnight further up the mountain (they are both avid walkers/hikers) so it was just Valérie and one of her daughters - Marianne - who, it turns out, was an absolute blast!Isabelle and I were asking Valérie how long it took to hike up the Môle and she said she could make it up to the Petit Môle in about 30 minutes, and the Grand Môle in about an hour - so you can probably double that for me then! Jordan and Jen live in St. Jeoire, which is on the other side of the Môle, and while it's not a particularly high mountain it's not the easiest of hikes, so if I'm thinking of going up there I'll need to get some practice in I should think. Anyway, once again there was waayyy too much food but we had a lovely evening, getting home at around 2 a.m. and with me getting to bed at 3 a.m.!The MôleI guess it's just as well we only do this occasionally, as I still had to be up this morning in order for me and André to go to the Mairie in my village to register him as living in France before the \"Brexit\" deadline expires on 31 December. Anyway, I made it to the Mairie on very little sleep and explained André's situation to her - that he was getting divorced and moving back in to France and we needed to register my home as his new place of residence for the time being. She was very nice and said she would do us both an attestation - my last one is now about six months old - but she would need a photocopy of André's ID. So he whips out his US passport! When I asked where his British passport was he said he thought he must have forgotten it at Jordan and Jen's!!! So the upshot was she asked him to email her a copy of his British passport and she would prepare the attestations and drop them in my mailbox since it was on her way home! Isn't that nice - it's definitely one of the benefits of living in a small village!So we came back to my place for lunch and I went through his budget with him so he could get a better handle on how things will work out financially both before and after he gets his own place. It's not that he's stupid but he always left \"all that\" to Lily - which is always a big mistake, I think, for only one person to know what's going on with the finances. Then he was rummaging though the mess of papers in his backpack while we were writing out a list of \"next moves\" and he pulled out a photocopy of his British passport saying he'd have to give that to the Mairie in Switzerland when he informed them he was moving out! So I said \"oh the British passport you didn't have one hour ago to give to the lady at the French Mairie\"? and he went \"oh crap\" and dashed back off there just in time to give her a copy before closing! Kids!!! Still, at that point I'd already put together a folder for him with different tabs so he should find it easier to work his way through all this now that his papers are in order. I don't actually think he's thick - I think it's just that he's finding it a bit overwhelming at the moment. Well, that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it!In other news, my friend and her sister are off to Spain on Monday house-hunting. Her sister had been married to an American (now divorced) and living in New Hampshire these past 20-odd years. Having just been made redundant (as a Spanish teacher) and with her last child now enlisted in the US Air Force, she decided now was the time to move back to Europe as she had always wanted to go back to Spain to live. Then of course, Brexit intervened, followed by bloody covid, so instead of flying out to Spain in March she has been stuck here in France with my friend for the last seven months. Anyway, as they are heading to Spain on Monday so that she can establish residence before 31 December, I went over to pick up my friend's house keys as our local commune is replacing all our water meters on Tuesday. Can you believe it, her sister brought her beloved labrador dog over with her from the States, he survived the flight and has been having a whale of a time walking in the mountains while they've been blocked here. But, three days ago the dog became really lethargic and suddenly developed lumps on his haunches so they took him to the vet in town and it turns out pup had a cancerous tumour on his spleen which had burst, and they could give him no hope! Bloody hell, he was only seven so I think it has come as a tremendous shock for them both having to have the dog put down two days ago - especially after all he'd just been through!And I don't know if you remember one (or several) of my previous posts about my going walking and there being a nasty dog further up the mountain on one of my walks that had me really spooked. He wasn't fenced in so I always assumed there was an electric collar involved, but either way I did not like that dog and indeed stopped walking round that area. Well anyway, my Jehovah's Witness neighbours with the arthritic old dog that used to crap in my garden - remember them? - well while I dislike shit-shovelling in my back garden for someone else's dog, the dog was actually quite sweet. It turns out that the husband was walking this dog up at the back of our houses and the nasty dog must have found a way past the electric wiring (or his collar became \"uncharged\"), because it came charging at my neighbour and savaged the elderly arthritic dog so badly that she also had to be put down, despite the best attempts of my neighbour to fend the other dog off. He and his wife were obviously distraught and when the husband went back to speak to the \"evil\" dog's owner he told him to get the f... off his land or the dog would kill him too!!!!! I don't know what happened after that but \"evil dog\" has disappeared (most likely put down) but seriously??? I know it's not usually the dogs that are evil, it's the owners, but some people are just unbelievable, all the more so when you see the picture of that poor little lad who got mauled in the States recently defending his sister against another out-of-control dog! Just like some people shouldn't be allowed to breed, some people shouldn't be allowed to keep dogs don't you think!Brave six-year-old Bridger Walker"},
{"title": "The Latte Factor!", "date": "Friday 17 July 2020", "text": "I'm not quite sure where this week went as it seems I was running somewhere or other every day for the past 10 days. I had my annual doctor's appointment in Geneva on Wednesday and what a nightmare it is to drive in there now. I know they're trying to have the tram network meet up with the new trans-border express train, but at the moment it's hell. Then, since I was going to see my friend (his birthday was 14th) I had to cross town and arriving down by the lake I only just managed to slam my brakes on as an idiot reversed out of a parking space into two lanes of traffic. At least this time I found the car horn (I usually hit the wipers which does absolutely nothing to vent my frustration) but damn it was close. It was all the more stupid since those two lanes are actually controlled by traffic lights so if he had just waited until we hit a red light he wouldn't have had everyone giving him the finger. Then of course I had forgotten that Wednesday is market day in central Geneva so all the traffic is diverted into little side roads, thus creating more chaos. I tell ya, now I know why I quit work - even assuming I didn't before!Then the next day I had the dentist for a check-up and it was brought home to me just what a dangerous profession that is right now. Oh she had her usual mask and gloves on but when you think they're spraying water into your mouth and it's then splashing back up at them - crikey - I would say that's really one of the more fraught professions at the moment. She did give me a disinfectant drink which I had to hold in my mouth for 30 seconds (before spitting out - my name's not Trump) but that was the only difference over the usual scenario. Still, at least now it's done and I walked out of there not needing any treatment but with my lips sticking to my newly-scoured teeth and the resultant ever-so-flattering gopher smile!He does look like he could do with a good cleaning though doesn't he!As I'd got some time to kill before meeting up with my friend I decided to throw all caution to the wind and get a Starbucks to go! I haven't been to Starbucks (or any kind of coffee house) for about three/four years so just this one wouldn't break the bank. But man oh man I can see why they tell you to quit the latte factor if you're trying to save money. I ordered just a regular iced coffee, which was basically one shot of coffee, a bucket full of water and a ton of ice. It was crap - and all that for the hair-curling price of SF7 ($7)!!! Bloody hell, I can see why people go broke drinking this stuff! When I was at the doctor's the previous day he had given me a prescription for some routine meds so I stopped in at the pharmacy next door to his surgery to try and get the prescription filled. Unfortunately they didn't have them in stock and since I wasn't going to drive back in to Geneva to pick them up later I decided to try to get the equivalent in France. They had them in stock and I paid €5.8 for a month's supply (that's near enough $6). So out of curiosity I looked up what I had paid for them the last time but when I had bought them in Switzerland - and they were SF 18.50 for a month's supply! Bloody hell!I think André is seeing the difference in prices too after so many years living in Switzerland. While we were waiting for Jordan and Jen the other day we were looking in the realtor's window and I think he's now quite keen to buy in France. He's already seen a few places he likes but of course he has to save up some $$$$$ first. He and I have done some running around together this week while he's been off work, so every time we thought of another thing he had to do I would write it down while he would be setting up accounts with me noting his passwords/reference numbers. One thing I remembered from when I moved into France over 30 years ago was that the Swiss customs require an attestation de non-poursuite before they let you leave the country. That's basically an attestation to prove that you don't have an outstanding debt/judgment against you in county court. That paper, at least, was pretty simple to do as so much of this stuff is online now, but it all adds to the stuff you have to get for your papers to be in order. He had his car in at Ford today being checked over before he runs it through the contrôle technique (not sure what that would be in the States - in the UK it would be the MOT - the test that proves your car is roadworthy). So bit by bit it's all getting done!During the week he went over to his and Lily's apartment to get the last of his stuff and said he bumped into one of Lily's friends who she had asked to go over and pick something up for her. I hadn't realized but she's on leave this week also (they had put in to take the week off together before André got blindsided). Anyway, André said it was awkward for Kenji (Lily's friend), who told him that he was sorry about what was happening but hoped they could remain friends. I think André would like to see Kenji again but not if it means seeing Lily! He also thinks that she might well be in England at the moment, having flown out to see Pete (the wedding photographer)!!!! Talk about not wasting any time. Then he laughed when he told me that Jordan and Jen are trying to fix him up with a friend of Jen's called Heidi. He showed me her picture and she is very cute. He knows her and says she is nice so who knows, although to be honest he wants to get the divorce done and dusted before even thinking about dating!And finally, I was channel-flipping last night and saw that The First Wives' Club was on so I thought I'd rewatch it to see \"what all the fuss was about\". I hadn't particularly liked it the first time I saw it and over 20 years later I can't say I thought much of it the second time either. Oh sure, if your husband dumps you for a much younger woman I can understand the hurt and the blow it must be to your pride. My husband's skank was 13 years younger than me but frankly since she looked like the north end of a camel going south I can't say she ever actually bothered me - and he knew it! Ha! Anyway, nope, I can't say the film did anything for me this time either. I honestly don't know what anyone sees in Diane Keaton. She seems to have as much acting skills as a plank of wood (a bit like how I'm feeling now about Nicole Kidman, but that might just be a case of too much botox). Even when she was starring with the appalling Woody Allen in Annie Hall to me it just looked like two planks of wood in one movie instead of just one (mind you don't get a splinter there)! And sadly, I didn't think much of Goldie Hawn either. She may or may not be able to act but it strikes me she has only ever played the ditzy blond roles and I find it all way too contrived. In the end all I can say is thank god for the wonderful Bette Midler, who saved what could be saved of an appalling movie. Sadly, if Bette couldn't save it I doubt anyone could have!And on that note, I'm off out to our latest board game evening, so I will love you and leave you until the next time!"},
{"title": "Making a start!", "date": "Sunday 12 July 2020", "text": "I went shopping on Thursday and decided to go to LIDL for a change as I hadn't been for ages. Crikey is it cheaper than where I normally go! I can't get everything I want there of course but it's definitely worth stopping in first I think, especially as I'm now picking up stuff for André every week too as well as the food bank. During lockdown I noticed seedless grapes were up to €5.50/500g as opposed to €4/500g previously, so I left those well alone - I don't want grapes that much. Now I see they're back down to €3.50/500g and so are back on the menu, but I have to say that even taking into account seasonal variations, prices have been all over the shop!On Friday night we had our annual AGM of the homeowners' association in the middle of the island in front of our houses. The President and the Secretary (Philippe and Pierre) are a bit like Cheech and Chong and basically said they hadn't got anything to talk about but since we had to have a meeting at least once a year would now be a good time to get the wine out? And of course it was! Somehow I ended up volunteering to become Treasurer as the previous lady has moved, but since that seemingly involves writing maybe one cheque a year I don't think I'll be too stressed - and of course it shows willing doesn't it!I had a good long chat with a neighbour I don't really have much to do with and he was telling me what he is going through with his wife. She's pretty much housebound and totally dependent on him for everything. It sounds suspiciously like Alzheimer's but he says it's not that, even though she has many of the same symptoms - no recent or even older memories, doesn't recognize her children and keeps expecting her mom to walk in any time now (mom's been dead for many years). As I say, I really don't know this chap very well but my admiration for him and for what he does for his wife just keeps growing!On Saturday André met me at the bank so that we could get his French account re-activated and start the ball rolling on getting his car imported and insured in France. He only worked a few months in France before leaving to join Lily in Korea and then finally moving into Switzerland with her, so he doesn't have much of a \"track record\" in France. Well actually that's not true. He left his motorbike insured in France and then stopped putting any money into that account so more than once I got a phone call from the bank looking for him because he was overdrawn!!! In the end I think they got fed up of him and cancelled his bank card. I told him he was a bloody idiot because if he transferred just SF 100 per month into France he would always be covered and he wouldn't miss such a small amount of money anyway. Eventually I guess I got through to him that that was the way to go as I reckon he stopped overdrawing that account about eight years ago - thankfully right? Anyway, he's now set up with an active bank account and new card, and we've been through his finances together and he has a good idea of where he stands financially. He won't be buying anywhere for at least a year I reckon but that at least gives him time to save some money and get a feel for where he wants to live!After the bank we met up with Jordan and Jen in town for lunch. It's a relatively new restaurant with excellent food and I have to admit I'm thoroughly enjoying seeing more of them all. While we were chatting I remarked on a scar André has just above his right eye and he was recounting for Jen the story of when he was in a car wreck in Verbier when he was 18. I've mentioned before that my kids went to an international school because I was lucky enough to receive a grant from my employer to cover some of the cost. Even with the grant it was extremely expensive but since we wanted our kids educated in English that was the only solution. Now the kids at these schools were either kids like mine - with parents receiving a grant - or kids from very wealthy families. Rich Russians and Arabs for the most part while my kids were there. And I have to say that while these kids lived on a whole other planet to us many of them were pretty nice - surprisingly so, in fact. Anyway, one of the mothers rented an apartment in the ski resort of Verbier for six of them (God knows how much that cost) and the lads were pretty good about moving everything that could be broken into cupboards so that they didn't damage stuff. Anyway, one night André and a friend had walked down to a nightclub and on the way back one of their rich friends passed them in some swanky Audi something-or-other and offered them a lift home. Trouble is, D (the friend) had actually taken the car keys out of the kitchen of his friend, R's, home and it was R's mother's car that he had effectively stolen (although André didn't know this of course). Anyway, I'm sure you can imagine what came next. He was showing off, hit a patch of black ice and rolled the car down an embankment. André was in the back and actually ejected from the car. He came to with blood streaming from his head and no shoes on. The other lads were able to climb out and believe it or not they all managed to limp back to the apartment. André was bleeding so badly though that they had to take him to hospital, from where I got a phone call at 4 a.m. asking me to guarantee his bill!!!! He was covered of course but he told me he had fallen and to cover for D they said they had gotten into a fight over a girl. Next morning there was a hammering on the door when the police showed up and D was marched off to the police station. The car was wrecked and D ended up with a SF120,000 ($120,000) bill to replace it, plus an SF 80,000 fine. And he (or more likely his parents) paid it! Thankfully, apart from being injured, André had nothing to do with it and actually got a letter from the courts in Switzerland asking if he wanted to press charges against D - which he didn't!Another time I was chatting with a friend at work and he was telling me about the time his daughter was invited to spend a week in Paris with her friend's parents and when he started asking about what she should pack and pocket money and so on his daughter mentioned they were \"staying in a place called the Georges V - or something like that\"! Only one of the most expensive hotels in Paris!The Georges VHa, when we took our kids' mates on holiday with us we went camping! Not that I care. I kinda think being filthy rich is pretty sad because I'm not sure they actually appreciate anything and I certainly don't envy them, but I would say, again, that some of these kids were pretty nice and my sons have stayed friends with quite a few of them, although in all honesty their mates are now mainly in France and more \"normal\"!I love reading \"social commentary\" books - I've read Nickel and Dimed, Around About A Pound A Week and so on, and I'm currently about half way through Affluenza at the moment. Not to oversimplify (or maybe yes, I am oversimplifying) but Affluenza seems to shine a light on how people's never-ending consumerism pushes them to have to work harder and longer to pay for it all and yet their happiness seems to be in inverse proportion to the amount of \"stuff\" they manage to acquire. It's very interesting to me as I feel our throwaway society and its inequalities are just so wrong - but I don't know what the solution is. Obviously we all enjoy certain comforts and everyone has their own idea of what that comfort looks like, but I'm more and more convinced that acquiring \"stuff\" doesn't bring happiness. Quite the opposite in fact, we just seem to want more and more and then have to work longer and longer to pay for it. At least that's my take on the book so far. In the end, if we have everything we need and most of what we want are we not truly rich?And finally, I just wanted to send huge hugs to our blogging friend in Canada after learning her shocking medical news today. Hang in here hon, your blogging buddies are sending you so many positive vibes. You've got this!"},
{"title": "Putting one foot in front of the other!", "date": "Tuesday 7 July 2020", "text": "I got a notification yesterday from the UK passport office to say that Jordan's new passport was on its way back to him (I used my email as I know he never checks his). So that was pretty good service actually - less than two weeks from my sending it off to the new one wending its way back, and this despite the fact that when I was filling in the form online the \"computer sez no\", as it didn't like his photo and despite the fact that I wasn't able to include a complete copy of every page of his US passport with the application as instructed since I didn't have it. I just sent the main page. Either way, it's gone through so that's one less thing to worry about with Brexit because his old passport was due to expire on 27 July. But, as I suspected, the website that was supposed to be up and running for us Brits to apply for our residency as from 1 July is indeed not up and running because it's not ready, and has now been rolled back to 1 October. Maybe I'm just getting cynical in my old age but who couldn't have seen that coming! Still, from what I can gather, it shouldn't be a difficult process as any Brit registered as living here before 31 December has the automatic right to remain. Which is just was well actually because I got a phone call from André this afternoon and he's decided that he is indeed going to move back into France rather than stay in Switzerland!Actually, his first words were \"mom, can I ask you a favour\" ... to which I replied \"do you mind if I store my stuff in your basement until ....\" and he just laughed and said \"well since you mention it ...\"! Anyway, he has next week off and is going to go back to their apartment in Geneva to get all his stuff out. I told him that except for Tuesday I can help, but I think he won't have that much anyway (famous last words right?). He's going to leave all the furniture and so on for Lily and just take his personal stuff so I don't think the move will be too onerous. He and I are going to the Mairie in my village on Saturday morning where he will declare his residence with me and then we have an appointment with the bank at 10.45 to set him up there. He already has a French bank account and tax ID because he worked briefly in France when he was still living at home so there's quite a bit of stuff that can just be reactivated. In the meantime I told him to go to the Swiss bank and get his ebanking codes so that we can set set up various transfers automatically and then he will start sending the majority of his salary into France to both start accumulating some savings and showing the bank that he's a good \"bet\" (for when he tries to get a mortgage later). I think he's quite stoked actually. We can stop off at the border next week and fill out the forms for importing his car, requesting a French grey card can be done online and getting car insurance can be done through the bank on Saturday. When I mentioned about having to exchange his Swiss driving licence for a French one he said it wasn't a problem because when he moved into Switzerland the Swiss just gave him a Swiss licence and didn't take his French one off him, so that's one less thing to sort out!It'll be a pain in the butt for a while I suppose but once we started talking \"numbers\" I think he was pretty excited. It's fairly easy to do loan calculations online and for around the same amount as he was contributing to his Swiss rent he can easily afford to buy a place in France, so I think that will help keep morale up. My thoughts were that he should (eventually) start looking for a place near la Roche (near me) in order to be able to catch the train to Geneva, but he said he kinda likes Marcellaz, where Jordan and Jen used to live, so that's where he wants to start looking. It will mean the horrible commute but then as my neighbour said on Sunday, she has been doing it for 15 years and can still tolerate it, whereas I'd had over 30 years of it when I came to the end of my rope. Either way, it's stuff that can be looked into as and when, as he's nowhere near ready to buy anything yet anyway!I've got a doctor's appointment in Geneva tomorrow, which will be only the second time I've driven in since lockdown was lifted. After that I'm going to have lunch with my friend and try to get back before the traffic starts picking up again. André told me all the lanes round town are being revamped to make everything more \"bike friendly\" so I'll have to watch out for that I guess, but hopefully it won't be too difficult!In other news, the French Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, resigned last week which I'm thinking may be a prelude to him standing against Macron in the next presidential elections. He is pretty popular and unlike Macron has come out of this pandemic situation pretty well. Considering that France and the UK have roughly similar populations and that both countries' death tolls were at around the 29,000 mark at the same time, it's quite telling that the UK's death toll is now over 44,000 and France's is still in the 29,000 range so again I'm inclined to think they got it as right as any country could! And I see that the other covidiot in Brazil has actually contracted coronavirus, despite declaring \"it's just a little flu\"! Again, who couldn't have seen that coming! I hate to think what Brazil's figures will eventually end up at given their high population density and an idiot like that in charge. Then watching CNN today and seeing the US figures starting to skyrocket is just so sad because I don't think they've even started to break the back of this damn virus and all the dire predictions look to be starting to come true. I certainly hope not but ...! I think we're probably all ready for 2020 to be over and done with don't you!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 5 July 2020", "text": "It's been a quiet weekend and I have to say I've really appreciated it, after having the roofing guys here all week. They've finished laying the insulation but one guy is coming back tomorrow to finish up the sealant on the part of my roof that they missed. It was an easy mistake to make as they thought it was part of my neighbour's roof, so tomorrow, hopefully, will be their last day here. While I was chatting to them I mentioned that in amongst the old insulation that they were stripping off I saw what looked like little clusters of yellow grapes. Yellow because they were covered in insulation, but small clusters the size of grapes or olives. They told me it was bats and they come across them quite often! Eeek! I had a wasps' nest removed from my roof many years ago and I personally set a burgeoning hornets' nest on fire more than once, but I never thought of bats, although why not? There are plenty round here in the evenings.My friend drove over on Friday and it was so good to see him. It's the first time I've seen him since around February/March. We went to eat at the one-and-only restaurant (one-and-only anything to be honest) in the village and had a really nice time together. I love that restaurant because the view over the mountains from their terrace is just fabulous and it brings back lovely memories of going skiing with our neighbours when the kids were little and then stopping in at La Fertire for a fondue afterwards! They were happy days!Later that evening there was a knock at my door and my neighbour handed me a piece of paper saying that they had decided to hold our homeowners' association AGM in the middle of the island on Friday night. Philippe is the President of our association (because no-one else wanted to do it) but I'm not sure he was ever up to it from a technology stand point because he'd printed off his convening email and was walking round handing out paper copies of it! I know they're looking for a new treasurer as the lady who has had that responsibility is selling up so I might volunteer, just to show willing. I doubt there's actually anything to do as we're not an active association and I'm not exactly over-worked as it is!And can you believe it was a year on 4 July since Jordan and Jen had their wedding do! Crikey, hasn't time flown!Jordan and JenI wasn't able to get over and see André this past week as I've been busy with workmen, but I sent him a message and asked how things were going. He told me that he and Lily had been to see an advisor who can guide them through a do-it-yourself divorce since there is no common property and no children. So, as sad as I am for them, it looks like the divorce is going ahead. I went into town yesterday as I wanted to pick up a couple of things and while I was there I thought \"why don't I start putting together a start-up package for him for when he moves into his own place\"? You know, things like cleaning materials, washing powder and stuff like that. I pick up extras for the food bank every week anyway so starting up another store for André won't change much for me. I'm not talking about furniture because obviously André will want to chose that for himself. I had my own place in Geneva when I met my husband and when we married and moved back to the States I remember spending an absolute fortune just on stuff to get us set up in our own home. My furniture was shipped from Switzerland but just setting ourselves up with the basics was extremely costly!Eat your heart out Dave because the Tour de France is actually coming to this area starting next week and should be in our local town on 16 July, if I remember right. I'm sure it'll be heaving so I'll try to wander down on foot and get some pictures for you!This is at the Plâteau de Glières, just up the road from here.\"74\" is this region of France - Haute SavoieI'm invited over to my neighbour's later this evening for an apéro so I'd better start thinking about getting cleaned up. But talking of \"cleaning up\", I've just spent quite some time going through my blog \"favourites\" and deleting as many as possible - people whose blogs I meant to read and never got round to it. People who've stopped blogging or maybe just people whose blogs I've moved on from. One thing I did notice though is that the bloody advertising on some of those blogs drives me insane. If you have to click on three different adverts just to be able to read someone's post well I guess that's no longer a blog for me!And finally, whichever way the US elections go in November I'm sure my American friends out there will be delighted to learn that Kanye West has \"decided to throw his hat in the ring\" for 2024! Can you image Kanye as POTUS and Kimmie as FLOTUS - and they said it could never get worse than Trump!"},
{"title": "Day two!", "date": "Wednesday 1 July 2020", "text": "The roofing guys told me on Monday that they would be back today to start laying the insulation and since they showed up on Monday at 9 a.m. I was expecting pretty much the same today - traffic permitting. So I was up, ready and \"doing\" bang on nine! They didn't show up then so I started reading and pottering and reading and pottering, with them eventually showing up at 10.30 a.m.! I didn't mind the delay as such, but every time I heard a car go past I was up and down stairs like a bloody yoyo to see if it was them. You see, I have a living room/dining room on the ground floor, but the previous owners turned one of the double bedrooms upstairs into a TV room. We knocked an internal balcony out and made the TV room even bigger, so it's quite comfortable with two sofas, the TV and room for my computer. So unless I'm in the kitchen doing something I actually spend most of my time on the first floor of my home - hence I was constantly going up and down like a bride's nighty this morning checking the front door! I think it was then that I realized one of the reasons I was so comfortable during lockdown was because I knew no-one would be knocking at my door and I wouldn't have that constant up-down. Well maybe that's only one of the reasons - maybe I'm just naturally antisocial too. So then I thought, why not see that as a positive, you know, going up and down all those stairs all the time is keeping you fit and clocking up the km! And it's true! What with storing perishables in my basement at the moment because of the heat and having a top bedroom on a third floor I really am up and down four sets of stairs on a regular basis! Crikey, I hadn't thought of it like that! Maybe it's actually a good thing having all these stairs! When I was growing up we had a four-bedroomed house on two floors and in 1992 my dad inherited a little money from his brother and they were able to sell up and move to a bungalow in Dorset - which had always been their dream. But, with them moving away from the stairs in the first house I realized that in addition to getting older, every time I saw them they were probably significantly less fit than maybe they would have been otherwise - and I put that down to the stairs! My mom wouldn't have had it any other way in any case, but I guess looking at things from this angle is one way to \"turn that frown upside down\" isn't it!I had to go out grocery shopping this morning so I left the two young men to get on with their work since they didn't need access to the house. When I got back though they were on top of my sloping roof and it was scorching! I felt so sorry for them as it was 32°C (90°F) and there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had told them where my hose was and left the garage door open and they had been spraying each other down with cold water, but even so it was hot. So then I was running in and out with iced water and coke for them but even so, I just don't know how they do it! They had made good progress on the one side of the roof and I just assumed they'd go off to get something to eat but they said that they wanted to get that side totally finished before packing up and heading off. They eventually finished up at 4 p.m. and left for the day. The one young lad told me that the previous day they had put in a 14-hour day to get a job finished. You've got to be young, is all I can say!On a slightly morbid note, I read somewhere yesterday about a file you can buy called Life in Motion! Basically, it's a rather jolly name for a file I would probably rename \"here's a list of everything I own, all my passwords and who gets what when I snuff it\"! Slightly less poetic but more fitting I think! Basically it's a file with eight tabs in it that you put together to \"ease\" things somewhat for your loved ones when you pass. To me that goes along with the whole \"decluttering now so that they don't have to do it afterwards\" kinda thing. I've been pretty good at filing my stuff and I've always told my boys that when I pop my clogs the first place they should looks is in a file called \"important stuff\", as that contains the most important papers they will need immediately. Anyway, this Life in Motion file, which I believe is available from Amazon, cost $50! Fifty dollars for a file/binder with eight tabs in it? No thanks. I have everything I need so I thought why not sit down every Friday when I'm doing my banking and just type up one thing for the file - which is what I did today!The tabs that they supply are! (1) documents/emergency plan; (2) medical and insurance info; (3) property info - house/car/keys etc.; (4) banking info; (5) final wishes/funeral arrangements; (6) end-of-life decisions; (7) estate settlement/will; and (8) where to find important documents. Frankly I will add a (9) miscellaneous/info about my blog? - as I don't believe everything will fit neatly under 1-8! So since I got paid today and was transferring money/paying bills, I decided to type up a number (4) and put the details of my UBS bank account down on paper. I have four bank accounts, which might make me sound like Rockerfeller but is pretty easily explained. I have my former salary account (UBS) in Switzerland where my pension is now paid. We have a Swiss franc-denominated pension fund and I have my pension paid in Swissies because - well because I'm not stupid! I also have a savings account at the United Nations Credit Union. I kept this simply because it's more difficult for me to access money there so I throw a little in it every month in order to save for whatever. Then I have an account in the UK (HSBC) which I've had since I was 18 and if I close it they won't let me open another one, so I send SF 100 there every month and that gives me my pocket money whenever I go to England. And finally I have an account in France because that's where I live and most of my bills come out of that in euros. So you can imagine my boys would probably find all this pretty intimidating if and when!So today it took me maybe 10 minutes to type up the UBS stuff. \"This is the account number, this is where the bank is located, this is my password for e-banking\" and so on, and it was really easy. As I say, I have everything all in one place but it struck me as making so much more sense to have a divider for each one and include all the passwords too. Morbid stuff maybe but I am more concerned with making my kids' lives easy as and when rather than worrying that if I write about my death it's gonna happen. It is - but not just yet hopefully!I got my \"one hour\" of work in again today and I realize that by the time I look at my timer for the first time 45 minutes have usually gone by so it really is easy. While I was \"doing\" in the garden my neighbour wandered over for something or other. He's going in to hospital tomorrow for a fourth (or fifth?) operation to put stents into the veins in his legs as they are clogging up. Wouldn't you think with him finding walking more and more strenuous and this being yet another hospital stay he would give up smoking like the doctors have asked him to do? But nope, his wife gave up (after 50 years of smoking?) when she got the fright or her life and ended up in hospital with pneumonia last year and even now has a hard time breathing. Anyway, his wife is also making her own world smaller and smaller as she ages (she's 67) because she \"can't drive in the dark (OK), is too afraid to drive down to Annecy (30 minutes away), won't drive on the motorway (OK) and can't drive him to the hospital because \"she's never driven on that road before\". I love her to bits but remember telling her ages ago that if she wasn't careful she would slowly wall herself in with all these perceived \"inabilities\" she has - and she was maybe 45 at the time! Well his daughter is going to drive him in tomorrow but has to be back at work on Friday for the first time since lockdown lifted so she can't pick him up. So I offered. It's no biggie to me but it brought home to me how much his wife's world is shrinking - and how stupid smoking really is!And finally, I got one over on my friend today. He sent me a chatty message asking when we could get together (this weekend probably, for the first time since March). So anyway he tells me that all this walking he's being doing (a lot) seems to have paid off and he's pretty sure he's lost weight, but he couldn't say how much because he doesn't have any scales. Next thing I know he sends me a picture of himself in his underpants and yes, it would seem that he has lost quite a bit of weight. So then we go flirting back and forth and I'm saying \"I think I'll need to see a bit more in order to be sure\" - but that's just our usual kind of banter. So at this point I decided to tell him about the time last year, just before Christmas, when out of the blue he sent me a rather more raunchy picture. I've no idea why and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. I mean, it's not like I haven't seen it all before right - we dated for about five years! Anyway, what I had forgotten was that when someone sends you a picture it automatically gets saved onto your pictures (on iPhone at least). So last year, just after he had sent the picture, I was at my patchwork lesson when I was telling one of the ladies about a Christmassy-themed project I would like to attempt. I had seen it at a patchwork exhibition and liked it so I took a picture of it. So she said \"oh can I see\", so I handed my phone over to her! And that was when I realized his other pictures was probably saved onto my phone. Now I'm the kind that looks at someone's pictures and often swipes left to look at the next one, so I was hoping to god she wouldn't do the same and almost threw myself at her to get my phone back. Which I managed but seriously? When I told him this I was roaring laughing and he was horrified - as I reminded him this morning when he sent me his \"I'm losing weight\" photo! Moral of the story? Be careful who you send your raunchy pictures to!"},
{"title": "A day at the dodgems!", "date": "Tuesday 30 June 2020", "text": "I got a phone call on Friday from my roofing guys asking if they could come and start work on my roof insulation on Monday (yesterday). This work was planned for October but since I'm home anyway I said yes. So they showed up at the crack of dawn yesterday morning and started clonking about on my roof like cast members of Riverdance. They are very polite and efficient but the noise was driving me slightly nuts so I tried to spend as much time in my garden as possible to get away from it!RiverdanceThey laid out the plastic protection sheeting first, which was a bit funny actually since the world is trying to do away with single-use plastics and McDonalds are getting hammered for their straws and yet these guys (of necessity) basically gift-wrap the whole house! To be fair, my neighbour took the unspoiled sheeting off them last time but still! They hadn't long got to work removing tiles when would you believe it - the heavens opened. The forecast was a bit iffy anyway, but as soon as it started to pour the boss gave orders to get all the tiles put back and told me that sadly they were done for the day as they couldn't do any more in the rain!I wasn't too bothered actually as they told me they would be back later in the week so around 2 o'clock I thought I it might be nice to take a siesta as I was feeling a bit tired. But wouldn't you know it, the sun came back out and just as I was thinking about crawling into bed there was a knock at my door, a mad rush to put my bra back on and they \"hoped I didn't mind but could they start up again this afternoon\"? Now I don't know if I was imagining it but I'm pretty sure I smelled dope on the boss guy but what could I say, so off they went and the three gofers managed to remove all my very poor insulation in about an hour and that was it. Tiles back on and they would see me again on Wednesday (and Thursday and maybe Friday) to get the insulation laid! I feel like I've had so much work done in the house this past year that I'll be glad to see the back of workmen for a while, but it's all for the greater good really isn't it, and I have to say that all the work done for me this year has been done well (somewhat to my surprise I realize)!My sister called me earlier today for a chat and when I asked about my brother she said they had just cancelled Sky (cable TV) as it was costing him £60 a month and he was hardly watching it. I remember cancelling Sky about 10 years ago for the same reason, and of course they then bend over backwards to offer you a deal but nah, I'm just not into TV that much and my Freesat does me just fine! My friend was annoyed when he realized he couldn't watch the cricket anymore but then there's always the Mr. Pickwick pub in Geneva if he's desperate. Actually, believe it or not, my brother used to listen to cricket on the radio if he couldn't get it on the TV!!!!! I know!!!!! It's boring enough watching it but can you imagine listening to it. That being said, the late commentator, Brian Johnston, was an absolute gem in the commentary box, as well as being an inveterate giggler. His absolute classic had to be his commentary when West Indian legend, Michael Holding, was facing England batsman, Peter Willey and \"Johnners\" came out with \"the batsman's Holding, the bowler's Willey\" followed by barely stifled giggling when he realized what he'd said! Anyway my sister was telling me she had now gotten a Firestick 4 and a subscription to Vlod (sounds like a Russian weightlifter doesn't it), and with all that my brother can now get 100s of channels for about one-tenth of the price - (I guess it just depends how many channels he wants to sleep his way through really)!Although it was hot I got quite a bit done today. I did a load of washing, including my summer duvet which I will now put away for a few months as I'll be sleeping with just a sheet while the heat ramps up. One of the joys of having my balcony is that I can put drying racks out there and hang the big stuff, like my duvet, directly over the balcony to dry and it's usually all done and dusted in a day. Okay it might look a bit like a gypsy encampment for the duration but technically nobody should be able to see it since my house backs onto the farm and the only people that might see it would be my neighbours walking through my garden to get to each other's houses. I have also learned to peg the stuff in place as it can get quite windy and I have found my knickers in the back garden on more than one occasion. So pegs it is - or at the very least buy some really kinky underwear and get the neighbours talking!I'm also doing quite well in my \"do something round the house for one hour a day\" plan, which is similar to what Fly Lady advocates on her website, although she drove me batty with her emails. It's actually quite satisfying to set my phone timer to one hour and see how much gets done - quite a lot as it turns out. While I was working on my veggie plot my gardener showed up on his riding lawnmower and started work. Then the neighbour's partner started doing the same on her land, and my other neighbour pitched in with his lawnmower. Apparently they've forecast rain for tomorrow so I guess everyone was trying to get it done beforehand. At one point they were all mowing at the point where our gardens meet and it felt slightly like a stand-off at the OK Corral, although to be honest, it looked more like a day at the dodgems to me!"},
{"title": "Rock on my son!", "date": "Friday 26 June 2020", "text": "I had lunch with my son today and it felt so good. He moved in with his brother and his wife on Saturday. I'm not sure how long he will stay there but I think it's good for him to be able to talk with people who understand but he can always move in with me any time he wants anyway. But it really was lovely. We walked down to a local restaurant where apparently he has been going every lunchtime and buying his lunch \"to go\" for €10 a pop. I think he's already seeing the difference between France and Switzerland as at a minimum he would be spending SF 17 per day just for lunch. Anyway, it was nice. I have always been very open about my finances, how much I make, what my bills are and so on, so we were going through him buying something in France and how much it would cost him. While he says he loves living in Geneva the prices are ridiculous and he knows he would be better off in France. The only thing I told him is he has to get a handle on his finances. It's more than doable - hell he makes so much more than I do and I'm still saving money. I find it hard to believe also that he has never gotten round to internet banking - damn, they say we're old foggies! So I told him I can help him set all that up but that I think it would do him good to live on his own for a while, pay his own bills and then take it from there. He told me he doesn't think he will ever get married again, doesn't know if he wants kids - and that makes me sad. The good part is that he has his brother and his wife bolstering him up and Max and his other mates really revving the engine! I told him that his mates are really in France so if he bought in France he can still do the drive if he wants to stay in the city after work.He sent Lily an email saying that he wanted to go directly for a divorce, that he was not prepared to remain her husband while she was messing around so let's go for it. And bingo, he got an email back saying that he had shaken her up, she wasn't prepared for that and so on. She's a good kid and I think they are well suited but in the end, if she wants to start messing around, good on him for saying \"nope, I ain't going for that\"¨Anyway, I went through all my finances and what he could expect to pay in bills and it is more than doable. While we were chatting away the lady owner of the restaurant just looked at him and said \"I thought you were French\". And he laughed and said \"nope, I'm anglo-american\" and she just looked at him with a stunned look and said she couldn't believe how perfect his French was. Well yeah, he's grown up here! So there you have it. I told him to move in with me if and when, save money and we'd get it all started for him to have his own place. I left feeling that he was quite motivated. As we were walking out of Jordan's place Jordan showed up as he had finished work for the day, so it was lovely to have both my kids there at once. Just wish it could have been under better circumstances!"},
{"title": "What can you say about Uncle Johnny?", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2020", "text": "That he was kind, thoughtful, funny and would give you the shirt off his back? Nah, I can't say any of that because in actual fact I never met Uncle Johnny. You see, \"Uncle Johnny\" was Johnny (Goldfinger) Palmer, once described as Britain's richest criminal and thought to be worth £300 million. He was acquitted of handling stolen gold bullion from the Brinks-Mat raid in 1983 but it was on this day five years ago that he was shot and killed in the garden of his home in what looked like a very professional killing. And yep, he really was an uncle on my dad's side, although I never met him!Johnny (Goldfinger) PalmerMy dad, Uncle A and John Palmer were sons of three sisters (there were loads of other kids too of course). As I say, I was just a little kid and never met him, although I believe my older brother did meet him a few times. In any case, he and my Uncle A are dead ringers for each other. I never knew an awful lot about the Brinks-Mat robbery but I was told that Uncle Johnny subsequently moved into the time-share business in Spain, where people were often strong-armed into buying time-shares that I'm not sure even existed. Mom told me that \"all of a sudden\" Uncle A started taking short trips to Spain and seemed to have an awful lot of money to throw around when he came back. Now this was in the 1970s and no-one went to Spain for a long weekend - well no-one, that is, except for Uncle A. Dad reckoned he was carrying cash over to John Palmer, although he never had any proof of that. It just didn't make sense to him, since Uncle A had a fish stall in Birmingham's Bull Ring market and even if they made good money there was no way he was all of a sudden making the kind of money he was throwing around. Dad reckoned the stress of whatever shinanigans he got up to eventually killed him because one day, at the age of just 54, Uncle A left his stall to go get a newspaper, had a massive heart attack and died on the spot! Whenever I would give my older brother some lip he would say \"watch out, or I'll tell Uncle Johnny!\" and that was enough to make me shut up. Yeah, as if! My dad barely knew him, he just knew they were distant relatives on their mothers' side, so my brother was truly a rotten sod scaring a little girl half out of her wits with threats of \"Uncle Johnny\". So there you have it, my one and only claim to dubious fame!I do remember being a really little girl - hadn't started school yet, so maybe three years old - and my mom left me with Aunt S, Uncle A's wife, so that she could go grocery shopping in peace. Anyway I remember asking Aunt S if I could just pop over the road to see if my mom was back and she said yes. Well mom wasn't back so I decided to walk to the shops (about two miles away I would guess) to see where she was. All I remember is balling my eyes out in the middle of the shopping precinct and my mom coming over wondering how in the hell I had got there! It didn't mean anything to me of course but I reckon there must have been a few frosty exchanges with my Aunt S when we got back!In other news, I didn't make it out to Excenevex today because, as I thought, I was just too slow off the mark this morning, but at least it gives me an idea of somewhere to go sometime before the schools are out to enjoy the lake for a while. I did get my grocery shopping done (but boy am I spending a lot at the moment). I also went to the Chinese store as I needed some black bean/garlic sauce - and man do I love going to that store. I just love the smell of it. It's like having a souk right on my doorstep with the wonderful smells of all those spices. Now these people are very good businessmen and sell not only Asian goods but also African and Middle Eastern spices - well basically if you ask for it they'll find it and sell it to you. I also like that if you are buying heavy stuff they will always have a young man carry it out to your car for you. It's like that with the Turkish stall holders I often go to also. When we were five living at home I used to buy a lot of fresh produce and they would always have one of the young boys carry my stuff to my car for me. And for me, that kind of service goes a long way, I can tell you!I also managed to make a dentist and gynae appointment for the month of July. When I was booking the gynae appointment the receptionist said I was to \"come alone and wear a mask\" - which kinda got my warped sense of humour going because surely that's not the bit he'll be sticking his nose in - but I managed to keep myself from saying that as not everyone gets my sense of humour!Anyway it's hot here and I'm wilting. I know I'm going to be miserable for the next couple of months - in fact it's only going to get worse as summer is only just starting! I just love that point in September when you can actually feel the heat break and know that things will get cooler from here on in. I pity the poor folks that have to work outside in this weather but I guess they manage or they're used to it. I know one thing though, I'll never be a hot weather person!The farmer turning hay in the part of his field at the back of my house!"},
{"title": "Success!", "date": "Tuesday 23 June 2020", "text": "I had so many plans for today - I was going to go on another walk (once my muscles \"defrosted\"), then come home and spend some time clearing more stuff out the basement (why do I sense I'm going to get my son's stuff dumped on me soon?) and then do some batch cooking to get ahead for the next couple of days. In the end what did I do? Bugger all! By the time I'd got my backside into gear it was already starting to warm up and I just couldn't face doing much more than sitting in the back garden reading. There's no law against it but I do get annoyed at myself sometimes! As I say, the temperatures are starting to pick up now and we've already hit 32°C (90°F) this week so I'm not looking forward to the start of the hot season which will soon be on us. I did get Jordan to carry my mobile AC unit up to my bedroom the other week so I'll probably be starting to use that soon, although I like to hold off as long as I can. And then of course I could always do a few \"lengths\" of my paddling pool (ha!) trying desperately to look like a naiad but in truth looking like Moby Dick proving Archimedes' water displacement theory. Not to worry though, that's one of the advantages of living alone isn't it!I have the AGM of our local community association tomorrow night where I will be attending in my capacity as President of the Sewing Club (I know, the responsibilities!!!!). I've already sent in our accounts and a list of members but if I'm correct tomorrow will be when they hand out the different subsidies to each club so I need to be there for that. They're very generous actually because the commune of Amancy give us the room for free (and I don't even live in that commune) and also give us a small amount of money to spend for the benefit of the club. Last year I bought two second-hand sewing machines but we've still got plenty left in the bank. We each pay our teacher, Patricia, an annual amount of €100 for her services so I'm thinking I might use the money from the commune to subsidize that amount this year in view of having to shut up shop during lockdown. Either way, we're on to a very good thing. I got an email the other day from the association that organizes the Italian lessons too in which they sent out a form saying that they would reimburse anyone who requested it on a pro rata basis, but also giving people the option to forego reimbursement in order to help the association. Since the MJC is a community-led association I decided to just give up the money, although in reality our teacher had already been off sick a month before covid shut the lessons down entirely. Still, if it means that they were able to keep staff on their payroll it's a small price to pay and I don't actually need the money!I probably won't get to go out walking tomorrow since I plan to go grocery shopping instead to get that out of the way. I looked on the web and saw that on Wednesdays they have an open-air market in a lovely little town called Excenevex, which is right on Lake Geneva, so I might try to shoot out there tomorrow and have a wander. It will probably take me about 40 minutes to get there, but it is a lovely spot with a nice little beach right on the lake so will make nice ride out - if I can get myself moving! Excenevex beachAs I was pottering in my garden my neighbour wandered over and I was asking her how she enjoyed Father's Day and seeing her grandchildren that live in Switzerland. She said they'd had a lovely day together and was over the moon to see her grandsons, although she still worried about the older grandson as he has Downs Syndrome and is more fragile health-wise. She also said that they are saying in the French news to expect a new covid spike in September and that people should prepare accordingly. I figured it would happen anyway as the country, of necessity, has to open back up, but here's hoping it's not as bad as this first round!Anyway while we were chatting I starting digging around in my potato patch. Remember, the potatoes that I planted on top of the sheet of cardboard? No digging, no lugging soil around, just plonk down the cardboard, throw on some sprouted potatoes from the garage and dump grass clippings on top. Well guess what, it looks like it has worked! Talk about the lazy woman's guide to potato growing. I only poked around at the one plant as I didn't want to disturb it too much but I picked six decent sized potatoes and just covered the diddy ones back up. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing, how often I should mound up the clippings or anything, but they are definitely growing! Yay me! They've worked out better than the cucumber plants (they were savaged by slugs). The curly kale has done well. The tomato plants are coming along fine and also the courgette (zucchini) so I'm quite pleased considering the amount of studied neglect I have subjected my garden to for the most part!I've got tomato plants by my living room window,but the rest of the stuff I just plonked at the top of the garden!In reference to my son's situation somebody commented yesterday that I did well not to wrap my kids up in cotton wool. I was thinking about that and realized that I probably would have done if I could have, but either way I guess I was more relaxed than some. I've always been pretty easy-going and thankfully my kids seem to have taken after me and are not highly-strung like their dad. While I was talking to André up in the mountains yesterday I commented something about Lily not having had the easiest of childhoods - but then neither did he, what with the screaming, shouting and physical violence (directed at me, not them). And he said something that really touched my heart. He said that he actually had a great childhood and sure we had our issues but then what family doesn't - and I wanted to cry as I've long felt so guilty for \"failing them\" when they were little. I guess it's just as well my phone battery conked out when it did!But it got me to thinking about \"coddling\" your kids and brought to mind a woman I worked with when I was just 16. From age 16 onwards I had a Saturday/holiday job working at WH Smith (the big bookshop/record store/stationers). Initially I worked on the shop floor/cash registers and hated it. I remember when the kids were buying their back-to-school supplies we had to ring up all the different pencils according to their individual codes and it was really tedious. I also remember the actor, Robert Morely, coming in one time and walking straight to the front of the queue, so I asked him to go to the back of the queue as people had been waiting. He looked at me and said \"do you know who I am?\" and I said that no I didn't but these people had been waiting and I felt it was right that they got served first! (Mouthy little sod wasn't I). Well my heart was thumping but I thought I'll be buggered if I'll let that sod jump the queue. As he was paying, another customer leaned over and congratulated me for speaking up - and I went bright red in the face as a result. I never liked Robert Morely anyway. As far as I was concerned he was another Hugh Grant - an actor with just one act, although at least Hugh Grant was better looking!Robert MorelyAnyway, someone in the queue must have spotted my name badge on my lapel and a bit later in the afternoon the switchboard paged me to answer the phone. My heart was pounding because my dad had had several heart attacks already and I just assumed it was bad news. But no, I picked up the phone and some twisted bastard called me by name and told me exactly what he would like to do to me!!! He also told me that he would be waiting for me outside the shop when we closed!!! I just burst into tears, walked off the shop floor and explained to the manager what had happened. I was only 16 and terrified that this jerk would indeed wait for me when we closed so the manager walked me to a back door and off the premises that evening! Perverted bastard!All that was by the way, of course, because I always seem to go off on a tangent don't I. Eventually after a few years at WH Smith I graduated to working in the cash office, tallying up the cash registers (which were rarely accurate) and working with the ladies who suspected some light-fingered work going on, in particular in the record shop. Anyway, two sisters worked in the cash office - Kath and Mary. Both were very nice and Kath had a son my age - Howard - and I couldn't believe some of the stories she told me about \"Howie\"! Howie had various Saturday jobs but mommy always told him \"don't you let them put upon you Howie, you just walk out if they do\", so Howie was always walking out of jobs where, apparently, they didn't appreciate mommy's little treasure! Mary, the older sister, used to look at me and roll her eyes. Daddy used to drive in to whichever job Howie had walked out of that week and pick him up to drive him home. Now this is in city centre Birmingham, the UK's second city after London, with excellent public transport, but nope, daddy always had to drive in and pick precious up! Even I was stunned. When I handed in my notice because I had got my job in Geneva Mary pulled me aside and said she couldn't believe I was starting work in Switzerland and Howie had just walked off his umpteenth job because yet again they didn't appreciate him! So yesterday's comment made me think - I wonder whatever became of Howie? Not much I expect!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Monday 22 June 2020", "text": "While I was over at Jordan's yesterday I told him that I was going to start looking at bathroom fixtures as my plan is to get started on refurbishing both bathrooms as they desperately need redoing. I had asked Jordan if he was interested in doing the fitting in his spare time and he said yes. I was fine if he didn't want to but would obviously prefer to give him the money than pay someone else. So we got to talking about what kinds of fixtures I should be looking at and I was saying I wanted \"suspended\" toilets with eco water consumption possibilities since my current toilets are very old and very heavy on water usage. I'll always remember my friend, Ian, who moved to Bulgaria in 2010. He was sick to death of England and chasing after the almighty £££ in order to consume more and more, thereby trapping yourself on the eternal money-chasing treadmill. Anyway one thing Ian said that stuck with me was that it just appalled him that we in affluent western countries actually use clean water to flush our toilets - simply because we can afford to do so. Ian was in construction in England so I guess he knew a thing or two about \"wastage\", but it's odd that that sentiment always stuck with me. So why am I talking about toilets? Well at this point Jordan piped up and said that his boss, Max, (who is also the bass guitarist in their band and a friend of both my sons) had actually installed a urinal in his home!!! And that urinal used only one litre per flush, as compared to 5-6 litres for modern toilets, and between nine and eleven litres for my old bog! Fascinating stuff isn't it, although I don't see much of a future for a urinal in my home, to be honest. Max bought a run down old farm on a fair bit of land and started doing it up over the last few years. Jordan helped him at weekends and learned a lot in the mix. Another thing Max did is have his home set up so that the ground floor could be used as a completely independent living area if the time ever came that he couldn't get up the stairs. Now he's only 31 so hopefully that's not even a consideration but he was also smart enough to install doors that were wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair, as he wants this home to be his forever home. Now the point of all this is that Max has recently become rather smitten with a young woman who is tetraplegic as a result of a car crash involving a wild boar (!!!!) and things look like they might be getting more serious! He said she is gorgeous, very funny and fiercely independent and while it's early days yet who knows where that relationship might end up. But isn't it amazing what a forward-thinking young man he turned out to be!So jumping from the rooster to the donkey again, today I had my Monday morning yoga class but was a bit apprehensive because I didn't fancy doing it outside in the scorching heat. While I was in the shower getting ready I heard a clunking sound and thought \"oh my god, someone's on the roof\" (my shower is under the roof and I'd been tootling back and forward naked while getting my clothes together to go to yoga)! Turns out the chimney sweep had come to work on my neighbour's chimney. Hopefully he shouldn't have been able to see into my house, but I guess it wouldn't be the first time they've got an eyeful would it. A bit like the window cleaners when I lived in England. They just showed up, climbed up their ladders and off they went, so you'd better hope you weren't stark naked when they started on your bedroom window! Yoga turned out just perfect though. It was already pretty hot but we were able to practice in her garden in the shade of a massive cedar tree and apart from one lady getting shat upon by a bird in said tree, it was actually lovely!After yoga I thought it would be nice to go out walking but didn't want to go on my usual walk down to Thyez as I wanted something a bit more challenging (but not that challenging)! So I set off in the direction of the Lac de Roy, which is a small lake in the mountains up above a ski resort called Praz de Lys. I'd heard it was only about an hour's walk and not very difficult so I thought I'd have time to fit it in after lunch. Only problem was I'd forgotten to pack anything to eat so I decided to treat myself to lunch in a small town about half way there - which was a real treat as I don't do it very often nowadays! Lunch at the Col de ChatillonI guess I set off up to the lake at around 1.30 p.m. and it wasn't too bad a walk, although every damn time I end up feeling like my lungs are on fire within about 10 minutes! Once I get into my stride it's fine, but those first 10 minutes are pretty miserable. Before I left I fished out an old sun hat that had a flap to protect my neck so I reckon I must have looked a bit like Beau Geste by the time I finally made it to the top!Gary Cooper in Beau GesteLac de RoyThe air up here was cooler with that still quality you get in the mountains and the dunk dunk of the cowbells. I had just gotten to the end of the lake and the cows were coming over to pose for a photo when all of a sudden I got a video call from André who wanted to run something by me. Last night he received another email from Lily. It was a bit \"rambling\" to my mind, but then I guess they have different styles of expressing themselves. French is a bit \"flowery\" and they can go round and round before they actually say what they mean, whereas English is direct and to the point - which is why it's the world's number one language for business. Anyway Lily's email just served to confirm to me that there really are no \"issues\" as such in the marriage, more a feeling of restlessness on her part, as she was talking about \"being tired of thinking about everyone else and wanting to put herself first for a change\". What can I say, I guess we all get restless too sometimes, but as André said, he just wished he didn't have to pay the price for her restlessness. There was one passive-aggressive dig at him so he wanted to run his reply by me before sending it as he knows I will always tone it down. Actually, what he replied was excellent. He's naturally very diplomatic anyway but direct and to the point. His intention would never be to hurt her but like me he's straight-talking. So the long and short of it is that he wrote back saying that he was hurt by the fact that she encouraged Pete, the photographer, after he told her he had feelings for her at the end of May (yes, it's that recent). Pete will never be a friend of his again and he was not prepared to give her the summer to \"figure out her true feelings\", but wanted to just go ahead and file for divorce since he didn't know if he could ever trust her again! So there you have it. He's going to move his stuff out of their place during his July vacation and push forward with the divorce. I admire him actually and told him that if he sat around moping like a sad-eyed puppy she would have no respect for him, but pushing ahead and kinda saying \"don't let the door hit ya in the ass on the way out\" might be the wake-up call she needs. Maybe she will realize what she has to lose - or maybe she won't! Sometimes that's when they come running back but he isn't counting on it and I think now genuinely not looking for that either. Still, it's sad, but what can I say. So as I was saying, I was just about to take the perfect picture all up close and personal with the cows and the bloody battery on my phone died as a result of talking to André. I must have looked like one of those yuppies - you know, the kind who can't even put their phones away at the top of a mountain pass, but just this once I'll take the hit. Either way I'm going to drive over and take André to lunch on Friday but I'm already reassured that he's coming out fighting and looking better than I expected. Add to that that I got in over 13,000 steps today and feel like I could crack walnuts with my bum cheeks, all in all I would say it was a day well spent!"},
{"title": "Mad dogs and English (wo)men ...", "date": "Sunday 21 June 2020", "text": "… go out in the mid-day sun! But at least this time I remembered to put more sunscreen on. I went over to my youngest son's place today as my oldest moved in with him and his wife last night. I hadn't wanted to write about it before, and to be honest I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but my oldest was blind-sided by his wife about five weeks ago when she said she was thinking about asking for a divorce! They've been together almost 15 years and married for three, and as far as he knew were very happy together, so to say it hit him like a 2 x 4 round the head is probably an understatement. She has her \"issues\" or \"complaints\" which she spelt out to him in a letter, but to be honest they seem to me to be \"issues\" that can be dealt with by talking - not by separating!!! I just listened as he told me everything that she said and tried to be as supportive as possible. His wife then left for the week to move in with her friend and at the end of that week my son moved into an airbnb and has been there for the last five weeks. He has many places he could have stayed here in France of course but the bloody borders have been closed and when he went to ask at the border they told him he wouldn't be allowed to cross into France (he lives in Switzerland) because his life was not in danger! So he's been in what turned out to be a very nice airbnb until yesterday. His friend offered him a place to stay, as did Jordan and Jen (and of course he can stay here as long as he wants), so he took Jordan and Jen up on their offer and moved in last night since the borders opened up on Monday. I went over there today to see him (first time since Christmas) and I have to admit he looked better than I thought he would (although a shower and a shave wouldn't have hurt at that point). They stayed up 'til 3 a.m. chatting so he had a bit of a hangover too, but I reckon he got a lot out of his system just by being there and talking with them. The good thing, as far as I'm concerned, is that he's now getting angry and ready to stand up for himself. Lily wants a trial three-month separation before they make a decision, during which \"we can consider ourselves to be exes\". He's now made up his mind that the wedding photographer (Pete) is a definite no-no from now on as Lily made the mistake of admitting she had feelings for him (although he's in the UK and I don't think anything has happened between them). He also told her that as long as they are still married there is no question of \"considering themselves exes\" so if she wants the freedom to mess around they'd better go for the divorce up front! They spoke last night and she still wants to go with the separation until September, but now he's more of the mind that even if she decides she wants to continue with the marriage he's not sure he can trust her again and is not willing to go through this a second time! So there you have it - the drama that smacked my family upside the head so unexpectedly!He seems good though and although initially he was saying he doesn't want to move back into France, when I mentioned to him how lovely Jordan's balcony was he said \"yeah, I'd forgotten just how beautiful it is round here\". So if they do end up splitting, moving back to France might be more appealing to him now than it was, all the more so since he could afford to buy something in France rather than rent. Then of course we've got bloody Brexit to contend with but as long as he moves before 31 December he's guaranteed the right to stay (and to be honest, it shouldn't be a problem anyway). I told him wherever he stays, to put my address as his home for the time being as they already know him at the Mairie here since he lived the first 21 years of his life in this village, and I can give him an attestation to say that he's living with me for free. Anyway, we're not there yet but there's an awful lot for him to think about, both on an emotional and a practical level!Leni the horrible cat on Jordan's balcony todayOn Thursday I went into Geneva to have dinner with my friend, my first time crossing the border and my first time in a restaurant since God knows when. The weather has been crap for about 10 days now and around 3 p.m. we had the most almighty hail storm I thought the windows might crack. So knowing that the road conditions would probably be horrendous I set off nearly three hours early to get to Geneva and decided to just spend the time waiting sitting on the lake front reading … and it was just lovely! The rain had stopped by that time and there were a couple of families just sitting on the lake front with the kids splashing around - and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! One thing I did notice though is that Versoix (where the restaurant was) is a pretty nice little town in Geneva's suburbs, except for the fact that it is right under the flight path for the airport and is therefore really noisy. Except for Thursday that is, because with air traffic hardly showing an uptick as yet, in the 90 minutes I sat there reading I only counted four planes going over. What a respite that must be to the locals!My home is in the mountains off to the rightLooking towards the Jura mountains on the north side of the lakeI had a lovely evening with my friend, who caught me up on all that was going on at work and while he has a big meeting coming up in July and is very stressed (oh I remember those meetings), I invited him to come over to my place once things calm down so we can spend more time together and he said he would like that. In other news, I was watching another episode of The Sopranos the other night and it centred around a \"war\" being waged between the Italian mafia (The Sopranos) and native Americans who wanted the statue of Christopher Columbus removed because of what it represented. So 20 years later things haven't changed that much have they - or maybe The Sopranos writers were more attuned to human behaviour than we care to think.I've also been attempting to cook more vegetarian meals lately as I'm still leaning more and more towards heading that way. Well vegan is also a possibility actually since I've found for a long time that dairy irritates me and I end up coughing and trying to clear my throat if I have too much of it. Vegan might be a bridge too far at the moment though but I don't think I would have much difficulty going vegetarian. I'm finding more and more that meat just doesn't do it for me and I love vegetarian food anyway. What's more I started watching the vegan-produced documentary Dominion the other night and I could only stomach the first 20 minutes of it (so far). I've watched these kinds of programmes before and managed to get through them but this is the first one that has turned my stomach to this extent. Narrated by Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix (amongst others) it is very well done, and I have to say pretty upsetting. So with that in mind I made what turned out to be a rather good chili tofu noodle dish the other night, and vegetarian or not, I'll definitely make that again!I guess it's no surprise to anyone except Trump that the Tulsa rally turned out to be not quite the roaring success that he bragged it up to be. I for one am at least glad that many people seem to have done the sensible thing and stayed away, so maybe the message that \"there's a pandemic going on\" did get through to some! I'm just curious to see how Trump will exact his \"revenge\" on whoever for the latest narcissistic injury, since narcs can never let any perceived slight go unpunished!And finally, I read in the news that Bojo is having a plane repainted to look more \"official\" at a cost of £900,000 and many people are outraged as that money could be much better spent. So the following meme tickled me -  made me laugh out loud actually - although I'm thinking maybe only the Brits and the Aussies might get it!"},
{"title": "Think I'm in the doghouse!", "date": "Tuesday 16 June 2020", "text": "So the Swiss/French border (and as far as I know the French/Italian border) opened up yesterday and it feels like such a relief. Not that I crossed the border first day or anything but just knowing that I can is a great feeling. I have a few doctors' checkups that are now overdue so it will give me a chance to catch up on them. I lived in Switzerland for a total of six years so I've tended to keep my specialist doctors in Geneva, even though it's more expensive than in France. Trouble with France though is you can wait six months for an appointment, hence the decision to just stay with Switzerland. On Thursday night I'm going into Geneva for dinner with an old colleague, so now I'm all excited to be (a) crossing the border, (b) going out to dinner like a real grown-up, and (c) with a man!!! I know. It'll feel like Christmas and my birthday all rolled into one. Well actually just being able to speak face-to-face with another adult will already feel pretty good, to be honest!I was reading the local Swiss news this morning and see that there are already articles in the paper about Geneva residents crossing into France to do their grocery shopping. Of course there are always the snide comments about \"they come over here and take our jobs\" and the reverse comments about \"so you don't want us coming over there 'taking your jobs' but it didn't take you too long to come over here and do your grocery shopping did it!\", but for the most part I understand it. The Swiss franc and the euro are not quite at parity (but for the sake of argument let's say they are, and the Swiss franc is pretty much 1:1 with the dollar), but one guy was saying that even shopping at ALDI or LIDL in Geneva he would spend SF 250 for a shopping cart full and here in France he would get a fuller cart for €150! So you can see why they would do it can't you! The bigger shock for me, though, was when one lady said that rump steak in France is €25/kilo and in Switzerland SF 72/kilo!!!! Wow! I've always known Switzerland was expensive and indeed spent a fortune grocery shopping for the three of us when we lived there, but I guess I'd forgotten quite how expensive it is!In other news, I've been following the story about 22 year old Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United and England football player, who wrote a very eloquent letter to Members of Parliament imploring them not to stop the free school meals programme for poorer children when the official school summer holidays begin. Apparently he has been working behind the scenes for quite some time helping to raise £20 million to support food banks and help fight child poverty. The government had been continuing free school meals to eligible children during lockdown but had announced the end of the scheme for the summer holidays. Marcus took it upon himself to write an open letter to MPs imploring them to maintain this programme. As the child of a single mother who worked full-time but only earned minimum wage he stated that the free school meal was sometimes the only meal he had some days growing up as a poor kid in Manchester. And guess what, the government have backed down and will be continuing the free meals programme throughout the summer. Well done Marcus!Marcus RashfordOn Saturday we had our latest board game evening at my place. We discussed beforehand whether we wanted to meet in person or via Zoom again and we voted unanimously for \"in person\" as there are no longer any restrictions in private homes. There was no \"social distancing\" as such because you just can't do it when you're all seated around three tables but we were all comfortable with the set up. Initially we were supposed to be 10 but then Adeline asked if she could bring her boyfriend so we ended up being eleven but that was fine. Yet again the food was lovely and I was really pleased with the way my spinach and ricotta-stuffed cannelloni came out. My photos aren't very good (I really should use my camera instead of my phone) but we had a lovely time with everyone leaving around 2 a.m.! I then stayed up till about 3 a.m. just tidying up and running a second dishwasher load, but yet again we had a great evening and the fact that the younger ones are asking to bring their friends means we must be doing something right!Isabelle is a real giggler - and her husband, Philippe, just lost it!Then tonight my friend called and we had a bit of a chat. I told him that we had been 11 at my place on Saturday night so he pretended to be all outraged and said \"but what about me, why wasn't I invited?\" I just told him I knew damn well he wouldn't come because he's an anti-social bugger, and that even if he had been here when everyone arrived he would probably have just gone upstairs to watch TV! To which he replied that that was nonsense (it isn't) but it was good to know he was one of my 11th-20th best friends and therefore outside my social circle of \"10 best friends\"! So yeah, somehow I think I might be in the doghouse again!"},
{"title": "I'm getting hammered here!", "date": "Friday 12 June 2020", "text": "And I don't mean drunk (although that wouldn't be totally unknown). No, I mean the bills have just been rolling in these past couple of days. Not unexpectedly, and I plan for them over the year anyway, but wow! I got the satellite dish replaced on Monday (€152). Then the chimney sweep came on Tuesday (€70), which frankly is money for old rope since I haven't used my fireplace in over 10 years, so five minutes vacuuming and it cost me €70, but since my house insurance isn't valid without it I had to do it. I received my fuel bill yesterday (€770), then my water bill for six months (€103), which isn't excessive by any means but still. And then my tax guy's office sent me a message to say I'll be getting the official bill from the tax people for 2019 (almost €17,000) any day now and then my monthly direct debit for taxes for 2020 will kick in at the same time!!! So yeah, I'm getting hammered. As I say, thankfully I plan for all this stuff (except the satellite dish) but it would be nice if they took the foot off the pedal a bit!Then yesterday I got another \"telemarketing\" call on my house phone, which I ignored of course. So the same number then rang on my mobile. This has been happening for a few days so I figure anyone that has my mobile I'd better answer, so I did. Turns out it was a telemarketer from SFR, my internet provider who I negotiated a new deal with last week. I knew instantly it was telemarketing though as he called me by my married name and everything has been changed to my maiden name for years now. The killer was, though, that this guy was obviously a French-speaking African. Not north African (Maghreb) - they're easier to understand - other African, and he was just so difficult to understand! In the end I had to say to him that I wasn't French and was having a hard time so could he please speak more doucement. Now doucement (gently) is usually taken to mean \"slower\", but he obviously took it to mean \"quieter\" 'cos that's what he did. So I've got this guy who sounds like a French-speaking Robert Mugabe on steroids whispering at me now and I'm thinking why oh why did I answer this bloody call? I eventually figured out that he was trying to sell me antivirus software for my computer/phone etc so I was able to whisper back at him that I had just quite genuinely renewed my Norton subscription on 31 May. Damn, I hate telemarketers to begin with but it's even worse when you end up playing Chinese whispers!In other news would you believe I've actually clocked up 500 miles walked since the beginning of the year!!!! I know! I wouldn't have thought it either. I was doing so well at the beginning of the year towards my 1,000 Miles in 2020 challenge and then the pandemic hit and I was scuppered (or so I thought). Obviously I couldn't get out and about in lockdown so I just had to put on my pedometer every morning and do what I could, but continuing to log the km/miles walked every night was a motivation to be more active around the house and garden (except for last week, of course). I'm pretty pleased and now going to give it my best to get the next 500 miles in by 31 December. I have also been good at keeping to my \"one extra hour a day of getting something done\" pledge (although it's only day two - ha!). I actually worked in the garden for two hours today and it's quite motivating once you get started, although a word to the wise. You know that compost I was making from damp grass clippings, well don't dump it around the tomato plants by the kitchen door. Damn that stuff stinks!I saw an article in the British press today on the fact that France's covid numbers continue to fall one month after the easing of the lockdown. There are obviously still new cases and more deaths (28 today I think), but the trajectory is even better than the government had dared to hope. Compare that to the numbers in the UK (over 40,000 deaths so far as compared to 29,000 in France for an equivalent population size) and I think it shows that the French pretty much got it right implementing a strict lockdown quickly as compared to the way the UK reacted. In fact, when you compare per capita deaths (and I actually know what that means Mr. Trump), the UK is doing worse than the US so far, although the pandemic is far from over in the US either. What's more I saw that Trump's team are making it a part of the terms and conditions of attendance at Trump's upcoming rallies that if attendees get sick and/or die of covid through attending his rallies they are not allowed to sue him!!!! Now frankly if you're stupid enough to attend a mass rally or concert during a pandemic you shouldn't be allowed to sue anyone, but to put it in writing? Wow. The guy never ceases to amaze!And to end on a less serious note, I saw this joke today and while it's a bit long, it actually made me laugh out loud!Two Aussie builders (Keith & Ken) are seated either side of a table in a rough pub when a well-dressed man enters, orders a beer and sits on a stool at the bar. The two builders start to speculate about the occupation of the suit. Ken: - I reckon he's an accountant. Keith: - No way - he's a stockbroker.. Ken: - He ain't no stockbroker! A stockbroker wouldn't come in here! The argument repeats itself for some time until the volume of beer gets the better of Ken and he makes for the toilet. On entering the toilet he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal. Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder. Ken: - 'Scuse me.. No offence meant, but me and me mate were wondering what you do for a living? Suit: - No offence taken! I'm a Logical Scientist by profession. Ken: - Oh! What's that then? Suit: - I'll try to explain by example... Do you have a goldfish at home? Ken: - Err.... Mmm . Well yeah, I do as it happens! Suit: - Well, it's logical to follow that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it? Ken: - It's in a pond! Suit: - Well then it's reasonable to suppose that you have a large garden. Ken - As it happens, yes I have got a big garden! Suit: - Well then it's logical to assume that in this town if you have a large garden then you have a large house? Ken: - As it happens I've got a five-bedroom house...built it myself! Suit: - Well given that you've built a five-bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you are quite probably married? Ken: - Yes I am married, I live with my wife and five children. Suit: - Well then it is logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis? Ken:- Yep! Five or six nights a week! Suit: - Well then it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often? Ken: - Me? Never. Suit: - Well there you are! That's logical science at work! Ken: - How's that then? Suit: - Well from finding out that you had a goldfish, I've told you about your sex life! Ken: - I see! That's pretty impressive...thanks mate! Both leave the toilet and Ken returns to his mate. Keith: - I see the suit was in there. Did you ask him what he does? Ken - Yep! He's a logical scientist! Keith: - What's that then? Ken: - I'll try and explain. Do you have a goldfish? Keith: - Nope. Ken: - Well then, you're a wanker!"},
{"title": "Getting my mojo back!", "date": "Thursday 11 June 2020", "text": "I've been feeling a bit blah this past week, but then it's been raining pretty much non-stop and the temperature has dropped way back down to around 15°C (59°F) - but I'll be damned if I'm going to put the bloody heating back on in June! So \"winter drawers back on then\" and/or keep moving it is. It really has bloody piddled down and \"something\" has gotten to my cucumber plants and savaged them - not saying what but the bloody slugs are now about the size of feral cats!I've been having a hard time getting off my backside too in the morning and have often ended up just sitting reading for hours on end. I even seem to have lost my oomph for cooking, but I know I'm not alone there. So I guess now's the time to change all that. Last night I went to bed at 1.30 a.m. and while I'm still getting up around 8.30 I think it's the wrong way to go. Or maybe it's just age, I mean, you know you're getting old when you have lunch at 10 am., dinner at 5 p.m. and breakfast the night before don't you (just like you remember your mom and dad doing??)! So I'm going to try for lights out by midnight at the latest, getting up earlier and other than the news, no computer until the evening. We'll see how that works. I also think I should be spending at least an hour a day getting something done, so apart from shopping and cleaning today I spent an hour in my front garden lopping back the huge (dead) roses and peonies. On 15th June France is planning to fully open up it's borders (as far as the EU/Schengen is concerned), so I'm hoping not only to be able to go into Switzerland and see my son/friends/my friend, but also to have free access to the local tip (as opposed to by appointment only, as it is at the moment). Then hopefully I can get more stuff taken to the charity shop also as I'm really getting sick of \"stuff\".As I mention, Switzerland isn't in the EU but is part of the Schengen zone (no passport controls). It's been both good and bad for Geneva (but sad to say we didn't really have beggars or the bigger drug problems until then either). But the other day I was reading the local Swiss newspaper and can you believe, only one of two Kosovans who had been hired by a banker to murder his wife (they failed thankfully) is being sent back to Kosovo. The request to send the other one back was initially approved and then repealed because of a technicality in Swiss law!!! So you see, the \"bloody immigrant problem\" exists everywhere (says she speaking as a \"bloody immigrant\" herself). It's not just in your country that the bad 'uns are taking advantage of their immigrant status (and getting away with it) but they're giving all immigrants a bad name at the same time!While I was outside working the donkeys were making a helluva racket and when I turned round to see what was up the male was obviously having a very \"hot-blooded\" moment and the female was having none of it, hence all the bloody noise. But that made me remember an incident many years ago when my niece was little. My mom and dad had a couple of donkeys in the field at the back of their house and my niece saw them having an amorous moment and said \"oh look nanny, Mary's giving Bailey a piggy-back\"! My dad - who embarrassed easily - didn't know where to put himself!Then I decided to take a bag of rubbish up to our local bins and bumped into Stan's oldest son, Sam. He's the one the most affected by being bi-racial but when I look at him all I see is a lovely young man with killer looks! Strange how most of us only see our negatives isn't it. I remember a couple of years ago on one of my Solos holidays to Greece an older Welsh widow commented to me how lucky I was to be able to wear shorts in this heat as I had \"good legs\". I was stunned because when I looked at her - yep maybe she was a bit heavier, but she had the most beautiful coffee-coloured skin because she tanned easily - and I told her so! And guess what, next day she was wearing shorts! Anyway, back to Sam, I asked how his dad was doing in Nigeria and he said that while he was happy to be there things had changed so much since he left that he was thinking of coming back to France. He has started a small business growing herbs and some crops and at first when he paid his employees their salaries everything worked out fine. But, after a couple of months, as soon as he paid them they buggered off and never came back to see out the month! He said another shock for his dad was that they no longer have coins in circulation among the population. Sure, the national bank had coins but they were \"hoarding\" them and everything now had to be paid for in notes - with no change being given. You can imagine the effect that has had on prices I'm sure! So maybe we'll see Stan back here shortly, but sad to say his café is already long gone (and sorely missed)!And finally, with my new satellite dish up and running, I managed to stream The Good Liar the other night and quite enjoyed it. The acting was superb with Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen portraying the perfect conman/scammer (McKellen) setting out to divest a rich widow (Mirren) of her fortune. I have to say McKellen in particular was excellent and really showed how good these con artists can be. That being said, there was a final sting in the tail which was somewhat unbelievable but I enjoyed it anyway.And then I stumbled on a new-to-me cookery programme called The Good Cook. Now Simon Hopkinson has obviously been around a long time as he is now mid-60s and opened his first restaurant at the age of 20, but I'd never heard of him. And I like his style. Very understated and calm. My sister loves The Hairy Bikers but I find their constant \"good ole lads\" banter irritating, and got fed up of Nigella's simpering, tight blouses and batting eyelashes. So if you want some simple, well explained cookery ideas you might try looking up The Good Cook!"},
{"title": "Creepy crawlies (and other wonderful things to find in your shoe)!", "date": "Friday 5 June 2020", "text": "We finally got our first rain in ????? days the other day and it's forecast to continue for a good few days. It's not horrendous but the temperature has dropped and a couple of times a day I now go out into my garden with a large spoon to train for the annual slug flinging competition! Bloody things, I hate 'em, so I keep checking my veggies and scraping the little buggers off before flinging them into the hedge. Well them and snails!!!! I don't mind the snails so much but I absolutely hate stepping on the bloody things in the dark, or worse still, finding one inside my garden shoes that I leave outside with my gardening stuff. Eewww, snail-filled shoes - certainly not my idea of a good pedicure! I had to laugh though as I found two snails \"stuck\" together by my front door last night, so flicked them on to the garden. This morning when I opened the door the poor sods seemed to have just been able to make their way back on to my front porch overnight to continue \"mating\" and I flicked them back onto the grass again. So they made all that effort for what turned out to be an exercise in futility to me, but then I don't really know how a snail's mind works do I. Oh wait …. nah, better not got there. I'm divorced! Then the other morning I was pulling back the curtains in the spare bedroom and found a ruddy great hornet trapped between the curtain and the window. Damn, I opened that window as wide as I could and beat a hasty retreat thinking I'd managed to get rid of it a couple of hours later when I went back in there and couldn't find it. But no, when I went into the other bedroom and turned the light on there he was again, the evil looking bugger. So I shut all the doors and opened just that one window and hope I've got the bloody thing out this time as I swear it was as big as my thumb. I remember one time finding a nest on the balcony right by my bedroom window. Not knowing what to do I set fire to the bloody thing. I'm not sure if that was the best solution but they seemed to change camp sites after that!Despite the slugs, snails and hornets, we need the rain and either way, the meme below is still pretty much spot on!And shooting off in a totally different direction, in The Sopranos episode I was watching the other night the \"guys\" headed off to Naples to do business with their Italian counterparts. Of course Naples was all very beautiful but I remember going there in 1980 (on our way down the Amalfi coast and then over to Malta) and my boyfriend and I ended up spending a couple of nights in Naples. Nope, don't think I'll bother again. We got so sick of being ripped off everywhere we went and since the lira was still the official currency at the time, with way too many \"000000\" at the end of each figure, I'm pretty sure they had us paying over $100 for a bottle of water as we couldn't figure out the exchange rate. Then getting ripped off by the hotel owner and taxi driver (who actually ran over my boyfriend's foot) and some of the worst food I have ever eaten, I swore I'd never go there again. I remember at the end of a disgusting meal we had, the restaurant owners sent the sullen little fat kid to \"wipe off our table\" as we were preparing to leave (i.e. flick the crap into our laps), so then of course you have to give the \"cute little fat kid\" who had done bugger all evening a decent tip! Which we did of course because no way were we arguing we those guys! Actually my son went there with the school many moons ago and he said the same thing about Naples. He swore the spaghetti napolitana was just spaghetti doused in ketchup and said the food was disgusting and a rip off for the tourists. That being said, he had a wonderful time and of course Naples is in no way indicative of the rest of Italy, thankfully. One of my friend's father is from Naples (mom is Scottish) and she said that even though she is family and speaks the language, there's no way she would wear any kind of jewellery while walking out and about in Naples. So I guess the mob mentality really is still alive and kicking there!In other parts of the globe, seeing people commemorating the Tiananmen Square protests the other night made me think of an article by an English friend of mine who was actually in Tiananmen Square when everything exploded! I can't remember all the details but she ended up being in the square quite by accident when the protests erupted. In fact, she hadn't really intended to be in China at all but was making her way to Siberia to see her boyfriend to get married there. As I say, I can't remember all the details as it was some time ago but she realized that as a blue-eyed blond she was most definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time and vividly described the absolutely electric tension! Eventually a bunch of Australian journalists dragged her to safety at the hotel where they were holing up and she said even there, in the relative safety of the hotel, the atmosphere was like sitting on a powder keg. Eventually they were all shepherded out of the country by the authorities and as she was getting on the train to leave a young Chinese man (a friend or a new acquaintance?) asked her to keep his address book on her as he was afraid what would happen to him if he was found with it. So she stuffed it inside her bra and this young man was, indeed, taken away on the train for \"questioning\" but was subsequently released and as they were parting ways she was able to give him his address book back, although she never knew what became of him! Now the reason she showed me the written account of her experience was because they had put out a call at work for people to submit stories to the intranet and she asked me if I thought she should submit it!!! To say I didn't think it would be a good idea would be an understatement and of course she saw my reasoning and never did publish it, but I'm so glad I got to read it. Was she foolish? Foolhardy? Or just unlucky? Who knows, but as a lady who went on to marry her Russian boyfriend in beautiful Siberia (beautiful despite the bugs that almost ate her alive), I would say she's certainly had a few experiences wouldn't you!On a totally different subject, I've recently got so sick of transferring my to do list from one page of my diary to the next that I finally got so annoyed with myself and thought \"oh for God's sake just get it done will ya\"!So I finally got round to crossing off another couple of seemingly eternally pending tasks today. I called the travel company we were going to Holland with and asked when I was going to be getting my refund and then drove down into town and fairly easily got an appointment to have the guy come out to my place on Monday with a view to replacing my ancient satellite dish. It wasn't even that difficult so why I put this stuff off I will never know!And finally (I don't half go on don't I), as I was sitting watching the news tonight they interrupted the broadcast to cut to Trump's impromptu speech from the Rose Garden. Now as soon as he comes on all I can hear is \"me, me, great, best, strongest\" so I usually mute it and just watch the chest thumping without having to listen to him. I get the gist of anything important he had to say later from whichever poor sod was given the task of listening to it and breaking out the actual facts from the self-congratulatory flatulence. But one thing that did strike me was that he always has to have a whole army of advisers standing behind him. Fair enough, I suppose, as he is the President. But it then made me think of how the other psychopathic narc I had the misfortune to meet in my working life was exactly like that. She never went to a meeting alone and it would have to be a cold day in hell if she only took one person with her. No, she would usually take an entourage of about five other colleagues (thus taking them away from their work) so that she would never get \"caught out\". You see, she actually knew jack shit and couldn't possibly dip her toes into what should not have been unknown waters alone because then she might be found out for the fraud she was. So now I'm wondering if that's another narc trait - chest beating and taking your army with you wherever you go in order to ensure that nobody ever gets to see behind the mask!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Monday 1 June 2020", "text": "Yet again there's not an awful lot going on here at the moment - or maybe it's just me that's run out of steam for a while because I'm not achieving very much. Who knows. It does seem like everyone and his uncle is ringing my phone and doorbell at the moment trying to catch up with stuff but other than that it's pretty quiet. Well over here at least - unlike the violent scenes in the US right now. What can I say that hasn't already been said? But the really sad thing to me at least is that I don't think George Floyd's death will be the last one. It never is is it, and that's what's so tragic!In other news, the telemarketers are back at it again and the other day I made the mistake of answering my mobile to a telecom company called Free trying to get my business with a special introductory offer on my house phone, TV and internet for just under €10/month for the next year. Actually I was somewhat interested as I've been disappointed with my internet provider lately, although to be honest this area is known for not having particularly good internet capacity. Anyway, I listened to the lady but as I was in a bit of a funk I just thought \"I can't be bothered going through all this again\" so decided to call my own internet provider, SFR, and tell them what Free had to offer and could they match it? And seemingly they could because I had already looked on their website. Well the lady tries to tell me that the offer is just for new customers so I said that in that case I would just give Free the go ahead to take over my account. And that's when I got put through to Mr. Account Retainer Guy! Now sometimes I have a hard time understanding these people because they go through their spiel so fast and very often they seem to have north African accents (the equivalent of the call centre in India?), so after a while I told the guy I wasn't interested in listening to much more or being put on hold again so could they do something for me or not? At this point he tried to offer me a special deal on a movie channel but I told him I wasn't interested as I don't watch French TV, so long story short, he knocked €20/month off my internet/house phone deal and another €7/month off my mobile if I would stay with them. I don't actually spend a great deal of €€€€ on either anyway so I was happy to go with that. I guess it really does pay to ask then, as long as you are prepared to politely tell them to quit the BS and let's just get down to the nitty gritty right? Actually, that's the way I ended up handing my notice in. As my friend said, you can go in there and ask for what you want (in my case, occasional telecommuting) but you have to be prepared to put your money where your mouth is and follow through if you don't get what you want. And since that's something I've always been prepared to do, I handed my notice in within a couple of hours of being refused! (And the dumb thing is, everyone at work has been working from home for the past 10 weeks now but hey, what do I care now)!I also finally managed to get Jordan's US taxes sent off and his British passport application. Wouldn't you know his passport runs out in July and as from 1 July we have to be requesting our residency permits for France, although I honestly believe the website will crash for the first couple of weeks anyway, so he should be ok. I had to laugh though as I uploaded his picture onto the passport renewal website and his picture came back as \"unacceptable\" because (apparently) it was difficult for the computer to distinguish between his facial features and the plain wall behind him!!! Who wudda thought - my son has a face that looks like a brick wall!!!!! I sent it off anyway as I disagreed so we'll see if it comes back. They also now ask if you have a second nationality and since he also has US citizenship I was supposed to send off a photocopy of every page of his US passport - which I don't have - so I just sent in a copy of the main page. I'm keeping my fingers crossed it'll go through as is but who knows!And talking of Jordan, it was his 28th birthday yesterday so I drove to their place to take his gifts over and chat for a while. I really do like their apartment because although it's small they have the most fabulous balcony overlooking a park and the mountains so I think that apartment was a good choice. And would you believe he's off on sick leave until this coming Friday because he managed to drive a nail through his thumb and ended up at the emergency room on Thursday. Apparently it was spewing blood so badly that his boss almost passed out (😅) so there were almost two of them out sick that day! He said it hurt like hell at the time but the doctor did a really good job of stitching it back up and Jen has been able to change the dressing on it and keep it clean, so hopefully he'll be back at work next week!I think my satellite dish is also on the blink so I'll have to get \"the guy\" to come out and try to realign it with the UK channels again for me. In the meantime, I'm still watching The Sopranos and have taken to watching Gina, The Italian Grandma cooking on YouTube. She's great and I like the way she cooks but she speaks English like my former neighbour in England who came to England as a war bride and never actually bothered to learn English properly. Everything - male, female, inanimate object - was a \"she\" and sometimes her rants were a delight to listen to (for the neighbours at least, maybe not for her 10 kids)! But Gina is fun to watch - as long as you've watched a few Sopranos episodes and can guess at half the Italian words!Gina, the Italian Grandma!Which brings to mind Trump's latest spat with Twitter. I think he has tried to open social media up to lawsuits, or something like that, you know, for doing depraved things like fact-checking his tweets. It was originally touted as being that Trump wanted to close Twitter down, but could you imagine Trump without Twitter??? It would be like putting two Italians in a room, tying their hands behind their backs and asking them to hold a political debate!Then on Saturday night I got an email from a former colleague who must have retired almost 20 years ago (I remember processing her pension and medical insurance paperwork). I bumped into her in town about a year ago and she did the usual \"oh we must get together for a drink\" kinda thing, \"here's my email\". So I sent her an email just to say hi and never heard back from her. Until Saturday night, when she sent me an email and asked if I could call her to \"discuss pensions\"! My first thought was that it was a scam so I checked on the number and it was indeed her number. So then I thought maybe she had gotten confused and thought I was still working in HR, but in the end I called her and she had a whole list of questions about whether she was entitled to keep French social security and our work medical insurance, did she have to pay the CSG (tax) on this and that? So I asked her if she realized I had retired and was no longer working in HR and she said \"oh yes, but Chantal gave me your number and told me you knew all about it\"! Bloody Chantal is the woman my friend and I bumped into on our way to Italy last year when she was telling me that she would love to retire but couldn't afford to, although \"it's all right for you because you were a higher grade\", and then went on to tell us how she went to Italy every week during the warm weather to go clothes shopping. And she was the one that had the same question about the CSG tax where I had been given conflicting information by two different tax guys and she went ahead and forwarded all MY tax information (with my name attached) to our local tax office to have them answer her query! I was furious because although I had nothing to hide and have indeed declared everything, that bloody female had no right to forward my information to the tax people!!! She's one of those people who talks at you not to you, and since she also sent me an email to say that she would be retiring in June I'm thinking I'll have to avoid our local town like the plague from now on. Anyway, I told Josy I couldn't give her any advice on her situation because I am not a tax expert and have never actually worked in France, so all I could do was give her the name of my tax guy (the good one, not the \"charlatan\")! But staying zen knowing that bloody Chantal is handing out my personal tax information and my contact details to staff members and former colleagues is not going to be easy I can tell you!So on that note, I'll finish with a picture of my lovely peonies and roses. All very beautiful of course but keeping up with dead-heading them takes quite some doing. Maybe it'll be easier to rip the dead heads off if I picture Chantal's face on them! Chantal's face on roses? Nah, maybe not. She's more like poison ivy. A pain in the butt you can't get rid of!."},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 25 May 2020", "text": "Things are fairly quiet here at the moment but then I suppose it is still only Monday right. With all but one of my classes now being formally cancelled until September at least, I've now only got just the one weekly yoga class until the end of June, but that's fine too I guess. I'm not much good for anything when the heat really picks up so the thought of sweating it out in an exercise class over the summer to make up for the missed classes doesn't really do it for me!I had yoga again this morning and we were lucky enough to be able to do it outdoors. There was quite a breeze first thing so I thought it actually might be a bit cold but it ended up being a very pleasant temperature, even though I had to keep moving about trying to stay in the shade. How the others can practice yoga in bright sunshine beats me but then it may be that I'm the weird one and not them. That being said, my sister can just sit out in the sun for ages so I guess we're all different. And I remember when I met up with Steve in Rhodes, he and I used to hop from one shady spot to the next while out and about, while his brother and sister-in-law's idea of a good time was lazing on sunbeds by the pool all day, and then meeting up with us later in the evening. I'm not knocking them for that, I just couldn't understand how they could do it!Anyway today she was going to have us do \"exercises for the abdomen\", and I remember thinking I haven't seen my abs since I was about 25, but made a valiant effort anyway. Even though it wasn't one of my favourite classes, I again came out of there feeling good. I then headed off back to Thyez for another hour's walk and ended up getting over 13,000 steps in today so I'm well pleased, even if the Thyez walk is probably now getting to be a little too easy. Time to find something more challenging I guess, although round here that shouldn't be a problem, as you can imagine. As I was walking along the river I noticed loads and loads of stinging nettles, so I'm now trying to think of a cunning plan to bag myself a few to make liquid nettle fertilizer for my garden. It's supposed to be wonderful, particularly for tomatoes, but I understand it stinks to high heaven too! I guess taking a huge trash bag, garden clippers and wearing full skiing gear on my next walk might look a bit weird though, don't you think!I finally managed to get my hair cut on Saturday (after three months?) - or at least after two home hair cuts. I don't know if she was being polite or she has just given up on me but she said the top and sides weren't too bad, although the back was a sight to behold (obviously) and needed sorting out - but then I don't really care what impression I make on people as I'm leaving anyway! I then stopped in at the supermarket and finally found the dual cartridge ink packs I have been looking for for my printer but crikey, they've gone from €34 per duo pack to €40!!!!! Not only that, but everything seems to have shot up in price. I guess much of our produce was coming in from Spain and Italy and now we're \"stuck\" with the more expensive French produce. Seriously, the cost of my weekly grocery shop has just sky-rocketed, and while this may not be such a big deal for me, I hate to think the effect it might be having on families! In fact, I was finally able to take my donations down to the food bank on Tuesday night for the first time in three months and they were telling me that demand has just gone through the roof!In other news I've also got an appointment to take quite a bit of stuff to the tip tomorrow afternoon (it's by appointment only at the moment) but wouldn't you know the fuel people called tonight and they want to deliver tomorrow afternoon also. It all happens at once doesn't it! I also got that bloody wasgij (jigsaw) puzzle finished finally and while it's \"satisfying\" to have finished it I'm not sure I'd buy another one - I might not have any hair left to worry about by the time I finished a second one!The picture on the boxThe finished puzzle!I was chatting with my friend last night and he mentioned that his daughter had just received her $1,200 stimulus cheque from the US! I had no idea she was American, even though I know she had lived and worked in New York for a few years, and I hadn't actually given it any thought that they might be mailing out cheques to American citizens overseas. I guess I don't see why not - I just hadn't paid any attention to it. So with that in mind I set to and prepared Jordan's US tax return and while he earns a pittance and it isn't that complicated to do, every time I got the forms completed and printed, when I went to save them all the data was erased!!! I did it three bloody times with the same result. I remember that happening last year too so I guess the IRS will just have to make do with the printed copy because I'm not doing it again! Maybe with any luck my kids will now also receive the stimulus cheque - who knows. It'll be a nice surprise for them if they do but then again, don't count your chickens right!And finally, when I got home tonight I saw an email from my neighbour who is on the town council, letting us all know of his decision to stand down but also informing us that as from today they are introducing a hosepipe ban due to \"drought conditions\"! So no car washing, no swimming pools to be filled up - you get the idea. I'm just so glad I got my \"swimming pool\" (oversized paddling pool, truth be told) filled up a couple of days ago or could you imagine me getting stuck with that thing on my terrace and ending up filling it with tomato plants instead?So anyway, a joke for you. Bill's walking down the road one day when he bumps into Jack and they get chatting about how they're coping during the pandemic. So Bill says \"oh I lost my job due to lock down but decided to set myself up in a little business working for myself, being my own boss, kinda thing. I was doing pretty well to begin with - I had a great little number going on performing colonic irrigations - and then they introduced the bloody hosepipe ban\"!"},
{"title": "I'm so glad I made the effort!", "date": "Thursday 21 May 2020", "text": "I gave myself a real talking to yesterday. My ideal future always involved being done with work and having plenty of time to \"go hiking in the mountains\". So now I'm retired and do indeed have plenty of time to go hiking in the mountains - except I'm still not fit. When I was at school I loved sports, all of it, played basketball for my county for two years and was up for anything. I guess many of us were the same, right? But then four years at college and having no time (long commute - the story of my life it seems, working weekend jobs and so on) and the sport that I loved so much went out the window. Then came my job in Switzerland and while I skied that was about it. And you know how the rest of it goes don't you. Work, commute, marriage, family and I just became totally unfit and hated it, but obviously not enough to do anything about it. But now what's my excuse? I don't have one right, and I know it. Anyway, my neighbours were telling me on Monday that they had just come back from a short hike at the Plâteau de Cenise so I thought \"that's it, that's where I'm going on Wednesday\". Jordan and his mates used to hike up there when they were younger and just camp out up on the plâteau. Jordan even used to strap a wooden garden chair to his back and lug that up there with him. I told him we had plenty of fold-up camping chairs but nope, he wanted that chair, so lug it up there he did. He must have looked like King Canute sitting up there in the middle of the mountains on his chair but what can I say, a kid's gotta do what a kid's gotta do. Cenise is also the spot where my friend, Valérie, scattered her son, Hugo's, ashes after he was killed in a horrific car crash nine years ago and when the kids used to go up there to camp they always took flowers to leave for Hugo!Anyway, back to the plot. There is a road to get up there that I absolutely hate. It's more or less a bloody goat track and basically a one lane road with a few passing points. You get hairpin bends and cars coming to within a few millimetres of each other. Another coat of paint and you'd take the side of your car off. So I wasn't going to go up that road but headed out looking for the other, easier, road, but guess who screwed up. Yep, I ended up back on the road from hell, called the Gorges du Bronze, but with my heart in my mouth and on a wing and a prayer I actually made it up to the parking lot. Let's face it, there was no reversing back down or doing a u-turn anyway was there!The road through the Gorges du Bronze - not too bad at this point but it got steadily worse!The \"goat track\" - this is where I just closed my eyes and hoped for the best!When I got further up into the meadow land I saw the most amazing alpine flowers ever. Not at the very top, but about two-thirds of the way up, they were just stunning. I couldn't stop to take a picture (for obvious reasons) so had to use a stock picture but those wild flowers were just so beautiful. Actually I've scattered a couple of packets of wildflower seeds in my garden and will be well pleased if they turn out anything like this.Eventually I made it up as far as I could go by car, slathered on a smidgeon of sun cream and set off. And here's where I get annoyed at myself. You see, it wasn't even particularly hard walking but I was puffing away like a blue whale for the first 15 minutes until I got into my stride, and that's just ridiculous at my age. Okay, losing 40 lbs would probably make it a lot easier but still!!! There were much older couples on that walk - probably nearer 80 than 70 - and they just plodded on at a steady pace with no apparent difficulty. I know they've probably been doing it all their lives but still, you can see why I get annoyed with myself can't you. Anyway, I made it up to what was my initial destination of the cross, but then realized it was only another 20 minutes to the plâteau itself so just kept on going, for a total walk of about an hour, I guess.The highest point is at over 1,700 metres and to be honest I should have known better with the \"sunscreen business\" because I didn't use it often enough!!!! It is deceptively cooler at altitude but the sun's rays are that much harsher so I managed to burn the back of my neck a bit and also have a rather fetching \"V shape\" on the front of my chest the colour of a turkey cock's arse (as my dad used to say). Still, I guess it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Many years ago, before I was married, my then boyfriend and I went skiing for the day at over 2,000 metres. I had put a \"dab\" of sunscreen on in the morning and then forgot all about it. The end result was that I got sunstroke and my face swelled up to the size of a basketball. Then my boyfriend fell over in the parking lot on the way back and broke his wrist. To say we should have stayed home that day is probably an understatement!Before!A couple of days after our ski trip!When I got to the top, the elderly couple behind me branched out to continue on so I asked them where they were headed. They said the Rochers de Leschaux, which was about another couple of hours' walk and quite tricky in parts, but the lady called it \"sublime\", said it was a nature reserve and you could see mountain goats, marmots and all kinds of wild animals. So that'll be another one to add to the list, once my fitness levels are up to it (if ever).As you can see, there are still scattered patches of snowAll in all I probably only bumped into 10 people in total all afternoon, although I did spot one lady about 300 metres further down from me wearing a face mask???? She's in the middle of the alps with no-one around and still feels the need to wear a face mask? Oh well, each to his own I guess!"},

{"title": "The new normal?", "date": "Tuesday 19 May 2020", "text": "Well not really I suppose as things are anything but normal right now, but at least it's more \"normal\" than it has been this past couple of months. And while I said all along that lock down hadn't bothered me too much, I realize just how lucky we were to have had seven weeks of fabulous weather out of the eight we were obliged to stay home. It would probably have been quite another matter if it had rained non-stop wouldn't it. But anyway, now that I'm freer than I was, I had my first Monday morning yoga lesson in two months this morning and thoroughly enjoyed it, as it really felt like it was time to get back to the exercise I had happily (and surprisingly) totally ignored for the past two months! Because the weather was so lovely our class was held outside in the garden - just three students and Tiphaine, the teacher. It was quite a different experience to an indoor class though, all the more so since her neighbour keeps hens and we had a very noisy cockerel join us for part of the lesson. And again - and I know I say this every time - while I often have the impression that the exercises we did were \"nothing much\", I always come out of her class absolutely ache-free and just buzzing!And talking about yoga, my neighbour was telling me that she bumped into Annie (the treasurer of the Tuesday afternoon yoga association) at the market and she was telling her that they are not going to renew the contract of Sylvie, the Tuesday teacher, this autumn after her last freak-out that I wrote about previously and we will now be getting Tiphaine instead. I reckon we will all be very pleased about that! Annie told my neighbour she was annoyed at herself for not speaking up when Sylvie wasted most of our lesson ranting about anything and everything, and I just assumed she meant she wished she had calmed her down and then asked her to get back to the class, but no - she said she wished she had finally spoken up and said enough is enough, this just isn't working out. I did comment to my neighbour that losing this contract might be the straw that breaks the camel's back but her response was just \"pfft\". So I guess I'm either a big softie or the French are a helluva lot tougher than I will ever be. Either way, while I feel sorry for this teacher, I'm glad that I'll now be getting in two lessons a week with Tiphaine come September!After my lesson I thought why not take myself off walking like I used to do \"BL\" (before lock down), and I'm so pleased I did as it was glorious. I headed back off out to Thyez for a walk and while it is always a beautiful spot, the fact that people are still not allowed to picnic or use the play areas for the time being, and also with people now being back at work anyway, the parking lot was virtually empty and I almost had the place to myself. So on top of 90 minutes of yoga I got in a 12 km walk too and am feeling pretty chipper I must say!ThyezPeople are still not allowed to use the little beach as yet!When I got home I dragged my inflatable swimming pool up from the basement because this year I'm determined to have somewhere cold I can throw myself into when the temperatures start hitting 30°C (86°F) and upwards (and even in the 40s°C (104°F) on occasion). So I pottered about spreading it out, assembling the ladder and figuring out how to work the water filter and I realized that thing is going to take up half my back terrace. But so what, it's the only part of my land that's actually flat so if that's where it has to be, then so be it. Maybe at least this way I will be able to laze in my \"pool\" while grabbing myself a cool drink out the fridge at the same time! So with that in mind I took my little temporary greenhouses back down into the basement and I reckon moving the BBQ and the table and chairs just a little I should still be ok. My neighbour came over with his electric air pump to get it started but it's a bit of a dud so I think I'll go out tomorrow and buy a new one - well that and maybe an inflatable armchair (with drink stand) and some Elton John-style sunglasses to go with it! You've gotta look the part after all. It's either that or I'm off up to a place called the Plâteau de Cenise tomorrow so we'll see which one wins.I have a bit more planting out to do but other than that I just pottered in the garden when I got back from my walk, putting another couple of bags of grass clippings onto my compost heap and would you believe it, when I turned that stuff over the underside bit was actually steaming, so I guess something's working/composting. My neighbour is dead impressed with my \"ingenuity\" so he said and is now setting up another compost heap in his garden and we're going to see who can grow the biggest pumpkins in it!Then on Saturday we had our latest \"pandemic\" board game evening. It had been set up before the world went to hell in a hand basket, so this time we decided to do it \"virtually\", with me going round to my neighbours and my son and his wife getting together with their two friends and we all \"zoomed\" in to play. I took over chicken in white wine and a German hot potato salad (which went over very well) and while the games were a bit hit and miss because of the hook ups, there was plenty of food and drink and we actually had a good time, playing until about 1 a.m. Next time is at my place where all being well we will get together on my back terrace (although some might have to play sitting in the pool now, come to think of it). Oh well, we'll just have to cross that bridge when we get to it!Virtual board game eveningI've been limiting my news watching lately because while I want to know what's going on with the pandemic I don't want it playing in my head 24/7 on a constant loop. I think we need to be informed but we don't need to be scared out of our minds. I'm all the more determined to limit my TV watching though since I saw on the news the other night that \"militants\" had attacked a maternity hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing many mothers and newborns!!!! Have we always been this sick or is this just a new level of depravity? What in the hell is the world coming to, 'cos if you know I sure don't!Anyway, I did put TV on the other night while I was trying to advance the wasgij I should never have bloody well started! There was nothing much on so I ended up watching Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in Sherlock Holmes, and while I like RD Jr. and thought he and JL sparred off each other pretty well, I did get sick of all the fight scenes and noisy brawls. Somehow, my impression of Sherlock Holmes is that he would never have been caught in anything as vulgar as a fight, he was just too much of a gentleman!Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock HolmesPeter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes - now that's more like it!So basically there's bugger all to watch on TV. I ended up subscribing to Amazon Prime videos a while back because I wanted to watch The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel and since I've watched all three series I wasn't sure what else (if anything) I wanted to watch. A year or so ago a friend lent me the entire Downton Abbey series which I enjoyed, and then another friend lent me Desperate Housewives. I made it to series three of DH but then kinda got bored with it. I think what did it for me was \"Susan\" (Teri Hatcher) playing the perpetually dumb female making googoo eyes over \"Mike\" (James Denton) - you know, the actor who, while absolutely gorgeous, would seem to have just one facial expression and most likely just one act - a bit like Hugh Grant. I don't know, it was cute to begin with but I gave up in the end. Soooooo don't laugh but I decided I would start watching The Sopranos, going right back to the first series which was actually filmed in 1999 can you believe???? I know, I know, I'm anything but up-to-date. But either way I'm enjoying what I've seen so far. When I start watching this stuff I always end up looking up the actors, so I was shocked to see that the late James Gandolfini was only 37 when he made the first series. Gosh, with his balding head and dad bod I had him pegged to be in his 50s. I like him anyway, and it was really tragic to hear that he actually died at the age of 51 from a heart attack, but I must be totally off whack with my \"sizing people up\" skills, because I was way out on that one.James GandolfiniSo I guess I'm only 21 years late watching the first series that everyone was raving about at the time, but better late than never I guess. Next they'll be telling me Princess Diana has died - ha, as if!"},
{"title": "My babies!", "date": "Monday 11 May 2020", "text": "A belated happy Mother's Day to all you ladies out there who celebrated Mother's Day this weekend. It's difficult for me to know when to celebrate because in the UK Mother's Day is in March, in Switzerland it was this past Sunday and in France it's the last Sunday in May, so my lovely second son was actually born on Mother's Day on 31 May 1992!In gardening news, while I have a hard time believing it, given what a cobbler's job I did, the potatoes I planted recently have started to grow. As I said before, I think I took about 20 minutes to throw down some cardboard, poke a one inch hole into the earth underneath it (because the ground was so solid I couldn't go any further) and then bung in a couple of old sprouted spuds and top with grass clippings - but wadda ya know - those babies have started growing. It's almost as exciting as giving birth, but without the pain and no Johnny Bench sitting there looking at your fanny!20 minutes work - and about 10 days' growth!And is it just me or does anyone else love the smell of tomato plants? I've always loved the smell of wet grass but when it comes to snipping off the middle shoot of a tomato plant I just love that smell. (As you can tell, I'm getting old and obviously easily pleased!) I saw another YouTube video the other day and redesigned by plant-watering system using old plastic bottles. That now involves holding four inch nails in the flame of my gas cooker (holding the nails with a set of pliers of course) and then poking them through the bottle tops in order to drip-feed my plants - and it seems to be working. Man, I feel like some kind of nuclear scientist!And going off on a totally different tangent, today I saw on FB a story by someone in my local region who had requested an appointment with Grenoble to hand in his naturalisation dossier in 2018 - and had got his appointment 15 months later! Now I requested an appointment to hand in my paperwork 10 months ago and there is still no response, so going by this person's timeline - 15 months to hand in your paperwork for citizenship (to see if it is ok) and then his citizenship appointment is scheduled for 2023!!!! So five years from initial request to even getting to put your case to request French citizenship!!!! Oh well, I will keep trudging along. I don't need to be French to stay here as my right to residence is guaranteed, but I want to do this. I'm just sad that it will take so many years to actually do it! Bloody Brexit!In other news, I received a message from my Monday morning yoga teacher to say that they have been authorized to start teaching again and did I want to return to class? And yep, I do. I need the exercise anyway but I also want to start supporting local businesses, so sign me up. We will hopefully be outside and can maintain social distancing, but otherwise she has now built a separate yoga room in her garden so I'm happy to go ahead. Which makes me wonder what our Tuesday afternoon yoga class will look like. I'm the youngest (by far) and suspect many of those ladies will back out even if they announce the commune will authorize them to start up again. I will go though if they open up and then we can see what happens!And funnily enough, I remember seeing a meme about people \"desperate\" to exercise in the UK after lock down. My friend was asking what I wanted to do after lock down was lifted and I said I wanted to go out walking but \"they'd forecast colder weather next week\". So he just laughed and pointed out how I had happily gone out walking in minus zero weather so what was my problem now? And you know, I don't have a problem, and I can go out when I want right? It did make me wonder though what will happen when all those people who were \"denied their right to go out exercising\" now have that right restored to them. Will they now go back to being the tech-ridden couch potatoes so many of them were as they were before? Who knows!Today being the first day of \"freedom\", I decided to celebrate and head off to the garden centre as I've wanted a hummingbird feeder for a while. It's weird because while the parking lot was fairly full the shop was ok, not too full at all. For the first time I wore my mask (and was thoroughly miserable as I don't feel like I can breath) but hey, that's what we do right. But as I was about to set off to the garden centre my neighbour walked over and handed me a \"red, white and blue\" face mask which, apparently, all the local communes are now issuing to each household. So I got a washable face mask with elasticated string with the French flag on it. Fine by me, at least they are being proactive.So I decided to head off to my local garden centre for tomato plants and picked up a few bits and bobs from the organic food store on the way out, including a bottle of organic white wine. Lovely! I haven't been buying booze during lock down - just because - but now I have a very organic hangover, sad to say. Serves me right I suppose, but I guess it's all in the name of freedom! Glad to oblige!"},
{"title": "We're green!!!!", "date": "Friday 8 May 2020", "text": "I couldn't sleep last night. Or more correctly, I just didn't feel tired yesterday evening so ended up staying up till 2 a.m. when I thought I'd better go to bed because it was getting ridiculous. And then this morning I realized it had been a \"flower moon\" last night so maybe that had something to do with it. Either way I'd already made up my mind I was going to do bugger all today and very nice it was too. And then I saw in the media pictures that people had taken of the flower moon at different locations - and boy were they stunning. The one I really zoned in on was taken over the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. Oh lordy did that bring back wonderful memories of one of the most amazing experiences of my life. In 2003 a Turkish friend of my husband's organized a luxury long weekend in Istanbul for us and it was just fabulous, all the more so since Mehmet was actually from Istanbul so knew all the places to take us. His mother invited us up to her apartment for tea on the last night and as her place was high up in the hills overlooking the city we had the most glorious view of the Blue Mosque as the sun was going down and the call to prayer began. As I say, it is one of the most enduring memories of my life, it was so fabulous. Well that and I remember walking down to the beach in Bali to watch the sun set and it looked like there was this enormous golden globe hanging there over the ocean - and then someone just \"cut the string\" and it was gone!The Blue Mosque, IstanbulSo today was, by choice, a quiet day where I really didn't do much except the basics and then sat outside in the garden reading for ages since the weather was so perfect. Yesterday I had gone grocery shopping and again it was pretty quiet. Even though the shelves are not as full as they should be you can pretty much get everything you need. As I was going in to the health food store to buy my kombucha I noticed the crazy guy who had hassled me outside sewing club just before Christmas. This guy had tons of hair and a full beard when he was bugging me so you can imagine what he looks like now in lock down with an even fuller head of hair and a mad man's beard! But there's something that doesn't sit right with me about him and I can't put my finger on it. I wasn't going to stick around to find out if he remembered me but I hope I don't bump into him too often - he's just too weird for my comfort. Anyway, when I went into the store I bumped into a guy who worked in our cafeteria at work. He was telling me that he was now in his third month of being furloughed and while he was receiving 60% of his salary it was tough. I actually felt he was getting a bit too close to me when he was talking so kept backing off until he got the message. But he asked me if I had heard the rumour about three deaths at work because of Covid and I said I hadn't and I didn't think it could be right because we would have been informed. Well it turns out that there are currently eight cases of infection at work but I don't know who they are nor how serious they are. I just hope they all pull through.I was chatting to my gardener when he came the other day and I commented that he must be pretty busy right now, what with the good weather followed by bursts of rain and so on and he said not so much. People had actually been asking him not to come as they didn't want him getting too close to them! I guess people really are scared because that didn't make sense to me, what with him being out in the garden and me being on my terrace. But then I was asking the roof guys how it was going and they said that they had had people cancelling, with me thinking it was for financial reasons but they said no, again, people didn't want to be around them. And again, that didn't make sense to me because they were on my roof and nowhere near me. Still, I guess everyone has their tolerance level for what they find acceptable don't they!Then this afternoon I wandered over to my neighbours to pick up some cut branches from their hazelnut tree to make more wigwams for my tomato plants. They probably are a bit of a joke because my wigwams are so flimsy looking that if anyone sneezes within a 10 metre radius I'm pretty sure they'll collapse, but it amuses me to keep making them. Anyway, my neighbour came over for a coffee and was in a pretty bad way, telling me she was sick to death of her patronising bastard of a husband (her words) and the way he talked to her like she was an idiot who needed to be \"tolerated\"! They have an issue with underground piping which channels the mountain springs away from our homes getting backed up and resulting in their basement taking in water on occasion. Now as far as we can tell the blockage is on the village road at the bottom of their garden and if that is the case it is up to the commune to get it fixed. But her husband set off to see a company to have them come out and sort it out, while she feels that the first step is to get in touch with the Mairie and have them send someone to look at it. It's not a question of who's right or who's wrong (although she's actually right) but it's the way he speaks to her. I know she's telling the truth because I've heard him and I can only say that if my ex ever tried that on I would (and did) give him such an ear bashing he wouldn't have been quick to do it again. Trouble is, I always stood up to my ex and didn't allow him to speak to me in such a disrespectful way but she never did - and it's probably too late to start now isn't it. But again, damn, I'm glad I'm single!Then tonight I got another scam email from \"Dr. Abdul Mohammed from Burkina Faso who was desirous of putting $13.5 million in my bank account dearest\" and I was to write back to him ASAP so that we could get the ball rolling. They're coming thick and fast at the moment and I was probably a bit riled up from listening to my neighbour so I wrote back and said \"f... off you twat\" and a couple of minutes later he wrote back and said \"wow, that was a bit aggressive wasn't it\" and I just burst out laughing. So I said \"oh I'm sorry, was I supposed to send you my bank details?\" and just blocked and deleted. These idiots can barely write English and then to address someone as \"my beloved\" or \"my dearest\"??? Well really, how dumb do they think I am?So after reading for a while I decided to plant out a few more tomato plants and then three cucumber plants with a home-made, plastic bottle irrigation system I had seen on Youtube last night. It's pretty much the same system you see everywhere - you poke a few holes in a plastic bottle, fill it with water and bury it nose-down in the ground so it self-irrigates. Well even though I only used a nail to make the holes I must have been a bit over zealous because far from the desired drip, drip, drip of water slowly feeding the cucs, I got a roaring whoosh and the bloody things were swimming for their lives in about two seconds flat. I think I'll have to take another look at my prototype!And it looks like our lock down will be eased as from Tuesday, according to what the French Prime Minister said the other night. They are deconfining according to zones and I was a bit worried that we might be a red zone because we're only one hour from northern Italy and if you take in the région (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes), which includes the hotspot of Lyon, I reckon we would still be red. But they seem to have taken the département (Haute Savoie) and we have come up green, so as from Tuesday things should be eased for us. No more attestations necessary to go out, we can travel freely up to a distance of 100 km from home, we're free to meet up in small groups and go into the mountains, although the lakes remain out of bounds for the time being, and many businesses are being allowed to open back up. Of course it all depends on people being sensible, but I believe they will be. I for one won't be dashing out to go to any parties any time soon, but just to have that freedom to go up into the mountains again feels absolutely delicious!And finally, I just wanted to send huge hugs through the ether to Anne in Alabama who has just lost her lovely mom. Thinking of you at this difficult time Anne!"},
{"title": "It's raining men!", "date": "Tuesday 5 May 2020", "text": "Crikey, one minute I'm lazing around doing nothing much at all and the next everyone and his uncle decides they'd better come over to my place! To be fair I was expecting the roof guys this morning as they had called me last week, so I crashed out of bed at what is now an ungodly hour for me and jumped into the shower and waited, and waited and …. And then I got a call to say that they would be another couple of hours because they had to take the generator back to the depot at Albertville as it was playing up! Oh well, what can I say. So four of them turned up around 11.30 a.m. and got started covering everything up and then up on the roof to start some sort of treatment, to be followed by pressure spraying, and then more treatment. I'm not exactly sure which order they work in but because they were late arriving they said they would only do one side of my roof today and if it was all right by me they would come back tomorrow to do the other side. It's not a problem for me as I'm hardly going anywhere with lock down am I! My friend sent me a \"good morning\" message and I told him I was up to my eyeballs in men so he said \"enjoy\", to which I replied that I would but that we were careful and using protection!!!To be fair, I thought they did a really good job covering stuff up - and not just the driveway, but the plants and grass also. When I explained to them that my one neighbour's car was broken down and they couldn't move it they just said no problem and covered that up too!Round the side of the house leading to the back garden - it was pretty bleak weather as you can see!Since I knew I was going to be stuck here for the morning I set about and planted up a few broccoli, courgettes and kale at the top of the garden, then decided to bake a cake \"just in case\" and then realized that my kitchen door was looking pretty drab now so set to and got that painted. Nothing too strenuous in and of itself but enough to keep me busy - and not think about how much I needed to pee! You see, the previous owners of this house removed one of the downstairs walls and repositioned the front door, which gives a much better flow to the house but it meant taking out the downstairs toilet! Big mistake! While the plumbing is still there obviously, if I were to put that toilet back I could actually open the front door while sitting on the loo - not a good look even if it might scare the Jehovah's witnesses away! There are two bathrooms/toilets upstairs but they are both under the roof with skylights so I didn't fancy nipping up there for a pee with a chap wandering over my roof with a pressure spray (again, not a good look). Thankfully after they'd got all the plastic sheeting laid down they took off for half and hour to get something to eat so all was not lost and the relief was palpable!Then out of the blue my gardener showed up, so another white van on the driveway. He comes and goes as and when and I pay him at the end of the year so it wasn't any trouble and the garden looks a lot better now of course. In this kind of weather, though, you could probably cut the grass twice a week, though I'll resist temptation to interfere. I got him to dump all the grass cuttings onto a large sheet of cardboard I'd laid out under my hazelnut tree so I now have the makings of my very own compost heap!And then the fuel guy called and asked if he could make a delivery as he was in the area! I'd just ordered 1,100 litres of fuel since they're practically giving it away right now but crikey, the neighbours must have been wondering what was going on chez moi. Which brings to mind a story from back in the 1970s. My sister was dating her now-husband who was a police motorcyclist. One day he and a few mates were in the area and decided to stop in at mom and dad's for a cup of tea. One of the sons from the very large family next door was in the army and he must have had the same idea as my brother-in-law so he and his mates showed up in a huge army truck and parked behind the police motorcycles. Again, the neighbours must have wondered what the hell was going on when they saw that lot parked out front!But now everyone has gone home, I've cleaned up the kitchen and moved some of my more fragile plants into shelter as there is a thunderstorm on the horizon. I love a thunderstorm but my plants not so much! So all in all I'm knackered. I've again done over 10,000 steps today without leaving my property so I reckon, given my obvious new-found fitness, it might be fun to sign up for the below as a starting point for my new fitness regime!My son offered to meet me at the half-way point with water - cheeky bugger!"},
{"title": "Freedom - or almost!", "date": "Sunday 3 May 2020", "text": "Well not quite yet but all being well France will begin easing some of the lock down restrictions as from next Monday, so fingers crossed. They have said, however, that how the restrictions are eased will depend on which département (state/county) we're in and where it stands as far as Covid19 is concerned. From what I can tell so far, Haute Savoie (which is where I live) should be one area where the restrictions can be eased more fully, although I'm still not sure we can cross the borders, either into Italy or Switzerland just yet. I said to my friend, the first thing I'm going to do is climb up Cou, which is the mountain behind my house that you can see in my header picture. After that, a trip to the local tip and to drop stuff off at the charity store and I'll be a happy bunny (oh, and a trip to the hairdresser's to get this mushroom cloud on top of my head whipped into shape). Other than that I don't see me mixing too much with anyone, although it will be good to see my kids. Just a few walks to get back into the swing of things and I'll be happy!Just to rub it in though my friend sent me these pictures of Keukenhof (Holland), where we were supposed to be last week. Oh well, there's always next year I suppose. I'm still very much of a mind to travel when all this is over but I don't see it happening for a long time sadly!All pictures by Albert DrosJordan sent me a message last night asking if I knew what blood type he is. I don't as it turns out, but I guess Jen was looking at his vaccination card and trying to make sure he is up-to-date. Apparently he needs a polio update and I told him to check his tetanus too. The good news is that he's going back to work tomorrow after a month of being furloughed. It'll be good for him to get out the house, I suspect it'll be good for Jen not to be the only one working, and it'll certainly be good for their finances!I'm more or less finished painting the kitchen and I have to say I'm quite pleased with it now. I think the deciding factor was when I painted over a corner wall that had a kind of coppery covering on it and now everything looks pretty clean - well everything, that is, except the kitchen door - which now looks grubby, wouldn't you know! I've left the paint out as I'm sure I'll spot parts that I missed tomorrow in the daylight so maybe I'll just use the same paint and do the inside of the door too. I'm not sure about the other side of that door as it goes into the living room so I'll have to have a think about that. Now that everything is cleaned up and put away it looks pretty good, even if I say so myself. With the weather predicted to pick back up again next week it'll hopefully motivate me to get back out in the garden and pot up/plant out my seedlings, before they start to resemble triffids in their little greenhouses!When I came in tonight I caught the tail end of Ben Fogle's New Life In The Wild and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now Ben is very easy on the eye anyway but I like him too. Tonight's episode was shot in Croatia with a former elite athletic coach who had a \"spiritual awakening\" and just got sick of the cut-throat atmosphere in elite athletics so gave everything away and set up home deep in the forest in Croatia. He built his own home and was living in splendid isolation until he met his girlfriend, who was a teacher in the local town. Ben does these programmes on people who just chuck it all in and opt out of society for the most part, and I really enjoy them. It's not a life I would want, but I have sometimes wondered if I actually could chuck it all in and live a simpler life on very little somewhere else. I don't know, but I would never rule anything out. Heck I never thought I would move to Switzerland at 21. Then I never thought I would resign and go off to Bali and Australia on my own for six months, so I guess the answer is \"never say never\" huh!Ben FogleAnd finally, I've been seeing this advert on TV lately and I wanted to post it simply because it makes me laugh. I have a very Gary Larson-esque sense of humour so I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"},
{"title": "Captain Tom celebrates his 100th birthday!", "date": "Thursday 30 April 2020", "text": "The other day I finally realized that I couldn't think of a single good excuse to put off painting the kitchen any more so decided there was nothing for it but to just get on and do it. Now I don't mind the idea of painting as such but I absolutely hate having to move everything so that I can get into all the nooks and crannies. I tell ya, the temptation to just paint round that bottle of ketchup where it stood was extremely strong, but then that would mean I would have to keep buying the same brand for ever and a day. So in the end there was nothing for it but to just move stuff and get started. I've never been one to work all day like a navvy and get it all done in one go. I've always done a bit here and there and quit when I get fed up of it. My ex used to go nuts as he wanted everything over and done in one fell swoop but then when it was finished he would toddle off to sit in front of the TV while I still had to clean up and make dinner and so on, so now I always stop before I get to the point of being knackered. Anyway I started out painting the ceiling, then one of the walls the next day and so on. To be honest I did such a cack-handed job the first day it felt more like flinging paint at myself and hoping some of it would stick to the walls, but each day I've done a little more and tried not to make so much mess as it just means more cleaning up. I'm not totally sure of the colour though. I had wanted just plain white but this seems to have somewhat of a bluish-greyish tinge to it which looks a bit cold so I'm wondering what exactly the colour \"blanc bec\" really is in paint terms. Whatever, it's up there now and it's not going anywhere so I'll have to jazz it up a bit if I think it looks too cold. I realized pretty quickly that I don't like using a roller so went to the DIY store and bought a new paintbrush, but would you believe there were hardly any in stock!!! I guess everyone is using lock down to get some DIY done because the shelves were pretty bare. Then despite what it would seem to indicate on the paint pot, I realized last night that I might not have enough to get it all done, so today I played the daring young thing and drove into town for the second time in a week to get another pot of paint. And miracle of miracles they had the exact paint I needed - I got the last pot. Crikey, can you imagine if they didn't have any and I ended up left with one odd coloured wall!Anyway since I was in town I decided to stop in at the health food shop again as my friend told me she had bought cottage cheese there the other day. Now cottage cheese is not exactly the in thing in France and most people have never heard of it, so it's not easy to find. But I got a couple of tubs of that and a bottle of kombucha and lo and behold, as I went to pay I saw that they were selling hand sanitizer at the cash register, so I got a bottle of that too. You know, I'm beginning to think that if I decided to have another shot at internet dating, just mentioning the fact that I can wield a paintbrush and have a bottle of hand sanitizer I think my stock would trade high, don't you!As I drove out I looked at the price of petrol and man has it dropped - so far this lock down I reckon I'm getting six weeks to the gallon and counting. So tomorrow I'll go and check my heating fuel and get that ordered while they're virtually giving it away. Every little helps doesn't it. Then I got an email from the tax people to say that \"your tax statement is online\" and when I checked it it looks like my tax guy has already set up the automatic deduction with my calculations being bang on. I'm so pleased because as I've said before when you've given up a good job based on a set of calculations it would come as a helluva shock to find out you'd totally screwed up and were basically now broke. Phew!I was watching TV the other night while still trying to get on with my jigsaw puzzle (never again) and I see that they've got a new series of Kirstie Allsopp's crafting programmes on, specifically designed around lock down I guess. I like Kirstie as she's very tongue-in-cheek, but you know how every Christmas you're going to have a totally \"hand-crafted Christmas\" and it never works out that way - well that's how I feel about this stuff. She's entertaining anyway, even if I never do get round to doing a complete découpage project using an old map of France for the design, although that has actually given me a couple of ideas, truth be told!Kirstie AllsoppAnd finally, today is the 100th birthday of the amazing Captain Tom and the country celebrated with him. At last count his fund has raised over £31 million for the NHS and he has received 150,000 birthday cards from around the world. An eagle-eyed boffin at the Ministry of Defence noticed that he was missing a WWII medal that he was entitled to so they made a special presentation of that medal to him this morning, along with a beautiful cake, a message from the Queen and news that he has been made an honorary Colonel! But the icing on the cake was when the RAF did a fly past of a WWII hurricane and spitfire over his home! Absolutely stunning. I think in difficult times it's lovely for people to get behind a figurehead and he seems to have fulfilled that role. But more importantly, he seems such a humble and decent man and when, at the end of the interview he simply said \"it'll be all right again soon you know, it always is\", it was just so so special and heartwarming. Warms the cockles of your heart doesn't it!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2020", "text": "While this whole pandemic situation is obviously dreadful with such terrible loss of life and many people's livelihoods going to pot, there are some people who seem to be thriving as a result of it - and I don't mean the TP and hand sanitizer hoarders (who will, hopefully, get the consequences they deserve). No, I was watching the news the other day when they ran a clip about a company using robots in Milton Keynes to deliver groceries and the point of it being on the news was that they were currently delivering free of charge to NHS workers. This scheme has, apparently, been around for a couple of years, but given the current crisis they were working on building more robots and expanding the scheme sooner rather than later - and good luck to them. I hadn't heard of them before but what a neat idea and it's nice to see a company like this benefitting from their ingenuity!Another positive is that the village shop would also seem to be making a come-back in some more rural areas, given people's difficulty in getting to larger stores, or just their reluctance to go to them. These shops were being slowly squeezed out by the big stores but the presenter of this particular clip was saying that hopefully the village shop will be able to survive and even thrive after the pandemic as not only shops but also the important community hub that they used to represent.In other news, it started raining on Sunday night for the first time in - oh, I don't know - six weeks maybe. It has been so gloriously warm and sunny that it has been a pleasure to take time out and just potter. That being said, we actually needed the rain so while it's quite a bit cooler it's not unwelcome. The weird thing is, though, that without the rain we have had such a large build up of pollen everywhere and when I was sitting watching TV on Sunday night I looked up and it actually looked like it was raining custard down my window!!! Still, getting some of that washed off should be good for allergy sufferers I guess!I finally took a trip out today for non-food shopping since I had heard that the Botanic garden centre was now open. I figured that since I hadn't been spending any \"fun\" money the last six weeks I could afford to treat myself at my favourite garden centre - plus I needed more soil anyway. But oh what a treat it is to walk around that place - I just want to buy everything and even the non-garden/plant stuff is just so pretty - if a little expensive. I bought myself a few veggie seedlings which are further ahead than my own so I'm looking forward to getting those out into the garden as soon as I can. My own tomato, cucumber and courgette plants are doing well this year, probably because I've kept them inside my little greenhouses and not planted them out at the first sign of warm weather, but I added in some chili peppers, aubergines (my word for 2020) and cantaloup melon to the mix to have a shot at growing them too. I just have to remember to properly label them this year as I often have no idea what I'm actually growing by the time it's in the ground! I also made two wigwam trellises using branches that my neighbour had cut off his hazelnut tree. Once they are all bound together they seem to be fairly stable, but it remains to be seen how they hold up under pressure. I've also been following a French site called Rustica, where they give gardening tips relevant to France and our climate and every time I think \"oh I must …\" they seem to have an article pop up on just that subject. The latest one answered my question on why my lemon bush's leaves were starting to turn brown (answer: it doesn't like to be in direct sunlight when you first put it outside and - get this, a lemon bush doesn't particularly appreciate temperatures of over 10° round here so not to let it get too hot). My next foray into the world of gardening is to attempt to make nettle liquid manure which is apparently very good for a veggie garden. No wonder my neighbours just shake their heads when they see my latest experiments, what with my home-made wigwams and the vision of my backside sticking out from the hedge trying to get at the nettles they must think I'm mad. One year I actually created a vertical garden growing up my cherry tree using plastic bottles and very satisfying (and productive) it was too, but like I say, my neighbours think I'm nuts sometimes!Since I was a little disappointed in my apple cake the other day I decided to make Mary Berry's lemon drizzle cake yesterday and that was a roaring success. Absolutely delicious. It sank a bit in the middle so I think I'll use a smaller, round pan next time, but having the hole in the middle just gave me the excuse to fill it up with whipped cream and indulge. As you can probably tell, the diet's going great guns (and so easy to follow too)!And finally, I was talking to my friend the other day and he was complaining about a pain in the left side of his back, under his shoulder blade. The next day he said it was still there so I asked if it was in his arm or in his jaw as I was a little worried, having had a dad who had frequent heart attacks. He said not, but I mentioned he might want to get some aspirin in just in case (I was told to give aspirin to my dad when he had a heart attack when I was 14 and home alone with him. The ambulance came of course but that was when I learned that aspirin can help to bust small clots so I always keep some in the house just in case). Anyway, he said he thought he had just twisted his arm awkwardly and that he thought Voltaren would ease it, the problem being that he had no way of putting it on his own back. So I told him now would seem to be the perfect time to get out and meet the neighbours. \"Hallo, you must be my new neighbours. We haven't met. My name's C. Would you think I was awfully forward if I asked if you would mind just rubbing some of this on my back?\" I was only trying to help but he didn't think that was very funny for some reason. Can't think why!"},
{"title": "Day 40!", "date": "Saturday 25 April 2020", "text": "There's not much going on here at the OK Corral - like most places I guess, but I'm still doing ok, thank goodness. I couldn't sleep the other night for some reason so got back up again around 12.30 to finish reading a book that had been recommended by a friend. It was called I Know Who You Are and was pretty good, with lots of twists and turns, an easy read, but quite a sting in the tail involving the bad guy getting killed with a pickaxe (don't want to give too much away there right)! After I'd finished it I did manage to drop off but as I'm wont to do on occasion, I had another weird dream. Apparently Prince William had just found out that Kate had been cheating on him and announced that he intended to divorce her. For some even weirder reason I was working there (????) and after a distraught Kate stormed off I went into the study and found an ax (she obviously intended to murder him with it) so the only way I could prevent that was to hide the ax behind the fax machine. I know, I know, I get it's weird to be dreaming about Wills and Kate. The bit about the ax you can probably see where I got that from, but a fax machine????? They went out with wind-up telephones. I used to tell my colleague about my weird dreams and he would \"psychoanalyse\" me until we roared laughing, but this one really got me stumped - a fax machine? How long ago did they fall off the face of the earth!At the beginning of the week I had a phone call from the young men who I signed with to get my roof renovated - Technitoit - and they asked if they could come over to finalize some papers and talk about the insulation project that I had also asked them to look into. When they arrived we sat out in the back garden and they commented how lovely my garden is. Not my unmown grass bit, but the beautiful view I guess, so I said I thought there would be a lot of lovely gardens this year, what with people having more time because of the lockdown. They were telling me though that having been off one month it was starting to hurt financially. In fact the one guy was very open and said that he had only picked up €1,000 last month in unemployment and with €800 of basic monthly bills it really hurt so they were more than glad to get back to work. Another thing they mentioned was that quite a few of their clients had had to cancel because many were frontaliers working in Switzerland and when the Swiss started cutting back on staff it was obviously the frontaliers who were the first to be let go! I hadn't thought of it that way and it really brought home to me what a precarious situation so many were now in. Anyway, they were up on my roof taking pictures and, not surprisingly, my insulation is shot to pieces. Well it's 40 years old so probably about as effective as a paper hankie at this point, so I signed up to get it all done - the cleaning and sealing probably starting next week and then 27 cm of new insulation all over, probably in October. It's a lot of money but becoming a necessity. So I was thinking, what with the floor, heating and water heater all done, the roof in the pipelines, as soon as I get the bathrooms done I think I'm good to go. Hopefully the rest will just be cosmetic, as and when. My neighbour did mention that they were having AC put in a couple of rooms as the summers are becoming unbearable here, so I may think about that too. I'll wait to speak to the guy that does theirs before I tackle that one, although I suspect in any case it's already too late for this year!In other news I continue to potter around getting things done here as the weather is still lovely. The really weird thing, though, is that I am consistently getting over 10,000 steps a day despite the fact that I never go out walking! I'm making a conscious effort to sort the basement and in and out the garden all the time but I was really surprised at how much I'm now moving as compared to previously. Long may it last, but I suspect it will slow down when the really hot weather gets here as I hate it!I ended up with both neighbours having a coffee in my back yard again today, which is nice as it gives us a chance to have a chat and them a chance to speak to someone other than their husbands. I was saying to D how much I loved the poppies in her garden and she offered me a root, which I gladly accepted. So then she goes on to say that she offered a root to her other neighbours, the M family, and he refused \"because they make opium out of poppies\"!! Say what! Now the M family are Jehovah's Witnesses, and while I am not the slightest bit interested in their religion they are very, very nice people. In fact it's their arthritic old dog that dodders down to my back garden for a crap most days but I don't say anything - just shit shovel - because, as I say, they are elderly (80 and 86) and they have been good to me. But even I was surprised at his response to the offer of a poppy root. I think my mouth must have dropped open because D then went on to say that years ago their 14 year old son had been killed when he climbed on a bunch of pallets, which then collapsed and crushed him (this I already knew). But when they got to the hospital the mother ran in and said \"no transfusions\" and the doctors, apparently, couldn't hide their disgust. Their son was dead on arrival sadly but to rush in to an emergency room and insist on that is more than I could do, religion or no religion. Each to his own I know, but nope, I'd be lining up with my sleeve rolled up!I also finally managed to get my \"pixie door\" put up today. I screwed that thing into my plum tree and while it might just kill it, I think it looks rather pretty!In other news I see that the UK has started clinical trials of a potential vaccine on healthy adults this week. Fingers crossed. And Captain Tom, whose 100th birthday is on 30 April, has apparently received over 40,000 birthday cards already, so much so that the Royal Mail is having to set up a special room just to cope with it.John over at Going Gently posted a picture of beautiful Conwy castle all lit up the other day and I wanted to repost it here as I have such fond memories of the place. My brother lived about half a mile behind the castle (on Castle View Estate) and my aunt lived about 300 metres down the road, on Castle Street (they're not very imaginative with street names as you can tell). I have such lovely memories of the place where I spent so many summers that I just wanted to have a keepsake here on this blog.Diolch - thank you!I think everything that can be said has been said about the Donald's suggestion to think about taking bleach internally hasn't it, but the one positive side effect seems to have been that his self-aggrandizing daily briefings have now been cut short and he's taking no questions from reporters, so that's a plus. I'm just wondering how long it will be before they announce that some idiot gave it a try though as, sadly, while that seems so unthinkable I honestly believe someone will do it!And finally, Kylie over at Eclectica had been asked by another blogger about \"weird\" things in your house that you don't even notice. Well I no longer have it in my house but when I was married I used to like to read in bed. My bedside lamp was fine but the one on my husband's side was way too bright, so one night I asked him if he could do something about it - thinking maybe he'd change the light bulb. But nooooo his solution (always the path of least resistance) was to take a pair of underpants out of his drawer and pull them down over the lamp shade. That bloody thing looked like a white faced alien for so long, the \"eyes\" being where the leg holes were. To be honest I was so beaten down that his bedside lamp/underpants were the last thing on my mind and I never noticed them. But about a year after he had moved out (taking the bed with him - I guess the girlfriend liked it), I was going to get the floor redone before buying a new bedroom suite. Well my neighbour came round to help me take the carpet up and said \"Anna, don't you think it's time for the underpants to go?\" and then we just roared laughing. It's kinda embarrassing to have your neighbour draw it to your attention though isn't it!"},
{"title": "Ha ha!", "date": "Thursday 23 April 2020", "text": "I mentioned in my previous post that I was watching Philadelphia Story and really enjoying it, so Dave asked me which version - the Katherine Hepburn version or the Grace Kelly version - both were funny! I thought \"damn, they must have really rewritten that thing to put Tom Hanks in the leading rôle and turn it into such a tearjerker\"! Don't get old, as they say!The last couple of days have been slightly more productive for me, as I was just getting tired of all the things I could/should do and not doing them. But I was thinking about it today and maybe there's nothing wrong if this becomes my new normal. For the most part I don't have to dance to anyone else's tune any more and while I enjoy my courses BC (before coronavirus) I'm doing just fine without them, too. In the six weeks we've been in lockdown I haven't gone out walking even once, only because I can't be arsed to figure out an exact one kilometre circuit near my house (there probably isn't one) and I was afraid of getting a fine 1,100 metres from my front door from some jobsworth having a bad day. So the highlight of my week every week has been grocery shopping - well that and taking the bin out twice! I went shopping on Thursday and was stopped for the first time by the police asking for my attestation and they were very polite, so maybe my \"jobsworth\" comment is unfair! There were no lines at the supermarket and while the shelves were only about three-quarters full I got everything I wanted. The good news, apparently, is that La Roche's outdoor market is going to slowly start up again, with maybe five or six stands being allowed to set-up out of the usual 40 or so, although how they figure out which stallholders are allowed to sell and when I have no idea!In other news, I saw on British TV the other day an interview with an American team in New York which had produced one of two studies on the death rates for CO19. It's early days yet of course but they had looked at statistics for over 5,000 deaths in hospital and studied the aggravating factors. I'm not phrasing this very well but basically both studies were coming to the conclusion that age and obesity seemed to be the two most aggravating factors linked to death. Now I would have thought compromised lung function, heart problems etc. were bigger issues than obesity but while they were indeed factors, obesity seemed to be a bigger factor! Then they interviewed a British researcher doing the same kind of study in London and he confirmed that their findings, so far, were agreeing with the statistics coming out of the UK! Wow!A few years ago I started having an annual check-up with a dermatologist due to a \"weird thingy\" on my leg when I came back from St. Lucia. It turned out to be nothing but he did remove a couple of other \"weird thingies\" as they were suspicious and advised me to get checked out every year because of my pale skin. Well Dr. Twinkly Eyes went into semi-retirement, giving up his surgery and moving to a large clinic in Geneva on a part-time basis. I was looking to book an appointment with him recently, but obviously that wasn't possible - until yesterday when I got an email from the clinic to say that as from Monday the clinic would be open for business, \"including for cosmetic procedures\"! I was stunned. I knew they did cosmetic surgery but I was stunned that they would be opening up for such selective procedures at this time! When I mentioned this to my friend he said he agreed but people/businesses were in dire straits and people didn't know how best to handle it. I'll be darned if I know the answer, but given the two studies mentioned above I wonder how much a bit of liposuction would cost?Anyway, back to lesser things, today has been really productive because I decided I wanted to knock a few things off my to do list. I spent over an hour getting online bills paid and sorting out paperwork etc. Then I received a posting from Un Jardin au Paradis (A Garden in Paradise), which is an organic farm near here where I wanted to do a one-day course on sustainable agriculture (which I will definitely book as soon as I can). Anyway, they sent me an article on \"cardboard potato growing\" and I was intrigued. Now I know you can plonk cardboard down over grass/weeds and a few weeks later, hey presto, half the grass/weeds are gone. The way they grow potatoes, you plonk down the cardboard (on top of my grass in my case), layer it up with grass clippings, cut an \"X\" into the cardboard, poke your sprouting potatoes through it, re-cover with more clippings and wait for a miracle. So I did it - well my form of it. I have to admit I'm pretty slapdash so I will be quite surprised if it works for me (remember my home-made kombucha experiment), but we can only try these things right!All the above pictures by Un Jardin au ParadisAfter that I did some more gardening, took a shower and decided I needed give myself a second \"lockdown haircut\". At this point I'm working on top of my previous lockdown haircut, so while I tried to make it as even as I could on both sides, I have no idea what it looks like at the back. Then again, I don't really care what impression I make on people as I'm leaving anyway!Then I decided I wanted to try a new recipe so as I had a few apples hanging around I made The Hairy Bikers Spiced Apple Cake. Now I'm very picky about cakes and while it was ok I wouldn't rave about it. Just as I was pulling it out of the oven my other neighbours walked over with a jar of homemade orange jam, and then my favourite neighbours wandered over so we all had a distanced coffee and a good chat. Both the ladies were saying that they were having a tough time, with Mrs. S saying that she thought she was heading into a depression, and my favourite neighbour saying that she had spoken to her mom and then spent the afternoon crying! Crikey, they are both lovely ladies and I felt so bad for them but what can you do in a situation like that except be there to listen? Anyway, after they left I had time to make a couple more masks while the cake was cooling and then took cake over to Mrs. S and to the other neighbours. Her husband was in the garden and when I saw that she wasn't in the kitchen I just left it on her table. Well about 30 minutes later I was in the garden reading when all of a sudden I heard her in the garden saying \"oh my God, I think I'm going to be sick\"!!! Say what???? About 10 minutes later she came over to thank me for the cake so I told her to just throw it if she hated it. She said \"no, I came over to get the recipe\", and when I explained to her that I thought I had almost poisoned her she burst out laughing and said she was reading an absolutely gripping, but horrifying book on WWI and that was what made her feel sick. So I guess I cheered her up at least!Right now I'm actually watching Philadelphia Story for the first time, can you believe, and am loving it, but I couldn't close without saying that today is St. George's Day. In 1350 he was chosen by King Edward III to be the Patron Saint of England because \"he was admired for his bravery in the face of terrible suffering\". So while I guess he may not have actually slayed a dragon planet earth could sure use some help right now if he's listening!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 21 April 2020", "text": "I had another couple of \"down\" days this weekend. No enthusiasm or energy for anything. Feeling sorry for myself I guess when I have absolutely no right to. Still I now just accept these moments for what they are and decide that if I want to do nothing but read for an entire weekend then that's just fine isn't it. Right now on TV I'm watching A Very British Lockdown and am really enjoying it. Just showing ordinary people and how they are coping with it. One lady has cystic fibrosis so her husband is living outside in their caravan for 12 weeks. Another woman is trying to work from home with two very young children and ready to pull her hair out. Another couple run a small grocery store opposite a huge, but closed campsite their business absolutely depends on for its lifeline. They're arguing a lot of course, but then I suppose that's no surprise. In fact my neighbour was whispering to me in the garden this weekend that her husband is driving her nuts (but then, when doesn't he?). She was on skype to her mom on the west coast of France when her husband walked in from the garden dragging mud all over her newly-washed floor. When she asked him if it was too much effort to kick his shoes off outside he took them off and threw them at her - and all witnessed by her mom and the care home assistant! So maybe it's not so bad being on my own after all! I called my friend too today and he was out for a walk as he was going stir crazy. When I said if we had thought he could have come over to my place he just said we'd be at each other's throats. Not true, I probably would have knifed him already (but at least we can laugh about it)!What else is new? Oh, in what is obviously a huge disappointment in France, the Tour de France has now been postponed to September. They had been scheduled to spend the night in La Roche on 17 July. Well now that's pushed back to 17 September, assuming France has opened up by then! And in totally unrelated news, what about Trump suspending the US contribution to WHO during a pandemic!!!! That just blows my mind, it's so unbelievable. Every time I keep thinking he can't do anything more outrageous he \"excels\" himself!! Or how about Bishop Gerald Glen of Virginia who refused to stop holding church services because \"God is larger than the virus\"! Well guess who just died of it (and I wonder how many more of his congregation are now sick)!In a totally other world, I had a \"zoom\" appointment with my tax guy today to get my 2019 taxes sorted. This was the guy who told me that the other \"expert\" that I had consulted last year about taxes on my lump sum basically didn't know his arse from a hole in the ground, although he was somewhat more diplomatic than that of course. The first guy told me that apart from the tax on my pension, I would pay an additional €21,000-ish in a tax called CGI. So my second guy said that was BS since (a) my pension is not derived from France and (b) I'm not entitled to sécurité sociale, which is basically French medical coverage and unemployment, so the CGI tax is not payable!!!! Phew, that took my tax down on just the lump sum from €21,000 to €9,100 - I'll take that any day. And while it obviously still has an ouch factor, I'd put the money away anyway so it is there just waiting to be paid out. On a personal note, I have thought more than once that if I was still married my husband would have found a way to spend that money, that's an absolute certainty!And I suppose any Brits out there have seen the story of Captain Tom right? The 99 year old WWII veteran who volunteered to attempt 100 circuits of his garden (with his walker) to try to raise £1,000 for the NHS. Well he reached his target and just decided to keep going, and as it stands right now he has so far raised £27 million (and still climbing) and was invited to open the newly-built NHS Nightingale Hospital in Harrogate (from the safety of his own home of course). Well done Captain Tom - I think a knighthood should be in the offing there don't you! The wonderful thing about the NHS is that not one single patient will walk out of any hospital with a bill (so Mr. Trump can shove that where the sun don't shine next time he says the NHS will be on the table in any Anglo-American trade deal). After all that's going on right now any government who even thought of selling out the NHS would be committing political hari kari!Captain Tom - a real hero!And finally, I saw the firemen from La Roche decided to pay their own tribute to our local hospital, the CHAL. I thought the sign at the end just said it all!"},
{"title": "Consequences!", "date": "Tuesday 14 April 2020", "text": "The other night I decided it was probably about time to turn my heating off. We've been having lovely weather and the heating kicking in first thing in the morning and last thing at night was becoming uncomfortable, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and get the instruction manual out for my new, state-of-the art heating system which was installed just last September. Crikey, that stuff is complicated - which only makes me take my hat off to my youngest son for being able to install and programme the bloody things! It took me a while because the computerized panel kept indicating that the heating was still working, even though I thought I'd turned it off. What was actually happening was the computer thingy showed that yes, it was indeed turned off, but it was still programmed to kick in in the event of the temperature dropping below freezing. I think my fear was trying to make sure it was still programmed to heat my water, so I kept switching from one programme to the other and getting totally confused. I'm pretty sure I've got it figured now though. Max had asked me to let him know what the fuel consumption was like since he had also switched my electric water heater over to the new fuel system. Well I'm pleased to say that it looks like I'm using the same, or maybe even a little less fuel than before, all while additionally heating my water with it rather than by electricity. So I guess Max was right then (he should be, he installed it). My fuel consumption is staying the same and my electricity bill should be all the way down since I am no longer heating 300 litres of water from 11 pm to 6 am. I'll take that!I spent quite a few hours today potting up seeds and dragging my temporary greenhouses up from the basement to my back terrace. A couple of years ago I had placed the greenhouses along the side of my house in a lovely sunny spot, but what I hadn't thought of was when it's windy the wind howls round that corner and after finding my blossoming greenhouses thrown all over my driveway by the wind one time I kinda gave up after that. But this year I'm going to give them another try on my more sheltered back terrace. I didn't put any of my seedlings in there though as I still feel it might be a bit cold in the mornings for them, so they're still spending their nights in my living room for the time being. Between that and my sewing projects, plus all my books in my TV room I did think I might be starting to look like a hoarder at the moment, but hopefully the seedlings will go outside soon, I'm going to put away a bunch of fabric tomorrow and my books … well what can I say? They're not going anywhere in all honesty! Oh well, thankfully I live alone!In the spirit of keeping in touch with friends I called an old neighbour up tonight from when we moved back to Switzerland from the States in 1989 and had a good long chat with her. She is Colombian and our kids were both two when we moved in, so we ended up just leaving our front doors open and letting the kids run back and forward between the houses to play together (and eat together pretty often). Like me she is divorced and now retired, and while I don't get to see her very often (she doesn't drive and it's a long drive for me) it was lovely to have a good long catch-up. She was saying that her little grandson tries to \"cook\" for her when she looks after him, and she laughed when I told her that when I was young - too young to get a Saturday job at least - I used to have my mom's lunch ready for her when she got home from work on a Saturday. I would guess that for 50 out of 52 weeks of the first year that I did that my poor old mom got my home-made cheese soufflé and salad, because that was the only thing I could make! The soufflé was pretty good even at that young age, but she must have got pretty fed up of it after a while!And did anyone see Trump's meltdown at his last press briefing! Good Lord, it's not going to end well. I sat through the \"video of justification of just how wonderful he is\", with clips of different people saying how he'd \"got everything right\" about this pandemic, but when one of the reporters asked what he was doing about the pandemic during the month of February, which had been conveniently missed out of the video clip, he pretty much lost it. I mean, from standing over to the side all puffed up like a turkey cock during the video, to throwing all his toys out the pram when the reporter kept repeating her question it was actually embarrassing. As the figures can only get worse in the States before they get better I can see a full-blown public meltdown on the horizon. If it wasn't so serious it would be funny, but sadly it is so serious!And talking of \"consequences\", I just read today that the Dutch threw away 140 million tulips this past month (their biggest earner) since they were not able to sell them during the pandemic. Damn! Something like €25 million worth! How sad, and just another indication of the dire economic consequences of this lockdown!Again talking about consequences, I read in the local Geneva newspaper this morning that since the beginning of lockdown the French have refused re-entry into our region for 3,400 false frontaliers. A frontalier is someone who lives in France and crosses the border every day to Switzerland for work. The cost of renting or buying property in Geneva is horrendous. For instance my son and his wife pay SF 2,000 ($2,000) to rent a one-bedroomed apartment. My neighbours' son and his wife pay SF 3,000 to rent a two-bedroomed apartment, and to buy a small house you're looking at about a million. So many Swiss buy \"secondary residences\" in France and actually live in them full-time, while declaring an address in Switzerland as their permanent address. Of course since they \"live in Switzerland\" they have Swiss licence plates, so the French have been turning them back at the border in the evenings because the borders are closed to all non-residents. Practically speaking, taxes are lower in Switzerland, VAT is lower and inheritance taxes are much, much lower, hence these people don't want to \"officially\" live in France. So now, those that can't go home to their \"secondary residences\" in France after work in the evenings are stuck! So far they've had 50 requests to \"regularize\" their situation but, off the top of my head, that will involve paying around 12% import duty/VAT on their cars in order to import them into France, since the duty in Switzerland is 8% as compared to 20% in France, plus around triple that amount in fines. I don't know what the price of some fancy Mercedes or Audi is but I imagine that will sting. Then of course, if any of them inherited property in Switzerland the French would be looking to come after them for inheritance tax, and there would probably be a hefty fine from the tax man too. Part of the tax that is paid in Switzerland by French residents is passed back to the commune where that person resides to pay for schools and so on, so these people claiming to be non-residents have been getting away with murder for ages. Now the \"haters\" in Geneva (not all by any means) complain that the French come over the border and \"steal our jobs\" and the \"haters\" in France rant about the Swiss doing all this complaining while doing their grocery shopping in France and buying up the real estate, thereby pushing the prices up, so it's either a win-win or a lose-lose situation, depending which way you look at it. I know I would never have tried to get away with something like that because apart from the fact that it's just wrong, I even got antsy the very few times I belted up the bus lane because I was late for work. Either way, I suspect a few people have some stinking non-pandemic-induced headaches right now!"},
{"title": "Half way there?", "date": "Monday 13 April 2020", "text": "Well President Macron addressed the nation tonight to let people know the \"state of play\", or what is and isn't happening regarding the coronavirus situation in France. For starters, what isn't happening is any relaxation of the lockdown. In fact, he more or less said \"forget about it until 11 May and we'll talk again then\", although I may be paraphrasing somewhat! So while there has been a slight easing in that some garden centres and one DIY place (that I know of) are opening for kerbside pick-up, nothing will change for me at least until 11 May. On that date, all being well, younger children will be going back to school/nursery, although older students facing exams won't be going back until later. He then said that it is now \"our turn to help\" nations just starting out on this journey, specifically mentioning that France would be doing its best to help African nations and forgiveness of their debt as a way to help. I'm not sure what he means by that exactly but I suspect my taxes are going to be going up either way. Not that I'm complaining, but I reckon higher taxes will be on the horizon for all of us when this is over! He also said that \"European borders\" would remain closed until further notice. Now whether he meant intra-EU, or including extra-EU I have no idea, but at this point it's a moot point as I'm stuck within 1 km of my home anyway. And now that makes Italy seem so close - and yet so far! It's an odd thing though to see the way that the French President speaks during these TV addresses, ending with vive la France and all that, while the Brits' nightly addresses usually end with a kinda cheerio now or toodle pip! Vive la différence, I guess!And talking of Italy, I only caught the tail end of Andrea Bocelli's solo performance last night at Milan's Il Duomo cathedral but it was just haunting. I'm a big fan of Andrea anyway, and his performance last night just seemed all the more poignant somehow in these difficult times!Andrea Bocelli in front of Il DuomoOther than that I think I'm getting the hang of this doing nothing business. Seriously, I have lots to do but I'm realizing that it's all right to work a bit, sit in the garden and read for an hour, work a bit more, read some more. Stuff is getting done but I'm finally learning to switch from permanent fifth gear to something approaching second/third gear, and I think this lockdown may well have something to do with it! As an aside, while this pandemic is awful I hope some good will come out of it - like people learning to slow down and realizing what is really important. Well that and, as I was saying to my friend today, maybe this enforced kindness to our environment could give us a kick-start into really doing something about climate change and pollution once this is all over, rather than just paying lip service to saving our planet!I've also been taking the time to catch up with friends, so yesterday I chatted for ninety minutes with an American former neighbour of mine, now living in Ireland, and had a great time catching up with all her news - all the more so as I get the feeling that she managed to get a lot off her chest during that chat. I hope so at least. Her son had planned his wedding in Spain in June and I had been invited. When I told her I didn't know what to do as I wasn't sure what the travel situation would be at that time, she said not to worry as it turns out that since so many people will be having problems (the bride is from the Czech Republic), her son and his gf have postponed their wedding until July 2021! Shame isn't it, but there doesn't seem to be an alternative right now. Then today, in addition to chatting with Jordan and Jen and my friend, I also called my long-time friend - you know, the one I had shared an apartment with when I first arrived in Geneva. Well she was out on her daily walk so we didn't get to chat for too long, but she was saying that, like me, she's strangely ok with this lockdown for the most part, with just the occasional wobble. I asked her if she thought we were weird because neither of us were having too much difficulty coping with the present situation, but she just laughed and said nah, we're just self-contained. And maybe she's right, I really am handling this solitude pretty well, although I suppose the next four weeks could really test that \"self-reliance\" I guess!Other than that, I realized that Saturday was the 18th birthday of Alexandre, the son of our neighbours who always join in with our board game evenings. Poor bugger, not able to have a party with his mates. Well I didn't have a card of course, so I made my own and took it over there and he was tickled pink!I call him \"The Emperor\" because he always beats me at our quiz games!Then tonight I had a phone call from my gardener asking if he could come over tomorrow. I was surprised as I had assumed he wasn't allowed to be out working, but I explained that although I had cut my grass myself on Saturday he was welcome to start up again in a couple of weeks' time (phew, that's one man I'm glad to keep in employment)!And can you believe it's almost a year since the bombings in Sri Lanka? What with all the coronavirus news the bombings weren't mentioned on Easter Sunday, although I'm assuming there will be some mention of it on 21st April, the actual one-year anniversary. It seems unreal and so long ago to me now!Anyway, to wrap this up, with another month of lockdown I wonder what the chances are of my starting (and sticking to) an exercise routine and losing some weight during the four week period between now and 11 May? Not high I guess, based on previous experience, but it could be an interesting starting point I suppose. Then again, if I can't get to the hairdresser for another month and have to keep resorting to the \"home cut\", I might need to lose weight in order to take people's attention away from my dreadful haircut!Don't leave your Easter bunny out in the sun if you don't want to make him cross!"},
{"title": "Catching up with friends!", "date": "Saturday 11 April 2020", "text": "Pre-pandemic, a group of us former colleagues used to get together on a Wednesday evening opposite work for a drink. Maybe six or seven of us if we were all there. Anyway last Wednesday P set up a zoom meeting for a virtual drink and chinwag and it was nice to chat with everyone again after so long and catch up. One friend's daughter had her second baby a week ago in California and her mom would have been out there with her to help out if circumstances had permitted. Another's daughter is working as a doctor in London during the pandemic, while another's daughter is teaching young children in Kenya - remotely at the moment I would imagine. My son helped organize a meeting with 700 participants all done through zoom - quite the achievement when you consider these people would normally be flying in to Geneva from all over the world. I found out that at last count there were 50 cases of infection at work, I believe, although thankfully none serious as yet. It's a strange old world we live in isn't it, when some are doing so much and then others (the likes of me) have to sit and wait it out, just pottering and trying to keep busy/sane!A totally non-stressed cat in my neighbours' driveway!And then you've got the cases of people dying who \"shouldn't\" be dying - young, apparently healthy people, and older people who supposedly have no resistance making it out the other side, like the 99 year old WWII veteran in the UK this week. He will be 100 in July and I hope they have a huge party for him to celebrate. The gent below is 92 (I think) but isn't it gratifying to see the doctors and nurses celebrating their every victory.I went to my regular store for shopping this week as I can't get everything I need in the \"Fresh\" store. People were very restrained, some wearing masks and others not, but at least the store provided disinfectant for you to wipe your cart down at the entrance, although I'd already done mine in the parking lot. There was the guy I now recognize as \"prowler\", who wanders up and down the aisles at speed, going completely against the normal flow of traffic and constantly yelling into his phone - unless he is actually remote controlled and that's the only way his wife can get her shopping done. I had to laugh though as I did see a couple of people wearing coffee filter masks, but hey, why not! Then there was the cop that my kids always used to call Robocop out and about in town trying for all the world to look like Schwarzenegger. I always thought he was a bit weird, all muscles, crew cut and swagger - and then my kids told me he is actually a municipal cop who only directs traffic and is, I suppose, now on the prowl to hand out fines for people without the appropriate paperwork. I don't know how they know him (do I wanna know?) but they don't like him, which is weird because they apparently also know his wife and said she's as nice as he is unpleasant!They actually had disposable plastic gloves at the store but when I saw that they were asking €10.50 for a box of 100 I put them back, because I was pretty sure I had a box at home, if I could just find them. Well anyway I did find them, and while my packet is probably a couple of years old they actually cost 1.30 Swiss francs for 100!!!! Can you believe that! The dollar, the Swiss franc and the euro are all pretty much on par at the moment and the store wanted over €10 for the same thing I bought not so very long ago for SF 1.30!!!!In other news, I'm still keeping track of my walking although with the lockdown it's no longer \"boots on\" (intentional walking) but just keeping track of my daily steps with my pedometre. In a fit of pique I decided to cut the grass again today, but without bagging it this time as it just gets too heavy. In any case I have nowhere to dump the grass with the tip being closed right now, but not bagging made it so much easier. Anyway I actually clocked up six miles today just \"puttering\", so I'm quite pleased with that, and it takes my yearly total up to 340 miles so far. When I decided to take my rubbish up to the collective bins a bit later, a distance of about 100 metres, it ended up taking me about 30 minutes as I got stopped by three different sets of neighbours for a chat! I was asking one neighbour how her husband was finding it working from home (I used to see him regularly on my commute) and I was a bit surprised when she said how much he hated it! She said he was so used to being on the move and always got a lot of exercise in in his down time that he was now climbing the walls! Add to that, she, like me, believes that when this lockdown is eased a little we will still have to wear masks if we leave our homes and she was complaining that she couldn't find them anywhere. When I told her I'd been making a few and would gladly make washable masks for her and her family you'd have thought I'd just given her a winning lottery ticket! I reckon I'll have them done by tomorrow, although my first attempt today was my usual botch job somehow (cut it out wrong again) so I'm now looking for a kid with a pin-sized head and huge ears to palm it off on!A couple of the local garden centres are being allowed to open up as of next week \"as long as they have been open throughout the lockdown by virtue of the fact that they also sell primary necessities\"! So the big store that I particularly like will be open as from Tuesday because they also have an organic shop on site. Not that I'll be able to go there though as it is not local to me and I would get clobbered if I got caught out that way. I think there is one in town that is now open because they also sell a few bottles of olive oil and honey and so on, but it seems kinda unfair to me that the one in the next village is not allowed to open because they only sell plants. I really feel for some of these people who have put so much into their businesses and now cannot sell to the public! If they're still around when this thing ends I'll make sure to support them as much as possible!Other than that there's not much new here obviously. Doing some sewing this afternoon set off my \"trigger finger\" and I ended up lopping about two inches of hair off the top of my head, but since I do that on a regular basis I'm glad to have an excuse this time. And finally last night I wasn't particularly tired so when I saw that Absolutely Fabulous - The Movie was on I thought I would stay up and watch it. Well, that's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back! Talk about a load of rubbish. But you know, I kinda like some of the stuff Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley have done in the series before. It's totally over the top but some of it tickled me. And I have to admit that however unbelievable the so-called plot was, I think I've got a bit of a girl crush on Joanna Lumley (I've always liked her anyway), particularly when she was \"disguised\" as a man in order to get the world's richest woman to marry her. She makes a fine looking man as far as I'm concerned, although would that be justification for staying up so late and watching the movie again? Nah, never in a million years!Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous!"},
{"title": "Just plodding along!", "date": "Tuesday 7 April 2020", "text": "Day 21 and things are still plodding along, as they are wont to do in lockdown I suppose. We received a notification from the retirees' association of another retiree death, but as this lady was 100 years old and one day, I doubt very much that covid19 had much to do with her passing. She was a right old tartar from what I can remember, so maybe that's how she came to last quite so long! And then I see dear Boris is now in intensive care. While I don't particularly care for the man as I feel he's basically just so much hot air, I hope he gets better quickly - and of course if he does he'll be bloody unstoppable. I must admit when they had the \"applause for the NHS\" last Thursday night he didn't look well at all so I guess things went downhill very quickly for him. But I do genuinely hope he gets through this!I see in related news that certain European countries are starting to think about relaxing the lockdown - specifically Denmark, Austria and the Czech Republic at the moment. I doubt France will be among them any time soon though as by all accounts we haven't hit the peak yet. A common feature of any relaxation of the rules seems to be compulsory wearing of a mask at all times when out in public. I was talking to my neighbour about this and she said she is panicking a little as they don't have any masks (neither do I but I'm not so worried about it). She, however, smoked for I would guess getting on for nearly 50 years (she's 67) until she gave up 15 months ago after hospitalization for severe pneumonia in January last year. Her husband still smokes and one of her grandchildren has Downs Syndrome and is medically fragile, so she was saying how they will need to be very careful when they are allowed out and about and she would need to get hold of masks pretty fast. So I went on Youtube and found what turned out to be a very simple tutorial on how to make your own masks. They recommend three thicknesses of material so I messed around with some of the fabrics that I have, including putting patchwork wadding in. The first mask I used thicker fabric throughout but it was very difficult to sew. The one with the wadding in was also a bit tough to sew, so I think I will stick with the three layers of close-weave cotton - also the easiest to sew. As I say, I have tons of fabric anyway and they were pretty easy to complete in about 15 minutes. My only problem was finding elastic for the sides but then I stumbled upon an old stash and off I went. The first three prototypes I gave to my neighbour (along with a bunch of fabric and wadding) and I've since made three more in case we do, indeed, have to wear them all the time when we are released from purgatory. I took a picture of all the different versions I'd made but when I realized they looked like a bunch of 1960s sanitary towels I thought \"nah, maybe not\"!Ready for the operating theatre!Other than that I've been pottering around getting things done and quite enjoying myself. I've taped up the walls ready for washing and painting the kitchen this week, been potting up some seeds in preparation for planting outside in May and trying to get 30 minutes yoga in every day, although I don't always succeed. My bloody 1,000 jigsaw puzzle is driving me slightly nuts though as it is slow going! Honestly, at this rate I reckon I'll be 76 and three-quarters by the time I get it completed. I also signed up as a local government volunteer and while at the moment there doesn't seem to be anything local enough for me, I'm sure something will come up.Other than that, the weather is beautiful - shorts and T-shirt weather during the day - so I make sure to spend at least an hour outside reading each day. What has struck me though is that with the relative silence that now envelops our little village I'm so much more aware of the chirping of the birds and the buzzing of the bees in this our new normal. As I was sitting on the back terrace the other night I looked up at the late afternoon sun on the mountains and managed to snap a fairly decent couple of shots of birds on the bird feeders with my phone. I was thinking the other day that yes I still have a lot of travelling left in my blood when this is all over, but until then I'm just so content to be where I am and happy with my lot!"},
{"title": "An interesting social experiment!", "date": "Sunday 5 April 2020", "text": "Lockdown day 20 looks pretty much like every other day in lockdown so far, except for the exciting bit where I get to chose the day I go grocery shopping. I like to change it up a bit so sometimes I go on a Thursday and other times on a Friday - you know, just to keep things real!! Anyway this week I went on Friday and timed it to leave home about noon because I knew there would be hardly anyone at the shops. One thing that still holds true is if you want to invade France you do it at lunchtime! And again things really aren't bad at all, I got everything I wanted and people are still very much respecting the social distancing, probably because the police are out and about and the fines will hurt! That being said, quite a few people have masks on (the store provides plastic gloves) but I don't have one - unless I can find the one I bought ages ago when I intended to paint the kitchen (before my new floor was laid - remember those lofty aims)? Failing that when I \"inherited\" all my ex-husband's stuff when I ended up emptying his rental after his move back to the States, I did find an unopened pack of Fruit of the Loom undies so I'm wondering if I can just put a pair of those over my head and brazen it out! I did think about taking a photo and sending it to my kids but then thought the better of it because with social media nowadays who knows where that photo could end up!In Sweden they have still not gone into lockdown and are relying on people's common sense (which may or may not be all that common) to do the right thing and not behave like idiots. So bars, restaurants, schools and so on are still open, with their chief epidemiologist stating that they believe relying on \"herd immunity\" is the only way to beat this thing. He then went on to criticize the UK's handling of the crisis because they \"switched tracks\" mid-way though, starting off going with the \"herd immunity\" plan and then switching to lockdown. In his opinion the UK were going to get the worst of all worlds by doing that. I think he might be right actually but either way I guess someone will be proved right and someone will come up short, but only time will tell which is which!A friend set up a zoom chat between a few of us retired colleagues on Friday and it was pretty nice, although my computer did keep freezing quite a bit. Either way it was nice to chat with them all. Then Jordan sent me a video of their cat on their lovely balcony (a godsend for them at the moment) being taunted by the birds. He told me that as from tomorrow he is on chômage technique, which is basically being laid off because of the pandemic even though they've got tons of work. They've done all the outside work they can do so they have to lay him off until lockdown is lifted. He told me he should still get 80% of his salary though, so that's a relief. I didn't say anything but in the UK people have to have been on board with the company on 28 February in order to qualify for this kind of payment and that's exactly when Jordan switched jobs. Apparently that doesn't apply in France so I'm relieved for them, although I can always help out if they are hurting. I told him now would be a good time to learn to cook but he said he and a neighbour are thinking of building a permanent BBQ in the park at the back of their house. When I queried how they were going to do this he said they can easily keep their distance and the park is actually private property belonging to their apartments so they can do this with no worries. Then I told him that it was a shame he couldn't come over here as I had a dripping shower and quite a bit of work I could give him. He told me that as a plumber, if the leak was serious and damaging structure, he was allowed to come out, but I told him I'd wait and see how it develops as I don't want to risk him getting into trouble since it's really not that serious (as yet).Other than that I'm easily keeping myself occupied (or not, depending on the mood). I started doing the wasgij puzzle and it's going to take me forever but I'm quite enjoying it. My Italian teacher sent me more homework and I could always get back to reading about the French revolution in case there is ever a chance of something moving forward on my request for French citizenship. I'm ridiculously excited to see the seedlings I planted are going rampant and am going to go repot some of them already as the weather is so glorious right now. And I'm absolutely loving the Carl Hiassen book I mentioned previously. Frankly any man who can get the phrase \"Apparently I murdered a man with a frozen lizard\" into a narrative gets my vote hands down. So with that I'll love you and leave you. Off to shower (so as not to frighten the natives) and then attack that bloody whirlygig with a pair of underpants on my head!"},
{"title": "Odds and sods!", "date": "Friday 3 April 2020", "text": "Well I guess like most people, there isn't an awful lot going on chez moi! There's only so much you can do within the confines of four walls anyway isn't there. But on day 18 of total lockdown I'm still ok. Feeling a bit sorry for myself yesterday but nah, that'll soon pass. And we are so, so lucky that the weather is beautiful. I can open all the windows and dry my washing outside, although having just pulled the whirlygig clothes dryer out and tried to get that thing sorted may just be what does me in. Those things are evil! Or maybe I really am just losing it because I can't get it sorted right now so maybe the best solution is to walk away right. I have been putting my washing out on my balcony and you get almost the same wonderful fresh air smell as being on a washing line. Then I decided to hang my bed linen over the balcony pending getting the whirlygig sorted, so it really does look a bit like a street in Naples at the moment but who cares. I was thinking the other day although I have a dryer I doubt that I use it once a year - round here people just don't use dryers. The washing gets hung on drying racks or out on the whirlygig thingy but not bunged in the dryer, and you know what, it's lovely that way. Everything just smells so fresh. Add to that the sunflower seeds I planted the other week are starting to come through and a few lettuce seeds and all almost feels good with the world!As for local news, the Swiss have clamped down their borders even more, so I couldn't go into Switzerland now even if I wanted to. My oldest has to go back in to the office as from next week but as they live in Switzerland he will have no problem. Jordan and Jen are both still working and that's a good thing I think, Jen because she's a nurse and Jordan, as a plumber can work throughout and I believe they'll be relatively safe if they follow the right protocol. Jordan told me that they are mostly just his company working on huge projects and mostly outside so fingers crossed. There's going to be a sad day of financial reckoning at some point anyway isn't there, in addition to the horrendous physical toll but hopefully that can all be dealt with appropriately at a later date!In French news I was reading the other day that so far the French have issued over 360,000 fines to people being out and about without the appropriate paperwork so at a rough estimate of €135 per fine that, hopefully, will pump almost €48 million back into the economy. As for life \"in real time\", I just went out shopping today and everything was fine. A little bit busier at the Fresh store maybe but still fine thankfully. I was looking at the UK news the other day and already there is a significant increase in incidents of domestic violence. Here in France too I imagine because the other day I received a message to say that if I needed to I could dial 114 \"under any circumstances\" and there would be a response from the gendarmerie. Sad isn't it, but I think we all knew that was coming!And I see that the NHS Nightingale hospital has just been opened in London. Built in just two weeks with four thousand critical care beds it's a great tribute to just what can be done isn't it.My nephew got in touch with me yesterday to see how I was. I image it's \"look after the old biddy\" syndrome but given that he is only six years younger than me I may be being unkind. He was saying that he was working from home and it was non-stop, and while he had tons of time available to him and loads of projects that needed doing he couldn't do any of them because the stores were shut. So I told him to put aside his socialist ideals and order stuff from Amazon (or wherever) and he admitted he hadn't actually thought of that! Hey, if I can support local businesses so much the better but if, in the meantime, I need to use Amazon I don't have a problem with that - it surely keeps someone in a job, however crappy that job might be.And talking of Amazon I decided to give my (former) mother-in-law a call the other night to see how she was doing. She's 84 and not in the best of health so you can imagine how the conversation went but while we've had our moments I've always been very fond of my MIL (and pap too, although he died nine years ago). She was telling me how wonderful it was to see Jordan again after nine years, and to meet his wife \"in the flesh\", and while they couldn't always communicate directly it was lovely. Jordan told me she kept saying \"I love ya honey\" over and over again, and that makes it all worthwhile doesn't it. Then she mentioned that did I remember McLaren farm, just up over the ridge from her (no, not really) but apparently it had been bought out by Amazon and they were going to build a huge warehouse up there (right near Pittsburgh airport) and were taking out the forests in the meantime. And then a neighbour had wandered over to her place and said that he had seen a bear down at the bottom of her property, and a couple of days later two other bears running across the road, no doubt displaced by the tree-felling to build the new warehouse. So \"can you imagine, he's seen three bears in two days\". When I asked her if any of them had a bowl of porridge in their paws she just cracked up laughing. We always did get along and I ended up with a 90 minute phone call which was well worth it for her to get (I think) a lot of things off her chest and a good laugh to boot! She had told me that she was pretty bored as she couldn't go out so I went on Amazon and ordered her a copy of a book I had heard was pretty good (although I haven't read it myself yet, even though I have it) and a jigsaw puzzle also. Just anything to kill time I guess. In other news I got my grass cut the other day. Took me an hour to get the bloody lawnmower started and just 45 minutes for me to fly across that thing and do the deed. But at least now I know why I don't want to do it myself anymore. I don't have a lot of land but the land that I have isn't flat and if I can pay someone to do that crap then so be it. And then when I saw on the British news that the wild goats up on the Orme in north Wales had started coming down into Llandudno and eating away at people's private gardens it just tickled me. We didn't get to go up the Great Orme when I was home for my brother's funeral but I will definitely get to it at some time.Then yesterday I received a notification from FB regarding a request for people to volunteer to sew scrubs for the local hospital so I forwarded that to my sewing club and hopefully we'll be churning those out soon enough.But finally, did anyone see the latest press conference from the White House. The Kushner BS??? Seriously??? I actually can't bear to listen to any of the tangerine buffoon's speeches any more but then to have him delegate contractual purchasing of masks and other protective equipment to Jared??? But the worst part was Jared then gave a speech (as much as I could bear to listen to it) and vomited out words to the effect that \"people need to think, when they are electing their mayors, governors, president, etc. who will be the best person to deal with this in the event of a crisis\"! Damn, since when did Kushner do stand up comedy?"},

I just remembered I had a pretty mangy bag of carrots in the garage and then spotted the donkeys in the field at the back of my house.

Add to that the sunflower seeds I potted up in my living room just last week are already starting to sprout and I'm ridiculously happy. I guess I'm back to being easily pleased again.

{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 29 March 2020", "text": "So here we are again, another day older, another day wiser? Maybe, maybe not! As you might imagine, life around here isn't exactly bursting with excitement at the moment, but that doesn't really matter any more does it!So what is new right now, if anything? Oh, on Sky News last night they showed a report on another upsetting aspect of the pandemic in Italy - as if they haven't got enough to deal with already. The northern part of Italy is the richer, more developed part of the country, while the south and Sicily depend more on agriculture and tourism. While the south doesn't (yet?) have the pandemic-level number of coronavirus cases it is being absolutely hammered by the economic consequences of shutting the country down. As the money is drying up and people's savings, if they have any, are also disappearing, they are now finding it more difficult to buy food and, in some cases, taking the law into their own hands! And to be honest, you wouldn't want to be in Sicily when people take the law into their own hands would you. One clip from the report showed a man trying to kick his way through a LIDL entrance so that they could get their hands on some food, while his mother was standing in the background begging the police officer to show some compassion. Now in this particular case the family were all living off the mother's small pension, but at that moment the bank was closed and they couldn't get their hands on any money to buy food. What a nightmare! In other instances, however, the reporter was explaining that although the government had set in motion \"bail-out\" cheques to help these people, many would not be eligible to receive this money since the south tended to \"operate on a cash economy\", and they were not, therefore, registered. I think we all know what that means don't we. But oh my goodness it struck a raw nerve in me seeing this because it does make you think (well me at least) \"there but for the grace of God go I\". And I know, I know, people all over the world go hungry and die every day but I think it takes something much closer to home to make it real somehow. I have a few smaller charities that I donate to every month and I also collect food for the food bank in town but at the moment, while I have a crate of food ready to go, I'm not sure about being allowed out to deliver it. They are only open on Tuesday evenings anyway so I'll have to try to get hold of them some how (so far unsuccessfully) to see if I can get down there and back without being hammered with a €135 fine for breaking curfew - money that could be much better spent on buying food don't you think!In other news we put the clocks forward today so that was probably the only exciting event in my life this weekend - well that and moving my car over in my driveway by about 10 feet because (a) it needs to run occasionally and (b) I find the brakes seem to stick if I don't use it very often. Oh the excitement! And I saw on my 2020 calendar from the fire station that today is St. Gwladys' day. My mom's name was Gwladys and I've never seen it spelled like that outside of Wales, so maybe it is a Breton spelling too. But I guess that's just more trivia that serves no real purpose in my new daily normal!Since I wrote yesterday about using technology to keep in touch, earlier this week I saw a clip of a group of workers in the US working from home who had set up a video-conferencing meeting. Unfortunately, one of the ladies must have forgotten it was a video-conference (I think the word \"video\" in \"video-conferencing\" was a bit of a giveaway though don't you) and she took herself off to the loo for a pee - while her horrified co-workers looked on in utter mortification. Way to go Jennifer!And finally, again talking about \"technology\" issues, did anyone else see the video of the Italian priest who was trying to live-stream mass but accidentally turned the special effects on? Oh the poor sod - but what a hoot! Now that's how to make church interesting again I reckon!"},
{"title": "Pity party over!", "date": "Saturday 28 March 2020", "text": "Well I got over myself pretty quickly last night. I knew I would anyway, but I guess I was just a bit surprised at how the news of the extended lockdown hit me. It was a pretty stupid reaction in any case because we were definitely expecting it and it's the right thing to do anyway! I suppose it was more a result of not actually speaking to anyone all day to be honest, and while mostly I'm fine with that sometimes it can be hard. Then again, as I've been sitting here reading today I've heard the neighbours having a couple of right ding-dongs so I guess we all have our crosses to bear don't we!Anyway, this morning I sent a message to my friend asking how he was as I could tell he'd had a bellyful yesterday too. Instead of just text messaging him though I decided to video-call him on WhatsApp - only for him to answer me from the bath! Ha, I should have remembered! When he gets up he spends a good 45 minutes in the bath reading and while I figured it was late enough that he would be \"decent\" I obviously timed that a bit off. Oh well, no worries, he wasn't the slightest bit bothered by it and I wasn't either so we had a nice chat, which I think did us both good in the end. After about 10 minutes he said he had to go because he was running out of battery and bugger me if he didn't get up to get out of the bath just as his battery ran out. Teasing again!After that I sent a message to my oldest son to see how they were doing. It's one week today since they got back from Thailand so I figured if they had been in contact with the virus in Thailand or on the return flight they would probably be showing symptoms by now, but he said they were both fine. They're working from home at the moment and André has another week of that but after that he has to go in to the office to work as he is on a list of \"essential staff\" (I guess there's a roster), ironically working at WHO. Still, with Geneva being as quiet as it is at the moment it shouldn't be too hard on him going into the office.So all in all today was a much better day. I got some cleaning and gardening done and paid a few bills before sitting outside in the garden for an hour to just read and take in the sun's rays. It's an odd thing though as about this time every year my top bedroom seems to get an infestation of ladybirds. For a period of about three weeks, every time I go up there there are maybe 10 dead ladybirds on the floor. I guess there's something up in the roof, but I'm hoping when I get my roof done that will be taken care of too. I also found a bunch of old magazines, and the one below, in particular, has really whetted my appetite to get back out walking when this bloody pandemic is finally over, as it shows all different hikes in my local area (and even has proper maps inside)! I can't wait!And talking of staying in touch during the pandemic, Marksgran mentioned how she was going to try to teach her mom how to use an iPhone so that they could stay in touch! Good luck with that. I know I could never have gotten my parents to use one of those things. Heck, my brother in England still can't use his (but having fingers like sausages doesn't help either). In fact, my brother in Wales who died last year was another one. He was a smart guy but his wife obviously took care of \"all that technical stuff\" so when she died suddenly he was lost. I remember him being delighted when I sent him an email and coached him through how to \"reply\" back to it. We eventually got him to use an iPhone too, although that never really took off until he met his new lady friend 18 months after my sister-in-law's death and with her being 150 miles away he had to learn how to use it. It's amazing what you can do when there's an incentive isn't it. When he finally realized he could actually leave messages on my phone it was pretty painful - you'd have thought he was in an extra in MASH, always ending his voice messages with \"end of message, over and out\"! I think he might have had delusions of being some kind of Rambo-figure with his new-found technical skills!And finally, I've been watching the news on the pandemic obviously, but I've been trying not to watch it all day long. Just maybe once in the morning and once towards the end of the evening. I have to say, if I ever get caught in a pandemic again (and I hope I don't) I sincerely hope I end up on Team Cuomo! Now there's a leader! He gives the facts, sets out his plan, pulls no punches but also gives hope, I feel, and he knows his stuff. I don't know much (or anything actually) about his politics but from what I can see there's a man who can actually rise to the occasion! Very impresive!Governor CuomoI knew it was going to happen but when I saw tonight that our lockdown has been extended until 15 April at the very least, it kinda knocked the wind out my sails. This is the first day of the enforced confinement that I've felt like this. I guess it's normal and I'm sure people are suffering much worse fates than I am but I have to admit the news of the extended lockdown has been a bit of a damper tonight. That being said, a couple of hours later and I'm fine. I've got loads to do around the house anyway so maybe I will go out and cut the grass tomorrow, just to get out in the sunshine. I haven't wanted to do it because it looks so pretty with the primroses and forget-me-nots but I think my mental health needs a decent workout at the moment.I sent a message to my friend and he seemed pretty down too, but then he lives in a small place and while he goes out walking every day it's not the same when you have to stay within 1 km of your home and you can only go out for a maximum of one hour, one time during the day. So far I haven't wanted to go out walking but I think that might be next on my list of things to do also. It just feels like such a bloody pain to have to print out the attestation and fill it in just in case I get stopped!Anyway, enough of this self-pity nonsense. I guess everyone wishes this would all be over and we could get back to our normal lives, although what \"normal\" will be afterwards I'm not sure. But in the end, I've no business being down. I've got a roof over my head, an income, good medical insurance and there's plenty of food in the shops. Others don't have it so lucky. And seeing that the number of cases of infection in the States has already skyrocketed to over 100,000, if we have to sit out this pandemic in our own homes for a few more weeks then so be it. Stay safe everyone. Normal service will be resumed (in about five hours I reckon. It's 2.30 a.m. here and I'm off to bed)!"},
{"title": "Oh the stress!", "date": "Thursday 26 March 2020", "text": "Day 10 of lockdown - or at least I think it is - and it's still ok here. I still think we're going to get an extension of this lockdown though. The French government have talked about needing a six-week lockdown already, but to be honest I can see another two-week extension in five days time when this one will be over, even if they don't go for the six-week extension immediately. And if that's the only way to beat this thing then let's go for it. We don't have a choice anyway do we. Every day I check the figures worldwide and the US is, of course, fast, catching up with the leader board. It's normal of course because it's a big country with a large population, but I'm just wondering how long it will take before they get the gold medal nobody wants. Another figure that intrigues me is that Switzerland (where my son and his wife live - hence the interest) is still ahead of the UK so many days later. Switzerland has a population of around 8.5 million and the UK around 66.5 million and they are still ahead of us. Obviously there could be several reasons for this, of course. They are so many days/weeks ahead of the UK in this misery. They genuinely have bigger problems than the UK. Or they are way ahead in testing people (more likely I think). Anyway, who knows, but I think we've got a way to go before we see light at the end of this tunnel - and that's hoping that that particular light is freedom rather than a train coming in the other direction!In amongst all the disgusting behaviour that I'm reading about I was proud to see that at last checking over 560,000 people in the UK had volunteered to \"help the NHS\" as of this morning, with 405,000 of them volunteering in the first 24 hours! I always knew there was a good side to people despite the appalling behaviour of some, as highlighted in the rabble-rousing of the gutter press in order to sell papers. Aside from the obvious health care professionals who are so desperately needed, they have a volunteer roster to help with transport, shopping for the quarantined, moving medical supplies around and just social contact. I would love to do something like this but so far I haven't gotten any further than the message from the lady at the Mairie telling me to take care as I live alone! I even have a crate of foodstuffs waiting to go to the food bank but can't take it there as we're not allowed out - or at least I'm not allowed out at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night to take stuff to the food bank, which is the only time they're open! I'm sure if I got stopped I could reason with the gendarmes but I also don't want to risk a minimum €135 fine if I come across some little jobsworth who is having a bad day!The French have now issued a new attestation giving more details as to why we are allowed out and about. I guess they're trying to stop the \"24 hour a day exercisers\" from being out all day long in their sweat pants, rather than the one hour time we are allotted. We now have to give our address (so they can calculate if we are more than 1 km away from home \"exercising\") and the time at which we left home. I don't mind that at all but it's kind of sad that they have to dot the \"i\"s and cross the \"t\"s to this point because a few can't show common sense. It did tickle me a bit though because they have now updated the list of \"essential\" shops allowed to stay open to include the tabac (tobacconist's) and the off licence (in the UK - where they sell booze). I suppose if booze and ciggies help people get through this then so be it. I reckon in about nine months' time we might also see a sharp increase in the birth rate but … great! Sadly, this also seems to be the kind of situation where the incidence of domestic violence also increases, for obvious reasons. The only thing I can say is I'm so glad to be going through this alone and that someone, somewhere is going through this with my ex - and it ain't me!I also saw on the local Geneva news this morning that the Swiss have chartered a plane (paid for by an anonymous individual) to send about 100 Roma gypsies back to Romania. This came about because, well, there is nobody in the streets any more to beg from and they want to go back to Romania where they have homes and a livelihood! So the Swiss jumped on the opportunity, an anonymous individual stepped in to pay for it, and voilà!As for me, I'm just puttering along daily and still doing fine. To be honest, if I have to get quarantined anywhere I could do a lot worse than here, and I know many aren't as lucky. I actually got most of my Kaffe Fassett mystery quilt put together and am ready to start quilting. Now I haven't enjoyed this at all, mainly because I actually don't like the original design (but wasn't to know that at the time, hence the word \"mystery\" in mystery quilt) and because I can't cut straight to save my life. But after much blood, sweat, swearing and improvisation that thing is laid across my living room floor while I'm crawling over it in shorts and clean socks trying to tack it together by hand until I can get it under the machine to quilt. Kaffe Fassett would probably roll in his grave (if he were dead, which he isn't at time of writing but who knows) at my version of his mystery quilt but hey, what can I say!What Kaffe Fasset had in mindMy version - I must have read the instructions wrong!And in other news, when I was making the brownies for my neighbour the other day my hand-held mixer started playing up. Not surprising really, I suppose, because I reckon my parents gave me that when I first moved to Switzerland in 1980 so it owes me nothing does it. Anyway with my newly-acquired zen attitude I decided to sit outside in the sunshine on my terrace and take that baby apart. Well, I'm not surprised it was playing up! While I obviously clean it after every use, when I took it apart I was amazed at how much dust and muck had accumulated over the years! I got an old toothbrush and cleaned that thing out and put it back together, but seriously! I'm not surprised I feel \"bunged up\" in the morning (not that I sleep with the mixer of course) and blame it on hay fever!!! I mean, how much dust is hidden from sight in our daily lives even if we consider ourselves \"clean\"? And talking of dust, I decided to further my zen mindset and have been doing a bit of yoga every day following \"Yoga with Adrienne\" on YouTube. I can highly recommend her as she's great! Except, that yesterday, as I was lying on the floor doing my bit with Adrienne, all I could focus on was the bloody dust and cobwebs underneath the furniture! Damn! Maybe I'm not quite as laid back as I thought!And then to add to my stress, I went out grocery shopping today and everything was fine - more than fine actually - at first. No queues, no worries anywhere, except I can't find my teabags! I know!!!! What's a Brit gonna do without her teabags???? I guess that patronising book I gave my kids making fun of the Brits who travel abroad with their emergency supply of teabags is ringing a bit hollow now isn't it!And finally, my \"Walk 1,000 Miles in 2020\" walking group is having \"technical\" issues as you can imagine, with people no longer allowed to go out walking - well maybe within a 1 km radius but that's a helluva lot of \"walking round the garden\" isn't it. Anyway, yesterday on FB one of the group said that since we were all in the same boat did anyone want to contribute stories about how horrible they/their siblings were to each other when they were growing up. There were a couple that made me laugh. One woman described how their family had gone camping and she and her brother smuggled chocolate fingers (biscuits) into their other sister's sleeping bag and the next morning her sister woke up and thought she'd shat herself!!! And then another one, in a similar, classy vein, mentioned how she'd licked melted Mars bars out of a (clean) nappy to the horror of her siblings. I know, I know, we're a classy lot we Brits aren't we! So I chimed in that when I was about 10, my older sister told me that if I shaved my eyebrows and cut off my eyelashes they would grow back twice as strong! Well guess who did it!! Thankfully they grew back but I walked around looking like a frickin' lizard for about a month and never forgave her! Siblings, don't you just love 'em!"},
{"title": "A closed casket!", "date": "Tuesday 24 March 2020", "text": "The news about the virus isn't getting any better is it - no surprises there, I guess. Italy had a \"relatively\" improved day yesterday with a dip in the number of deaths but it soon went up again today, sadly, with Spain looking to be hot on their heels. I saw on the news tonight that they have actually taken over an ice rink in Madrid to use as a makeshift morgue now. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better isn't it!Later in the news broadcast they were showing the plight of people trapped overseas (Brits in this case) and desperately trying to get back, with flights being cancelled left, right and centre. One poor family were trying to get home from Thailand but having just spent the last 24 hours in Bangkok Airport trying to get on a replacement flight they were getting nowhere fast. They could get a flight in a couple of days' time at a cost of £12,000!!!!! but, as they said, they didn't have that kind of money. Eventually (and I would probably say provisionally because who knows if \"confirmed\" flights will be cancelled between now and then) they managed to get a flight out on Sunday at an additional cost of just £2,000! But today is only Tuesday so what are they going to do between now and then? I can only thank the heavens above that my kids managed to get out of there when they did, and on their already scheduled flights. Again, as I say, this is just another facet of what is already a nightmare situation!In better news they announced on the British news tonight that so far 35,000 volunteers have come forward to help out the NHS. That number is made up of retired doctors and nurses of course, but also medical students and interns in their final year of medicine. That's an amazing number of volunteers and the number is still rising. In addition, a nationally-organized volunteer scheme has been set up where people can volunteer in areas outside the medical field but where there is still a need, so hopefully some kind of order is being brought to the current madness.Then this afternoon Ireland announced stronger lockdown measures to deal with the crisis, in addition to relief measures to be undertaken. I didn't catch all of it but one thing that struck me was that they had come to an agreement with private medical facilities and their staff to step in and work with the public sector on a not-for-profit basis to get them through this. In addition, there was guaranteed coverage by the government of unemployment pay (up to what sounded like a pretty generous limit), as well as a ban on all rent increases and evictions \"for the duration\". Over here I was expecting to hear President Macron speak tonight but ultimately we got the Minister for Health giving information on what is going on and, I believe, softening us up in time for an extension of the current lockdown for up to a possible six weeks! While I'm not thrilled at the idea of a six week lockdown, if that's what it takes to defeat this thing then that's what it takes - which made me all the more horrified to hear that Trump is pushing to get people back to work after two weeks against the advice of his medical advisors! I suppose, ultimately, if that happens only time will tell whether the \"two week\" or the \"six week\" roll of the dice was the correct one, won't it!As for me, I'm still jumping from one project to the next but enjoying getting odds and sods done.  Even if I'm not making huge headway on any one particular thing at the moment that's just the way I roll. When I get fed up of sewing I stop and go down to the basement to work. Then when I've had enough of that I go out to the garden for a bit. As today is my neighbour's birthday (the wife), I decided to make up for my appalling cookies intended for her husband's birthday and make a batch of my \"no fail\" brownies. When they were done I ran round to their front door and played \"Thunder and Lightening\"! You remember playing that as a little kid right? Knock on the door like thunder and then run like lightening? Or was that just me? Anyway, she was delighted that I had remembered her birthday so while I was out back working on my raised beds a while later she wandered over to thank me (our back gardens are all open) - stopping a good 10 metres away of course. I was \"shit shovelling\" at the time as I was trying to empty some of the sludgy compost onto my raised beds but somehow that stuff had taken on the consistency and smell of horse muck and I was having a hard time of it. But then from beyond the hedge over at my other neighbours we could hear them barking out orders to each other. She'd say \"but the hole is right in front of you\" and he'd say \"well just grab it with both hands\"! So she'd yell back \"you're behaving like we've never done this before\"! At which point I commented to my neighbour that they were apparently making a porn movie! Well she got a fit of the giggles and the game was up. Turns out they were trying to put a new cover on their outdoor parasol but weren't having much luck! It's amazing how your mind plays tricks on you when you've been kept in isolation though isn't it!I decided to become a proper little old lady too today as I finally dragged a card table upstairs into my TV room in order to do a \"wasgij\" I've had sitting around for ages (that also sounds like it has \"porn movie\" connotations doesn't it, but not a bit of it)! A \"wasgij\" is a jigsaw puzzle where the finished jigsaw uses the same characters but looks only slightly like the picture on the box. We'll see how long it takes me I guess. Additionally, in the \"pass time\" arena, I picked up a freebie book in English at my pilates class the other week and I have to admit I'm quite enjoying it. It's an easy read and I like his style, even though I'd never heard of this author before. I'm not sure if it's the kind of book you might like but I would definitely give it a thumbs up!And while I know there's nothing funny about the coronavirus, there have been a few black humour stories/events all the same. One guy was saying how ridiculous it was to have a sign saying \"wash your hands\" at the entrance to the motorway. I mean, can you imagine getting pulled over by the motorway cops with your hands in a bucket of water singing two verses of God Save The Queen! And I also spotted the \"Italian mayors' rants\" that is doing the rounds at the moment too. As I say, while there is nothing funny about this pandemic, some of the things these mayors came out with were hilarious - unintentionally maybe - but hilarious nonetheless! And here I would point out that while I am indeed learning Italian I'm not quite at the level of understanding these guys so I took the translation from the sub-titles - and apologize in advance for the language. Well one mayor was going absolutely ballistic about people not respecting lockdown and \"no, having your hairdresser come to your home instead of going to the salon does not constitute an essential or urgent necessity! You'll be in a goddamn closed casket so nobody will be looking at your f....ing hair\"! Again, sorry about the language, but somehow that just about sums it all up doesn't it!"},
{"title": "Day seven!", "date": "Sunday 22 March 2020", "text": "Under normal circumstances I guess we'd be almost half way through our 15 day lockdown here in France, but in all honesty these aren't normal circumstances are they and I fully expect that lockdown will be extended. What can I say! I realize exactly how lucky I am compared to so many people who are worried about their or their loved ones health and/or financial stability, so for me to complain would be unforgiveable. I have no intention of complaining anyway as I really am just fine. Maybe the truth is that I'm just antisocial as these past seven days being alone haven't bothered me at all. I do now have a lovely clean terrace and even though the temperature dropped today I spent a couple of hours outside weeding as it was good to get some fresh air. I also rather optimistically set up a few pots with tomato and courgette seeds to start off in my living room but - and don't laugh - I'm actually thinking I might lug one of my little old el cheapo greenhouses up into my bathroom and set it up in there for the seedlings. It's a large, bright and sunny room which retains the heat so I reckon they might do well there and hey, I live on my own and have no-one to impress anyway so why not!I mentioned before that I went out grocery shopping on Friday and it was really fine - not really any shortages and plenty of fresh fruit and veg, which makes the images I see of empty shelves and people lining up outside the shops in the UK all the more saddening! What the heck is that all about? My sister and her husband got back from Spain on Friday and she said that although they stayed in while they were there, again there were no shortages in the stores!! Shame on (some) Brits for such selfish behaviour! My sister and her husband will be staying indoors for a couple of weeks, of course, and like the rest of the country just have to get on with it. André and Lily made it back safely from Thailand on Saturday on their regular, scheduled flight and again they will be working from home in Switzerland and self-isolating. I'm just relieved they're all back home safely. I found out today that three colleagues have now tested positive for the virus and one person has lost a family member in Spain so it really is hitting close to home now!André and Lily travelling homeWe have to have this attestation de déplacement on us every time we go out!I have been watching the British government's nightly update on the situation and while I will never be a Bojo fan I have to say I'm impressed by the people he surrounds himself with, in particular Professor Chris Whitty, the UK's Chief Medical Officer. Although having a bit of a Mr. Bean appearance I've found him impressive and reassuring when giving his opinions and answering questions in an extremely composed and stiff upper lip kinda way! I suppose the good news at least is that Bojo doesn't keep firing his experts!Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical OfficerWhen I came in this evening I thought I may as well sit down and do some Italian homework that our teacher sent us. Just a couple of short stories to read and answer questions on so that took up another hour before I headed down to cook dinner. Another thing that surprises me though is that restaurants and cafés are closed in the UK now but they can still supply take-out meals! I suppose it surprises me because you have a snowflake's chance in hell of getting a take-out meal over here at any time, not just during a pandemic!!! Don't get me wrong, I'm glad these businesses can continue to provide this service for those who might need it, but it's just such an anathema to me because take-out doesn't exist here. There are no grocery store deliveries either. Maybe in Switzerland but not around here, so it's just not something we can count on. But what also surprises me still is how so many people just can't cook. I don't mean that they don't cook, but that they can't cook! I remember years ago meeting a colleague's sister who was over here on vacation. She had four kids and told me she never, ever cooked! Never! I think my jaw just dropped as I couldn't get my mind around the idea of never cooking for your family - or that such a thing was even possible! I suppose knowing the rudiments of how to cook went out the window at the same time as home economics classes did in school sad to say! What a loss those classes were. Both boys and girls at my school had to do at least three months each of woodwork, metalwork, sewing and cooking. We can't all be boffins can we and I really feel the loss of those classes did no-one any favours (although I was crap at metalwork, I have to admit)!In other news I see that the UK put out a call to retired nurses and doctors to come back into service and so far 4,000 nurses and 500 doctors have stepped up to the plate. Given the fairly recent dispute between the government and junior doctors about their contracts I seriously hope that everyone remembers what these people are doing for us all right now, in particular when it comes to giving them the salaries they deserve!In other news I had the weirdest message on my phone this evening. Around October last year I mentioned that I thought something might be wrong with my friend Brian in England as in the 10 years we had known each other he had never forgotten my birthday, always contacted me on Remembrance Sunday and always sent me a Christmas card - until last year, that is! I sent messages and tried his number but got nowhere, so given his age and his recent ill health I could only assume the worst. Well tonight I received a forwarded message from his number. It was a copy of a letter written to the Irish Times re the coronavirus. From Brian!!!!! So I wrote back and said \"Brian???? Is that you????\" and so far, several hours later, I've not received an answer. It's a bit like a couple of years ago when I woke up in the middle of the night to a \"thumbs up\" message from Ian, my friend in Bulgaria who died so suddenly about three years ago. In all honesty I think it's just a fluke, maybe a spam message or something, as I really think Brian would get in touch if he were able to, but it was definitely weird, and I still have the message on my phone, unlike Ian's message which disappeared after a few minutes! Maybe it was just Brian telling me to stay safe. I like to think so!The big \"joke's on you\" I just read about is that Boris Johnson's father, Stanley, has applied for French citizenship on the grounds that his late mother was French!!! If that goes through it would allow Bojo and his siblings to also apply (his sister broke the news and is already rubbing her hands with glee apparently). So there you have it, another Brexiteer in the land of I'm all right Jack!And finally, the UK is still not in total lockdown and the city of London is still open for business, with people simply being advised to maintain social distancing. Trouble is, while most people will indeed do the right thing some idiots will continue to believe the rules don't apply to them and ruin it for everyone. Just like the bloody idiot YouTube wannabe who, although not a Brit, must be a candidate for the Darwin Awards for the most stupid thing to do in her desperate search for fame. Apparently this \"aspiring model\" (aren't they all) and two-time guest on Dr. Phil, \"took up the coronavirus challenge\" and videoed herself licking the toilet seat on an airplane, all in the eternal quest for YouTube glory! Natural selection at its best (I hope)!"},
{"title": "Day three and going strong!", "date": "Thursday 19 March 2020", "text": "Well it's day three of lockdown here and everything's going just fine. Well more than fine, strangely enough, because I've had this long list of things that need doing for ages and I'm finally starting to tick a few off. Now given that I no longer go out to work and in normal times only have a few hours' activities a week, I'm just wondering why my list ever got to be this long in the first place. But it's quite satisfying actually getting down to some of the nitty gritty. Yesterday I spent another couple of hours pressure-spraying the front of my house and hosing down the balcony, so that's the pressure spray put away (hopefully) for another 12 months! Then today I decided I was finally going to fill in a few of the holes in the concrete paving on my terrace. They've been there for a while but of course pressure-spraying showed up a few more eroded spots so I lugged a bag of quick-setting cement up from the basement (set like a brick already for the most part) and after bashing the hell out of it with a crowbar and a lump hammer I made up a small bucket of cement and starting \"trowelling\" it into the holes. It didn't look very good until I got water and a cloth and started tamping it down and now, while it's hardly a professional job, it definitely looks better than it did before and will hopefully stop bugging me every time I see it. To be honest though, I could probably have just mixed up another batch of that dreadful cookie mix I made for my neighbour the other week and used that - I bet the crazy paving would never move again after that!I've also been trying out a few new vegetarian recipes as \"going veggie\" is something I'm quite interested in. I don't think I'll ever really go totally vegetarian but I am more and more drawn to that way of eating, all the more so since watching the documentaries Forks Over Knives and Food Inc. recently. I just feel more and more that meat is not really necessary in our diets and the inhumane way in which so many of our animals are raised and slaughtered makes me want to try to eliminate meat as much as possible. Trouble is, at the moment everything seems to be \"chickpea curry\" , or some version of it, and while I love chickpeas there is a limit. So today I spent a fair bit of time cooking yellow dahl lentils with aubergine and tomatoes. I'm not totally sold on it (maybe too much tomato sauce) so the jury's still out on that one. I did, however, use up the mushrooms I had stuffed at the back of my fridge to make garlic mushrooms - now they were delicious (but it's probably just as well I live alone - all that garlic you see). Still in addition to keeping vampires away I'm hoping it will also keep the coronavirus away - well that and turmeric maybe!Earlier this afternoon I sent a quick message to the lady I know at the village Mairie and said that I was able-bodied and had time on my hands if there was any way I could be of help. She wrote back and said at the moment everything was pretty quiet but if I knew anyone near me who was living alone I might want to check in on them. So I gave it some thought and the only person I can think of near me who lives alone is me! Ha, job done then! But with that in mind I thought I'd better check in on my brother in England who also lives alone. I never usually call him because he is a technophobe, doesn't really know how to use his phone and in any case he stutters so he hates using it. But I had a quick chat with him anyway to see if he was ok and mentioned he might want to get a few bits and bobs in \"just in case\"! I know he's fine really but with my sister away I thought I'd better let him know he could call me if he was worried about anything. In any case, my sister and her husband finally made it back from Spain today on what they were calling a \"repatriation flight\". That's good news as the Spaniards have told all tourists it's time to leave the country as they are shutting all the hotels down! So one down, just the other one to go then!I had a good long chat with \"the other one\" yesterday - i.e. my son who's in Thailand with his wife. I guess he was bored because we got into a rather political debate about the state of US politics. I shouldn't do it really but I quite enjoy a good banter with him. He is very politically-minded and I would say pretty well informed. He once told me that he not only listened to US news stations (as well as the BBC), but also to Al Jazeera, because if you wanted to know the real truth you had to hear a story from all sides didn't you. I thought that was pretty smart actually. Anyway, I can't say he's pro-Trump but he is just so disgusted with the Democrats it makes his blood boil. Says that all this in-fighting and behaving as badly as Trump (as though they were on reality TV) has done them no favours and risks losing them the next election as he genuinely thinks Trump will get back in!!! As you can imagine, it was an interesting discussion. As I say, he is very politically-minded and can diplomatically debate with anyone. He actually once had a protracted discussion with his very conservative American grandma about why abortion should be legalized - and she said that although she could never agree with him it was lovely to have such a spirited (but respectful) discussion with her own grandson! Anyway, hopefully he and Lily will be on their flights out of Thailand tomorrow night. At the moment everything looks to be on track, thank goodness!I think I might take a trip out to the grocery store tomorrow to get fresh stuff as long as there are no queues (with my attestation in case I get stopped)! If that fails, I'm good. I have no idea whether or not they have paper products or soap in stock (I suspect they will, although not as much as normal) but I'm good anyway. And then it occurred to me, when I ended up emptying out the farmhouse my ex abandoned in 2015 I gave all the decent linens/towels etc. to charity, keeping the tattier stuff in my spare bedroom to cut up for rags. Well five years later and I'm nowhere near through using it all up (he had a lot of stuff, as you can imagine). Whenever I'm cleaning I just cut up a few more rags and throw them afterwards but here I am five years later and I've hardly made a dent in my pile! Crikey. My mom always used to say you can tell \"posh\" people because they actually buy their rags instead of cutting up their old sheets. I guess we weren't posh then and I'm still not now 'cos those unposh rags are still going strong!My friend is already having a hard time in isolation, it would seem, because yesterday he sent me a message to say \"temperature 34° and I'm bored out my mind\"! I knew it! He lives in a small apartment so I guess there's not much he can be doing around the house. He does a lot of consulting work on international trade law now he's retired but I guess that's not enough to keep him busy either right now. I mentioned that I had thought of inviting him over here to wait out the quarantine with me but then thought the better of it as I was afraid one of us might murder the other stuck in close quarters for too long! He pretended to be offended but we both know that's the truth. So in the meantime he's bored and I'm loving it! While I know there's an awful lot of unhappiness going to come out of this coronavirus madness, I'm also kinda hoping that maybe, just maybe, people might learn to slow down and enjoy the quieter things in life. Who knows. Certainly the basic goodness of some people is starting to show too. I saw today that two of the UK's top footballers are going to open up hotels that they own in the London area to be used by exhausted NHS (medical) workers free of charge so that they don't have to struggle to get home after long shifts! As I say, bad times bring out the worst in some people but also the best in others!I also saw a couple of things on the net that tickled me too this morning. One young woman had been house-sitting for a family she didn't know and posted that while the house was lovely they had the weirdest soap ever - it didn't lather and was in fact very unpleasant to wash with. She found out later that they had left a chunk of cheese out near the sink by accident before going away and she had been washing her hands with it!Then I read another story about an American couple travelling in Scotland who were absolutely rhapsodizing about the place - about everything, that is, except the soap they found in their room. They said it was grainy, didn't lather at all and left their hands scratched and blotchy. When they mentioned it to the hotel manager he burst out laughing as they'd been washing their hands with traditional Scottish shortbread!And finally, talking of \"supplies\" I just had to post this picture for Dave. Dave I saw this and thought of you. Hope your dogs are better behaved!"},
{"title": "Lockdown!", "date": "Tuesday 17 March 2020", "text": "Well for us, at least, it started at noon today. So from today, and for the next 15 days, we have to self-isolate at home. There are exceptions, of course, and people will be allowed to leave their homes but you have to have a signed attestation de déplacement on you at all times. That basically is a form signed by yourself (wording proposed by the French government website) to say that you are out and about because (a) you need to get to work, (b) you need to buy essential supplies (groceries, medicines, etc.), (c) you need to take care of a vulnerable person, or (and this is the best one) (d) you've got to take the dog for a poop! Well it's not quite stated like that but I guess they know that people need to take their dogs out and people also feel the need to get out in the fresh air and exercise so we can actually go out for our jog (fat chance of me doing that) or walk but it must be local, we must be alone, and we must have that attestation on us. Failure to produce it gets a €38 fine, which can increase to over €100 for repeat offenders, so it's just as well to print it or copy it out and do the necessary I guess!I had yoga yesterday morning and decided afterwards to go out for what turned out ultimately to be a \"last hurrah\" walk for a while. I took myself off to a place called Passy and spent a very pleasant hour or so walking round a couple of small lakes round there. But wouldn't you know it, all the skiers have gone home because they've closed the resorts a month early, the price of petrol is going down and down, the weather is glorious - and we're all now stuck at home! Sod's law, I guess, but it's a small price to pay even though I'm pretty sure the lockdown will be extended beyond the 15 day initial timeframe!Lac des IlettesI spoke to Jordan yesterday and he will be going in to work, but the company they get most of their supplies from in Italy have already told them they have ceased production for the time being, so I don't know how long he will be properly employed. In any case he should get 70% of his salary whether he works or not but somehow I can see them finding plenty for him to do. Jen, as a nurse, is definitely going to be in full-time employment but she has also been put on a reserve list as a replacement for the hospital near me in La Roche in case of necessity. She hopes it doesn't come to moving here because she loves where she is currently working and even though she liked working in La Roche before she hated the administrators there, so I hope she can end up staying where she is. At this point it's out of her hands though isn't it!I booked myself in for my regular monthly facial about 10 days ago which was very nice of course. Then the next day I found myself hacking bits off my hair with my sewing scissors so I dashed in to town to get it cut by a professional before I did any more damage. Then, remember when I left work and my colleagues very generously gave me a gift box as a leaving present? Well I chose an entry into a hot springs in Geneva with a massage to follow from that gift box, but what I hadn't realized was that there was a second free entry into the hot springs, to be used within one year. Well one year was up on 17 March 2020 so I also booked myself in for another massage last week - just in time, as it turns out, because since yesterday there is no more \"non-essential\" crossing of the Franco-Swiss border either!My sister and her husband were caught short by this coronavirus and are in Spain at the moment and - we hope - have managed to get a flight out of there on Thursday. They are staying in their own small home there anyway so hotels are not a worry but in times like these I think everyone would prefer to be \"at home\" wouldn't they. My oldest son and his wife are in Thailand too. They booked it as a third anniversary trip and are loving it, although are somewhat \"concerned\" about the new travel ban. They've been in touch with the Swiss Embassy in Bangkok who told them that while things are ok there at the moment they should get back to Geneva as soon as possible. Today's flight out was fully booked and for Thursday's flight they wanted 3,000 Swiss francs ($3,000) one-way! Can you believe it! Their original return flight leaves on Friday anyway so they are sticking with that, but will keep the Embassy up-to-date if necessary. They've also looked at local air BnBs on the island and they say there are plenty if they get stuck, but it seems at the moment that Thailand is not overly affected by the virus (so far). Still, I'll be glad to see them safely home too!My trip to Holland to see the tulips has gone down the pan of course so I'm waiting to see if they will reimburse or how that will work out. Can't be helped though can it. There does seem to be a fair amount of solidarity here with people offering to help older and more vulnerable people out - which is always nice to see! You hear so much about the bad side of the hoarding (not that I've seen any as yet, to be honest) and the nastiness and probably not enough about the good side of things do you. Like the florist who walked round giving away all his unsold stock today at lockdown!And talking of \"little ol' ladies\", my lovely Tunisian friend from work called me yesterday to see if I was ok, what with me being a \"little ol' lady living on her own\"! Cheeky bugger - but it was very sweet of him anyway. All the more so since this little ol' lady decided if she was gonna be stuck at home for a couple of weeks it was time to knock some of the \"must do\" jobs off the list. So with that in mind I spent three hours pressure spraying the muck off my back terrace today, and very satisfying it was too. Well, satisfying for the first couple of hours but by hour three I was starting to get wet and slightly cold (in addition to having a face full of muck and crap) so I was glad when I finally finished up. To be honest my face is \"as red as a turkey cock's arse\" tonight (as my dad used to say), probably due to the wind blowing all that crud in my face, so in retrospect I probably could have done without the facial the other week!The winter muck!Almost done cleaning!When I was looking through my bathroom cabinet for eye drops (got muck in my eyes from the pressure spraying) I realized I'd also got a couple of bottles of rubbing alcohol in there too, as well as a couple of (very old) disinfectant scrubs. Then, when I was reading Frugal in Istanbul's blog today (I can highly recommend it) she mentioned Turkish lemon cologne/sanitizer and I realized I actually had a bottle of it in my kitchen all this time. I bought it last time I was in Turkey as I loved it and the bloody thing has been staring me in the face all this time. So now I'm set to go, not that I'll bother with it at home as that's what soap and water is for, but it's good to have it in my bag just in case, or if the kids' need it!I've got plenty of food in the house but I'll be curious to see what the situation is like when I do go out shopping (attestation in hand) later this week, or maybe even next week for fresh stuff. I suspect it won't be too bad anyway once people realize that supplies are not going to run out. Either way I'll not starve. Interestingly, the other week I intended to make stuffed cannelloni but realized I didn't have any ricotta when I got home. What I did have, though, was Boursin à l'ail (soft, garlic-flavoured cheese) so I used that instead and it was really good. I might get a bit sick of it by day 15 but what can I say, food is food isn't it!And finally, you know how FB suggests people you might know. Well at the moment it's going slightly mad because apparently I \"might know\" half the Indian sub-continent - or so it seems. I just delete all those suggestions but I had to laugh at the two I saw today. As it turns out I don't know either of them, but looking at the trout pout on the left and the dog on the right I think I prefer the dog!"},
{"title": "Winding down!", "date": "Saturday 14 March 2020", "text": "Like most people, I guess, I'm tired of thinking about the coronavirus. And yet .... and yet, we really do have to keep up with it don't we. It's such a big thing that it would be foolish not to. That being said, I don't see the point of going into total panic (at least not where I am) and having sleepless nights about it. As I said yesterday, all of France is in partial lockdown as from Monday but (so far) it's still not total lockdown, as in parts of Italy. Frankly I would hate that as I know I would get cabin fever if I couldn't go out, but needs must I suppose. I remember when my oldest was born in the States, I came home on the second day and was told to keep him indoors for about 10 days. Well I couldn't do that. Cabin fever - being told I couldn't go out - meant that I took him out almost immediately. Not far and not to crowded areas, but once someone told me I couldn't do something that was it. I suppose if we do go to total lockdown I'll have no choice, but so far so good! I made the mistake last night of watching Trump's speech in which he declared a state of national emergency. Two things struck me - it would seem that nobody ever taught the guy to read aloud because although he was reading from a script half the time it was difficult to understand what he was saying as reading aloud involves, you know, a certain fluidity to your speech so that people can follow what you're saying doesn't it. But the biggest thing that bothered me were the two \"nodding dogs\" at the back. You know those nodding dogs that you used to see in people's cars? Well Pence and the blond woman (sorry, I've no idea who she is) kept nodding sagely at everything he said like they were hanging on to pearls of wisdom and I find it kinda weird that my only take from it was the nodding dogs!Today I received word that my Tuesday afternoon yoga classes have been cancelled \"until further notice\" - which probably isn't a bad thing as maybe that will give the teacher a chance to claw back some mental sanity - I don't know. The next cancellation was my Italian classes. They're now cancelled until 30 April, and since my teacher was also off sick for a month recently I think I'm totally screwed for hooking up with a sexy Italian, given that the sum total of my Italian conversation at the moment would seem to be \"at what time does the train to Milan leave?\" (Side note, the answer to that question is probably \"not at all at the moment\"!).So yesterday I decided to take a walk up in the mountains as the weather was half-way decent and I needed the fresh air. On the way up there I stopped off at a new-to-me store called Fresh which, as the name would suggest, sells only fresh goods, but by golly it was a great place. The meat, cheese and produce looked wonderful and was cheaper than my local haunts, so I might be doing my main shopping there for the duration of the market closures!After that I headed up to the Lac Vert for a little wander and it really was lovely. It's a very small green lake (as the name suggests) but stunningly pretty, although I couldn't get good pictures on my phone so had to use google images to show you. As an aside, the last time I went up here was about 20 years ago with my friend's parents. I was walking round the lake behind her mom when she unfortunately let out a rather loud fart. I didn't want to embarrass her so didn't react, but when we got back to the cars she leaned over to me and in her rather posh English accent thanked me for pretending not to hear! Ah, I love her mom!Le Lac VertAs I haven't been up there for years I wasn't sure I was on the right road so I stopped part way up to check. When I pulled over I noticed a book on a bench in the layby and went over to have a look, thinking that someone had forgotten it. But no, someone had left a bible there. It seemed in reasonable shape when I took a look at it but I don't suppose it will stay dry for long. It was a nice touch though!As I was driving back I got a text message from my eldest asking if I was ok as he had heard things were \"rough\" in Europe! When I said I was fine but where was he he told me that he and his wife were in Thailand and worried about closed borders when it came to coming back. Said they were keeping up-to-date with the Swiss Government information site since the Swiss are effectively closing their borders to non-essential travellers right now! And I didn't even know the little bugger was away! When he told me to stock up just in case I just laughed as I can usually feed an army even on a normal day so I told him not to worry! Add to that that my sister is currently in Spain and wondering if they will be allowed to leave on Friday it's all go at the moment. At least they have no worries about where to stay if they get stuck because they are staying in the small home they own out there!And I note with satisfaction that Weinstein finally got his come-uppance. 23 years!!! Yes!!! While some people will say many of these women used his advances to further their careers there is no doubt in my mind that 100 women accusing this guy proves that the jury made the right decision, so I, for one, am glad (and surprised) to see him go down. These rich, powerful guys think they're invincible - and it's a good day when the little people fight back and win. Actually, many moons ago, I worked for a company where one of the top guys was an evil, narcissistic bastard. He treated everyone - in particular the \"little people\" - like shit and it was a happy day for all of us when he retired. Buuuut, about 10 years later HR received a letter from him. He had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and in this letter (if I remember right) he almost apologized for his behaviour. I say \"almost\" because I can't remember the exact wording of it, but maybe - just maybe - it was an act of contrition on his part. At the time I just blanked my mind out to it because I didn't even want to think about him as he had been such a nasty, evil piece of work. Now, many years later and maybe with hindsight and compassion on my side, I can try to see it as an apology rather than the last ditch, \"save my soul\" bid of a nasty dying man. Who knows, although I doubt anyone will feel that way about Weinstein, even though his lawyer tried to get him off with just five years because he is a \"sick man\". His \"illness\" didn't stop him abusing his power at the time did it!And finally, I had so many plans for today and basically did bugger all. I mentioned before that I completed Dry January and basically just kept going. I think I've had maybe four glasses of wine (and a rum punch) since December, but today I felt like just doing nothing so I sat outside for a while in my back garden just looking at the mountains and opened a bottle of wine, just for the hell of it. And you know what, listening to the Gipsy Kings with a glass of wine was just magic and all seemed well with the world - even if it wasn't!"},
{"title": "And there you have it!", "date": "Thursday 12 March 2020", "text": "About an hour ago President Macron went on TV to announce that as from Monday all nurseries, schools, colleges and universities will be closed until further notice. They are now also looking at closing borders and Haute Savoie (where I live) is one of four regions where free movement will be severely restricted. He has asked over 70s, in particular, to stay home as much as possible and assured people/businesses that the State will pick up the tab when people are unable to work. So now we know!I went to pilates this morning and was somewhat surprised to see that the market was on as I had thought that markets were being closed down for the duration. That being said, I understand that markets in Haute Savoie will, indeed, be stopped as from Monday. Those poor people - can you imagine being prevented from making a living \"until further notice\"! There were far fewer people at the market than usual but at least it was on today. After that I went grocery shopping and I have to say I didn't really notice any shortages. Plenty of tp, maybe slightly less well-stocked shelves of rice, pasta and couscous, but not really anything that noticeable!On a whim I looked up the exchange rate and sure enough the Swiss franc is starting to soar as in times of crisis other currencies traditionally take refuge in the Swiss franc. It's now at it's highest level against the euro in decades (SF 1.05/€1 right now) and US$1 will now only get you 0.94 Swiss francs. To give you an idea, when we got married my ex was paid in US$ and at the time it would have bought him SF 2.50!!! Even if you never leave your home country such roller-coaster rides in currencies makes a helluva difference. For me, for instance, since my pension is paid in Swiss francs, I will make more money when I change it into euros. But it makes Swiss exports and tourism more expensive, and imports into Switzerland cheaper. The downside of the strong Swiss franc is that interest rates on savings in Swiss francs are negative (and have been for quite some time). So you're actually paying the bank to keep your Swissies safe!! What a mess this whole situation is, but ultimately I'm sure this lockdown is probably the right thing to do. I'm just glad I don't have any travel plans!That being said, yet again I can only say how relieved I am that I no longer have to worry about work and day care. Others, sadly, are not so lucky. So with that in mind I am going to use this \"free\" time to try to get in more exercise/walking, as well as more sorting, decluttering and sewing as the weather is supposed to pick up (hopefully). At this point I'm not even sure if our yoga classes/sewing club will be allowed to meet as from Monday. What can I say! Hang in there everyone and stay safe!"},
{"title": "Mutiny!", "date": "Tuesday 10 March 2020", "text": "Well there's a surprise (not). As of today the entire country of Italy is now in lockdown - so over 60 million people, assuming they're all home! Crikey, that was quick, but maybe it was the right thing to do. Again I'm not totally sure how this is supposed to work but from what I understand public transport will still be running and people will be allowed to go to work and to shop for groceries but other than that I don't know. I imagine some people won't be able to work and will therefore not get paid but then how will that work for them? And how many people are just one pay check away from financial disaster already? On the positive side I see that the Government has issued a debt moratorium for the time being so that people won't have to worry about making their mortgage payments at least! That's got to be some relief but is it enough?On a whim I looked up the website of the Mont Blanc tunnel which links Italy and France by cutting through the Mont Blanc. I was pretty surprised to see that as of today cars, campers and buses are still being allowed through but trucks over 3.5 tons are not! I was talking to my neighbour about that and neither of us could figure out the logic of not allowing goods and perishables through but then allowing people to travel! Beats me!Then yesterday I received an email from my nephew and his girlfriend has been at home sick (in Liverpool) for about a week now and they're thinking she might have the virus. There has also apparently been a confirmed case at work, which isn't such a surprise in itself, I guess, in an organization with over 700 staff and constant meetings/visitors. I don't know what the plans are at work but I imagine it's time for people to be working from home and cancelling meetings, if that hasn't already happened. I guess I'll be avoiding the gym there for a few weeks then as it just doesn't make sense to go in does it!And still thinking about the coronavirus, last night we had our sewing club and I got talking to Valérie, who is a nurse in the large hospital down the road from here. She was saying that while they do have a couple of cases she feels that they are \"ready for it\" - or as ready as you can be for an epidemic of this kind. We were \"sensible\" though as nobody did la bise (the kiss on both cheeks) to greet each other like we usually do. We just kinda waved at each other to say hallo in that very British way - made me feel right at home for a change!Picture by shutterstockAnd I just watched a few minutes of the news tonight and saw Trump give a short quote to the awaiting press corps at the White House re the coronavirus situation, words to the effect that \"the economy's doing great, consumers are going to spend and great things are gonna happen, you'll see\"! What the flip!!! Those are the soundbites he uses whenever he's asked a question on any subject. But don't worry America, apparently consumers are going to spend their way out of this epidemic so you're all good and have nothing to worry about!Then today I had my first Tuesday afternoon yoga class after the spring break and oooohhh was it awkward. The teacher mentioned the coronavirus at the beginning of the class and all the \"fake news surrounding it\" and do we chose to listen to bad news all day and sit there in a state of permanent panic or do we do like her and chose to see all the good things we have in life - our health, our homes, enough food and so on? Fair enough, she's entitled to her views and she is a yoga teacher after all. So then she put some rather pretty \"oriental\" music on and asked us all to lie down and just listen to it to see if we could block out the whirring thoughts in our brains and really appreciate the gift that is our sense of hearing. Again, no problem, I can do that (although someone fell asleep at this point - I heard the snoring). But she then proceeded to go on and on and on …. she never stopped talking about seeing the positives in life and not being materialistic and how life is wonderful, and totally drowned out the music she was asking us to listen to in the first place. It was just weird! That is one of her big faults actually, she never shuts up and when you're trying to \"get in the groove\" for yoga you don't need someone constantly blathering away. Well after about 30 minutes of this I started just doing a few stretching exercises as I was getting bored and starting to prepare my shopping list in my head to tune her out, so other people started doing the same (the stretching exercises, not the shopping list thingy). But in all this went on for the entire 90 minute class and, as I found out afterwards, people were getting more and more irritated with her (like I said, I just tuned her out). Everyone had had a bellyful of her whittering it seemed. On a side note, my ex-husband actually used to \"whitter\" too. I remember him picking up on a particular song that he liked the lyrics to, so he put it on really loud (too loud) and kept saying listen, listen over the top of the song. Well this went on for so long I just turned round and said \"I'm trying to f....g listen, but do you ever shut the f up\"? Sorry about the language but I have to say it was provoked, believe me, and oddly enough my outburst kinda spoiled the moment somehow. I've no idea why!Anyway after yoga I went to the loo (not forgetting to wash my hands of course) and bumped into Sylvie who said that in her opinion our teacher was heading for another \"breakdown\" because \"this is how she got last year shortly before she went completely under for about three months\". Then when I got out to my car a few others were saying the same thing, with a couple saying \"remember this, we didn't pay good money to listen to that rant\"! So I'm not sure what's going to happen. Will she end up having another breakdown? Will they end up not using her services any more because she is unreliable (as was proven last year)? Who knows. I was saying to my neighbour on the way home though that if, as a yoga teacher, she is still as highly strung as she is I would hate to imagine what she would be like without the yoga. The two just don't seem to go together at all. I mean, you imagine yoga teachers to be all zen in their personalities too don't you. But I suppose if that's all it takes to be a yoga teacher I'd make a good one - I'm so laid back I'm surprised I don't bloody well fall over half the time. Pity about the \"yoga\" bit though!"},
{"title": "Lockdown!", "date": "Sunday 8 March 2020", "text": "So it would seem that approximately one-quarter of Italy's population is now effectively in lockdown - 16 million people currently located in the regions designated as high risk in the coronavirus epidemic. I'm not at all sure from the news how this will all work out (I don't think many Italians know either). Are they going to be allowed out shopping? Should they go to work? What about businesses and services? I've no idea. What I do know is that Lombardy is just over the border from here. Forty-five minutes by car gets you to the Mont Blanc tunnel and in to the Aosta Valley on the Italian side, with Piedmont and Lombardy the neighbouring regions. As I was watching the news tonight they were saying that there are now over 7,000 cases of infection in the country, with an increase of 2,000 cases in the last hour alone - a phenomenal rate of acceleration! So now I'm just wondering if/when it will hit here. I'm eternally grateful that I'm retired and can self-isolate if necessary. Other than death, the worst case scenario would be \"inconvenient\" for me, but what on earth happens to the local businesses in particular, and the economy in general? Scary times indeed!Even despite the proximity of Italy I haven't seen any evidence of panic buying of anything as yet. For some reason I bought a bottle of hand sanitizer about a month ago, probably the day I went hiking up to the waterfall and felt pretty grubby on the way down. I don't usually carry it with me unless I'm on my travels but I'm pleased to say I have some to carry around with me for the time being. And as for the \"rush\" on toilet paper - nope, not seen that at all. I had to laugh though at the chap in Australia who accidentally ordered 48 boxes of toilet paper online a month or so ago instead of 48 individual toilet rolls. Apparently he had the mickey taken out of him by his friends something terrible, so in light of the latest panic buying in Australia he published a rather funny video of \"who's having the last laugh now\"! Gotta love the Aussies!His wife on her toilet paper throne!Talking of Italians and toilets (we were weren't we?), at my Italian lesson on Wednesday we were learning the use of c'è and ci sono - \"there is/there are\". It makes sense in English but in French they don't distinguish between the two - il y a means both, so it was a novel idea for the French-speaking students in our group. Anyway, our teacher was asking us about our homes, our gardens. Do you have a garden? Do you have a balcony? etc. to get us to use c'è and ci sono. One of the things she asked was did our homes have doppi servizi, which basically means a full bathroom. Then she somehow wandered off on a tangent about how weird it was for her, as an Italian, to find bathrooms without a bidet. She said her grandmother would have been horrified to find no bidet and even she, as a 40-something Italian, found it strange that most homes round here do not have bidets. So then the conversation degenerated wandered on to the subject of bidets and their uses until I burst out laughing and asked if anyone realized we had just discussed bidets for the past 10 minutes!!! Either way we covered a lot of ground and it was a fun class! In amongst the different words we were learning she asked me if my home had la cantina, which, it turns out, is what the French call a faux ami, in the sense that la cantina is actually a basement and not, as the name would suggest, a cantine/kitchen! These are the kinds of words that trip you up when you learn a foreign language. For instance, in French sensible means sensitive and not sensible, so a faux ami! Gripping stuff isn't it!Anyway, in other news I've managed to get some work done in the basement (la cantina) and the garden this weekend and it's been really pleasant. The crocuses (crocii?) and primroses are starting to bloom and my little patch of lawn is looking lovely - well at least to my eyes anyway - I don't need it to look like a bowling green! While I was outside working there was a knock at my door and a young lad asked if I would like to buy an Xbox 360 for €30! I told him I already had one (I don't but it seemed easier than turning him down), but since I saw he was going door-to-door I asked him why he didn't just put a notice up on the mail boxes round here. Well that must have sparked an interest in him because guess who ended up making him five flyers to put up!! I recognized him as the young lad who my neighbours had kicked out of my garden a few years ago when he was just coming in and breaking/stealing my ornaments. Actually he's the reason I put my side gate in, truth be told, but that's all water under the bridge now I guess as it was five years ago. At one point I asked him to write up one of the flyers (since I had a few to make) and he told me he \"couldn't write that well\"! I was stunned as he is 11 now! So I told him to just copy what I had written and he couldn't even do that! This is the youngest from the family I wrote about in another post where mom has run off with another man leaving dad and the last four of her seven children with dad - who is now in the process of drinking himself to death apparently! Remember - the one where their golden retriever followed me on my walk! It's sad really but what can I say. It didn't take him too long to see the sweets I had out on my cabinet so I told him to take one from each bowl. Well he ended up taking quite a few (\"one of each colour\", I think he said) and left with a bunch of flyers and pockets bulging with candy!Then last night I did, indeed, go out with Ginette to the Soirée Réunionaise in her village but ... meh! It wasn't so great. They had four young women from Réunion who did a couple of African dances and that was pretty much it for the entertainment. I have to say the food was very good but pretty expensive, all the more so since they didn't include even one drink in the price. When I went to buy a glass of white wine they told us they only sold it by the bottle (????) so we both ended up having a glass of rum punch that nearly had us on our backsides!!! After that we stuck to water! She was telling me re her ex-boyfriend that she had recently sent him a \"cease and desist\" letter, which he probably received that very day, as he has been pestering the life out of her since she split from him, calling, showing up at her house and begging her to come back. She said it's funny how he was a miserable sod for three years and tighter than a duck's bum and now all of a sudden he can't do enough for her and wants only to lavish money on her!! In any case she told him to get lost and if he doesn't leave her alone she will take it further. Crikey, all that drama at 72!!! I don't do \"drama\" so I'm so glad I'm not in that situation. Maybe it'll be one of the requirements of the French citizenship aptitude test - how to throw a wobbly à la française! If so I'll have to practice! At about 11.30 it had turned into a blaring disco with strobe lights so I told her I was getting a headache (I wasn't but couldn't stand much more of it) and that I was going to leave. She agreed with me and we decided to leave at the same time but in the end I don't really regret going. If you don't try these things out you'll never know if they are good or bad will you! On the negative side, in order to make it on time to this do I missed the last five minutes of the England/Wales rugby match and it would seem that Wales managed to score two tries in those five minutes and I missed it!!! What a bummer! Just as I was leaving though she asked me if I skied. When I told her I didn't do cross country she said \"no, downhill\". Now I haven't done that for about 20 years but she asked if I wanted to go one afternoon when the weather is fine and we could try out a few easy slopes. So I guess it looks like I might be scratching around in my cantina some more looking for my ski gear very soon!Typical dancers from the Island of RéunionAnd finally I had the weirdest dream this morning just before I woke up. I used to get awful nightmares about being stuck in a maze or down a diamond mine when I was married (no prizes for guessing what they meant), or not being able to wash myself clean for some reason (again, no prizes), but all those kinds of dreams stopped after my divorce (and yet again, no prizes). But this dream had me sitting next to Boris Johnson (seriously????) while he was driving a bus through a tunnel (I do hope that's not a euphemism) and I had to keep telling him he was going over the central line or he was too close to the wall. What on earth was that all about? I wonder if that means ol' Bojo will soon be driving the country into a brick wall? Sadly I'm afraid that might be true if my dreams are anything to go by!"},
{"title": "Lazy days!", "date": "Monday 2 March 2020", "text": "Cor blimey the weather is bloody miserable at the moment. Weirdly miserable, like a glorious sunny morning and then pelting down rain, but then I guess it is only the beginning of March isn't it! Beginning of March!!!! Good Lord, where have the weeks gone? It seems like only yesterday it was Christmas doesn't it! So what's new? Not a lot really, I suppose.As today was a day for doing not much of anything, I was sitting on the sofa in my tv room reading when (yet another) overhead light blew. I have eight inset lights in that room and by the time this latest one went that made four out of commission so I reckoned I had better get the step ladder out and start \"fixin'\"! When I pulled the fittings down I got absolutely dumped on by a pile of par-grilled dead bugs (wasps mainly) stuck in and around the inner light fittings. Lovely! I reckoned those bugs were what was giving off the occasional burning \"whiff\", but when I pulled out one of the fittings it turns out the transformer was quite severely burned also! So I went to the DIY store for a new transformer and when the lady looked at my burnt-out one she said \"I\" (as if I had installed them) had been using too powerful lightbulbs (i.e. over 60w), which was too powerful for the transformer, hence it burned out rather than starting a fire!!! Yikes! Anyway, my ex husband's personal philosophy seems to have been \"why buy one when you can buy 100 - and you can worry about where you store them later\", so while I had tons of the appropriate light bulbs I had to look through them all to find replacement bulbs which were less powerful than 60w. In the end I got five of the six bulbs replaced and reinstalled into the ceiling. I couldn't do the last one as it is over the stairwell and there's no way I could get up there, but at least it's slightly lighter to read by now!Anyway, while I was sitting there reading up on French kings and current Ministers (oh joy of joys) I heard a tremendous, metallic bang, followed a couple of minutes later by another one. So I went out onto my external balcony to find it covered with about 50 large white feathers - and a long trail of blood and guts. I reckon a kestrel must have taken a fancy to a smaller bird which happened to be sitting on my balcony, and the \"bang\" was the result of the ensuing fight for life. I never found a body so I'm assuming the kestrel won. So now I just have to wipe up the blood and guts. And they say a woman's work is never done right!On Saturday night, instead of our usual board game evening 11 of us decided to go to an Escape Room near here. Six of us took on the Flying Dutchman enigma and it was pretty good - my first ever attempt. I'm not very good as I really didn't know what to expect but between us we managed to guess all the clues and were able to deliver the golden skull back to Captain Davy Jones!The Flying DutchmanThe other five managed to complete a trickier enigma called Arkham, after which we all met up in the main hall. They had it set up pretty nice in that they had board games we could play while we were sitting there having a drink and snacks, before heading just up the road for Asian food at a new-to-me restaurant, and very nice it was too!Then on Sunday I went to see Judy with my lovely (non-flying) Dutchman. I've always liked Renée Zellwegger as she really can act (I mean, who wouldn't fall in love with Bridget Jones, right)! She also did an amazing job of transforming herself physically into Judy Garland, with all the mannerisms and gestures. I thought she was wonderful. Towards the end I looked at the Dutchman and his eyes were \"leaking\" profusely! Soppy ol' sod, but at least he enjoyed it. It was odd though because Judy has only just come out over here and I would say the cinema was only about one-quarter full - a consequence, no doubt, of concerns about the coronavirus. Scary stuff, not so much the virus itself, but seeing the effect it seems to be having on businesses and, indeed, the stock market and how it's all interconnected!Renée Zellweger as JudyAnd finally, I was sorry to learn this morning that \"Mayor Pete\" has dropped out of the race to be the Democratic nominee in the US - but I think it was the right thing to do. The Dems all need to get behind one candidate if they are to have a chance to take down Trump! It'd be nice to see him as VP candidate though - a class act indeed, and I suspect not the last we'll be seeing of Mayor Pete!"},
{"title": "Just an ordinary week!", "date": "Friday 28 February 2020", "text": "I made it to yoga on Monday even though my legs and backside were killing me from our hike the previous day. When I told our teacher about all my aches and pains she said \"oh you'll just love today's class then\", so that was encouraging at least. She explained that in yogic beliefs winter is the season of descending energy, just as the sap in trees and plants descends back into the earth for the winter. Right now we're in the \"between seasons\" period and she was explaining that the body stores water during the winter (for whatever reason) and today we would be doing exercises, torsions more specifically, that would help the body \"wring out\" that water like a sponge, ready for the ascending energy of spring. I'm all for being wrung out like a sponge as I've always felt I suffer from water retention to a certain extent, and can easily go up or down 2-3 lbs in weight overnight! In fact I have indeed lost four lbs since Monday so maybe those exercises really did help huh. Either way, they certainly felt good! And I took the bull by the horns after my class and decided to go out walking to take advantage of the continuing good weather! I also did a one-hour walk today as I'm trying to keep up on my \"1,000 Miles in 2020\"  challenge, and while I'm not going to break any records (I most likely won't even make the challenge), so far I've walked 281 km, or 175 miles since 2 January and I'm pretty pleased with that!So what else is new? Oh yes, my foray into kombucha-making was a complete disaster. I waited out the required four weeks for my scoby (my baby) to develop in my darkened spare bedroom but when I finally took a look at it there was no way I was gonna use that stuff to make kombucha. It was supposed to look like a kinda \"slimey mess\" - you know, like you might find in vinegar that has turned slightly - but this was more green and mouldy-looking so I thought I'd better give a brush with botulism a miss and threw it away. So it's back to the drawing board on that one then! Or else, I think I might just stick with buying it at the health food store!Then on Tuesday I noticed that our new neighbours opposite were having their roof treated so I wandered over to talk to the workmen as I think my own roof could do with a de-mossing and restorative treatment (it was done eight years ago). So long story short, I'm now signed up to have my roof done in March (the cleaning and tile-repair part) and then a \"sealant\" applied four weeks later. It's all money of course but I need to keep up with these things for my own comfort and to protect my investment anyway!I also learned this week that the French will be changing some of the requirements for requesting French citizenship as from 1 April. Right now anyone 60 or over (so that's me then) does not have to sit a written French exam (I'm not sure why they figured we old foggies didn't need this but …). Now under the new requirements everyone has to sit a 90 minute written French test, regardless of age. I can't say I was overly thrilled, even though the test doesn't worry me, but it's just one more hoop to jump through in a long list of other hoops, so I'm starting to feel a bit like a circus animal. And, if I get my initial appointment within the one year time-frame as indicated (that would give me an appointment in July), I need to get this test beforehand!! With that in mind, I went on the French Government website last night and found four or five test centres in this area and booked the first spot available to me on 16 April. So I decided to knuckle down last night and sit a previous exam paper and it was ok to be honest. I got 99% thankfully, but I'm just going to keep taking these tests so I will be up to speed when the test comes around. Frankly, I'd rather do this test than try to learn all about the kings of France but what I want is neither here nor there in the end is it! I also spent an hour tonight putting away all my paperwork as I had it spread out all over the bed in the spare room. In the end I just thought to heck with this, I know where it all is when needed. I also read in the paper today that all the EU countries are going to issue qualifying expat Brits (that would be me) with a special ID card recognizing us as \"third country nationals\" with the right to live in our chosen country, but specifically mentioning Article 50 of the (Brexit) Withdrawal Agreement. So onwards and upwards it is then!Tomorrow night, instead of our usual board game evening, our group has decided to go play a couple of Escape Rooms right near the Swiss border. I'm looking forward to it as I've never played an Escape Room (I suspect I won't be very good at it - well I certainly wasn't when we went on our Sherlock Homes \"Whodunnit\" day out a couple of months back)! Then on Sunday I'm finally going to see \"Judy\" with my friend. It's only just come out over here as they wait until the dubbed French version is ready before they bring it out for public viewing (although we'll be going to see it in English of course)! I'm looking forward to that too!On Wednesday we got our first real snow of the season, but even that didn't last long, oddly enough. But it would have to be the day I had to go pick the kids up from the airport after their trip to Pittsburgh wouldn't it. No snow all season so far and yet on Wednesday they were calling for five inches!!! So I decided to go use the gym at work and then head out to IKEA after having the inspired thought that I could spend a couple of hours in IKEA (I'd been wanting to go for a while) and hang around there until the kids arrived as it is only five minutes from the airport. And that's what I did (in addition to buying lovely new bedding and a couple of rugs I'd been after). You know, IKEA's quite nice if you can go when there are no crowds, but finding your way out of that place is (deliberately) also a bit of an Escape Room challenge in itself!!The kids made it back with no hiccups thankfully. The return Pittsburgh/London flight was only five and a half hours, as opposed to eight hours on the way out, so that must have been quite a tail wind don't you think! They had a great time and everyone made a big fuss of Jen being French and her cute accent (including the very friendly immigration officer). Well everyone except my ex's gf it would seem. Sadly there's no love lost between my kids and their wives and the gf as they think she's weird. My family also felt the same way about her at both weddings, to be honest. My feeling was she was ok if she was the centre of attention all the time but if not, forget it. I mean come on, she's 57, but hey, what can I say, I don't have to live with her! Anyway, the kids had a great time with the ex and his family and even though the gf didn't make them particularly welcome they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Or maybe, as they said, they actually enjoyed themselves all the more so since the gf never went with them when they went out! Oh well. Grandma was all \"I love ya hon\" and hugging them, so I'm glad they got to see her. I had made sloppy joes and bought bread to take over to their place for their first night back but Jen said all they wanted to eat was salad. No more pizza, hamburgers or hot dogs. They wanted salad! That's not a reflection on the ex's family as grandma is a good cook (as is my ex), but I guess there wasn't an awful lot of cooking going on last week.Then they were telling me the stuff they'd bought in the US. Not everything was cheaper but they got some good deals with the US$ being so weak against the euro. I mentioned to them afterwards did they realize that there are $$$$$ limits to how much you can bring back without declaring it at customs, but they both just shrugged. Not that they were buying Rolex watches of course, just a few pairs of jeans and a couple of jackets, but I suppose technically they might have been over the $$ limit, but who knows!And that brings to mind a story of my lovely friend, Joyce, now sadly deceased. I must write some of my \"Joycey\" stories sometime as she was a great friend, a lovely person, and an absolute blast! But that'll have to wait till some other time I think. Anyway, many years ago, before there was free movement of goods and people between France and Switzerland, there was, indeed, a limit to the monetary value of merchandise that could be bought in one country and taken back to the other. I think at one time it was 200 Swiss francs, so the Swiss who went into France grocery shopping (because it's cheaper) would pile all the family into the car in order to get the higher allowances. Even then, there were still restrictions on how much cheese, meat and alcohol they could bring back into Switzerland regardless of the cost. Anyway, Joyce would quite often go clothes shopping in Switzerland during her lunch break and take the (undeclared) clothes back home with her to France in the evening. One time after another shopping trip I asked if she wasn't afraid of getting stopped at the French border on her way home. At that she just opened up her raincoat like some ol' flasher and stood there wearing just her underwear underneath! Yep, she used to come in to work with just her underwear under her coat (her husband must have thought he was going to get very lucky at work on those days) and then cut the tags off the clothes and wear them home again in the evening. Or she would keep old dry cleaning bags and take them back home that way. I mean, it wasn't exactly hard-core smuggling but when I asked her if she was ever afraid of getting stopped at the Swiss border coming in to work in her underwear she just laughed. She was such a cracking looking woman in her younger days I'm sure the Swiss border guard would have come over all \"unnecessary\" if he had rumbled her! God love ya Joyce. I still miss her so much even now so many years later!"},
{"title": "I'm exhausted!", "date": "Sunday 23 February 2020", "text": "I didn't do very well with my walking last week, which was pretty pathetic really because the weather was nice and I really have no excuse (although, believe me, I'm still trying to think of one). I just felt kind of lazy so I guess you have to go with the flow don't you. Our Italian teacher has been off sick for the last month so I decided to check with the community centre to see if she was back on Wednesday as I wanted to get her some flowers as a \"get well soon\" gift. While I was choosing the flowers I saw the florist had some pretty red tulips in a bag with hearts on so asked if she had any other kind of container as these were obviously leftovers from Valentine's Day. When she said she didn't have anything else she told me just to take them as they were right on the limit anyway and I could have them for free! Nice huh! I didn't give these to my Italian teacher of course (I bought her a lovely bouquet of dried flowers), but it was a really nice gesture on the part of the florist I thought!After leaving the florist's I decided I really needed to get some walking in so crossed the road to walk in a little park I had spotted some time ago but had never got round to visiting. It was small - seriously, you could walk round that park with a broken leg in about 10 minutes, but at least I got a few laps in and very pretty it was too!Using an old ski lift as a book exchange - neat huh!Then today three of us decided to go off in search of the newly-completed 7 km addition to the cycle path near Talloires on Lake Annecy, mainly because the weather was glorious and I believe it has forecast snow come Wednesday. So off we shot and since we really had no idea where to find this cycle path we decided instead to head up to see if we could find the waterfall known as the Cascade d'Angon. Well we found it all right but somehow managed to find the \"scenic\" (read \"vertical\") route rather than the easy route. I tell ya, the first couple of km really were vertical and tough going, although if you take it easy and go at your own speed anything is possible really isn't it. Well we made it to the top of the climb into a pasture, then up further to a road, which lead back down towards the path to the waterfall. It was quite slippy going down to the fall but there were barriers and it really was definitely worth the effort.The first part of our climb up above Lake AnnecyStill climbingThis has got to be the most perfect spot for a picnic!The little kids in the picture above had to stop every so often and have a drink of \"magic potion\" to help them up the mountain - turns out it was fruit tea (but it obviously did the trick)!The barriers leading to the waterfallThe \"slippy\" bit!The narrow walk around to the bigger part of the waterfallBy the time we got back down I had clocked up 19,750 very tortuous steps and 15.83 km (or just under 10 miles) but boy were we tired. So we spent the next hour over a lovely glass of cold cider while our muscles started to seize up a treat! I'm so glad I've got yoga tomorrow!And here's a tip for the uninitiated:Do you think this was why I was invited?And can you believe this weather! That is snow on the mountains in the background and these lads are going swimming in the lake. Now admittedly they didn't stay in long and that huge bottle of Ricard may have had something to do with their decision, but crikey, they're braver (or maybe just dafter?) than I am!\"Dutch courage\"?"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 19 February 2020", "text": "Jen sent me a quick message yesterday to say they'd made it to the gate and were on their way to the States (finally)! I picked them up at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning and they made it to Pittsburgh at 2.30 a.m. this morning (Wednesday) so a total of three days in the same clothes (nice), but at least they bought toiletries and other \"essentials\" at the airport before they left for the hotel. Then Jordan sent me a message this morning to say that their baggage had left on the original, Sunday afternoon flight. That's a huge no-no to have luggage travelling without its owners but what can I say! It was chaos and things happen but at least their luggage made it, even if it was 48 hours before they did. Told Jordan at least he has a clean change of boxers now!Day 3 of being on the road!I was talking to my sister yesterday about their travel saga and about the new flooding in the Hereford/Worcester area (near where we grew up). It floods in that area pretty much every year because of the large rivers, but I understand this time it is the worst flooding on record! While obviously people's homes getting flooded is much more devastating, it just breaks my heart to hear of some of the beautiful, historic buildings being damaged also. And totally irrelevant to anyone's safety or livelihood, she told me that the old Miners' Bridge in Betws-y-Coed (the village where my mom grew up) had been washed away!! This bridge was built many hundreds of years ago and was used by miners ferrying stone from the quarry in the woods, hence its name. Like I say, it had no real \"value\" except as a tourist attraction but we were both saying how sorry we were to see it gone as it was such a magical spot with great memories of where we used to play as kids when we stayed with family in North Wales.The Black and White Museum, HerefordMiners' Bridge, Betws-y-CoedAnyway, where was I? Oh yes, on Sunday, after I dropped the kids off at the airport, I met up with my friend for a coffee. Municipal elections will be taking place here in a couple of weeks so different parties were handing out flyers outside the coffee shop. When the guy offered me a flyer I just said no thank you (in French) and then he said something back in English. So ole Dutchy says words to the effect that \"we speak French, what's your problem?\" (ok, maybe not quite as rude as that but you get the gist) and I was furious with him. \"Why do you have to be so rude\"? Well actually he knows it irritates me and sometimes does this kind of thing to wind me up. But he said that people switching languages on him drives him nuts, even to the point that sometimes when he goes to Holland he will speak in Dutch (of course) and it really irritates him when they reply in English. So I said maybe they just want to practice their English, but he would have none of it. Then inside the coffee shop there was an incident with an old guy who brought his dog into the café and the waitress asked him twice to take it outside as dogs were not allowed. So Dutchy makes some comment and there were a couple of small \"digs\" going back and forth between Dutchy and the dog owner and I just hate it! In the end I told him that what really annoys me is that his English is so perfect and his accent so bloody posh that everyone thinks he's English and we get the blame for being miserable sods when it's nothing to do with us! And with that he just laughed at me (the sod)!Which brings me back to another gem many moons ago. We had taken the kids on a fairly last-minute trip to Cyprus at Easter one year and my ex and I got friendly with a British-Indian couple called Jaz and Mandy. One night they were having a karaoke session in the hotel (oh horror of horrors), and this British couple got up to sing \"The Only Way Is Up\" - or at least I think that's what it was. I couldn't be sure though because they were terrible! Totally out of tune and everyone was either roaring laughing at them or egging them on. And they looked so British too - you know, the guy in the string vest, shorts, brown socks (seriously) and sandals. They were just excruciating. Jaz looked at me at one point and said \"are you just wishing the ground would swallow you up too?\" and I just nodded. But the soul-destroying thing about the whole event (as we found out afterwards) was that those embarrassing \"Brits\" turned out to be Kiwis, and short of running round with a foghorn shouting \"they're not Brits, they're Kiwis\" Jaz and I couldn't see any other way around taking the blame for being embarrassing Brits abroad - so we decided to head off to the bar to drown out our abject humiliation! That sorta worked!The Brits abroad - note the socks and the hanky!This one I'm happy to claim - Mr. Bean - comedy genius!And finally, yesterday would have been my dad's 100th birthday had he lived that long. When someone is in their 90s, for me at least, it's still somehow real, but thinking that dad would have been 100 just blows my mind. My sister said the same thing. Gosh they lived to see some things in their lifetimes didn't they!The family - late 1950s/early 1960s - I'm the babe in arms!Ted (dad) as a young man!My wedding. Dad didn't quite make it to 100 and my marriage didn't quite make it to 30 years but hey ho!"},
{"title": "Oofff - sorted!", "date": "Monday 17 February 2020", "text": "I got a message from Jordan at 2.30 a.m. this morning to say that they had finally made it to the front of the queue at the British Airways service desk and they had provided them with a voucher for a room for the night at the Premier Inn and breakfast! They didn't have their luggage but were just glad to finally get a room and a few hours rest after such a long and stressful day. So I could finally relax a bit once I knew they were sorted. I knew I wasn't going to sleep anyway until then because I was more worried in case they didn't have a \"decent\" credit card than anything, but with BA paying for their overnighter there was less to worry about and I could finally go to bed!Turns out that the big problem at Heathrow was that all the computers went down because of the storm. People couldn't use electronic tickets, although Jordan and Jen had printed theirs also, but the information boards indicating which gates people should go to were also down (which is why they missed their flight) and ground staff ended up having to write boarding gate info on white boards - but by this time it was too late for them as their flight had already left!They called me this morning while they were having breakfast (put a \"full English\" in front of those two and they are happy) and told me they had to go back to the airport to sort out rebooking their ongoing flights - and this was the queue waiting patiently to get to the British Airways information desk when they arrived!Still, within a couple of hours they got to the front of the queue and while BA could get them out today they could only get them as far as New York or Chicago and would not be responsible for onward flights to Pittsburgh, so the kids decided to opt for the direct flight tomorrow (Tuesday) in order not to have connecting flight worries again. That has meant spending another night at the hotel - which they were okay with - and even though central London is only 45 minutes away by train they decided to give it a miss and just \"chill\" around the village where the hotel is located as they were both tired. So they're now all checked in for their flights tomorrow (although I'm not quite sure where their luggage is), and will hopefully get a good night's sleep tonight.I've been watching the news a lot today too and Storm Dennis coming hot on the heels of Storm Ciara, the UK has been pretty battered, with severe flooding now also hitting the more central areas. I feel so bad for those affected because even though they have put in flood defences, the incredible amount of rainfall hitting the UK in the last week has meant that so many of those flood defences have been breached! What a nightmare!This video of an Etihad flight landing at Heathrow this weekend is doing the rounds at the moment and my God, if I ever end up flying Etihad I want this pilot. He landed that thing sideways!!!!!!My ex phoned me a short while ago to make sure I was up to speed with the kids as I had been out this evening. He was saying that while February isn't the ideal time for a visit to Pittsburgh they have enough things in mind to keep the kids entertained. Amme (grandma) doesn't know the kids are going so my ex is having \"everyone\" over for dinner on Wednesday night in order to spring the surprise on her (she hasn't seen Jordan in seven years)! I can just picture it now. She is a great story teller but by golly she goes round the Wrekin with her stories, so when I saw this picture below, if you change \"how I tell a story\" to \"how Amme tells a story\" you'll get an idea of what Jordan and Jen are in for!And finally I haven't got much walking in in the last week, more out of laziness than anything as the weather, up until now, has been pretty good. But I have to say some of the people on the \"1,000 Miles in 2020\" walking group are really funny. One lady posted the picture below during Storm Dennis with the caption saying \"hubby asked me if I wanted to get down and dirty\"!!! She said she lived in hope ..."},
{"title": "What a bloody mess!", "date": "Sunday 16 February 2020", "text": "Well storm Dennis rolled in to the UK this weekend and I was kinda hoping it would have calmed down a bit by the time the kids were due to fly. After a few nail-biting moments their flight to London took off just 30 minutes late and they arrived at Heathrow Airport three hours ahead of time for their ongoing flight to Pittsburgh. So they sat there, and sat there and sat there waiting for their gate number to be called … and nothing happened. I kept checking with Heathrow's website (which suddenly started saying \"gate closed\") and British Airways' website (which then stated that the flight had left 30 minutes ago!!!!)  Say what????? I got in touch with Jordan and he was getting all the same info his end. Trouble is, Jen was very worked up and in floods of tears because she doesn't speak English, and then she started worrying about money because \"they can't afford to be rebooking flights and hotels and so on\"! And Jordan wasn't exactly brimming with confidence either because the whole airport was a bloody mess, the computer systems being down because of the storm and loads of flights delayed or cancelled!I told him first thing to do was get some cash - say £100 - just so that they had a few GB£ on them and not just euros or Swissies. Then go and buy drinks, sandwiches and maybe soap, toothbrush and so on, because there is a good chance everything would close down and they would end up high and dry with nothing to eat and feeling decidedly smelly and dirty. After that they headed over to queue up at the BA information desk, where they were told to go to Gate A9 - but at Gate A9 they were just booking hotels or doing paperwork for people who had had enough and were giving up and going home - not an option for Jordan and Jen obviously as they needed someone to let them know about rebooking flights or other alternatives! I called a little later and as it stands now they have to go back out through customs/passport control and into the public area as Terminal 5 is closing down, and then they have to hook up to a BA site to see if the proposed alternative flights are acceptable to them. Who knows what BA will offer them but I doubt they'll be going anywhere tonight. If they decide they just want to jack it all in and forget about the States they'll have to track their baggage down and make alternative arrangements. Jen was saying she just wants to come back to Geneva. Good luck with that. EasyJet cancelled loads of \"skiing/Geneva\" flights yesterday because of the storm, as did other airlines, so I doubt they'll be getting back to Geneva anytime soon as the people bumped from yesterday's flights have to be accommodated first!So I've been in touch with my sister and I can get them on one of several buses to her in Dorset any time tomorrow and have found a couple of hotels within a few miles of Heathrow if they decide they want to give up on the idea of going to Pittsburgh. I also told them not to waste time (or more importantly their phone batteries) calling my ex as I will keep everyone informed, although thankfully they both have their mobile phone chargers with them. What a bloody mess. My sister told me it's just been on the news that all the computers were down at Heathrow so everyone will be in the same boat I guess. I know they're adults and Jordan, at least, speaks English but neither of them knows much about the UK and what's what, to be honest, and so are pretty out of their depth in how to deal with this. I have no doubt they would be much more confident sorting themselves out in, say, Geneva or Paris, but London/the UK is a whole new ballgame for both of them!The only other thing I told them was to stay cool, and to be civil to the poor sods on the service desks because it's nobody's fault and these people will be just trying to do their best to get everyone sorted. Trying to find the positives, I told them to be thankful that this happened in England because at least we Brits queue and are pretty stoic in a crisis, for the most part. It could also be worse as they could be travelling with young children or elderly relatives. So I reckon they are in for an uncomfortable night either way, and I'm probably going to be awake most of the night, credit card to hand, just in case. Happy days then!Taken at Birmingham Airport I thinkFlooding in South Wales"},
{"title": "Tulips from Amsterdam!", "date": "Wednesday 12 February 2020", "text": "That was the title of an old Max Bygraves song - I suppose \"Tulips from Keukenhof\" doesn't have the same ring to it does it! But who cares anyway 'cos guess who's going to Holland in April to see the tulips. Yes me!!! The company that my friend and I have done quite a few trips with put out their 2020 programme at the end of November and the \"tulip\" trip was on it. So at the beginning of January we stopped in to see them and reserve and the darn thing was already fully booked! In fact, it had sold out within a couple of days and even though they could easily sell out a second trip they had no plans to do so apparently. Well that is until today when we received an email saying they were doing a second five-night trip in April and were we interested? My friend saw it before I did so jumped right in and reserved by phone, telling them we would be there by Monday to confirm, so we're now going and I'm delighted. We could have booked something ourselves actually by flying to Amsterdam and booking something that end but as my friend pointed out, there was quite a lot else going on on this trip so we didn't want to take planning our own trip any further and end up disappointed. From what I can remember there are a couple of river cruises, a night in Amsterdam, a visit to the diamond quarter and a trip to Keukenhof towards the end of the trip.Keukenhof GardensActually I'm just as excited about visiting Amsterdam as I am to see Keukenhof so I really am pleased that they decided to put on a second trip!After stopping in at work to use the gym I had a drink with my friend tonight and was excitedly telling him about my trip and how we would also get to see the town of Gouda - which is apparently very beautiful, in addition to being the home of the famous cheese of the same name. So then he got all Smart-Aleky and decided to correct my pronunciation to something that sounded like \"Xhouda\", Ha ha, what a joke. I told him that if I pronounced it \"his\" way people would either think I was choking or I'd gone off my head and booked a trip to China, despite all the coronavirus warnings! So my way it'll be for the time being! Actually that makes me think of the time I had a Finnish colleague whose name was \"Tuire\" and if I said her name my way everyone knew who I was talking about, but if she said her name the correct way, nobody knew who was on the end of the phone!So what else is new? Not a lot really. I felt like a pregnant two-ton hippo at yoga on Monday (and had about as much grace) and when I came home I lay on the sofa and fell asleep for two hours. What the flip! And I knew I would have no problem sleeping that night either - indeed I slept about nine hours! But I hate it when I feel like that - like I could just nod off at the drop of a hat, and I can only put it down to the vagaries of the weather. Up one minute and down the next. I wasn't particularly looking forward to yoga on Tuesday either for that very reason but by gosh I'm glad I went. We again worked on the \"Salutation to the moon\" and I as much as I don't enjoy the \"Salutation to the sun\", this sequence is just great. It seems to work every muscle in your body giving a great workout, a fact that all the ladies I spoke to afterwards seemed to agree with. More to the point, I felt all my energy coming back after that session and no longer had any desire to nod off all the time so maybe there really is something to this \"yoga thangy\"!Then on Friday of last week I met up with a very old friend, G, who I met the first day I arrived in Geneva. Our employer had put us up in the same B & B on our first night and we hit it off immediately. We ended up renting a studio together in central Geneva on a month-by-month basis while looking around for a place of our own and it worked out really well. We still laugh, though, when we remember the day we realized what was going on with the dirty old sod in the apartment opposite. We would dash home after work each night, jump into the shower and then get dressed up for a night on the town. In fact I don't remember ever staying in one single night as a singleton - so for five entire years I was out every night of the week!!! Anyway, one time in autumn or maybe winter (sometime when it was starting to get darker earlier) we had the light on as we were getting changed and it was then that we realized the dirty old sod opposite was always out on his balcony when we got home - looking in through the flimsy net curtains, the dirty perv! As soon as we realized what was going on we started getting changed in the bathroom and \"Merv the Perv\" no longer seemed to feel the need to get a breath of fresh air on his balcony every night, although I do remember him saying \"bonjour\" to me one day as I was walking out the apartment and wondering who the hell he was (I obviously didn't recognize him when he wasn't standing on his balcony in his underpants with a massive erection)! I remember one time, too, that G was away travelling with her parents and there was a knock at the door around 1 a.m. I was alone and thought \"who the hell comes knocking at 1 a.m.?\" and when I looked through the peephole the apartment manager was standing there all dressed up in his Sunday best! Now I knew we were up-to-date with the rent and there was never any noise coming from our place so there was no way I was going to open the door to him at that time of the morning. He obviously had a key anyway so I moved a big table from the middle of the room and wedged it against the door. Thankfully nothing further came of it but I have to admit I was glad to get out of there after a few months when we each got our own place. It was in central Geneva and wonderfully located, both for work and for night life, but it was also in the prostitute area and while I never felt threatened I did get propositioned a couple of times. It was funny because the first time mom and dad came out to stay with me while G was away, we were walking down the road and my dad said \"ooohhh there's a lot of people out tonight aren't there\", so I asked him if had noticed how many of them were sitting on the hoods of cars, and he just looked at me with a kind of rictus grin as the realization set in!!G and I were also at our first staff Christmas party when this charming older gent came over with a glass of wine in his hand and asked us where we worked. I said in Division X and she said in Division Y and then she asked him where he worked - and he said \"in the Director-General's office\". After he left I nudged her in the ribs and said \"that's the new DG\", and she almost fainted, with visions of her contract renewal floating away before her eyes I imagine! Not that anything of the sort happened. The man was an absolute gent and had the most wonderful sense of humour, as you can probably tell (may God rest his soul)!Anyway, on Friday we met up for lunch in a wonderful Indian restaurant near her place. I haven't eaten Indian food in ages so it was a real treat, with excellent food in beautiful surroundings.The RajpouteG spent some time telling me about her recent interview for French citizenship and while there were, indeed, questions about French history and politics, etc. she said they were more interested in whether or not she had assimilated into the local French community (she has, very much so)! So she told me to make sure I took a screen shot of the web site which shows me as being the Présidente of the sewing club (daft as it sounds) because that proves I'm willing to get involved in local activities. She said also to show proof of all the different courses (yoga, pilates, Italian) that I'm taking locally, as opposed to in Switzerland, so I guess signing up for all those things wasn't such a bad idea after all!And then, as we always do, we got to reminiscing, and despite the fact that she left my employer and went to work at the World Health Organization after a couple of years and we didn't see so much of each other, in May it will be 40 years since the day we first met and yet we still have so much to reminisce about. I know I always do it but I had to bring up the time she decided to repaint her bathroom. It was a long weekend and really hot and she got it in her head that her bathroom needed repainting. So she got herself all kitted out, took the handles off the door so it would be easier to paint, and then decided that it was waaayyy too hot for overalls so she took that off too and started painting in just her underwear. Except, of course, when she shut the door to paint it she realized too late that having taken the handle off she couldn't get the door open again and was now effectively stuck in the bathroom! So she started frantically tapping on the piping and yelling to her downstairs neighbour, but being a long weekend, this particular neighbour had gone away. In the end she managed to get another neighbour to realize that there was a problem and asked her to call her landlord. The initial problem was compounded, of course, by the fact that her key was on the inside of the door and the landlord couldn't get in, so he ended up basically rappelling from an upper balcony into her apartment to let her out of the bathroom - in all her glory, covered in paint and wearing only her bra and pants!!! I told her she was going to make it on to my blog someday but promised I'd keep her anonymous, so G, there you have it! Fame at last!We then got to talking about the various trips we had planned (none for me at that point). She likes to travel alone as she likes to do her own thing, whereas I am happy to travel without knowing anyone but I don't like to be completely alone. So then she brought up our long weekend in Madrid the first Easter after we arrived in Geneva. G is very artistic and creative and was determined to visit the Prado while we were there. Me? Not so much! I like natural history but art? Nope, not for me (I know, I know, I'm a pleb). Anyway, we legged it over to the Prado and glory of glories, it is closed on only two days of the year - Good Friday and Christmas Day and \"today\" was Good Friday! Now it's very hard to fake disappointment when you're secretly thanking God that it's closed but I did try very hard. Still, my luck could only give out the next day so off we trecked back over there and this time, of course, it was open. I'll never get how people can spend hours wandering round these places looking at the paintings - it really isn't me - so after an hour I couldn't fake it any more and told her I'd meet her at the café in the park opposite and to take as long as she wanted. So we both ended up happy in the end - she got the Prado and I got white wine and tortilla!The PradoShe told me she knew I wasn't enjoying it when she took a photo of me inside the Prado leaning on a wall yawning with my arms folded! The next day she wanted to visit a Cezanne exhibition (I probably would have held on a little longer if we had started with that one) but I just told her to enjoy herself and I'd meet up with her a few hours later, which was what we did. Talk about the Odd Couple - but I suppose that might be why 40 years later we're still good friends. Who knows (although I'm obviously Walter Matthau)!Picture courtesy of Film Art Gallery"},
{"title": "Well that was embarrassing!", "date": "Saturday 8 February 2020", "text": "As we were driving back from yoga on Tuesday my neighbour said \"oh, I've got big news for you, M (her daughter) and B (her British boyfriend) are getting married on Saturday in Geneva\"! It wasn't as big a surprise as it might have been as they were engaged anyway and looking to get the paperwork completed in France, but since B still has his name on the lease for his apartment in Switzerland until the end of the month they were able to get accepted at the Mairie in Geneva where an available time slot came around quicker than they anticipated, so they had to rush and get everything sorted in time for a civil wedding today. It wasn't a big wedding - just immediate family - but they looked lovely. After the wedding they drove up the mountains near me for a fondue and my neighbour asked me to come back to their place afterwards for a celebratory drink. Actually they were lucky to get up the gorge for lunch because I saw on FB this morning that access was pretty much at a standstill (it leads to two of the bigger ski resorts round here). Initially it was blocked with people heading out to ski - locals, I guess, because the big ski vacations for the schools don't start until next week - but I just heard from a friend that there was also a horrible accident on the way up there too. It's a narrow winding mountain pass up through the gorge with steep drops on the one side. Apparently a car was involved in a fairly minor collision with a truck and one of the passengers jumped over the retaining wall to in order to get off the road and out of the way of the traffic but didn't realize there was a horrendous drop on the other side of the wall. It's not as stupid as it sounds because there are trees right up against the wall and you could easily mistake it for flat ground behind. Anyway, the roads were blocked for several hours while the emergency services looked for the poor guy - who eventually turned up dead further downstream trapped under a rock in the river! Bloody hell, what an awful way to go!Anyway, since I was invited over later to have a drink with the newlyweds I dashed out as I wanted to buy a bottle of champagne to take with me. The supermarket was pretty busy unfortunately so as there was no line for \"10 articles or less\" I ended up standing in the line where priority is given to the disabled, elderly and pregnant women. Well the lady cashier at one point looked at the stomach of the woman in front of me and asked her if she was pregnant because if so she should jump to the head of the queue. Now this young woman did, indeed, look about seven months pregnant but the husband turned round and said \"no, those days are over for us\"! Ooops! I saw the cashier blush vividly and felt so sorry for her as she was only trying to help! Actually, I did the same thing with our banker too when we were going through the divorce. After we had finished our meeting I asked her when the baby was due and she said \"I'm not pregnant\"!!!! Never again! I will never say anything to a \"pregnant\" woman ever again. Better to just wait till the baby's born next time before opening my mouth I think!That being said, I can't really talk as my own belly isn't exactly J-Lo material and I reckon I haven't seen my toes (except at yoga) for a good while now. And this despite the fact that my weight goes up and down like a bride's nightie! On top of all the walking I've been doing I haven't had a drink for six weeks now so I kinda hoped some of it would come off but apparently sugar cravings seem to have kicked in so I guess that'll be the next thing I have to tackle! Gotta knock the chocolate on the head too I guess! Anyway, when I was buying the champagne I also picked up another bottle of kombucha as I'm going through it at a rate of knots at the moment. And talking of kombucha, my home brew seems to be coming along nicely at two weeks along - I've either got a very good base for my own kombucha or a severe case of botulism in the making looking at the mouldy stuff floating about in there. I guess only time will tell right!Anyway, getting back to next door's wedding, my neighbours said I could ride over with them because of limited parking space and the husband got chatting to me about his friend, Jo, who might also come if he could get back down the mountain from his shop in time. He has several shops that sell cheese and dried meats - upscale deli-type of thing, I guess. Anyway, M was telling me what a nice guy Jo is - I've met him a couple of times and he does indeed seem to be a nice chap. He's a widower but had been with someone for quite some time when she apparently ended it a couple of months ago. So my neighbour was saying how the gf will regret this as \"Jo is a lovely guy and has plenty of money\"!! His wife has also made a few comments about inviting me over to dinner at the same time as Jo, so trying to set me up or what? Now I have nothing against Jo - from the little I've seen of him he seems to be a genuinely nice guy - but what really riles me is that the husband has to mention how much money he's got. Is that what men really think? That women are only interested in them for their money? Or is that what women are really like? I don't know, but that's certainly not the case with me. I was actually pretty offended to think that Jo's having money (or otherwise) would be a factor in whether or not I was interested in the guy! Actually it doesn't rile me up, it makes my blood boil!!! I mentioned one time previously how the first guy I dated briefly after my husband left was a very wealthy Spanish lawyer and he offered to pay my mortgage off because \"I've given more money than that to the Prado\"! So I told him thanks very much but no thanks as you can't put a price on freedom and that I value more than anything in the world. Oddly enough that's probably why we remained on good terms even after we split up! But my neighbour trying to \"sell\" Jo to me really offended me. Am I being unreasonable here? Maybe trying to play matchmaker - no problem there - but please don't insult me with the money angle!It brought to mind a time when one of the local guys asked me if I would be interested in standing for the village council \"because we could do with another woman on the board\", and then realized I couldn't because I'm not French. And again I think \"what, do you want me to stand for the village council because you think I'm up to it or because I've got a pair of boobs\"? I don't know, maybe I'm just hormonal (ha) but I get really offended to be (a) treated like a pair of boobs or (b) treated like someone who would be interested in dating a man just because he has money! Now before anyone bursts a blood vessel I know there are plenty of women out there who do see men as a pocket book but I'm certainly not one of them. I have my own home and my own money - it's not a fortune but it's more than enough for my needs. What's more I didn't \"make out\" in the divorce either - quite the contrary actually, but what the hell, it was worth losing out on over $100,000 I had put into the house to begin with (as against his $0) to get my freedom (and I wasn't the one playing away from home, which brought about the divorce anyway). I don't know, maybe I'll say something to my neighbour the next time Jo comes up - or maybe I shouldn't. Am I being over sensitive? I'm not sure on that one!Anyway, on to less cerebral things! I was messing around on Google Earth yesterday and had great fun googling my address and seeing my house with my car in the driveway. So then I googled my ex mother-in-law's place and saw her car in her driveway too. It kinda made me a little sad as I have fond memories of both my mother-in-law and father-in-law in that house, and now pap is dead, amme (MIL) is old and I'm divorced from their son. I guess time moves on faster than we care to think doesn't it. So then I googled my ex's address in PA (I know, nosy cow aren't I, but he gave me the address) and it's a nice place he's got (although his windows could do with a good clean). But google earth is really something. So then I googled my address when I was growing up in Birmingham and see that the school that I attended, and which backed on to our back garden, is now huge - about three times what it was when I was there. Oh, and then I read that Birmingham City Council are trying to push through a motion to make all of the city centre a car-free zone! Wow! Good luck with that, I think it would be wonderful. In fact, as long as I can remember Birmingham's City Council has had a reputation for being very dynamic and forward thinking (probably something to do with all the ladies on the board - it's the boobs ya know) so I really hope this comes to pass. Not that it will affect me, of course, but good on them for giving it a shot!Spaghetti Junction, BirminghamThe above is a picture of Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham. I only ever drove round it a couple of times but I think I was about 18 when I got on those roads one time and about 21 by the time I found the right exit!In other news I've been slowly continuing my attempts to learn more about France in connection with my request for citizenship. There's a lot to learn but I honestly don't mind - I just have to park my bum and get down to it. But today at the drinks with the neighbours I asked them to name all the French presidents since the beginning of the Fifth Republic (established in 1958) and no-one could do it - so I'm pretty sure I'm on the right track then if the French don't even know the answers!And wrapping up, I see that Kirk Douglas has finally died at the grand old age of 103. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the man or his films. I don't have a lot of time for serial cheaters, but then I guess that was a matter between him and his wife wasn't it. Can't stand Michael either but … In any case, talk about having good genes though, with both him and his wife living in to their 100s and seemingly in reasonable health to boot. That is quite an achievement in this day and age isn't it! Not sure it's one I'd want to emulate but when you consider the alternative who knows!"},
{"title": "Progress!", "date": "Wednesday 5 February 2020", "text": "I think I'm starting to get the hang of this exercise business, well in as much as it seems to be growing on me and I don't actually hate it anymore. From my past experience with exercise I know that once I get on a roll I really begin to enjoy it eventually so I'm hoping I can keep going without anything putting the kibosh on my good intentions! And I really no longer have any excuse do I - no work, no kids, no husband! The biggest \"worry\" I have actually is the summer heat because I just hate it and want to crawl under a stone somewhere for at least six weeks - but we're not there yet are we!After yoga on Monday I decided to take myself off walking as the weather looked like it might be forgiving for a little while, which indeed it was. So I took a 90 minute walk along the river Arve at Thyez, but sticking to the paved trails as it had rained a lot over the weekend and everywhere was pretty muddy. Then on Tuesday I went to my second yoga lesson of the week with my neighbour and really enjoyed this session. We've been doing quite a lot of \"salutation to the sun\", which I don't particularly like, but on Tuesday she had us doing \"salutation to the moon\", which I found more enjoyable - although I ached like billyo afterwards. Seeing me getting out of bed this morning was pitiful! Still, those aches only last as long as it takes to warm up a little and then I feel great.Salutation to the moonI found the above on Pinterest, although there are different variations, but of course the only person who looked anything like those photos is our teacher!! Still, if at first you don't succeed … That being said, my Monday morning teacher must be in her mid-40s and looks around 10 years younger, and my Tuesday teacher, I reckon, is in her 50s and while facially I would say she looks her age, her body is incredible - all \"bendy\", slim and toned! They are both great adverts for yoga, I can tell you! On the drive home my neighbour was saying that after a week \"without\" she starts to get stiff and miserable so I asked how she thought she was going to feel when the classes shut down for the summer. To which she asked if I would be willing to have a go at doing a yoga session with her a couple of times a week during the summer break! My, haven't we come a long way! And to think this is the lady I had to nag for two years to join me and now she can't imagine not doing it anymore! To that end, I also can't imagine \"doing without\" as I feel so great when I get my full quota of four different classes in during the week so I'm wondering if I should sign up for a third yoga class next year. I'll have to think about that though, I guess, as my friend warned me about over-scheduling myself during my first couple of years as a retiree!I didn't go walking yesterday as we had our first snow fall of the year - can you believe that! Our first snow so late it's just unreal! And while it snowed fairly heavily in the afternoon and evening it was all gone this morning when I got up. I only hope the rain we had down here translated into snow up in the mountains as the skiing holidays are coming up shortly and this place will be heaving with kids on spring break! Anyway, I was feeling a bit lazy today and wasn't going to make the effort to get out walking but then I looked at my walking log for the year and realized I was so close to 100 miles in that I'd better get out there and start walking. So I went up behind the houses at the back of me and what I used to consider a complete walk took me just 45 minutes today (including uphill). Heck I must be a bloody wimp to have ever considered that strenuous, so I'm suspecting some progress is being made, however little! When I came to the end of that circuit I decided to head on out towards La Roche and added another hour to my walk and now, I'm delighted to say, I've hit 105 miles walked since 2 January. It isn't enormous by any means but it has all been \"conscious\" walking, spurred on by signing up to the FB challenge! And I'm loving it!When I got back I saw that I'd received an email from a lady who runs the kiddies' craft club in the community hall where we have our sewing club. It's called the Association des Associations and there are about 20 different clubs run by the commune of Amancy. Hiking, zumba, yoga, photography, sewing, choir, belote (card game) and so on, which is quite impressive for such a small village. Anyway, this lady had got my email address from the clubs' info sheet and asked if I would like some patchwork books for the club. It's actually a sewing club, not a patchwork club (I'm the only one that does patchwork because I can't sew), but one of the younger woman asked me on Monday night if I would help her start doing simple patchwork as she loves the stuff I'm making!!! Yikes, frankly I'm rubbish at patchwork and usually have to do work-arounds because I keep messing up, but what could I say! I told her that I was learning myself but I would be glad to help her if I could. So I ran down to the community centre tonight and the email lady handed me about 30 books on patchwork, all in French (mine are mostly in English so not much use to the others) and it looks like we could well be taking off in another direction with the sewing club! And since eight of our members are new to the club this year it's been gratifying to see how friendly everyone has become - it's a nice bunch with no \"difficult\" members like we had last year (thankfully just one person). In fact, one of the younger women suggested we have a kind of pot luck at this Monday's sewing evening as she felt it was a shame to limit our socializing to just a Christmas dinner and an end-of-year get together. Nice huh! I have no idea what I'll make but I'm leaning towards a red velvet cake at the moment, although that could change any time between now and then!And finally, seeing all the stuff in the news about the coronavirus bought back an incident that happened, I think, in 2003 during the SARS epidemic. Because the threat was classed as epidemic-level by the World Health Organization, they invited representatives of all the international organizations in Geneva to a meeting on how to deal with such an epidemic should the city be hit. The head of HR was invited and he asked me to go along with him! Me???? What the flip! You can't begin to imagine how I felt sitting in that huge room surrounded by all these eminent epidemiologists giving their opinions on such a serious subject in what seemed to me to be a language right out of Star Trek, although I was assured it was English! As we walked out of the room my boss actually said \"Sorry, I should have introduced you to everyone but I never got the chance\"!!!! Say what! I would have just died if he had 'cos, you know, me and Marie Curie weren't exactly like this:But, after the conference, they took us to see the underground bunker that they could use in the event of a mass emergency and that was fascinating! They can stock emergency supplies of vaccines and so on and everything else that would be needed to keep things running as normally as possible in the event of a life-threatening epidemic. So my embarrassing trip to the WHO meeting actually turned into a pretty interesting time for me, but it's just as well they didn't ask my opinion on any of the \"meatier\" issues isn't it! And an interesting fact (and this'll show you how forward-thinking the Swiss are). All homes built after a certain date in Switzerland - although I couldn't tell you what date - have to have an emergency bunker/sleeping cell to be used in the event of a war/nuclear incident. When I first moved to Geneva in 1980 I had a lovely large studio and in the underground area where the washing machines were we all had what they call a cave, or storage area - you know, somewhere to keep your skis and bikes and so on. The doors at the entrance to these caves were one foot thick solid metal and could be closed up in the event of an incident, with the doors to the individual caves lifting off to be used as beds for the duration. Those weren't particularly sophisticated times either by today's standards so I can only imagine how much they have progressed in their preparations in the 40 years since! It sure beats what I think would be the British alternative of sitting in the middle of the road with a bottle of whiskey singing Auld Lang Syne and hoping the nuke lands directly on top of you doesn't it!"},
{"title": "And moving swiftly on ...", "date": "Sunday 2 February 2020", "text": "So Brexit is done and dusted - for the moment at least - and thank God for that! I think just waiting has always been the worst part. I'd rather get it over with and get on with my life - a bit like ripping a sticking plaster off a scab I guess. Anyway, I had all my paperwork ready to request a carte de séjour (resident's permit) online this coming week when I see that that site has been blocked as the French are setting up a new site specifically for Brits to request their permits. This site will only be up and running come July so I guess I'll have to wait for a while then, although I did tell Jordan to get his British passport renewed as soon as possible because it expires in July. Timing is everything I guess! Apparently these new permits will have a specific indication on them that they are for Brits in France caught up in Brexit. I don't know what that will be - maybe it'll have a free tea bag stuck to the back. Still, now, at least, we can all draw breath for a while and regroup I guess!I saw a little of the \"party\" that took place in London to celebrate Brexit. Again, whatevs, as they say. The only thing that tickles me is that Nigel Farage is being hailed a hero - and frankly only the Brits could come up with a hero named Nigel! I mean, if it were the Scandinavians I'm sure their hero would be a \"Thor\" or an \"Igor\" for the Eastern Europeans, but no, we got a \"Nigel\"! It's a bit Monty Python-esque and says it all really doesn't it! But I, for one, can't wait until the mask comes off!Farage cartoon by Gary BarkerAnyway, moving seamlessly on, I checked my final walking log for January and came up with 94 miles walked in total, so under target but at least it's something. That being said, the weather has been crap these last few days and I've been a lazy bugger anyway (and thoroughly enjoying it) so I need to get back in the saddle pretty quickly if I'm gonna catch up at all.So what else is new? Oh, I didn't get to see the Bee Gees tribute in Geneva in the end as it was cancelled a couple of hours before it was due to start, due to poor ticket sales I guess. It's a shame really as I'm sure they were very good, but there obviously isn't the market for that kind of thing here I suppose.But I did get to go to a live-streaming of Porgy and Bess performed by the Met in New York last night and it was lovely! Again, I'm not a great fan of opera but some of the songs were just beautiful, as you can imagine, and the cast were wonderful. Apart from the fabulous portrayal of Porgy and Bess by Eric Owens and Angel Blue I have to admit to being quite smitten with Frederick Ballentine's Sportin' Life - I just love a wicked grin and he had it down to a fine art!Porgy and Bess (performed by the Met)Sportin' Life (performed by the Met)The introduction stated that it was being simultaneously relayed in 70 countries at 2,200 theatres to an expected audience of a quarter of a million (if I remember right). The wonderful thing is that apart from not being local to these hit shows, in many cases the cost of tickets would just be prohibitive so to see this live and just down the road was a real treat!During the interval people stayed in their seats and then pulled out their picnics - and, this being France, their bottle of red of course. A few seats over from us, they even had champagne flutes and a couple of bottles of plonk! How civilized is that! And just as importantly, in my opinion, they took all their rubbish with them and dropped it in the bins on the way out leaving a near spotless theatre with very little clean-up for the staff!I'm not sure what the next event will be (possibly The Flying Dutchman), but I'll be sure to look out for whatever is upcoming as I think I'm hooked!South African Golda Schultz singing \"Summertime\"!"},
{"title": "Oh dear!", "date": "Thursday 30 January 2020", "text": "I hadn't planned on posting today but …. As you may (or may not) know, Brexit \"goes live\" tomorrow night and I'm gutted in a way, but now I just want to get on with it and move forward. I think it's been too divisive and at this point que sera! Both on this side of the channel and the other, what will be will be! The British Embassies (certainly the Embassy in France) have been wonderful trying to keep expat Brits in the loop as much as was possible given all the uncertainty. Anyway, now that the Withdrawal Agreement has been signed it will hopefully alleviate some of the worries that many had, particularly regarding health care coverage in the EU and uprated UK pensions. I've been following a tremendous group called British in Europe who, along with The 3 Million (referring to EU residents in the UK), have been doing sterling work fighting for our rights. Sadly citizens' rights have been very much overlooked on the grounds that \"oh you'll be all right\" kinda thing! Well, actually, no, \"you'll be all right\" was never a given for so many, and still isn't. But now I just want it to be over so that I can get my papers in order (gonna request my permit on Monday) and also move ahead with my request for citizenship - although that will take longer of course.To that end, I've been sitting down reading the Livret du Citoyen (the Citizens' Manual, if you will) in the evenings to try to take in background information on France, its constitution, its system of government, it's history and culture and so on. To be honest I have a hard time staying awake as I'm certainly not into French philosophers or French pop music (that's a misnomer as far as I'm concerned), but I have no problem having to learn this stuff because ... why not? Even if it bores the pants of you you should know some of this stuff, although apparently most of the ladies at my sewing club on Monday night didn't know the half of it. So anyway …. today on FB one of the expat Brit groups asked what common misbeliefs we had encountered from friends and family regarding what would happen to us after Brexit. Now my sister has lived in Denmark for over 40 years and I've been in France over 30 years so you'd think my family would at least have an inkling of some of the difficulties we are facing now that we are leaving the EU wouldn't you! Well no, despite that my family all voted \"leave\", with the exception of my brother who died last year (God love ya Phil). Oh well, whatever, we just have to agree to differ!So I wrote on FB that when I met up with Steve in Greece a couple of years back I also met his brother and his wife. They were a lovely couple and we got along well. They had all voted \"leave\", and this despite Steve's dad being Polish, but then that's their prerogative! I decided not to get into it with them because they were nice people and you should never talk politics or religion in unknown waters right? But then the wife told me that she and her husband were intending to move to Spain in a couple of years when the husband, Steve's brother, retired! Now Steve had told me that they only had UK state pensions to retire on and no savings because, according to Steve, the wife was a real spendthrift and the husband would complain bitterly to Steve about it after he'd had a few drinks! So I asked her, before they put their house on the market and started house-hunting in Spain, if had they looked into the income requirement as a citizen of a \"third, non-EU country\" - which is obviously much higher than that required of an EU citizen? And I got a blank stare. And then I asked her, if the UK wouldn't guarantee their medical coverage, could they afford to pay private medical insurance on top of the minimum income to cover their life in Spain as this would be a requirement? And again I got the \"deer in the headlights\" stare. It obviously hadn't occurred to them that the restrictions being imposed on those \"damn EU immigrants in the UK\" would now apply to them if they wanted to move to Spain. They just hadn't given it a thought! I'm not knocking them, but it was very definitely a foolish move to be thinking about taking without looking into it further!So I posted this on FB and stated that while I liked this couple very much it was indicative of how little so many people in the UK had thought this through! Most people said \"yeah, I've seen that 'penny drop' expression too\", but one woman wrote back directly to me and said that \"it's a good job you're so knowledgeable and pompous about this\" (or words to that effect) and was really very rude!!! Say what! So I said I didn't think it was pompous to ask if these people were aware of just what administrative hoops they would be required to go through if they intended to move to Spain. Indeed I thought it was fair of me to mention it because they were going out to Spain house-hunting but if I came over as \"pompous\" then I apologized! And again, I liked this couple very much so didn't push it.Well, since then people have been rushing in to defend me and saying that the only \"pompous\" (and aggressive) person on this feed was her and if people thought they could now just up sticks and move to Spain (or wherever) as easily as they could have pre-Brexit then they were idiots. I did ask them to let it drop because it wasn't my intention to start a group argument, but up to about 10 minutes ago the argument is still going strong and she has been asked to leave the group if she won't stop being so insulting to people!!  Crikey, I kinda feel sorry for her. My first reflex when people are in my face is usually to \"tone it down\" anyway, which I did I when said I hadn't meant to offend anyone but, as I say, she's getting torn a new one by some very angry and upset expat Brits as I write. Maybe she'll learn to \"tone it down\" a bit herself next time then!"},

But I was dead to the world when around 3 a.m. I heard a loud \"pop\" and a whooshing sound so I got up to see if anything was amiss and even went to check on Shaggy in the spare bedroom but he was just fine. I couldn't figure out what it was and when I looked outside this morning everything seemed okay until I took stuff up to our large compost bin and found the lid hanging over the side and the bin leaning at a perilous tilt. I reckon the wind must have lifted it up and shaken it about, despite the fact that that baby is heavy, but at least it wasn't anything serious, thank goodness!Then two nights ago I was again fast asleep in the land of Nod when I was woken by a \"ping\" at 4 a.m. When I looked at my phone it was my \"Words with Friends\" buddy in New York who must have just thought of a joke he had to send me right now! So, 10 p.m.-ish in New York and 4 a.m. my time!!!!! And it wasn't even that funny! He's the only person I actually chat back and forth with while playing and I think he's nice so I don't really mind when he gets it wrong occasionally. So I sent him a message to say that I'd got the joke \"ha, ha\" - and did he realize I was reading it at 4 a.m. my time because we're six hours ahead of New York? And God love 'im but he wrote back and asked what on earth I was doing awake at four in the morning!!! So I wrote back and said \"reading lousy jokes that some old guy in New York sends me because he doesn't realize it's four in the morning my time\"! He did apologize (not that it matters really in the grand scheme of things), but vengeance turned out to be mine when I got my biggest ever single word score of 207 points! That'll teach him!Anyway, this morning it was still pouring rain and trying to snow at the same time so I decided against attempting to walk to yoga again. I had checked out an alternative route to the forestry road (too much mud) and this route would have added 1.5 km to my trip, for a total walk of 8 km, but given that I had already seen a FB post about fallen tree branches/limbs on that particular route I decided to give walking to yoga a miss this week. Yesterday's yoga lesson was quite something though I have to say, as in addition to doing our usual floor exercises she told us that she was going to be working on relaxing \"the rhomboid muscles\" also. Yeah, that's what I thought too - what the hell are the rhomboid muscles? Well it turns out it is the set of muscles between your shoulder blades (which we now call the scapula apparently - gosh I'm becoming a walking encyclopaedia aren't I), but since this is the region where I feel the most tension, probably due to poor posture, I was all for it!So she had us lie on our backs and then came around and placed two very soft balls under us between our shoulder blades and we did the rest of our exercises with this added instrument of torture! To say it was very uncomfortable would be an understatement, even though she told us not to force anything, but later that afternoon I felt just wonderful. It really is quite amazing (well to me anyway) how these yoga exercises can target specific muscles and they darn well work! Whoever invented yoga should be canonised!!!! In fact, Sylvie - who goes to both the Monday and Tuesday classes with me - came over this afternoon and asked how I felt after yesterday's lesson as she felt amazing - so you see, it really does work!As the rain had eased up somewhat after my lesson I decided I really must get out and walk while I still could so I took off to a small town just up the road called Bonneville and headed out on a new-to-me riverside trail along the river Arve - and it was lovely! Perfect walking weather and a lovely trail to get an hour's walk in!So while I'm not managing to get a walk in every day I'm still getting a few km in as and when and you know what, I'm actually really enjoying it!Then later I was curled up on the sofa with a cup of tea and a good book when I heard the rain start to bucket down again. So I sent a text message to my friend saying \"isn't it wonderful when it's cold and wet outside and you don't have to be anywhere!\" And he came back with just one word - \"miserable\". To which I wrote back ????? and he said \"I'm miserable because the weather is miserable\"! So way to burst my bubble there, my little ray of sunshine! Such a joy to chat with him as ever!Anyway, jumping from the rooster to the donkey again, One Family One Income was writing yesterday about an acquaintance of theirs who was embarrassingly cheap, so of course I got to reflecting on some of the \"cheapskate\" stories/people I have come across in the past. I suspect we all have a few stories we could tell don't we! Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being thrifty, but some people are just so cheap it makes your hair curl. God knows my ex had his faults but \"cheap\" was definitely never one of 'em, thank goodness!Anyway, probably number one on my \"cheapskate\" charts was my ex-BIL - damn that man was both miserable and cheap, he was unbelievable! He made decent money as a translator and my sister also worked but they never had any money. He never maintained his cars and I think the last time he opened his wallet two thousand bugs flew out and Denmark thought they'd been hit with a plague of locusts! I was over there one time and he was going to lend us his car for us to take a day trip to Sweden with the kids. My sister couldn't drive so it was up to me to do the driving and in order to hand the car over to me he pulled in to a petrol station and insisted on showing me how to put petrol in his car - like I had never put petrol in a car before right! The cheap bastard handed that car over on fumes and thought he could get me to pay for his petrol by taking his time insisting that I understood how to put petrol in a car \"over here in Denmark\". My family had already figured out he was tighter than a duck's bum at this point so I didn't rise to the bait and I let him pay for his own petrol. Shit, we probably only used about $5 worth of petrol that day and that was just driving a couple of km to get the ferry over to Sweden, but that a**hole tried his best to get me to pay for it! Didn't work though, even if I did hand it back to him with a full tank! Then I remember he was leaving the house one day and my sister said she needed to go shopping for dinner so could he leave her some money (she didn't have access to any money????) and he threw on the table what I calculated was the equivalent of about $1.50 to buy groceries for dinner for six of us! Yeah, he really was that cheap - not with other people's money of course - then he was very generous - it was just when it was his own money you practically had to break his fingers to get a dollar out of him! (I should note that I forever had my hand in my wallet every time I went over there and my family did the same both in Denmark and in England, so it's not like I was expecting much of him to fill his own car with petrol or buy a few groceries was it)! Well it turns out that the reason he had to be so cheap was because he had \"lady friends\" in several different countries and I guess \"lady friends\" when you're married can be expensive can't they. But even they weren't as expensive as the 20-year-younger Russian whore who fell madly in love with him over the internet without ever meeting him. Long story short - and do let me know if you can guess the ending to this story - he managed to sponsor her and get her in to Denmark even though he was still married to my sister and the whore had a husband in Russia, my sister divorced him, he buggered off with the whore who eventually brought her two bratty kids and her mother over, and then proceeded to fleece him out of every penny he had! I love a story with a happy ending though don't you! And to think I received a \"friend request\" on FB from him a couple of years ago! Yeah right, I just can't wait to get together with you again! Ah well you know what they say, there's only enough blood in a man's body to keep one head functioning at a time - and the one above the neck rarely wins!Then there was lovely Janet who I shared an office with in 1989. We were in an annex with no access to the cafeteria, so we took it in turns bringing in milk for tea and coffee every so often. A litre would probably last two days, so someone else would bring another litre in on day three and so on. Except Janet! When it was her turn she would bring in just enough milk for herself in a tupperware container because she was \"afraid it would go off over the weekend\"!!!! Sadly she was your typically English horsey stereotype - a kinda Joyce Grenfell type with a \"jolly hockey sticks\" accent and buck teeth! And damn was she cheap!Joyce GrenfellShe managed to get other people to drive her round Switzerland at the weekends on \"day trips\", which inevitably ended up at the town where her brother was living further up the lake and which meant she never had to put petrol in her own car! But my overriding memory of her was around Easter one year. She came in rattling a huge bag of crisps and asking if anyone wanted any. That packet must have been an already opened packet left over from a Christmas party which she found in a locker and she was still eating them! When she uttered the immortal words \"well you can't let good food go to waste\" I thought I was going to die, I didn't dare look at my colleague, whose jaw had already hit the floor with a loud clang!And talking of not chipping in, my dad worked with his half brother as a welder at the Rover car factory for quite some time. All the men used to put 50 pence into a kitty to buy tea, sugar and milk every week - except my dad's brother Alfie. He used to do a \"Janet\" and bring his own milk in a tupperware and it made my dad so mad. Mad that Alfie was his brother and too damn cheap to throw 50p in the kitty! So one time dad had to weld a metal bar onto a work bench and asked Alfie to jump up on the bench and stand on the bar to hold it down while he, dad, welded it. I guess the temptation was too great because my dad actually welded Alfie's steel toe-caps to the work bench and walked off and left him. Dad said Alfie nearly broke his neck when he went to jump down! Ah, I miss my dad!And then there was Welsh M - who was slightly odd but nowhere near as cheap as Janet. Until, that is, she was leaving to go back to Wales and decided that rather than take all her clothes back with her (the organization would have paid for her shipment) she would sell them off to her colleagues for five Swiss francs a pop - \"but not the dressing gown, mind you, I can't let that go for less than 10\"! I remember my colleague again looking at me with that \"WTF!!!!!\" look in her eyes. You see, while M was okay looking she dressed like Amy Farrah Fowler from the Big Bang Theory, so as you can imagine there wasn't a huge stampede to get the best pickins' from her wardrobe!!Amy Farrah FowlerAnd then there was my nephew's mate who, according to Darren, when they had a night out at the pub, always managed to be the first out the taxi but the last one at the bar! That's what you call having \"cheap\" down to a fine art isn't it!And finally, I couldn't write about \"cheap\" without mentioning Crazy K. Trouble is, Crazy K was such a study in lunacy that even 20 years later she still gives me the heeby jeebies. Maybe I'll save that tome for another day when I feel up to climbing that particular Everest!"},
{"title": "Meet scoby!", "date": "Sunday 26 January 2020", "text": "No, no, not Scooby, the indefatigable canine member of that 1970s private investigators' team, but scoby, a yeast and bacteria culture needed to make kombucha! I'm in the process of making one - well, at least, I hope I am - I'll know for sure in about four weeks, I guess!ScobyPretty gruesome looking isn't it! And I guess this is the point where my juvenile mind goes racing off on a tangent to another gruesome encounter of the bacterial kind! I remember when I was pregnant with my first son I was working at the World Bank and my medical insurance covered Lamaze pre-birthing classes. Now frankly I didn't find these particularly helpful (as it turned out, you can't daintily \"pant\" your way past the pain of pushing something the size of a basketball out your rear end), but it was very helpful in teaching about the various stages of labour and delivery and what might happen. One of the things that the very competent Lamaze lady told us was that in many cases before labour begins you might \"lose the mucus plug\" ahead of time - not always, but fairly often, she said. So she told us what to look out for and said that would probably be a good time to call the hospital for advice. I had to laugh when someone asked exactly what this \"mucus plug\" looked like and the lady said \"well not to put too fine a point on it, but it looks like you blew your nose in your underwear\" - and we all burst out laughing (and I still remember that 32 years later)! Still, it was a good thing she mentioned this because I actually lost mine with my second son three weeks before I went into labour and not, as my mom had said would happen, gone into labour within 24 hours. Had the Lamaze lady not described \"the plug\" I might have thought I'd given birth to a jelly fish!Anyway, back to the plot. I mentioned in a previous post that I had decided to do \"Dry January\", not from the \"giving up booze\" point of view really but because I thought it might help me lose a few pounds. Well I actually \"gave up\" on 26 December and it's been a doddle so far, haven't missed the white wine at all oddly enough, but I have been a bit stumped as to what to drink instead. I don't like coke and all those sweet drinks so when I stumbled upon kombucha I realized I had hit pay dirt. Or maybe I just picked up a really good brand because I found it tasted a bit like cider and was really refreshing. Trouble is, at over €5 a bottle it is also quite expensive, so I decided to \"Youtube\" it and look up how to make my own, having been impressed seeing my friend messing around with her concoction when I went to visit recently. It seems the first thing you have to do is make a scoby (which actually isn't all that difficult but which can take anywhere from one to four weeks to grow), so that's the stage I'm at. Think I'll call mine Shaggy! Well \"Shaggy\" is now sitting in the dark in my spare bedroom and hopefully keeping just warm enough to grow into a real scoby. Will let you know how it pans out in a couple of weeks.Anyway, while I was in the health food shop yesterday buying my kombucha I saw a couple of Brits trying to \"mime\" to the young assistant that they were looking for turmeric! Now how you \"mime\" the word \"turmeric\" beats me, unless you paint yourself yellowy-orange and put on the sari you just happen to have handy, so I went over and asked if I could help, much to their relief. (\"Turmeric\" is \"curcuma\" in French, just in case you're ever caught short!). But that incident got my mind wandering on my drive home about other daft things people have done while trying to communicate across the Tower of Babel (myself included of course, I've come out with some howlers). But one of the first incidents that popped into my mind was when our neighbours back in Birmingham had gone on a camping holiday to France many, many years ago. While they were there their eldest daughter started her periods for the first time and was in a lot of pain. Mom didn't want to leave her and their younger daughter alone so sent her non-French-speaking husband into town to buy sanitary towels. Well poor Norman obviously ended up in a right state as none of the assistants in the pharmacy spoke English. Turns out he ended up drawing one on a sheet of paper - and then they got it!!! My mom always used to double up when she told that story!And when I flew out to Bulgaria to meet up with my old childhood friend in 2010, we were travelling round the country in his clapped out Postman Pat van and ended up staying in what were some fairly basic, Soviet-era campsites. And I mean basic! Very poor facilities and hardly anything in the way of grocery stores or other amenities. Anyway one day Ian decided that we'd have omelette for dinner but realized he didn't have any eggs, so off he trotted to the little (in)convenience store to get some. We had learned Russian at school 10 trillion years previously and he had been getting by with a few words of Russian during his time in Bulgaria but completely blanked when he walked in the store and couldn't see any eggs on display. When he did indeed come back with a dozen eggs I asked him how he'd managed that, so he did a rather impressive impersonation of a hen laying what was apparently a square egg and the elderly babushka in the store got it straight away! Oh happy days!Which leads me off on another tangent of course. I'm still in the process of putting my books back on the shelves in the living room after having moved them all when my new floor was laid. Trouble is, I can't just put them all back, I have to look at each one and decide if I want to keep it, if it's too tatty and I want to throw it, or if I want to donate it. So to that end I now have a huge pile of books stacked on my coffee table in the TV room and also on the arm rests of the sofa where I sit watching TV, all waiting to have their fate decided. So if on the off chance I ever disappear from the ethernet please get the avalanche tracking dogs to come sniffing under the pile of books on my sofa 'cos there's a good chance I'll be buried alive under it! But, just today I opened a Delia Smith cookery book that my ex had taken with him when he moved out - and when I opened it I found a letter from him to me, saying how much he missed me now that I \"wasn't there\"! Well of course I \"wasn't there\" you idiot, you cheated on me and moved out. Still, it bothered me a bit as there was a sentimental side to him, although since the gf had cheated on him at this point I suspect he was just feeling a bit lonely. Still, it's weird to find something like that (it's not the first time) five years after he moved back to the States and all his stuff ended up dumped in my basement! But just to show how much I must have had my finger on the pulse of current events even then, I also found this book that I bought before I was married (so pre-1985):So ya see, I was obviously way ahead of Greta Thunberg (well, she hadn't actually been born at that point but let's not split hairs shall we), and I can see that the environment/conservation/recycling has always been something that's interested me. But if you want a bigger laugh, around the same time I must have also bought this:So again the same kinds of interest, but considering I live just 45 minutes from Geneva airport and hardly in the back of beyond, I don't think Bear Grylls has much to worry about do you!"},
{"title": "It's a small world isn't it!", "date": "Friday 24 January 2020", "text": "I didn't get much walking in these past two days as it's been really foggy - too dangerous to be walking on the roads round here and pretty grim to boot! So I took the opportunity to drive back to Thonon this afternoon to take one of the sewing machines we bought for our club back to the seller as it's not sewing properly, but man was it hard going driving - a real \"pea souper\", as they say! So I'm glad I'm home now, and it's actually rather nice not having any plans tonight. I've just been sitting watching a couple of episodes of \"Would I Lie To You\" (Lee Mack was on fine form tonight), and eating some rather nice Algerian dates I bought from the market. For some weird reason I feel a bit like Cleopatra stuffing my face with dates - or could it be just because I'm sitting on my ass? Oh well, whatever!And talking of feeling like Cleopatra, I went for a facial again this morning as part of my newly-decided-upon once-a-month treat. I still find it a bit weird being \"spoilt\" like this but I'm struggling along valiantly trying to get used to it! I kinda embarrassed myself again though as after much pummeling and prodding she applied a face mask then left me alone for ten minutes to relax while it dried. Trouble is, I'd had three cups of tea before I went out and was getting a bit desperate for a pee while I was supposed to be lying there \"relaxing\". Have you ever tried \"relaxing\" with a full bladder? Impossible right! So I decided I had no choice but to hop off the bed and run out to the loo - with no top on, greasy hair and a bright blue face! Which would have been okay I guess if no-one else had been there, but of course I just had to bump into a lady en route didn't I! Still, I guess we were all there for the same thing weren't we but damn if those cucumber slices didn't keep falling off!I saw in the news the other day that Princess Anne's oldest, Peter Phillips, is now cashing in on his royal credentials to plug milk in China, as is Diana's niece, Kitty Spencer, and Princess Michael of Kent (yep, that is the way she is referred to) is now also plugging some stem cell treatment centre in the Caribbean (they reckon that woman would go to the opening of an envelope if there was a free lunch involved)! And it would probably be easier to just draw up the short list of what Sarah Ferguson hasn't tried to plug using her royal connections! WTF!!!! So I suppose that's the route Harry and Megan will be taking - or will it be public speaking at how many thousands of ££££ a pop? Who knows, but really, who cares? Now I know there's good money in this kind of stuff but I'm forever amazed at the levels these people will stoop to when there are $$$$$ involved. I suppose they've all got their snouts in the trough in some way or another though haven't they. But the bigger idiots (in my humble opinion) are the \"sheeple\" that actually go out and buy this shit just because it's plugged by some celebrity (or celebrity wannabee). I mean, seriously, why would you go running out to buy some product just because it's being plugged by a Kardashian or some chinless wonder with protruding ears and a royal title? I suppose some of the lemmings are simply young and stupid, but I will never understand that kind of thing - but then again I don't suppose I'm part of their target audience anyway am I! I never would have been that dumb even when I was young (and probably stupid). It sure beats me though!Peter PhillipsKitty SpencerPrincess MichaelSo where was I? Oh yes, \"it's a small world\". In her comment on yesterday's post Marksgran mentioned that her aunt had lived in Geneva and she knew it fairly well from having been a frequent visitor. She mentioned a small bakery in the old town and I'm pretty sure I know which one she's talking about. Then yesterday I saw an article about an attempted abduction of a 13 year old girl on her way to school in our local town of La Roche, so I posted a link to the article on Facebook. When I got back from Thonon this afternoon I opened up FB (I play Words with Friends quite a bit) and a lady from another FB group that I follow commented that her brother and a colleague's brother live in La Roche (this lady is French but lives in Texas). So yes, it would indeed seem to be a small world!So that got me to thinking about a colleague who told me she was sunning herself on a beach in Crete many, many years ago with her boyfriend when all of a sudden she hears \"Ello Janet, what are you doin' 'ere?\" spoken with the very thick Wigan accent of a colleague of ours!Then when I was doing my six-month \"round Australia\" backpacking trip when I was 24 I stopped off in Bali on the way over. Being on my own I didn't go out much at night but did end up going out to what I thought was \"dinner\" with a bunch of \"older\" Australian ladies (in their 50s I reckon so \"ancient\" to me at the time) when I realized that they weren't really interested in \"dinner\" so much as picking up young Balinese men (and paying for their \"favours\", if you get what I mean)! I was young, naive and horrified, so you can imagine my relief when a young European put me out of my misery and started chatting to me. Turns out he was Swiss, was from a place called Buochs (as was my boss), and guess what - his uncle was my boss! Again, what a small world, right?And during my wonderful trip round Australia I met a young man called Jim in Darwin (God what a humid hellhole that was), and one day we got talking to an older lady who was working out in the desert doing some kind of research into earthquakes and earth tremors (or something like that, you can see how well I listened can't you). She was a fascinating lady to talk to and when I told her I worked in Switzerland at Organization XX she said \"oh I know that building. Beautiful isn't it! In fact, I used to work there when it was the ILO (International Labour Organisation)! So fancy meeting a lady in the middle of the desert in Australia who was probably a previous occupant of my office (and may even have carved her initials into my desk - nah, I doubt that bit)!Which makes me think, I have to think about writing about my six month trip around Australia at some point. I had a blast but I have hardly any photos because I got hit by a car on a pedestrian crossing fairly early in my trip and while I was unhurt my pretty expensive camera bit the dust as a result (something I only found out later). So yep, I guess I'll have to start dredging my brain for memories of that trip before it all disappears in a blur - or maybe not eh. Then again, maybe I will. I guess I'll be dead by the time my kids get around to reading this blog (if ever) so maybe I'll just go for it and to hell with it! Kids, take up any issues you have with my ghost when I come back to haunt you will you!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 22 January 2020", "text": "So what's new here at the moment? Not an awful lot really I suppose. Life is just ticking along nicely and the weather is still glorious, if cold, but then it is winter isn't it! We had rain on Friday which stopped me going out walking. Well I guess that's not strictly true because I could have just put on a different coat couldn't I, but if I'm honest I couldn't be arsed and I'm fine with that! While I'm enjoying the walking and have been pretty consistent with it, if I don't go out for some reason that's also fine. Saturday was again really sunny, but what I hadn't realized was that the rain from the previous day had actually caused black ice to form in certain areas and on two occasions my car went into a bit of a skid coming back from the market. I wasn't going fast of course, and I do have my winter tyres on, but it is a weird feeling all the same. Thankfully I had been able to pick my own car back up from the garage after they had spent most of the week repairing the damage caused by the wild boar. Turns out there was more damage than we originally thought which was not immediately visible from the outside, but the guy showed me pictures of where the internal damage had been done and it ended up costing €1,900 (that's about $2,100 at the moment). Thankfully I only had to pay €350 out of pocket, with the insurance picking up the tab for the rest. Thank goodness for that! Actually just looking at that exchange rate conversion I see that the euro is going down against the Swiss franc, or more likely the Swiss franc is going up (well that's what it looks like to me when I look at the Swiss franc/US$ exchange rate). That's all good for me as my pension is in Swiss francs and gives me more bang for my buck when I switch it into euros. I don't even want to look at what the GB£ is doing - it's probably losing points against the Matabele bongo bean as we speak thanks to Brexit but …. nah, everything is going to be just f-i-n-e if you just listen to Bojo! We'll see!And talking of the economy, I see that the big boss was on TV with Trump in Davos today. I haven't had time to read the transcript of the interview but it could be interesting (to me at least)!So where was I? Oh yes, routine. After yoga on Monday morning I headed out to a new-to-me spot to try to get some walking in, and it wasn't bad at all. Not as picturesque as many places but it is just down the road and for the most part easy walking - well I managed to get 9 km in that day so it can't have been that bad can it!In fact, I was just looking at my walking totals and since 2 January I have logged 94 km (or 58.5 miles), all mileage that I wouldn't have done if I hadn't signed up for the walking challenge. So maybe that's what I need - an accountability incentive! I'm just barely on track to making the 1,000 miles in one year, and it will mean really upping my walking on days when I do walk because there are obviously going to be days when I can't, but I'm a stubborn bugger and I have to admit I'm quite enjoying it! I had a fitbit but that suddenly stopped charging and since I didn't want to buy another one I just bought myself a cheap pedometer to wear round my neck, given that I wasn't carrying my phone on me half the time. It's funny though but I noticed on my phone that it was tracking all kinds of weird things, one of which was called \"cycle tracking\", so I though, \"oh great, if I decide to go out bike riding that might be useful\". Stupid sod I am sometimes, because when I looked closer at it it can apparently tell when I'm ovulating (on a bike?). Ha, as if! I swear my kids would just shake their heads sometimes!I also gave myself a good talking to today and got my act together enough to drive in to Geneva to use the gym at work (it's quite a trek and can be a pain in the butt if the traffic is bad). But as I was walking down from the car park I realized that I actually miss walking along the lake front or in the botanic gardens. It's so peaceful and yep, I kinda miss it. So I think I may start taking myself off down to Lake Annecy and start walking down there instead. I actually find Lake Annecy prettier than Lake Geneva so I can only think it will be good to go down there to walk and I'll still get that lovely \"sea air\" smell!And finally, on Sunday I talked my friend into driving into Geneva to see Knives Out and it was pretty good. Daniel Craig's \"southern\" accent was a bit hard to take but then I think it was played for comedic effect. In fact the whole film was pretty funny and we both enjoyed it. Without giving too much away, there was one scene that involved someone leaving a message using \"invisible ink\", so as we were walking out I asked my friend if a spy was using invisible ink to leave a message how would he know when his pen was empty? He just looked at me like I was mad! Then I told him that tomorrow night I'm going with friends to see a tribute to the Bee Gees in Geneva and he asked me if it was the original group! Considering that three of the four brothers are dead I told him I thought that was highly unlikely don't you! So touché then!"},
{"title": "Living the dream!", "date": "Saturday 18 January 2020", "text": "Well it's Saturday night and I've just spent the last fifteen minutes watching a Youtube video by a Scotsman showing me how to make yoghurt in a yoghurt maker! Some of us are just living the dream eh! I had actually bought my yoghurt maker some time ago as I go through a lot of yoghurts and it started to seem like madness to me to keep putting plastic yoghurt pots in the recycling bin when I could be making my own using glass pots. Trouble is I couldn't remember what I'd done with the instructions (not that it's that difficult to make your own yoghurt right) so I went on Youtube, looked up the make of my yoghurt maker and that's how I stumbled across the Scottish guy's video. So it took all of - oh, I don't know - 30 seconds to figure it out but then he actually took the thing apart to let me see inside it! Gripping stuff! I tell ya, those of you out on a date with a gorgeous hunk this Saturday evening can eat your hearts out!! I know, I know, I used to have a life and now I watch Youtube videos on yoghurt-making and collect pretty tins for my baking (my sad little secret). Oh well. Anyway, I made my first batch of seven yoghurts and they weren't bad, although I think I'll heat the milk first next time as it's supposed to give a more solid yoghurt. But my mathematical little brain calculated that they work out at around 10 cents per pot, as opposed to around 60 cents for the shop-bought ones and there are no more plastic pots to recycle, so I guess it was worth sacrificing my Saturday evening right!Anyway, now that that adrenalin rush is over, what else happened the past couple of days? Oh yes, I heard from Ginette (the lady I met at the market) and she asked me if I wanted to meet up on Thursday for a coffee. I told her I couldn't make it at 10.30 a.m. because I had my pilates class but I could meet her at 11.30 if she was still up for it - which she was. We ended up going for lunch together and she asked me if I wanted to go out for a walk with her and a friend of hers \"who knew a good walk up through the woods near Chatelet\", and I thought why not. So we drove out to Chatelet to meet her friend and parked near a little flour mill, but as we were about to set off she noticed three men firing up a very old oven in preparation for Saturday's Fête du Pain, or Festival of Bread. The two ladies got chatting to the men, one of whom turned out to be Ginette's son's neighbour, and he turned out to be a real character. He said that every year they fired up the ancient ovens and started running the flour mill as a way of celebrating the old bakery there. They would have lunch and drinks for all the locals and any profit they made from their little fête would go to keeping the old mill in working order.The old flour millAnyway, \"Mr. Personality\" called the other guys over and we ended up standing there chatting to them for about 20 minutes - not that I minded, but so much for \"walking\" right! They invited us to go into the oven area to have a look round and get warmed up, and then one of the guys told me not to worry as \"they hadn't burned any English at the stake for a long time\"! Ho ho! That's usually a pretty common go-to joke for the French - always a reference to the English burning Joan of Arc at the stake in 1431! Still, they were nice enough and actually invited us to come along to their \"do\" on Saturday. When I said that I wasn't a local the \"Joan of Arc\" guy said \"I'm inviting you, come as my guest\"! What was so weird though was that he actually looked very much like an older version of Steve - it was uncanny!Anyway, after a while we set off on our walk, only to find out that Marie-Christine (the friend) hadn't got a bloody clue where she was taking us. We wanted to try to stay in the sunshine as it got quite cold in the shade, but she had us going off on these woodland paths, then doubling back and trudging along trails that in the summer were probably quite nice but in the winter!!! Bloody hell, I could feel my shoes getting sucked off my feet every step I took. By the time we sloshed back to the road I/we looked like we'd done a \"tough mudder\" race!Picture courtesy of The Hull Daily MailAt one point we stumbled across five youngish men who had built a camp fire and were roasting what turned out to be duck on it. They were collecting dead wood for the fire and had a few beers in the trunk of their car but weren't in any way \"threatening\". Ginette asked if they had hunted the \"pheasant\" and they laughed and said \"no we just got back from the supermarket\" (as evidenced by the styrofoam trays) so we wished them bon appétit and headed on back towards the road. Buuttt by the time we'd got back to the road Marie-Christine had decided they were poachers, they were making an illegal camp fire, they were Eastern Europeans in the country illegally, probably unemployed and/or selling drugs!!! Say what??? First of all I didn't notice any \"foreign\" accents and if they were \"poachers\" they appeared to have shot that duck in the poultry aisle of the local supermarket! So then she asked if we should report them, so I said \"for what\"? It's not illegal to make a fire here, they're only collecting dead wood, and the place is sopping wet anyway! So we agreed (or so I thought) that it wasn't any of our business! Well that was until a car pulled up with a man asking if we had seen his runaway dogs (we hadn't), at which point Marie-Christine went into great detail to tell this man about the evil ax murderers in the woods!!!! He just laughed and said they often made camp fires between shifts! By this time I was starting to get the \"lay of the land\" as far as \"nut job\" was concerned but knew we had to keep going as we wanted to get back before it got dark. Further along the road we passed an older man pruning his apple trees and stopped to talk to him. Again I don't mind stopping and chatting at all - well that is until nut job started going off about French politics, local politics, how dreadful Switzerland was and \"as for the Swiss\" - it seems they are arch enemy number one! At that point I just had to speak up so I said that if this region was as wealthy as it was it was largely because the locals had the possibility of going into Switzerland to work and paying French taxes on their Swiss salaries. Otherwise what was there in this region? A little bit of industry in the Arve valley and the possibility of making a bit of money off the skiers if (and that's a big \"if\" at the moment) there was any snow! After that I thought I'd better just shut my mouth so I pretty much walked back to the car in silence. When we got back the Steve look-alike guy again invited me to their drinks on Saturday so I said I'd think about it. We said goodbye to nut job and then Ginette drove me back to my car. On the way there she said \"you were very quiet\", so I just said I didn't know much about French politics and in any case talking about politics (anybody's politics) got me all worked up so I preferred to keep my mouth shut! But then she asked if I would like to go out walking another time with her (and here I'm thinking \"I'd rather have all my teeth out without an anaesthetic\") but next time we would go without nut job because she was hard work! I told her I didn't want to interfere in their friendship but she said no, I'd rather keep my distance too, so who knows, maybe there will be a next time!One thing she did say though is that she had broken up with her partner over the Christmas holidays. On New Year's Eve he had told her he had a bad back and didn't want to go out (which she didn't mind at all), but on an impulse she drove over to his place at 4.30 p.m. and he wasn't home. So she sat there until he rolled in at just after midnight and broke up with him there and then. Seems he had been out dancing (looking for his next victim she suspected), and since then he has been bombarding her with phone calls and showing up at her house begging her to take him back! Not in a million years was her answer, and I have to say she seems much happier now to be shot of him!And talking of the Steve-lookalike, I sent a message to Steve's daughter on Christmas Eve to say that I was thinking of them at this sad time as I knew they all used to get together at their dad's house for Christmas day. I then went on to tell her the story of how her dad had this God-awful jacket that I hated. It was bright red on one side and reversible to dark blue but it looked horrible on him and I told him so. Then when I was coming back from Colmar and we had stopped off at a service station for a potty stop, I saw a \"mac in a pac\" for sale. It was a rain jacket that folded up into a very small pack and was ideal for keeping in your bag \"just in case\". When I got home and opened it up I realized I had bought the same bloody God-awful jacket as Steve had - and it looked just as awful on me! So Josie wrote back and thanked me for my message and said that they'd got a good laugh out of the matching jackets story. I think if things had turned out differently and Steve hadn't died so unexpectedly Josie and I would have gotten on a treat, but it wasn't to be, sadly!Then yesterday Jen asked if she could come over because she was trying to book their flights to the States on British Airways and was having a hard time so would I help her? We got online and booked their flights Geneva/London/Pittsburgh (so it would seem that BA are now offering direct flights London/Pittsburgh again then - they stopped doing that some years ago) and they've decided to give New York a miss, sadly, because the flight New York/Pittsburgh was almost as expensive as the flight from Geneva to Pittsburgh and it was probably beyond their budget! Shame, but there's always another time I guess. So then I helped her fill in her ESTA visa request for the US, but I had to laugh when it asked for her town of birth and I had to type in \"Bitche\"! No kidding! She was born in a place called \"Bitche\". I guess we'll see if they decide to let her in then!And finally, it's been a year today since my brother died. Gosh hasn't that year gone fast. And four years to the day since his wife died too. Yep, they died on the same day, three years apart! Still can't believe it, but I know he/they are still around us all the time. Miss you both so much! God bless!Brenda and Phil"},
{"title": "So that's decided then!", "date": "Wednesday 15 January 2020", "text": "My Italian class was cancelled tonight as the teacher is unwell, so I decided to take advantage of the extra free time (but damn it, I'd already done my homework!) and head on down to Annecy as I wanted to visit the hypermarket there. I needed to buy a new iron for sewing club and I wanted a 21 cm spring-form cake tin, but wasn't having much luck finding one locally. Trouble is, when I go to this store I always end up coming out with other stuff because their prices are pretty good and they have a much larger selection of goods than our local stores. So I came out with a new, lightweight winter jacket, some ski trousers (just in case) and new woollen socks, as I seem to be very hard on my socks at the moment. Oddly enough, every time I went to England I would come back with new sweatpants because buying sweatpants obviously meant I was going to get fit and lose weight didn't it!!! Ha ha! Still, they're coming in useful now I suppose! When I got back to my car I noticed that I'd missed a call from Jen so I called her back and she asked if I would be around the second half of February or did I have travel plans. When I told her that I was going to be around she asked if I could take them to the airport as she and Jordan are off to the States for 10 days end of February! Turns out he handed in his notice at work today and will be starting work with Max on 1 March so he needs to use up a couple of weeks' leave beforehand. His current employer was disappointed but thanked him for seeing them through the worst of the winter anyway - it's always good to leave on a good note I feel, so I'm glad he resigned \"the proper way\". So they are off to Pittsburgh for a few days to see my ex and Ammy (grandma), which I'm pleased about as she's 84 and he hasn't seen her for seven years. After that they're off to New York for a few days and I can already tell Jen is really excited as she's never been to the States before!!!!When I got back I realized I just had time to fit in a quick walk up the hill behind me, and for the first time ever I made it up that hill without stopping to regurgitate a lung. I suppose I've been making an effort to walk for two weeks now so hopefully I am making steady (if somewhat slow) progress. Oh and I weighed myself this morning and I'm actually down six pounds since 2 January! While that's great, I know myself well enough to realize I can go up or down three pounds overnight, but at least it's going in the right direction for the moment!Oh and guess what, I've got tickets to see André Rieu in Zurich in October! And I'm delighted - it will be a real treat! When \"Marksgran\" commented on my blog that she couldn't get tickets for Glasgow and that both nights in Wembley Arena (London) were sold out, I thought damn, that's 26,000 tickets right there, sold out! So I knew I'd better get moving. My friend didn't want to see him (the miserable sod) but a former colleague (we're both now retired) said he would love to go, so I checked again with Tony and got tickets for both of us. From my place it would be a 4-5 hour drive I reckon so I might shock him and suggest a \"dirty weekend\" and that we get a hotel! Well, actually I don't think anything would shock him and we are just good friends anyway, but I'll have to see how he feels about driving back overnight. Makes sense to me to get a hotel but we have time to discuss it between now and then!And talking to Tony reminded me of a time I was going out to lunch and Tony was standing with Ian (another tall, lanky Brit) waiting to get the bus into town. Now Tony is very tall, and consequently has pretty big feet. I don't know what he had done on his way to the bus stop but somehow the sole of one of his shoes had separated, but not completely detached, from the upper part of his shoe, so since he was in a rush he had just wound scotch tape round and round his shoe to hold it together. Those things made a horrendous \"farty\" squelching noise as he walked up the path and Ian and I were doubled up laughing! I remember talking to Tony one time about buying shoes (and the difficulty I had finding shoes for Jordan when he was a young man with ruddy great \"plates of meat\" - Cockney rhyming slang for \"feet\") and he was saying that having such big feet was a nightmare in Geneva because you just couldn't find the larger sizes. He said if he found a size 50 pair in pink with ribbons on he would buy them he would be that grateful just to find something - bet he was sorry he'd missed the sales that day then!And jumping again \"from the rooster to the donkey\" (word associations), the other day at Grand Bornand Jordan asked me if I had a spare pair of gloves as he had forgotten his. Which made me think back to a dreadful Saturday job I had (my first) when I was just 15. My aunt found me a job in a horrible little shop of the kind that seemed to proliferate in England at the time - you know, the kind of place that sold wool, handkerchiefs, bras and other undergarments, men's ties - I mean, I was 15 years old and into fashion not ladies bras that looked like barrage balloons (you know, the kind I wear myself now - tee hee)! Still, at 15 I was underage to be working so in the end I was glad of this job, even if they were rip-off artists. The owner, a lady called Joyce, was probably in her 60s and used to bore the pants off me telling me how she had perfect legs - taking the definition of \"perfect\" (apparently) used by the Zigfeld Follies (but then, what would I know). Seemingly \"perfect\" meant that she could put a coin between her thigh muscles and her calf muscles and it would stay there - hence \"perfect\" Zigfeld legs - as opposed to my bandy legs that you could drive a truck through!!! Now this might have been interesting if you had been young during WWII (like her) but to a 15 year old kid it was so boring I had to stifle my yawns more than once. Anyway, I remember one time a lady came in and wanted a pair of brown leather gloves to go with a wedding outfit, so I went through all the boxes of gloves and got out every box of brown leather gloves for her to look at. At which point Joyce came in and went ballistic saying that if the lady wanted gloves I was to get out every box for her to look at, not just a few! Thankfully the customer stood up for me and said that she had indeed asked for brown gloves so the ones that Joyce was throwing on the counter were of no interest to her! Thank God for that lady! They used to pay me a measly £2 per day at the time, but one time during the school holidays I worked six full days and at the end of the week the daughter gave me an envelope with £9 in it and said she \"hadn't deducted any tax\" (as if I was declared! Right!) My mom was horrified that they had ripped me off, but what horrified me even more was that while the daughter was giving me her little spiel about not deducting taxes, she was actually picking her nose, and I'm standing there thinking \"does she not even realize that she's fishing for boogers while she's talking to me\"! Yuck. I was so grateful when I turned 16 and got a job at W.H. Smiths I can tell you!!But the funny thing was, my friend, Joy, same age as me, got a job in the pharmacy next door and while the young woman was showing her the ropes she said \"and of course if any man comes in and asks, all embarrassed, for 'you know what', they're under the counter\" (this was around 1973 I should point out). So one day a salesman came in and asked for a packet of aspirins, some cough medicine and \"a packet of the usual\", so Joy put it all in a paper bag and rang it up. When she told him how much, he said \"what the heck have you just sold me?\", and when he looked in the bag and saw the packet of condoms he burst out laughing. \"A packet of the usual\" was apparently a packet of chewing gum, but Joy, being new there, wasn't to know that was she. Still, at 15 years old, sooner her than me! And to think I was mortified the time a lady with a very severe speech impediment asked me five times for something and I had to run into the back and find the owner because I couldn't understand her (turns out she wanted a packet of sanitary towels - thank God I didn't ask her to mime it)!!!!In her younger years my sister also had a Saturday job working in a fish 'n chip shop in the same group of shops (and since my brother worked in the outdoor fish market at the time I guess someone in our house always smelled of fish in our younger years then)! Anyway, these shops were a good three miles from home (and we had to walk it), but if you cut across the \"recreation fields\" (\"the rec\") you could cut a good mile off your journey, so that's what we did. But the scary thing is, not so many years later \"the rec\" became a very dangerous place to walk across, with more than one rape and assault taking place there - and to think we used to walk through there as a matter of course! One of our neighbours also used to make this trip back from work every night, but at a certain time every evening her family would let their German shepherd out and he would trot the couple of miles to the stop where she would get off the bus and sit and wait for her to accompany her back across the rec every night! Amazing stuff huh!My boyfriend at the time also used to walk across the rec and I remember him telling me one time a young girl had been raped there and he, Mark, was asked to attend the police station on some vague pretext. Nobody had told him why they had him there (although he guessed 'cos he had heard about the rape), when suddenly an older woman and a young girl walked in, supposedly to report a stolen handbag. The girl took one look at Mark and then walked out. She was obviously the young girl who had been attacked and that was how they brought her in to take a look at Mark (who obviously had nothing to do with the attack). It's funny but that would never be allowed to happen nowadays would it, but at the time that was the way it was and you just got on with it. What different times we live in now though!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Tuesday 14 January 2020", "text": "Damn, I ache all over. Y'see, I had another bright idea this morning and now I'm paying the price for it! Since I'm trying to get some walking in every day while the weather allows to work towards my 1,000 miles challenge, after yoga yesterday I decided to drive back down to Thyez and walk for an hour on the cycle path along the river Arve. While it was better than nothing I realize that an hour isn't really enough to clock up the steps/km - even if it's more than I was doing before I signed up for the challenge. So my intention was to get up and out this morning for a walk through the woods before my 2.30 p.m. yoga class in a village two villages away. Trouble is, since I'm now retired and no longer have to the hit the ground running in the morning, I've gone back to my natural sloth tendencies and spend a good couple of hours reading while having my breakfast and a cup of tea (or 10). That then made me a bit pushed for time to get in a decent walk before heading off to yoga class in St. Pierre - so like an idiot I decided to walk there! With that I ran round to my neighbour and told her I would meet her there as I was going to walk - and she just burst out laughing and said I must be mad (she's probably right). My neighbour's mirth notwithstanding, at 12.30 I set off walking in the direction of the village of St. Laurent, and then on down the forestry road to St. Pierre. Turns out it's almost five miles away! Who wudda thunk! I made it to yoga class with just five minutes to spare and the teacher then chose today of all days to up the ante and teach a much more dynamic class. Damn, I'm aching all over! Buuuttt, I got a total of 12,400 steps in today in just a couple of hours and walked about six miles in total in addition to 90 minutes of yoga! I guess that should up my weekly total a bit then!In other news, when we were driving up to Grand Bornand on Sunday Jen said that they would like to ask my opinion on something! It turns out that Jordan has been offered a job back at the company where he worked while apprenticing as a plumber. Max, the young man that installed my new heating system, is the boss and Max's dad started his plumbing business many years ago and employed both his sons in the family business. Dad retired in September so Max and his brother are now the owners of a rather large plumbing business that specializes in \"big jobs\" - like replumbing hospitals and apartment blocks - and Max called Jordan to say they had a few big contracts signed and their only other employee had just resigned to move into a different branch of plumbing and would he come back. Now this sounds ideal because Jordan really doesn't like what he's doing at the moment - servicing central heating systems - and wanted to get back into \"proper\" plumbing anyway. The way Jordan looks at it, though, is that Max is a long time friend (they both play in the same band together) and sometimes they clash, but to my mind the positive is that they know each other, he knows how Jordan works, and he will have much better working hours with Max than where he is now. His current employer schedules in as many as eight service appointments a day but does not factor in travel time and the eternal traffic jams, so Jordan often works through his lunch break and then on until 8 p.m. While he doesn't mind occasionally he says it shouldn't be an every day thing - and he's quite right, especially considering he starts at eight in the morning! He already told his employer before Christmas that he was looking for other work but they asked him to hang on during their busy winter period so he agreed to see them out until the end of February - which would tie in very well with Max's offer. He doesn't want to leave them in the lurch as he said they have been good employers but doing routine maintenance work is doing his head in. So I told him I think he should go for it, since Max has also been very good about lending him tools in the past if he had other jobs on the side (jobs that Max doesn't want because they are too small). If worse comes to worst and they do clash he can always look elsewhere anyway, so I think he's going to go with it! And good for him. Fewer hours, the same or more money, proper lunch breaks, although with harder physical work - but that's what he wants so I say go for it!Then yesterday I dropped off my car at the garage for them to repair the damage caused by the wild boar the other week. I had asked the garage if they could lend me a car for the duration and they have lent me what must be one of the smallest cars in captivity (a little Fiat), but you know what, it isn't bad! It's about as big as a matchbox car and probably has less power than my sewing machine, but it's fairly new and quite nippy so I can live with that. In fact, now that I'm no longer putting in the km to drive to work and belting along the motorway at high speed every day I don't think I will need such a heavy duty car when this one dies on me, so maybe a nippy little four-wheel drive might be nice! Still, we're not there yet, and hopefully this one will keep going for a few years yet.And finally, tonight I drove in to town to drop off a crate of stuff that I had bought for the food bank. The elderly man there who took my crate can never figure out how to collapse it back down when it's empty and we always laugh and joke about him needing to take night school classes in \"crate folding\". Anyway, he was telling me that the food bank will be moving to new premises next month and when I asked where it turns out it's near the Church of the Blessed Fountain. So I told him that that was near to me, so we got chatting, as you do, and it turns out he lives in my village, right near the church, and knows my neighbour well, since they were on the village council together! And now I think about it I might just recognize him from around the village but who knows! As I say, it's a small world isn't it!"},
{"title": "Another beautiful day!", "date": "Sunday 12 January 2020", "text": "Jen had mentioned last week about us going out walking today if the weather was nice - which it is! It's still lovely here at the moment, which I guess is payback for all the rain we had in December. Anyway, she called last night to confirm and then sent me a message this morning to say they would be over around 1 p.m. to head up the mountain to Grand Bornand as they wanted to go skating. At this point I was a bit \"blah\" - not too enthused about getting all trussed up in long johns and such, but then I picked up my phone and saw that I had seemingly only taken 24 steps this morning!!! Now I'm pretty sure the distance from the couch to the bathroom is about 30 steps and I don't remember having an accident so I reckon I clocked up so few steps because I don't keep my phone on me all the time unless I'm out. But, that was just enough of a kick up the backside for me to start getting ready to go out. \"Getting ready\" involved making tuna/mayo sandwiches, since we'd decided to take a picnic lunch, and then making lentil soup and a quiche for tonight. I also took cold drinks and a couple of thermos flasks of hot water so we could have hot tea up there - and it's all just as well really because there wasn't very much open. I guess the lack of snow meant that many of the locals didn't bother going up there skiing for the day, although the paragliders and walkers seemed to be making the most of it!Anyway, by 2 p.m. we were up at Grand Bornand, which is only about 10 minutes away from my favourite ski resort of La Clusaz. It's been years since I've been to Grand Bornand so it was lovely to visit again and see how pretty it is!The little kids were having a blast!Just about to land!One thing I must remember to do next time though is take my ski poles as it was really slippery in the shaded areas. After a quick walk around the village the kids decided to go ice-skating and as the rink was pretty empty I think they enjoyed it. I haven't skated since I was a kid so decided to give it a miss and go on another walk by myself.Again I didn't get much mileage in but having signed up for the 1,000 mile challenge I now have 40 km more walking in since the start of the year than I would otherwise, so I guess that's a positive!In other news when I went to my friend's the other day she was making clementine kombucha and it was pretty nice. I looked up how to make it but it seems a bit of a faff to me so I picked some up at the health food store the other day and it was really good. It tastes a bit like cider but without the alcoholic kick and is really refreshing. So that's a definite hit for my shopping list until I decide to give it a try myself (although I'm not sure that'll ever happen, to be honest)!And finally my car goes in to the garage tomorrow for a week to repair the damage done when I hit the wild boar before Christmas. Well technically he hit me but since his insurance wasn't up-to-date my insurance will be picking up the tab! They will lend me a car for the duration (an old beater I expect) so I won't be driving into Geneva this week and will probably do fewer miles than I usually do, but it will be good to get my car repaired as there was more damage than was initially visible. Oh well, I guess that's the way it goes sometimes isn't it!"},
{"title": "The Strauss Concert!", "date": "Saturday 11 January 2020", "text": "So on Thursday my friend and I met up in Geneva for a concert by the Strauss Festival Orchestra and Ballet Ensemble. And right from the start I loved it! I love Strauss's music and from the very first piece I was totally enthralled! I was somewhat surprised though to see that the theatre was only about two-thirds full - I really expected it to have sold out but that wasn't the case - which, I guess, is why I got the email offering me a 15% discount in the first place I suppose. Still, I'll take it! I used to get their programme of events sent to my work email, so after I retired I lost touch with much of what was going on in Geneva for a while. I suppose now, having since booked a few concerts using my private email address, I'll start receiving more regular updates.They had a lady come on for about four songs singing opera - which I can take or leave frankly - but she did have a beautiful voice and was quite funny in some of her rôles. They also had dancers (as the name \"Ballet Ensemble\" suggests) and that I enjoyed very much, although to be honest I felt they didn't have that much room to dance. Towards the end of the evening they were playing a grand waltz when one of the male dancers walked on with a bottle of champagne which he was supposed to open and pour into several glasses. I didn't think for one minute that it was real but as he went to open the bottle the cork shot off and champagne (or some other fizzy stuff) spewed out all over the floor! I don't think that was supposed to happen somehow, but they were very professional and kept on going - although I was living in dread of one of them slipping in it! Thankfully that never happened!The penultimate piece they played was The Blue Danube, which everyone recognizes and loves of course. But after that they played The Radetzky March for the grand finale and that was the piece that raised the roof! What I didn't know was that Johann Strauss Sr. wrote The Radetzky March and his son, Johann Strauss Jr. wrote The Blue Danube. Seems like there was just waaayyy too much talent in one family there don't you think!Obviously this concert wasn't being filmed but since I love André Rieux I found a clip of his orchestra playing The Radetzky March (in Holland, im guessing, since they're all wearing orange). And guess what, I see that he's coming to Zurich in October and while my friend doesn't want to go, I have a friend who would like to go with me, assuming we can make the dates fit around his birthday celebrations! Damn, I hope Tony can make it!I got up quite late this morning so got off to a slow start when I had been meaning to get some walking in. Around mid-day I was just thinking I couldn't be bothered to go out walking today when I looked on the 1,000 Mile website and saw that their motto was \"boots on\", so I thought sod it, \"boots on\", and here I go. The weather was glorious here today so there really was no excuse and I realize I need to seriously up my mileage if I'm going to achieve 1,000 miles in one year, as I'm nowhere near close to hitting the right daily target!  So I drove down the valley for about 30 minutes to a small leisure centre in the village of Thyez. Now my friend and I discovered this pretty little lake a few years ago when we went to a vide grenier (car boot/garage sale) there, but I hadn't realized that there is actually so much more there than just the lake/swimming area. There were kids playing football, tennis, basketball, a skateboard park, a ping pong table and of course the usual swings and slides for the younger kids. In fact, there is a more than decent riding/walking trail there which would make it a good place to go walking on days when the weather isn't so great and I don't want to walk in the mud. So I got in a 90 minute walk (minus the 15 minutes I spent chatting to a lady sitting on a bench - told you, I'll talk to anyone!) and got a few km in towards my total, but it's really nowhere near enough. So I'm hoping that as I get more consistent with my walking I can pick up the pace and the mileage, although from what I hear that gets easier once you take your hands out your pockets!!! Who would have thought!Lac de ThyezI mentioned yesterday about Stan's son representing Nigeria in the cross-country skiing in February's winter Olympics, and that he could well be a one-man team (I'm not totally sure of that but it makes sense doesn't it). Well along the lines of the great Eddie the Eagle (as a Brit I'm so proud of that guy!!!!) it got me to thinking about Eric the Eel (better known as Eric Moussambani), who represented Equatorial Guinea in the swimming at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. From what I remember, after two false starts by his fellow competitors they were disqualified, so all Eric had to do was successfully swim 100 metres to qualify! Thing is, he nearly didn't make it as, to be honest, he could barely swim! But the crowd were on their feet cheering him on and he did, indeed, do it!!!I tried to post the video as it is so funny but apparently it is the property of the Olympics Committee so it won't play here. If you get a chance have a look. 17,000 people on their feet cheering him on! Just brilliant!Eric Moussambani - he said that moment changed his life!Sam's participation for Nigeria will be nothing like that because he was tipped to be selected for France (until his accident), but what a lovely story Eric Moussambani's is - one of the most memorable Olympic moments of all time!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Friday 10 January 2020", "text": "Well I made it through a pretty hectic week this week but even though it was pleasurable I wouldn't want every week to be so jam-packed. Circumstances, I guess! I'm still trying to work in a few extra km walking every day and I have been doing well, even if I'm not really achieving great mileage. I guess what I mean is that if I hadn't signed up for the 1,000 mile challenge I would have just slobbed around at home, but I have made an effort to get out walking every day even if I'm not getting the mileage I would like. Still, it's better than nothing I guess!On Tuesday I walked up to the Mairie to pick up attestations for Jordan and me regarding our length of residence in France. My attestation states that I moved into the village in April 1990 and am still resident here, while for Jordan she did one saying he had lived in the village from birth until October 2015 (when he moved in with Jen). After that I guess he can get attestations from his next villages for when he requests residency after Brexit. Instead of going straight home from the Mairie I decided to walk back in a loop through the woods at la Bénite Fontaine church and home past Stan's old shop - which got me an hour's walk in and about 5,000 steps. Stan is my Nigerian friend who used to have his little bar/shop near the railway line in the village but who retired about 18 months ago and now lives mainly in Nigeria but comes back to France on a regular basis to see his wife and grown up kids. Anyway, just as I was approaching his old shop, who should pop out of the group of men at the mobile still (turning walnuts into eau de vie) but Stan! Turns out he's back from Nigeria for a couple of months and it was great to see him!StanThe mobile stillIt was so lovely to see him and have a chat. He is back here until end February and in a couple of years' time his (French) wife will retire and join him, splitting her time between France and Nigeria. While I was chatting with him I noticed the farmer was in among the group of men chatting next to the still and he just gave me a smile and that was it. But you know, I'm not the only one to have really missed Stan's place. We have one restaurant in the village and nothing else, so not having somewhere for people to meet up for a chat is a real loss.Oddly enough, I was chatting to my neighbour this morning and I mentioned that Stan was back. So she told me that she had seen one of his sons over Christmas and - get this - Sam has taken Nigerian citizenship (in addition to his French citizenship) and will, we think, be representing Nigeria in the winter Olympics in the cross-country skiing! Since it seems he will be a one-man team he will also be the flag-carrier apparently! And I think that's wonderful! All three of Stan's kids are athletic. In fact, they pushed their kids into sport as a way to deal with the fact that they are mixed race and have been on the receiving end of racism on occasion. Daniel plays rugby for Toulouse and has also played for France in the under 21s. Cécile has played handball for France and is a sports teacher in Montpellier, and Sam was on track for possible selection for France in cross-country skiing when he fell and broke his shoulder - thus putting paid to his dreams of representing France. He works as a ski moniteur and, hopefully, will now get to represent Nigeria in his chosen sport!Then on Tuesday we started up our Tuesday afternoon yoga again, this time with my Monday morning teacher standing in as a replacement for the Tuesday teacher, who couldn't make it. So now I think my neighbour is totally sold on the Monday teacher - I told her she would prefer her - and she is going to look into coming to Monday morning yoga with me in future if possible because she loved the way this replacement teacher taught our class! Knew it! Then on Tuesday evening I had my first patchwork lesson of the year (thankfully only once a month as it can get too much), and this time we're doing a small project that won't take up as much time as my as yet unfinished Kaffee Fassett quilt. While I'm honestly not very good at it I continue to enjoy it and am still learning so much!Then on Wednesday I had to talk myself into driving in to work to use the gym there, but I did it in the end, even if it wasn't exactly a hard work-out. I always hesitate to drive in to Geneva because of the traffic and because I have to cross back over to the other side of the lake for my Italian class, which also started back up this week. It all worked out well in the end, and the class is moving along at a fair old pace, but then that suits me as I don't like lessons that to my mind move too slowly. I took some truffles that I had bought over Christmas and then the Polish lady in our group showed up with panettone as she had just come back from Italy! Crikey, it's a good thing I signed up for the 1,000 miles walking group isn't it!PanettoneOn Thursday it was back to pilates also, and I sense she is moving it up a notch as it was quite a bit tougher - or maybe I was just three weeks out from doing any kind of exercise, I don't know. I managed to fit in a hair appointment before heading back to Geneva for the Strauss concert in the evening (more on that in another post) but by golly I ache this week!Today was the day I was supposed to try out snow-shoeing with a friend but the weather turned to rain (so snowing in the mountain) and we decided to give it a miss. But I knew I should try to get out anyway, so took myself off for a one hour walk around our town, but avoiding the woods because of all the mud. Trouble is, just down the road a golden retriever was running loose and he decided he would accompany me - which wouldn't have been a bad thing except the bloody thing kept dashing into the road and into oncoming traffic! One guy yelled at me to put my dog on a leash - so I yelled back that I would bear that in mind if I ever got one! Actually I know who this dog belongs to but (a) I didn't have anything to attach to his collar to get him under control, and (b) it's not my responsibility anyway! It's a shame actually because it is a sweet dog but I fear it'll end up getting killed or at the very least injured if they don't keep him in!Turns out he actually belongs to a neighbour of Stan's. The wife had been married before and had three kids, and then remarried and had four kids with the current husband. I remember going for a coffee at Stan's one time and you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. Apparently her youngest kid was making a nuisance of himself at Stan's, banging on the display cabinets, opening the freezers and messing around, when Stan balled him and his friend out - and then balled the mother out. Quite rightly, I think, he told her that if she wasn't prepared to discipline her kids then he would - and I agreed with him. Her reply was that \"he's only six\", but as Stan said, \"and one day he will be 15 and you still won't be able to control him\". This was the little sod who was coming into my back garden and breaking/stealing my garden ornaments. One lady found him taking stuff from her garage and another found him in her house when she left her door open for a few minutes! And as Stan said, what can be forgiven of a six year old is not funny when he is pulling the same shit as a 15 year old! In fact, he is the reason I put the side gate in to block access to my back garden, as I didn't want him coming onto my property. Stan told me that most of her kids have been given \"special needs\" status - for which she gets an allowance, but he said she needs to start parenting these kids, giving them stability and discipline, rather than drugging them up to keep them docile! Just his opinion but I tend to agree with him as her older kids are so spaced out on medication it's sad to see! She's on to a pretty good thing actually because the allowances she gets for these kids are pretty generous. So generous, in fact, that she was telling everyone at Stan's one time that she had \"retired\" at age 42! One of the men just laughed and said \"no, you just quit your job to live off the State\" and she didn't like it one bit! This is all the more weird actually because one time when I was taking stuff down to the food bank shortly after she quit her job I actually bumped into her picking up food. After that I started going down later to deliver stuff as I didn't want to bump into people I might know!Anyway, it turns out that she recently buggered off and left her husband and their four kids for another man (the youngest kid - the little \"monster\" - would be about 10 now I guess). Said husband is now (apparently) drinking himself to an early death, and hence the dog no longer gets walked but is just allowed to roam free (until he gets hit by a car I suppose). Talk about living in Peyton Place!Anyway, on the cooking side and trying out new recipes, I tried a new (to me) lasagna recipe from the blog \"Good Cheap Eats\" and I really liked it. I don't really make lasagna since the kids moved out but thought I would give it a shot and I like it as it's less runny than my recipe and quite tasty. So score then!I also managed to get a bit of cleaning done today too while having all the windows open, and changed the bed. And that's got to be one of life's joys - getting into a clean bed in a bedroom that has been properly aired. Absolute bliss!"},
{"title": "I guess all you have to do is ask!", "date": "Monday 6 January 2020", "text": "My classes are all starting back up again this week so I had yoga first thing this morning and boy was it good! Even just missing two weeks over the holidays I really felt the difference. I tried to do a bit during the break but it's obviously not the same as a formal class. At the moment this class is, of necessity, quite small as our teacher is giving the classes in her home while she is having a yoga room built in her garden. In fact there were only two of us today so it was almost like a private lesson! The other lady that showed up was Sylvie, who also takes the same Tuesday afternoon class as I do. She is also the lady that asked me if I would be interested in joining the group snow-shoeing outing in February. So this morning I told her that, weather-permitting, I was going to do a trial run with a friend on Friday to see if I liked it, but it turns out this outing was fully booked up before Christmas so we're both too late. I did get chatting to her on the way out and told her that I was going to go walking immediately after yoga because I needed to get a few km in! Somehow we got around to talking about various off-the-beaten track walks that I could do as she knows this area well, having been a primary teacher up in the mountains in the village where my ex-husband lived for quite some time after we divorced. As we were saying goodbye, she asked if I would like to go walking with her sometime - so I said yes! Now she's still working at the moment doing day care for school-age children. She doesn't take babies and won't have children all day, but I get the impression that she will take them before and after school and during the lunch break, so I guess she is somewhat limited to the days she can go walking. But, of course, there are always the weekends and the school holidays so I look forward to going out with her soon.Anyway, after yoga I decided to spend an hour walking around the two small lakes I checked out yesterday called La Motte Longue which are only a couple of km from the yoga class. These were more like \"large puddles\" than small lakes to be honest, with one being exclusively for fishing and the other used as a swimming hole by the locals in the summer. But, this place was situated between the motorway on the one side and the crematorium on the other, so I scored a bit of an own goal by choosing to go walking here - it was hardly the most inspiring of walks! Still, I was already there so I decided to go for it. Three circuits round the lakes bought me an hour's walk and 5,000 steps so I can't complain in the end, but by golly it was cold! My car indicated it was -2°C and in just the short time I was gone the rubber seal around my car doors started to freeze over again. Actually it was so cold that I think if my nose had fallen off the only way I would have known about it would have been by hearing the \"clunk\" as it hit the floor. Anyway, it wasn't the most scenic spot I've ever been to but at least it upped my mileage for the day!Then tonight our sewing club started back up again. There were only eight of us this time as some were sick and some were working but they are all nice so we always have a good get-together. Anyway, one of our new ladies, Marylise, was telling us how she had been walking in the mountains on Sunday and how beautiful it was, so again we got to discussing different places I could go walking without necessarily being stuck with all the skiers, and she asked me if I would like to go walking with her at the weekend on occasion. So I said yes, yet again! It's amazing to me how as soon as you start talking to people and/or asking for their advice, \"something\" comes from nothing and you end up broadening your horizons again and making a new friend!It did dawn on me that having had a couple of weeks with no classes and therefore relatively quiet, I'm going to be out five times during the day this week and four evenings also! Crikey! Tomorrow night I have the first of my monthly patchwork classes so that will be a late night, then Italian classes start back up on Wednesday and then the Strauss concert in Geneva with my friend on Thursday. It's all go again! Actually he has been sick these last few days so I'm glad he got that out of the way before the concert as I think we both would have been disappointed if he had had to miss it!And finally, as I was taking the various Christmas decorations down to my basement I realized what a mess it still as after having shoved so much stuff down there when I had my new floor laid. I guess it's time to get back in the saddle on that too and start shifting stuff and hopefully pitching a lot of what is down there. It's a never-ending job isn't it, but thank God I'm retired!"},
{"title": "Blind faith!", "date": "Sunday 5 January 2020", "text": "As I was getting ready to go out for my walk yesterday my neighbour's daughter called out to me that she had my son, Jordan's, scarf in her car. She and her soon-to-be husband moved into a house they bought together on 20 December and on Sunday Ben, the fiancé, decided he was going to do some DIY to fix a dripping toilet cistern. Trouble is, he soon came unstuck and so decided he would run out to the DIY store to buy what he needed. Oh his faith is touching! Ya see Ben is English and he foolishly thought he could just run down to the store on a Sunday - like you do back home right? Wrong! This is France and mad as it sounds none of those stores are open on a Sunday. The garden centre just might be open on a Sunday morning if you're lucky, but anything else forget it! I always said if I was going to run a store here it would be either a garden centre or a DIY store and I'd make sure to have it open on Sundays because that's when people have the time and the inclination to shop! Now I know much of this is down to France's highly restrictive labour laws but still … Anyway, it left Ben in a bit of a mess, \"the trickle\" having turned into a veritable \"flood\" by all accounts, so Mathilde did what any sane person would do and called my son, the plumber. As luck would have it he was home on Sunday so he went over there and sorted it out for them, and that's how he ended up leaving his scarf at her place!So today I thought I would take a trip out to a small fishing lake about 5 km from here and take a walk round it to keep accumulating my km! I called Jordan and said I would drop off his scarf if they were going to be in and while I was there chatting with them I asked Jen for any nice, easy walks around St. Jeoire that didn't involve going up into the mountains, as I don't want to get caught up in all the skiing traffic! I had seen one walk not too far away and since Jordan drives all over Haute Savoie with his job he was able to explain to me how to get there. But then Jen suggested I might like a walk around the Lac de la Tour/Lac du Môle, which is only about 2 km from their place. So with that she decided she would like to come with me. I'm not too sure how enthusiastic Jordan was but he came anyway, and although the lake is very small it was a lovely walk all the way round. And here's where the \"blind faith\" in the post title comes into it. I had figured it might get pretty cold today (it didn't as it turned out) so I had to have blind faith that I wouldn't slip on the ice and break a leg because I had put on a tatty pair of old long johns that had belonged to my ex underneath my sweat pants! You know what your mom says about always wearing clean underwear - well these long johns were exactly what would have horrified your mom! Anyway, as luck would have it, the temperature stayed above freezing and we were able to have a nice stroll around the lake, followed by a trip up nearer to where they used to live to wander round a ruined château that had been built in the 1300s and which had a spectacular view over the Arve valley.Lac de la TourJordan and JenThe Arve valleyIt was interesting listening to the kids talking about their future plans though. Their apartment is small but very sunny and while I was thinking they would pay it off as quickly as possible and then move to a house, they are talking about keeping it for a few years and then buying a house but renting out the apartment. Makes sense actually, because my thoughts for them and their retirement is to become landlords rather than putting their faith in a French pension, which is pitifully small and only likely to get worse! They're both adamant (Jordan more so than Jen actually) that this is where they want to remain as they both love the region and, as Jordan says, I have everything I could ever want here, and while we don't have the ocean we have enough lakes to make up for it! And he's right! It's nice to see that they are both so grounded though!Anyway, as I dropped them back home Jen mentioned another lovely spot in the mountains that I might like where there are two small lakes you can walk round. So she ended up suggesting that if the weather is good next Sunday we all head up there for a hike. Wow, this walking business could be catching on then! I was also pleased to hear Jen say that she has given up smoking. It's early days yet but good on her. So I told her I was doing Dry January (although I actually started on 26 December) so I reckon with this and the walking challenge we could all end up uber fit by next December!Anyway, around 4 p.m. I headed off towards home but stopped on the way to check out the lakes I had initially intended to walk around. In fact, as yoga starts again first thing tomorrow morning I might head out to these lakes right afterwards for a quick walk as it's supposed to be nice this week also. Then when I got home I saw on my FB feed that just after I had left them a 15 km tailback had developped on that road with all the skiers heading back from their Sunday afternoon skiing, so I reckon I got out just in time!And on a totally different subject - or as my neighbour would say \"jumping from the rooster to the donkey again\" - my mind was drawn back to an event that took place in 1967. I know, I know, trying to corral my thoughts is like trying to herd cats. Anyway, on the \"1,000 Miles A Year\" FB page, someone posted photos of his walk this morning across Cannock Chase in England. And that is what made my mind jump back to 1967 (although I had to look the exact year up, to be honest). You see in 1966 two little girls, aged five and six, were abducted (separately) from the Birmingham area and subsequently murdered, with their bodies being dumped on Cannock Chase. Then, in 1967, seven year old Christine Darby was also abducted from the same area and her body was also found on Cannock Chase. The only lead police had to go on was that they were looking for a grey Austin A55 (I think). So one day, in August 1967, my mom and dad decided to take us out for the day (though I'm not sure where we were headed) and we ended up driving across Cannock Chase. And guess what car my dad was driving? Yep, you guessed it, a grey Austin A55! Anyway, we were pulled over by the police (I remember being terrified) and the officer wanted to ask my dad a few questions. \"Can you tell me where you were on August 5th?\" Of course my dad couldn't (I mean, who could really?) so my sister piped up from the back and said \"I know. It was my birthday and we did such and such\"! True! So then the officer asked my dad what his registration number was (licence plate) and my dad again said he didn't know. Now I was still only eight years old at the time but I piped up from the back seat \"353 HOP\"! And I was right!!! And the only reason I knew it was because it rhymed! Funny how over 50 years later I can still remember that licence number! A man named Raymond Morris was eventually arrested and convicted of the girls' murders and sentenced to 42 years in prison where, I believe, he has since died. Many years later we actually saw that car driving round Birmingham and my dad said it was the best car he had ever owned. Tragic as that situation was, I don't think my dad had ever been so glad to have his two little girls in the car with him that day!"},
{"title": "All gung-ho!", "date": "Saturday 4 January 2020", "text": "I was \"blog hopping\" the other day and one of the bloggers mentioned the UK-based \"Walk 1,000 Miles\" group, so I went over and had a look - and now I'm inspired! I only bloody went and signed up didn't I! I must be mad, or maybe it's just new year's enthusiasm! I feel I just can't keep telling myself \"oh you must get out and walk\" and then do nothing about it although, to be fair, I've already been out walking three times since 1 January for about an hour at a time. I know this is a UK-based group and they of course can benefit from plotting their walks using UK ordnance survey maps, and joining up with other walkers, whereas I can't, but they seem such a nice, encouraging group so I went and signed up for the challenge! The idea, as the name suggests, is to walk 1,000 miles in one year, or in this case, in 2020! Or in fact, in one year from whenever you decide to start. Or walk less if you want to. Basically it's up to you, but the aim of the group, as I see it, is to encourage people to get out and get walking!www.walk1000miles.co.ukI think one of my biggest problems was always doing walks round here and not driving a little ways out to different routes, which is kinda silly actually as I don't mind driving at all. So with that in mind this morning I drove about 15 minutes up the mountain behind my house to a small ski resort called Orange. Technically it is part of my village but being further up the mountain we don't really \"connect\". And when I say \"small\" ski resort, I mean small. It really is for very young children to ski and for those that might want to do a bit of cross country skiing or luging. Not today though as there was no snow, but I suppose it'll arrive soon enough.OrangeObviously, since I have no physical disabilities, walking 1,000 miles in one year shouldn't be that difficult, I mean it works out to only 2.74 miles a day, or 4.4 km in my case. The problem as I see it is that for three months of the year we will be ankle deep in snow, and then for about two months of the year I just want to lie under a stone to escape the heat, so I guess that means that in order to compensate for those times I will have to go on some fairly long walks on the good days! We'll see how long the enthusiasm lasts but I know I have never regretted going out for a walk once I've made the effort to get out the door! Well I almost regretted it today as a ruddy great German shepherd was roaming around up at Orange, chasing after the one or two cars on the road with not an owner in sight. One guy drove all through the village slamming on his brakes and honking his horn trying to get rid of it. I hung back at my car for a while to see what the dog was like and if I needed to jump back into my car for protection. I wish people would keep their bloody dogs in their gardens!! While I like dogs I don't like being lunged at by a ruddy great dog, jumped all over with their muddy paws and in any case, some people, strangely enough, actually don't like dogs, if you can believe it. Anyway, as I set off further up the mountain I heard the car driver giving the dog's owner (who had obviously just let it out \"for a roam\") a mouthful and telling her to keep the bloody thing locked up. Good for you mate!As it started to cloud over and turn cold I headed back home after about 90 minutes to have lunch, but when I looked at how many (few) km I  had done I was disappointed, so decided I had to go out again round the back of my housing plan to clock up a few more km. And wouldn't you know, another bloody dog came lunging and barking at me as I walked up the road. Now this particular dog has done it to me before (it's never fenced in) so I had the foresight to take my walking stick this time just in case. While I didn't need it for protection, luckily, I do think some dog owners need locking up more than their dogs do!The housing plan next to mineThe still haven't take Santa's sleigh down I see!On the \"trying out new recipes\" front, I've been pretty good about that, although I'm rather disappointed so far. I succeeded in making the cheesecake that called for condensed milk, and while it tasted very nice it didn't set solid enough (they said this would be the case) so I won't be making that again. Then I made a potato and courgette rösti which turned out rather bleh, so another no-no. After that a crab chowder which was okay and I'm making stir-fried chicken and broccoli tonight using a lovely marinade I found on Mavis' blog over at $100 A Month! That one was a winner, thankfully!And talking of recipes, as I'm putting my books back on the bookshelf in my living room I'm taking the time to go through them and decide if I should keep or donate them. But I found a Martha Stewart book/magazine which was God-knows how old. I tell ya, if you ever want a magazine that contains 100 pages, of which 50 are advertising, I've got a magazine you can have! Bloody hell, I've no idea why I bought it (I threw it in the bin), but I guess now I know why I don't buy glossy magazines any more. All that advertising!And finally, for Northern Living Allowance, if you read this, I've tried to comment on your blog a few times with no luck, so I guess you have the same problem I do sometimes - people's comments just don't go through, even allowing for the fact that you have \"comment moderation\" on. Just thought you might want to know - I'm not ignoring you. And well done you on buying all the gear for your new fitness regime! Now we both have to keep at it don't we!"},
{"title": "A quiet new year's eve!", "date": "Wednesday 1 January 2020", "text": "Just the way I like it! I stayed home on my own last night and was absolutely fine with it. I've never particularly liked NYE much anyway because when the kids were little I'd be ready to go home around 1 a.m. and my ex would be wanting to party the night away and we'd inevitably end up arguing! Needless to say, he was never the one to get up with the kids the next morning and let me sleep in so we had more than one argument about my wanting to go home and \"could he just quit drinking already\"! So now, in the words of the immortal Frank Sinatra, I get to do it \"my way\"! Well actually I get to do everything my way, and very nice it is too! Anyway, I sat reading for quite some time as I really can't be arsed with the TV and \"the top 100 programmes on XXX of 2019\", but I did at least put my book down at midnight and went outside to watch the fireworks. Our neighbourhood was fairly quiet but I could see the fireworks in town and that was fine by me!Talking of fireworks though, many years ago, before I was married, my mom and dad came out to Geneva for a week in the summer. 1st August is Swiss national day and Geneva always puts on a great firework display for that and for the subsequent Fêtes de Genève, which usually last around 10 days. Anyway, I managed to find a parking place and we walked down to join the throng for the firework display, when all of a sudden I could see my dad flexing and relaxing his left arm. My then (lovely) boyfriend was a medical student and he took one look at my dad and said \"let's get out of here\". My dad had had several heart attacks and bypass surgery at the age of 54, which was a huge operation in those days. Karim explained that the medication they gave heart patients contained gunpowder (I'm probably not getting this exactly right) and the gunpowder in the fireworks was affecting my dad's cardiac rhythm! So we dashed out of there and sure enough dad was much better the further we got away from the lake and the fireworks! It's funny how little things trigger memories though isn't it.Anyway, after the fireworks I went to bed to read but I kept getting WhatsApp messages from friends and family to wish me a happy new year. So as it was almost 1 a.m. I got back up again to watch the fireworks in London on the TV - again lovely, but I wouldn't want to be in those crowds! After that though I was still getting messages from friends sending me the ubiquitous WhatsApp videos - and I hate the bloody things! As soon as I see a \"merry Christmas\" or \"happy new year\" video I just hit \"delete\" as I can't be bothered to watch a dancing Father Christmas jumping around to Feliz Navidad! I guess they get on my nerves because they are so impersonal - just like round robin Christmas letters and those \"deeply prophetic\" (but highly unoriginal) thoughts people plaster all over Facebook! I know, bah humbug right! I actually got five videos from Nacer, my first love when I was 19 and who I got back in touch with last year! Five!!!!! I suspect he was working and was bored!Anyway, this morning I got a \"happy new year\" message \"from Patrick and Dominique\" - and I haven't got a bloody clue who they are! I received a message from \"Dominique\" about a year ago saying that they were off to the Caribbean, so I messaged back and said I thought she had the wrong number. To which she wrote back and said \"no, we met on the bus going to work remember Anna\"! And of course I didn't! I really have no clue who she is, but \"happy new year to you too anyway my dear\"!And that reminded me of an incident many years ago, back in the early '80s. I hadn't been in Geneva long when I met an Irishman called Justin. We were friendly and he was waiting for me outside work one night when this woman dashed up to him yelling \"Justin, how wonderful to see you. How are you doing? Long time no see! And how are your mom and dad? Are they enjoying retirement\" Blah, blah, blah, you get the idea. Anyway, they must have stood there chatting for 10 minutes when the lady said she had to go but \"please remember me to your mom and dad\"! At which point Justin said \"I will, but who are you?\" I nearly died of embarrassment 'cos I would have just faked it but not Justin! It tickles me now but I was mortified at the time, even if he wasn't!Then this morning, as I was switching over to my new 2020 calendar (bought in Cinque Terre) I remembered another incident about 10-15 years ago. A colleague and I shared an office and worked with a guy called J (now retired). I worked more closely with him and we got on okay but we weren't over friendly as he was a moody sod! Anyway, it was about the time that the film The Calendar Girls came out and all of a sudden everyone and his uncle was posing for nude calendars. I guess the first one or two were fun but after a while???? I  mean, do I really need to see a picture of my postman butt naked? Anyway, as I was saying, J was fairly quiet and very moody but we worked okay together. Then all of a sudden he started emailing my colleague and I calendars of naked men! Okay, the first one - yeah, good looking dudes but …. Then in the afternoon, another one! Okay, we'll let that one pass. But this went on for a couple of weeks! I mean, twice a day, nude male calendars! Now between you and me I actually prefer not to see human plumbing in a calendar, whether it be male or female. It's definitely so much sexier if something is left to the imagination I think, but that's just my preference. So one afternoon after a few days of this my colleague looked at me and said \"what the hell is happening? And what do we do about it? Should we have a word with him?\" If I remember right it was around the time that he and his wife split up but bombarding us with these calendars was just so out of character - and such a stupid thing to do at work frankly. He was lucky that my friend and I are pretty open-minded but even so, there is a limit! I would say that there is more tolerance for this sort of thing in Europe than in the US but buddy, get a grip (if you'll forgive the expression)!!!! Thankfully, after about two weeks he stopped, so I guess he either got his jollies somewhere else or he ran out of calendars! But talk about weird!And finally, \"soap making\". Yep, I had a go at that today with disastrous results! I've always been quite partial to some of those pretty soaps they sell at craft fairs, particularly those perfumed with sandalwood, and this morning I realized I had thrown all these odd remnants of soap into a glass jar in the bathroom meaning to do \"something\" with them one day. Anyway, I looked up on Youtube how to make your own soap out of remnants because I have quite a collection of essential oils which I think would make a nice addition to home-made soap! So I got it all \"bubbling away\" gently on the stove, stirring continuously (just like they said in the video), added a few drops of sandalwood essential oil and then waited. And waited! Only thing was, I forgot the first and seemingly most important step. I forgot to grate the soap! I just bunged it all straight into the saucepan and went on from there on a wing and a prayer! Well that didn't work out 'cos I ended up with a huge clump of beautifully perfumed gloop stuck all over my saucepan. What to do (apart from retire from the soap-making business)? So I poured it all into a cocktail shaker and now I have a cocktail shaker shaped bunch of solid perfumed gloop! Oh dear. Anyway, I hacked a few clumps off and shoved it inside my \"shower glove\" - not sure what they call a gant de toilette in English - you know the scratchy kind of glove you use for a friction rub! Well, it worked a treat, lathers up beautifully and the smell is divine! Apart from one ruined saucepan and cocktail shaker, who says the entrepreneurial spirit is dead?From Very British Problems:New Year’s Day possible plans: ‬‪‬‪-Attempt to burn off 50,000 cals by wearing gym kit‬‪-Take a multivitamin‬‪-Buy nonessentials in the sales‬‪-Spend all day on social media like you said you wouldn’t do anymore ‬‪-Pizza/aspirin in bed"},
{"title": "My word for 2020!", "date": "Tuesday 31 December 2019", "text": "Gosh it's foggy out there today! This morning, instead of doing my usual \"slob around in my jimjams while having breakfast and reading the news until about 10.30\", I decided to get up and get moving as I wanted to stop in at the Mairie in our village before they closed at noon. So I bounded out of bed like the decoy hare in the starter trap at the dog races, jumped into the shower and drove the short distance to the Mairie. The young woman there is very nice and she remembered doing me an attestation sometime ago to the effect that I have lived in the village since April 1990, but I told her with Brexit looming I suspect \"they\" would want a more recent attestation. I also asked her if she could do the same for my son, to prove that he had lived in the village from birth (1992) until October 2015, when he moved in with Jen. She said she will have them both ready for me if I want to stop by next week. Other than that, I'm not sure what is acceptable to the French authorities as proof of over five years of residence, given that we haven't needed permits to live in France for many years - and Jordan has never needed one! Yearly tax declarations I suppose, but I suspect an attestation from the Mairie will be easier!As I was on my way out I saw a group of around 30 young men in hiking gear with huge backpacks, so I reckon they were heading up the mountain at the back of my house to camp/watch the fireworks. I reckon it would probably be a 4-5 hour hike up there but good luck to 'em in this miserable weather! Still, a bit of fog is a million times preferable to the horrendous bushfires in Australia at the moment! I see today that 4,000 people are trapped on a beach just waiting for the orders to \"jump into the ocean\" if the fires get any closer! God I hope it doesn't come to that and that Australia (in particular) and California can get a good dousing by some of the rain we've been having here, and that in Europe the rain will dry up long enough for some of the flooding to recede. I can't even begin to think how exhausted the wonderful emergency services must be!After the Mairie I decided to head on down to Cluses, about 30 minutes away, as I will be starting my next round of once-a-month patchwork lessons and the lady asked us to stop by and choose the supplies we will need for our next project before our first lesson on Tuesday evening. Since it's new year's eve the shop was quiet so I got her all to myself, helping me pick out binding for the baby quilt I'm making, as well as advice on making a tote bag Jen would like me to make for her! This lady has wonderful taste (thankfully, as she's in the business) and I just find it so confusing picking out coordinating fabrics and so on. I guess you've either got it or you haven't and I definitely haven't - hence I'm so glad of her help! I was also explaining to her the difficulty I had had trying to quilt my baby quilt so she showed me a proper quilting foot for my machine and it does make a helluva difference. I was also asking her about quilting motifs on borders and she showed me where I had been going wrong there - but I think I'll leave buying that equipment for later. I'm a very slow learner as far as quilting is concerned, so I reckon a few months before buying the next round of accessories for my machine won't hurt. I had a bit of an \"ouch\" moment when I realized how much I'd spent but in the end I reckon it's one of my few hobbies and I generally budget for this kind of stuff so I'm good with it really!When I was in the grocery store the other day I picked up one of those freebie magazines that tells you what's going on in the local area. For some reason I looked at my horoscope (I never read that rubbish), but this one said \"as a Libran you need to get outside more into the fresh air\"! Ha, so I was right the other day then! Actually I also managed to get a walk in yesterday too, up behind the houses where I met the farmer in February. And while it's still not easy going uphill it's nowhere near as difficult as I used to find it, although coming back down through the fields I found the going a bit slippery so I think I'll take my walking stick next time!I also spent maybe a half hour the other night going through all the blogs on my favourites bar and deleting as many as I could. Some bloggers have stopped blogging. Some I found interesting and \"wanted to read them from the beginning\" but never got around to it. For some my taste has just changed, so I think it's good to clean it all up a bit as I wasn't reading them anyway. Just hope I didn't delete any of my real favourites by accident! And talking of blogs, I happened to look at the stats for my blog on Christmas eve (which is something I never do), and I saw that I had 99,998 hits on my blog! I suppose two things spring to mind. How was I going to get two more hits to get to the magic 100,000 mark? And I can't even begin to fathom that people actually read my blog! I started it because I wanted to write down my stories for my boys and never really expected anyone else to read it, but wow! Now if I can just get two more people to read it between now and midnight!!!!!Then on Saturday I used my phone app to submit about €600 worth of medical bills to my insurance provider. Once my 300 Swiss franc annual deductible is met I'm reimbursed 90% of most of the remaining costs, so it was quite a shock when my phone \"pinged\" 24 hours later indicating that they had already reimbursed me and the money was in my bank account! Talk about efficient! I told my former mother-in-law about this the other night when I was chatting with her and she couldn't believe how easy and efficient it was - no quibbling, no hassle! And I have to admit she's right. I pay 174 Swiss francs a month (that's about $174) towards my premium and get 90% reimbursement of pretty much everything after the 300 Swiss franc deductible is met! And the coverage is excellent. Believe me, I know how lucky I am!As I mentioned previously, one of my aims this year is to try out at least one new recipe a week. Well I tried out one which called for slow roasted pork with a garlic and sugar coating - and god it was awful! I managed to save the pork of course but that dressing was just yuck! Anyway, one of my big things lately is to find new ways to cook aubergine (eggplant). Not because I particularly like it but because I find aubergine \"challenging\"! I mean, what do you do to make something that looks like a big black rubbery goose egg taste good (apart from the ubiquitous eggplant parmesan)? Well, as I've been taking my books back downstairs to my bookcase I've made a point of flicking through at least one cookbook a night to see if I should keep it or donate it. Then last night I found a Sicilian recipe for aubergine salad, and since I have all the ingredients I'm going to give it a try later!I'm also making a point of reading in bed for around 30 minutes before I go to sleep and last night, from inside the book I was reading, I pulled out three stapled A4 pages on which I had been making pension estimates and mortgage pay-off calculations since 2014 (I guess I was already that desperate to retire even then)! It made quite fun reading actually because even though I was paranoid in case I had missed something, my calculations worked out bang on and I even ended up retiring two years earlier than I thought possible. To think that I'd finally \"done it\" made re-reading those pages so satisfying!So, back to my word for 2020. I was giving this some thought and again the words \"eggplant\" and \"challenging\" sprung to mind. So there you have it. My word for the year: \"EGGPLANT\"! As you can see, I'm not that deep!Anyway, I'm staying in tonight. Don't want to be out in the fog or on the roads with the crazies, so I'll wish you all a safe and happy new year's eve and all the best for 2020!"},
{"title": "Getting started early!", "date": "Sunday 29 December 2019", "text": "I'm not very good at making new year's resolutions - I always feel they are counterproductive, because by the time I've fallen off the \"resolution wagon\" around 18 January it's kinda disheartening to think I've \"got to wait a whole year to start again\" (mad, I know), so I just don't bother making them, well not on 1 January anyway! That being said, the new-ish year is always a pretty good time to start thinking about what you might like to change in your life I guess. So with this in mind I've already started Dry January (the day after Christmas actually). Not that I was a complete lush over Christmas anyway - I learned that lesson a long time ago - you can't pull off Christmas and everything that entails and dump a bottle of wine down your throat! So I decided the day after Christmas was as good a day as any to start as I don't plan on doing anything on new year's eve anyway! We'll see how it goes, but even if I don't make it the full month, I don't have to wait a year to try again do I!On top of that, I want to get back to walking as this is ideal walking weather as far as I'm concerned. For quite some time I've had a low grade headache just \"hanging around\" fairly constantly. I put that down to the pretty non-stop rain we've had for about a month and not really being able to get out in the fresh air. So today, after exhausting every excuse and delaying tactic I could find to not just get my walking gear on and head out the door, at 2.30 p.m. I realized I finally had to \"just do it\", because otherwise it starts getting dark around 4 p.m. and there are very few street lights around here. So I set off up the mountainside on a route I used to know fairly well but was amazed to see how built up it now is. Oh it's all very pretty because the houses are built on the slopes and look to be fairly expensive I would think, all the more so since the CEVA (the new trans-frontier express train) has now started running from our local town direct into Geneva, so I imagine prices are going to sky-rocket, if they haven't already - I wouldn't know! In fact, my friend took the train in to Geneva the first weekend it started running (14 December) and she said it was fabulous. I suppose hanging on for that train could have been a good enough excuse to do the two extra years at work that I had originally planned to do but nah, I'm good! Anyway, once I realized I wasn't totally sure where I needed to head off into the woodland further up because it had all changed so much, I decided to just turn back and head home the way I came as, like I said, I didn't want to get caught out in the dark as the sun was starting to go down. The temperature was only 3° but that's fine for walking and guess what? My headache has gone (fresh air really is the only solution). Well it might be that, or it is being totally masked by the lack of feeling in my ears and nose! Either way, I'll take it! But at least I got off my backside, even if the circumstances weren't ideal, and got in a 45 minute walk and 4,000 steps!Which reminds me, many years ago my friend was working very long hours on a work project so one evening I suggested to my ex that we went over to her house and walked her two labs into the village just to give them some run time. Now my ex used to wear cowboy boots all the time, but as he was very slim they looked pretty good on him. Cowboy boots are not, however, particularly well suited to the snow (ya think?) so I told him that I would take the younger, female dog and he could take the older, male dog as he was just too strong for me. So we put the leashes on the dogs and headed out the door, but the dogs, having been cooped up all day, shot off like crazy in the vague direction of the village. I was able to control my dog, but the older dog yanked on his leash and my ex and his cowboy boots shot off in the snow looking like he was water skiing! It was so funny I almost peed myself! He, however, didn't find it in the least bit funny, but walking along the village road today bought that image back as clear as a bell! I never asked him to walk the dogs with me again though! Happy days!"},
{"title": "Just lovely!", "date": "Wednesday 25 December 2019", "text": "Everything went just beautifully for Christmas day. I had spent a good few hours prepping food the day before but way too many hours wrapping presents also. Damn, I usually get that done when I buy them but this year I was not as organized on that score. Oh well, that'll teach me!While I was finishing the final prep it was one of those \"It's a Wonderful Life\" moments, where everyone is beautifully dressed, dinner is almost ready and a beautifully made up Donna Reed just has to put the fairy on top of the Christmas tree before Jimmy Stewart dashes in to hold her in his arms (yeah, like those moments just happen by magic). Anyway, I was blasting music when I ended up putting on The Skater's Waltz at full blast. I just love this piece. I remember it being played at the winter Olympics at Lillehammer for every victory lap and was particularly moved when Dan Jansen finally won his olympic gold! Anyway, I was blasting this happily in the kitchen when my kids arrived, unbeknownst to me because the music was so loud. There is nothing to spoil the emotion of the moment quite like when your son, the plumber, leaps into the living room attempting to show his ballet prowess with all the innate grace of a ... well, a plumber! I don't know where I got my love of classical music from. I was definitely a cuckoo as I grew up in a working class home in Birmingham but fell in love with Chopin (watching Frederic March play him was when I knew I wanted to learn the piano), Edith Piaf (was when I fell in love with French) and Strauss (going to a concert on 9 January). It was definitely never played at home so I'm completely flummoxed as to where I got that love from. Needless to say my sons don't share my passion but ... just wait till I get grandkids, I'll show 'em!God I think André Rieu is sexy! He makes classical music fun! There is nothing quite as sexy as an intelligent, talented man. Who cares what they look like or how old they are, but Rieu has that smile too! In fact, I've just been looking up his concert tours for 2020 and see that he has concerts in Maastricht (normal, he's Dutch), Birmingham (my home town) and Zurich in 2020 so that's on for definite!Anyway, I got together with the kids for an apéro while we opened our gifts and I think I really hit it on the head this year. In Colmar I had seen \"puzzles\" so I bought one each for the kids and I swear we didn't need to speak for the next hour! It's difficult to describe the different things I bought but picture interlinking metal chains that you have to separate, or wooden blocks that have a sequence to open them. I knew Jen would like that but I wasn't sure about the others but no, they all kept picking them up and whinging that they couldn't figure them out. But the real pièce de résistance was when they unwrapped the books I had got each couple called Very British Problems Abroad!This must have been a definite hit with André because he didn't put the bloody thing down. He kept roaring laughing and reading out excerpts from the book. Lily actually came in to the kitchen to congratulate me for getting my son to read a book for the first time ever! I told her I know! I sensed that \"this one wasn't a reader\" when I was in the maternity hospital and didn't really want to take him home with me 'cos I think I'd got the wrong one but they made me take him home with me anyway! One that he actually read out to us: \"Never feeling more annoyed than when you've just put out a fresh bin bag before leaving for a fortnight abroad and then SOMEONE eats a banana\"! You either get it or you don't. We roared laughing. In fact, we spent the entire afternoon laughing because last year I had bought them \"Mad Libs\" but they had never used them until today at my place (where they scribbled all over mine)! When I asked why they hadn't used them Lily explained that really you have to be a bunch of people who all speak English (never thought of that - duh), and she's right. Jen doesn't speak English but she was off in a trance trying to untangle some of the puzzles that I had bought but it was so nice to see my boys roaring laughing together - now I can see they inherited my sense of humour.Lily is Swiss and they are not known for their sense of  humour, but she is the exception that proves the rule (thankfully - I couldn't take a dour puss as a daughter-in-law), and she showed me a speech by the Swiss President (whose original language is Swiss German but was speaking in French) about how we \"all need to laugh, because laughing does us good\", all the while looking like one of the stuffed penguins on the balcony of the Kremlin! It was meant to be inspirational but it was like watching Nightmare at the Rue Morgue! By god it was funny! Thank god my son married a non-stereotypical Swiss (as are her family, I'm delighted to say)!Oddly enough it was Lily who asked if we could watch the Queen's speech!! I told her it wasn't even on my radar but if we did we all had to stand to attention - so that's what we did!  It was sweet, and while I remember watching the Queen's speech as a kid I also remember my mom telling me that \"in the day\", you not only wore your Sunday best but you also stood when she was speaking!Watching the Queen's speech - I should have made him take his cap off! And guess what, after so many days of rain, the sun finally made an appearance. We usually get snow but I'll take the sunshine if we can't have snow just for this one day!So I hope you had a lovely Christmas wherever you are, be it quiet or full to the rafters with great company. All the best from a very happy expat Brit!"},
{"title": "Not so organized!", "date": "Monday 23 December 2019", "text": "How can you get to have the whole year \"off\" and have one of the least-organized Christmases ever? Beats me! Actually it's not quite as bad as it sounds because present-wise at least, I've been picking up things throughout the year as and when, but food-wise I seem to have left it the latest I have ever done and I've no idea why! I figured last week I should start giving Christmas lunch some thought and since I hate \"having\" to cook specific things just because it's a specific holiday, I decided that I would make a pork roast as the main dish. I always make potato gratin though because (a) the kids and I love it and (b) I've finally perfected the recipe to my liking after so many years (or as Steve said \"eehh lass ya can cook\", when he ate it last time he was over! RIP Steve my ol' mate)! But I only ended up going shopping for it this morning and there was virtually no pork left! Silly bugger! So I ended up picking up a capon and we will now have a fairly traditional lunch after all (gratin notwithstanding)! I must have been exhausted last night because I went to bed at 11 p.m. in an effort to instil better sleep habits into myself (although I didn't fall asleep until 1 a.m.) but when I woke up this morning it was 10.40 a.m.!!! I can't believe it! So that kinda threw my \"early morning shopping trip\" out the window. Since I also wanted to go to the recycling centre and nothing here is open all day like in the UK or the US, I decided to head out at 2 p.m. when they reopened and then head off to the supermarket (again, no late-night shopping or Sunday opening here for the most part)! That turned out to be a pretty good decision because while the store was busy it wasn't heaving when I got there! I bumped into a friend though and she told me that in the morning you could barely breath, and as I was leaving people were queuing up for parking spaces as the car park was absolutely full and that I've never seen before! But now I know why I usually get my Christmas organized ahead of time!I've decided on two different desserts I want to make, so I'm looking forward to getting my final present-wrapping done tomorrow and then spending the day cooking. I have to say though that I do sometimes get fed up having to look up French substitutes for stuff I need, particularly for baking, when I can't find the UK or regular international products! Condensed milk and evaporated milk are a good example, both of which are called \"lait condensé\" over here, but evaporated is unsweetened. I suppose some might ask why I don't just use French recipes but (and I'm hesitant to say this) French baking just doesn't do it for me. I find it rather dull, unless it's croissants and bread of course! So yep, I'm looking forward to spending time pottering in the kitchen tomorrow, although I suppose there's always the risk that one of my new-to-me desserts ends up a complete failure if I've picked up the wrong lait condensé!While I was having my \"lie in\" this morning (ha, ha more like comatose I would say), I thought I heard voices in my back garden, something which should never happen as I back on to fields and no-one has any reason being anywhere near my garden. Well I guess Agatha Christie I ain't because my neighbour sent me a message shortly after I got up to say that she hoped I didn't mind but her husband and the other neighbour's husband had gone in to my basement and taken my vacuum/aspirator as their basement was flooded! We have had non-stop rain for about 40 days (time to think about building the next arc I think) and neighbour A told neighbour B that my vacuum really sucked up the water well and also that I always left both front and back garage doors unlocked. This might seem weird but I have always told them to just go ahead if they need anything, and in any case neighbour B has had a key to my place for years (as I have for theirs). I suppose I should just be glad they didn't come traipsing upstairs to ask - my snoring would surely have alerted them that I was still in bed! Actually I shut all my shutters every night so that's probably what really gave them the clue I suppose! Still, no harm done!I've mentioned before that the area where I live is called les Champs de Chant, or \"fields of song\", not because of birdsong but because we have loads of underground springs coming down from the mountains that \"sing\" on the way down! While parts of my garden have, on occasion, been very waterlogged, I have never been flooded thankfully, probably due to the fact that a fair-sized drain was put into my garden when the houses were built. Then three years ago we laid piping to further channel the main spring at the back of our houses down to the drains on the village road. What we think happened next door is that the \"village drain\" has backed up and since they have a small drain cover in their basement, the overflow started backing up into their basement, but luckily it is spring water rather than sewage! Apparently they have ankle-deep water in the basement that isn't going anywhere real soon!My friend left for England on Friday, so with that in mind I went over to her house to check on it, but the one area she had a small drip flow problem in the basement had only led to about 10 inches of water dripping into the large bucket she keeps under it. So I emptied that and then went and checked inside her house, but thankfully all is well. In the context of the awful flooding France (and the rest of Europe) has been getting it's hardly serious, but still unpleasant and a worry!And finally, as I was driving home from the shops I saw a sign announcing that la Bénite Fontaine (the church of the blessed fountain) is celebrating its 400th anniversary this month and inviting people to stop in. This is one of my favourite walks and where I pick up spring water to take home, but I had no idea it was 400 years old! I've been inside it before even though I'm not Catholic, but I think once the Christmas celebrations are over I will make a point of stopping in again as it's one of my favourite little churches!La Bénite Fontaine(I've no idea how old this photo is or where to attribute it, sorry!)The spring water source in the groundsAs I'm not sure if I'll get to post again before the new year, I wish you all a merry Christmas and health, wealth and happiness for 2020!

{"title": "Back in the land of the living!", "date": "Saturday 21 December 2019", "text": "If a year of retirement has taught me anything I guess it's that I really need to learn to pace myself a bit better! This past week I've been so tired but it's not surprising I guess really is it, what with the work I got done on the house, four different outings over four week-ends and of course the run up to Christmas! When it all gets too much for me I just basically do bugger all, don't even turn on the computer (hence I haven't been commenting on your blogs) and veg for a few days to get some \"oomph\" back. So yep I probably need to learn to pace myself a bit better. A year's retirement has confirmed to me that I absolutely love it, although if I'm honest I do miss the company of my work colleagues occasionally. It's quite something else to live totally on your own and then not have your colleagues to chat to, but for the most part I'm ok with it. That being said, this near constant rain we've had for the past month would get anyone down, and that's saying something for a Brit! I haven't found the TV to be a problem in retirement - I'm definitely not sitting glued to it - but I do have it on as a bit of background \"noise\" sometimes in the evening. I guess the real problem is the computer. Man, I can stay on this thing all day sometimes so that's definitely something I want to knock on the head in the new year! I have gotten back into reading and also cook every couple of days so I'm glad about that, but I have to admit I do miss having someone to cook for on occasion! Never happy am I?I mentioned previously that we had an overnight trip up to the Christmas market in Colmar (Alsace) last weekend and again it was very good, although the trip up there was horrendous! The wind and rain just roared all the way up but the odd thing is as soon as we got off the bus the rain stopped and the sun came out! Every single time, it was weird! It also wasn't particularly cold given that it's December so it really did work out well for us. We had a late brunch on the way up there (I guess the driver has to stop every so many hours), about four hours to wander round Colmar, and then on to dinner at our hotel - choucroûte garnie (sauerkraut with all the trimmings). I'm not a great fan of sauerkraut but once a year I can enjoy it, especially with that wonderful Alsace white wine!!! But it was a long day so I think we were all glad to hit the sack that night!I love this architecture (Tudor?) as it reminds me of the little country villages back home and oh was everywhere just so pretty (the mulled wine went down pretty well too as we were walking around)!\"Little Venice\", ColmarThe next day we were up in time for breakfast before heading out to the village of Ribeauvillé, which was probably the prettiest on our trip, but not as big as Colmar! I almost made a complete pillock of myself at breakfast though as I picked up a hard boiled egg and some bread but just as I got back to my table I realized they had had boiling water right next to the eggs for you to \"boil your own\". I'm just glad I didn't crack raw egg all over my neighbour!!A real guy - the \"peasants\" were apparently \"revolting\" that day!Not a great picture but the stork is the symbol of Alsace - and look where that one made her nest - right on top of the church steeple!As I say, I think Ribeauvillé was probably the most beautiful of the villages but Riquewihr had the best crafts, so we put a few dents in the bank card yet again, but I really don't mind when it is such pretty stuff!RiquewihrAfter Riquewihr the driver decided to give Kaysersberg a miss in favour of our planned trip to a winery! This was interesting, all the more so when they came round with five different wines for us to sample!!!! It was funny though because on our trip to Cinque Terre earlier in the year we met an older lady and her daughter, and they were on this trip also. Now the daughter had what appeared to be quite severe Down's Syndrome and was, I would think, quite a bit older than she actually looked. Hard work for mom but I can only applaud her there. I tried chatting to the daughter a few times and asked her what she had bought but there really wasn't much conversation to be had. Well, at the winery the daughter picked up her glass and went \"head-to-head\" with every sample before the mother realized! To be honest it was only a smidgeon at the bottom of each glass but she was knocking them back like they were going out of fashion. Mom jumped up and took the glass off her but even she had to laugh at the big smile on her daughter's face after that little escapade!After that we headed back home - our last trip of the year. Next year I think we are looking at Amsterdam and the tulip fields in May but nothing much else right now, apart from our \"ubiquitous\" annual trip to Turin market, probably around May or June time.I'm not sure if I'll get time to post between now and Christmas, so if not I hope you all have a lovely time with your loved ones and I'll look forward to catching up with all the gossip in the new year!

I'm not really surprised, more disappointed of course, but I will be curious to see him lie and bluster his way out of everything now he has to actually deliver on all the hot air he's been spewing! Some people see the massive victory for the Conservatives as a second vote for Brexit, but I don't see it that way to be honest. I think everyone is just sick to death of living and breathing Brexit that they want it done one way or the other! I know I am - and I want to stay in the EU! But I just think que sera at this point! It's funny really because my nephew is a staunch Labour supporter, has worked in the Labour Party archives in Manchester for years and is very politically minded. Always has been, and is very knowledgeable (and pretty interesting to talk to, just like his dad, my brother). But he was telling me before the election that this time, for the first time ever, he was going to destroy his vote because as much as he hates the Conservatives there was no way he was going to vote for Corbyn. Condamnation indeed! And the biggest \"laugh\" (so far - I suspect more Trumpesque behaviour will be forthcoming from ol' Bojo) was that in his victory speech he declared he was \"humbled\" by his victory! Ha, ha, that's a good one. Bojo may be many things but humble will never be one of them. But, on a practical level, I suspect he was the only candidate with the kind of personality (full of BS and bluster) capable of holding his own with the likes of Trump and Macron. I guess only time will tell but either way, hopefully, I'll soon be French and can stop thinking about what a bloody cock-up it all is!In other news, I watched a documentary the other night on the Sally Challen murder case and I have to say it was a rather strange experience. In 2010, after many, many years of bullying and routine humiliation, Sally Challen beat her husband to death with a hammer and was sentenced to 18 years for murder. In 2015 \"coercive control\" became a crime in the UK and her legal team used that new law to ask for her to be allowed to appeal and her case reviewed with a view to having her conviction reduced from murder to one of manslaughter on the grounds of her husband's coercive control. By all accounts, for pretty much the entire duration of their marriage, her husband was a cheat, a bully, abusive, occasionally violent and had raped her on several occasions. While both her sons stood by her only one felt able to be interviewed on camera and it was he who campaigned vigorously for her release, aided by Justice for Women. Earlier this year the charge against her was indeed reduced to manslaughter and she was subsequently released after spending over 10 years in prison. This documentary told her story from the start of their relationship to her subsequent release from prison. Rightly or wrongly I have a lot of sympathy for women (and men) in this situation, having been married to a violent man, and I know how easily a person can be pushed over the edge with the constant drip, drip, drip of abuse and walking on eggshells, but sadly, for me, I found Sally to be a rather unsympathetic person. She seemed almost zombie-like (maybe she was on medication, I don't know), but while I still think it was the right decision to release her, I found it harder to warm to her, and yet felt so much sympathy for her son who had fought so hard on her behalf. Strange!Sally ChallenIn slightly less depressing news, I finally got my Christmas tree put up this week, after getting most of my downstairs back to normal. I hate putting the tree up but I'm always glad when it's done as it brings so much \"sparkle\" to the house.Then yesterday I was invited to a friend's house for an early Christmas lunch between former colleagues. J is a wonderful cook and she and her husband are fabulous hosts and I really had a lovely time. Of course since we had all worked together for years we had so much to talk about and had a really good laugh. She even got hold of Christmas crackers with paper hats and silly jokes in them - the cornier the better. \"What do you call a hen that can count her own eggs?\" \"A mathemachicken\"! I tell you, after a few drinks that joke was hilarious!The gods were also kind to me and I managed to make it all the way back from her place in record time, despite it being rush hour and their house being about 60 km away on the other side of the lake!Tomorrow my friend and I are off on our final trip of the year to the Christmas market in Colmar. It is one of the biggest and best known markets in France and is supposed to be beautiful. It's not an area I know too well, although I have spent time in nearby Strasburg, so I'm looking forward to it, all the more so since we are staying over night. So despite another early morning start we don't have to trek all the way there and back in one day! Photos to follow I suspect!And finally, I do my Monday morning and Tuesday afternoon yoga class with a lady called Sylvie, who I like very much. On Tuesday afternoon the \"Présidente\" of the yoga club said that they and the hiking group were organizing a snow-shoeing outing up in the mountains behind my house in the new year and that anyone interested in going was to let her know by early January so that they could book the restaurant up on the plâteau. So Sylvie came over and asked me to go!!! I've never been snow-shoeing in my life, I tried cross country skiing once and hated it, I'm totally unfit, and despite all of these ladies being older than me guess who will most likely end up being \"tail-end Charlie\"! But Sylvie virtually begged me to go with her \"as it would be such fun\" (yeah, right). But stupid old me is actually thinking about it! I know I need to get some kind of aerobic exercise going and signing up for this would give me 6-8 weeks to do something about my abysmal fitness level but …. Damn, I must be mad for even considering it!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 10 December 2019", "text": "Saturday night we had our latest board game evening at Jordan and Jen's house and as always it was a very nice get together! As usual we took way too much food but … what can I say … it was all very good! I made \"confetti rollups\", brownies and bara brith. Bara brith is Welsh for \"mottled bread\" and since I knew Jen likes that kind of spicy flavour I decided to make it for her, even though I'm not overly fond of it myself. My mom used to serve it with butter but I took cream cheese (any excuse for extra calories I guess), and as there was some left over Jen took it to work - and now the nurses at her work have asked for the recipe! It seems kinda funny to me to think that nurses in a French psychiatric hospital will now shortly be making Welsh bara brith! We also did a secret santa and I received an \"escape room\" game that we may be able to use at our next evening. I'll have to check out how to play it but it does look fun. We decided that we might try to have our evenings \"themed\" in future, and since the next one is on 8 February I'm thinking carnaval might be a good theme, so I'll start looking out for an outfit, just in case.I didn't get home until 1.30 a.m. and I was pretty tired next day, so it's just as well our next day trip didn't set off until 1 p.m. on the day after! They are happening thick and fast at the moment but there's not much we can do about that as so many of the trips we selected are \"Christmas-related\". This trip on the Sunday was back to Lyon for the Festival of Lights. We got there about 4 p.m. and had a few hours to just have a wander before setting off on a short boat trip along the river Saône.On the boat we were all given a map of Lyon with around 30 different \"points of interest\" highlighted, so my friend and I shot off to \"point 1\" way up the hill in the old town, and what a bloody trek that was, although luckily it wasn't particularly cold and the rain held off. Or held off, that is, until we got to the top of the old town and then it started, just in time to make our run back down to the river(s) over the cobbled stones quite a hair-raising gallop! But we had to keep going as we realized we were running late to meet up with the group for dinner - you haven't seen anything until you've seen two tubby middle-aged women trying to speed down cobbled stone walkways to make it in time for dinner! Again, the food was very simple but very good. As we were eating I kept glancing at the older man next to me thinking \"I know him from somewhere\" but couldn't place him. Eventually a blond lady said \"hallo Anna, how are you, and are you still doing patchwork\"? and I realized that she was in the patchwork club I used to go to on a Monday night when I was still working, but had stopped when they decided they no longer wanted to open up the clubhouse in the evenings. The white-haired gent, as it turned out, was the husband of the lady President of the club, Colette, only she hadn't been able to come on the trip as they had a quilting exhibition going on at the same time! Then, the husband of the blond lady was saying how he wished he could speak English as he spent so much time at Company XX in Geneva ... and my friend and I both burst out laughing as that is where we used to work! We had a colleague who had a terrible accident about five years ago and is now quadriplegic, but was determined to come back to work and now comes in one day a week. He obviously needs support and the gent at our table was his regular assistant on his work days and also, I believe, in his personal life for his basic physical needs! It's a small world isn't it!Once it fell dark the different light displays were indeed amazing, but I have to admit it was all a bit much with the heaving crowds. In the city centre the police had it well organized, keeping people pretty much obliged to follow one-way foot traffic in order to avoid a crush situation, but it does get very wearing in the end, so after a couple of hours we just went to a bar for a drink and to wait it out! There were loads of young people on the side streets selling mulled wine or hot chocolate and it was all very good natured. Lyon really is a vibrant city and yet again it was a pleasure to visit, crowds or no crowds! (A couple of the photos below are google images because I obviously couldn't get high up enough to shoot some of them!)When I checked my phone on the way back I had clocked up over 14,000 steps in just one afternoon/evening so it's no wonder I felt tired, all the more so since we again got home at 1.30 a.m.! Think I'm too old for this stuff, especially as I had early morning yoga the next day! But I made it!On a totally different subject I see the latest series of \"I'm a celebrity get me out of here\" has just finished! I actually had a shot at watching 10 minutes of it the other week but I felt like I needed to wash my eyes out with bleach even after just such a short time! Dear god alive, what won't some people do for money!!!! I've never seen such crap in my life - well all of the reality shows to be honest - urrghh, I'm so glad that's over until the next time and I don't have to hear or read about it in the media for a while, even though I obviously voted with my TV remote and didn't watch it for more than those 10 minutes! What crap TV!And finally, my neighbour came round the other day all of a \"tither\" as they had received a notification from ENEDIS (probably the largest electricity company in France) informing them that their (external) electric meters will shortly be replaced with \"Linky\" meters, and they are all up in arms! Supposedly the Linky meters are \"not good for people who are hyper sensitive to electrical waves\" (or something like that). Seems it's been on the TV for a while but since I don't have French TV I'd never heard about it. But if my meter belongs to ENEDIS and I have no legal say in the matter, I say just get on with it, do what you have to. I mean, the bloody thing is outside anyway! I believe, although I'm not certain, that the new meters can be checked remotely and so will no longer require a meter reader to go house to house! My neighbour was all up in arms because \"do you want ENEDIS to know all about your electricity consumption\"? Say what? As long as ENEDIS don't think my electricity consumption is indicative of the fact that I might have a cannabis farm in my basement I really couldn't care less what they know about me! So I said, \"you've got a mobile phone haven't you?\" To which she replied of course, so \"why are you worried about an external electricity meter when you hold that thing to your ear half the day\"? And she couldn't answer me. I happen to think the world of this neighbour but oh the French do seem to like to get their knickers in a bunch sometimes!"},
{"title": "A new friend!", "date": "Sunday 8 December 2019", "text": "Yesterday, as arranged, I met up with Ginette, the lady I got chatting to at the market a few weeks ago, and we decided to go have lunch in town. She's obviously very thorough because she'd phoned five different restaurants to find out what their set menu was - I always just rock up and go from there - but we ended up at a very nice restaurant built into the walls of the old medieval town of La Roche. I had been there many years ago with my ex and while the food was good it was a bit \"fancy\" for me. I like something less fussy than \"battered courgette flowers\", so somehow I ended up never going back. Apparently it has changed hands several times since and I have to admit the latest owner seems to have gotten it just right! Very good food, not enormous portions (that grosses me out) and very reasonably priced! He had a young trainee working with him who, we found out later, was only 14, and at one point we could hear the owner giving him hell in the back kitchen! \"Do you call that clean, you've got to move faster, there's loads to be done\"! I think we all felt kinda bad for the young lad actually and as we left we asked him to go easy on him as \"we were all young once\". But the guy said, quite rightly I guess, that \"our\" generation grew up having to work for a living - real work - and he just couldn't get his head around how so many young people today were allowed to just skate along and do bugger all, and then \"call mommy\" if things didn't work out for them! He's absolutely right, but I have to admit that while I had to work for everything I wanted because we were a large family with not much money, I/we allowed our kids to \"just skate\" quite a bit and I'm not sure that was doing them any favours! That being said, my kids are both hard working and respectful so I guess we did something right. It's odd because Jordan went into plumbing later than most kids because he had done a commercial course beforehand, and I remember him telling me that some of the younger lads in his class needed a good kick up the backside - they were lazy, occasionally disrespectful and were always on the verge of \"calling mommy\" if they didn't like the way they were spoken to! This wasn't the majority of them of course, as I remember at the awards ceremony how respectful the kids were to their teachers, but some of them even got on Jordan's nerves for being \"precious little snowflakes\"! Studying plumbing? Seriously?After lunch Ginette suggested we go for a walk around the park at the back of the château as it was such a lovely day - my favourite kind of weather actually - crispy cold but with bright sunshine - and would you believe in the 30 years I've lived here I've never been to that park. It was lovely! So we had a wander and she showed me a path through the woods that would bring me out nearer my home, although I'm not totally sure I would go walking in the woods on my own, to be honest! But we sat in the sun and had a good old chinwag, and she turned out to be a very nice lady!Looking towards my house from townShe was married briefly many years ago (he cheated on her so she divorced him), and has had a couple of partners since, the latest lasting three years, but she was explaining to me that she wants to get out of the relationship. They don't live together but she said he is lazy, demeaning, mean with his money and lies constantly. Sounds like a real catch huh! They met at the dance club they both go to and she said while it's great to have a dance partner she is fed up of him and worried about how to get out of the relationship. Like me she's not interested in ever living with someone again and sadly, it seems, so many men of her age (she's 72) end up looking for a nurse, and possibly a purse, in their later years while, in my experience, the women value their independence. And I agree with her absolutely in not wanting to take that on! You put the effort in for your spouse and your kids because you take the bad times with the good, but to take on that kind of \"hassle\" in later years for someone you're not even that fond of sounds like more of a \"lead swimsuit\" situation to me! It's amazing though how some people just open up I find. Maybe she just needed somebody to talk to, I don't know, but she pretty much ended up telling me her life's story. I don't mind in the slightest but some people might find it weird I guess!After our walk she suggested we go check out the local library, and again, I've never been to it in the 30 years I've lived here! That's not surprising though really as I'm used to a huge library in Birmingham, where I'm from, so these little local libraries don't really do it for me. Plus everything is in French and while I read in French, by choice I will always read in English. On top of that I must have at least 150 books sitting looking at me waiting to be read right now - no kidding - so I really don't have much use for this library. But, what a stunning place it is!View looking towards the Mont Blanc chain from inside the reading roomAnyway, we said we'd meet up again when we're both free and the weather cooperates as she seems to know some good walking routes round here, so I shall look forward to that!In other news, on Thursday they called a national strike in France to protest against the pension reforms Macron is trying to introduce. I know, I know, they're always on bloody strike - that's why I never use Air France and never fly through Paris if I can help it! It's that bad! I don't really understand the ins and outs of it all as I don't have French television (I will never be that masochistic), but my neighbour was explaining a bit about it to me on the way to yoga the other day and I understand the situation a little better now at least. She was saying that one of the things Macron is trying to change is the pension de reversion, or the surviving spouse's pension. Under the current system, if my neighbour's husband dies she would get just over 50% of his pension (I can't remember the exact figure), which would give her €1,400/month as a widow. It's not much to live on round here but she said she could probably just about make it as their house is paid off. Under Macron's new scheme that would go out the window, to be replaced across the board with a widow's pension of €1,000/month - and there's no way she could manage on that! And I agree, that would be more than tight in this region, even without having to pay a mortgage! This is over-simplifying the subject but basically Macron's plans would involve people working longer for lower pensions. The current situation is, of course, unsustainable (as it is everywhere), but from what I hear Macron is going about it completely the wrong way and, as my neighbour says, what would a former investment banker know about struggling on a tiny pension? Nothing right! I don't know how the issue will be resolved but one thing I know for sure is that my son who works in France as a plumber shouldn't count on living on just the state pension when he reaches retirement age. Just like in the UK, it isn't a viable wage. For him/them, I think the way to go is to buy a small property, do it up and rent it out for additional income. Round here, given the proximity to Geneva, you will never lose out going into the property market. But it's tough out there - and again I'm so eternally grateful to have a decent pension and excellent health insurance. Frankly, the alternative doesn't bear thinking about!"},
{"title": "Viva Italia!", "date": "Sunday 1 December 2019", "text": "I knew it would only take a couple of decent nights' sleep for me to get the ol' mojo back and it seems it's true. I was so tired last week, what with all the home improvement stuff, but I know myself well enough to know that just slowing down for a couple of days will really get the energy levels back up. It's a pity I wasn't able to do that when I was working though because, as most working mothers know, there is rarely any \"free\" time when you have kids, a job and a home to run. Now though, that has all changed and I really am starting to realize that I can do bugger all if I want to. Not that I want to do \"bugger all\" very often, but yep, that's now always a possibility, I'm glad to say!I'm slowly restoring the downstairs to its new \"norm\" and sorting stuff to take to the charity shop, hopefully sometime this week. Already it feels easier to breath, even though there is still a lot to be done. The basement can wait till later but that will also have to get sorted at some point too. Still, when you have visitors you don't all sit in the basement do you, so it is, at least, a horror I can hide!Anyway, on Saturday we had the latest of our jaunts to Italy, this time to an outlet village near Turin. We again went with GAL Voyages as we have been very happy with them every time. That being said, it meant getting up at the ungodly hour of 4 a.m. to be ready for the \"off\" at 6 a.m. I knew there would be a lot of interest in this trip - \"shopping\", you see - so it was no surprise that they had laid on four buses and each one was full, so over 200 people! We made good time, hitting the Italian border an hour later, and positively waltzing down the Aosta valley with virtually no traffic! It was amazing - the snow held off and Italy seemed to have closed up shop for the day! Once through the valley we always stop for breakfast - a quick 30 minute potty stop and a chance to grab a coffee and croissant - and by 10.30 we were pulling into the parking lot of the outlet village, where ours were the only buses there! There were obviously cars in the parking lot but I was really quite amazed at how empty the place was, bearing in mind this was the weekend of \"Black Friday\"! There is such a push to introduce Black Friday into Europe and while some places are following like sheep, in my experience many people just can't be arsed, and that certainly seemed to be true of this mall! It was a Saturday morning and I would say it wasn't even as busy as an English high street on a Monday morning! In fact, when my friend and I stopped at the information centre for a map they asked us which travel company we had used because they were obviously keen to encourage more visitors! (I did a quick calculation in my head and if everyone on our buses spent an average of just €200 like we did, our French contingent alone would have spent €40,000 in one day - but many people will have spent more of course! And again - and I always do this - put that into the context of Brexit and the effect reintroducing borders will have on the French markets if/when the Brits can no longer shop freely just across the border in France!). Anyway, back to the plot! The thing is, most of the shops here were all designer and high end fashion shops and there was, indeed, a queue to get in to the Michael Kors shop, not because it was full but because they were only letting a few people in at a time. Other than that, it was extremely uncrowded and pleasant. What's more the sun was shining and the temperature was warm enough to leave our coats behind - now that in itself was heaven after what seems like non-stop rain for the last month!As I said, it was pretty much high end fashion, although with the Black Friday sales on, so a three inch handkerchief that passed as a skirt went from €350 to maybe €200!! Oh I'll take two then shall I! Anyway we had a wander but the clothes shops were rather lost on us because (a) neither of us are in to \"that snobby stuff\", (b) we didn't even like most of it, but (c) even if we were, neither of us exactly have the figure for it - and that must be the understatement of the year! I swear most of that stuff was created using a stick of spaghetti as a pattern! In any case, even when I did have a good figure I always looked at that kind of money as \"another holiday\" rather than a €300 handbag. Some people can and do carry it off well but that was never me. But do you remember my colleague berating me recently about how it was all right for me being able to retire as I was a higher grade than she was (despite the fact that she had over 30 years in the pension fund to my 20), and then telling me in the next breath that she goes down to Italy every weekend during spring and summer to go clothes shopping! Not that she has the figure for Italian clothes either - she's much bigger than I am - but she spends all her money (and then some, I imagine) on clothes. She's what I would call a \"blousy blond\" (except she's not blond) and spends a ton on make-up, hair products and clothes (or \"on with a trowel and off with a blow torch, as my dad would have said) so no wonder she has no money and \"can't retire\"! Still, each to his/her own in that respect I guess, but don't come complaining to me that you can't retire please!Anyway, just beyond the designer clothes shops we came to the Lindt chocolate shop and bugger me if you didn't hear a collective orgasm as people walked into that shop! Just the smell of the place was divine and the set-up fabulous. The interesting thing is I counted 28 different flavours of Lindor chocolate balls and yet in Switzerland, the home of Lindt, I have only ever seen three! Go figure! So I bought a few ready-packed bags of mixed chocolates to give as presents, then set about picking out my favourites as I want to scatter them on my dining table at Christmas, they look so pretty!Turin Outlet VillageOn an only slightly related note, I remember many years ago - maybe around 1981 - my mom was taken seriously ill with pleurisy and ended up in hospital. I was living in Switzerland already and couldn't do much from my end except phone every night to see how she was doing. Lindor chocolate balls were not available in England then so I bought a huge box of them and mailed them to her. She said afterwards that she got the equivalent of private treatment on the NHS as the doctors and nurses kept buzzing round her bed to see if she \"needed anything\"!!Around 12.30 we stopped and went to a restaurant for lunch. We weren't particularly hungry so I just had a beautiful salad with tuna, mozzarella and so on. Their menus were in Italian, English and French (and everyone spoke at least Italian and English), but it tickled me to see on the English menu that my salad consisted of \"fresh tuna salad with tomatoes and a buffalo\"! Little things please little minds I guess! But since I was indeed being good and not having any wine I decided to have desert and ended up eating the most delicious meringue glacé I have ever eaten in my life! Seriously! It had chewy meringue on the outside with solid ice cream on the inside and a little jug of hot chocolate sauce to add to the decadence! Honestly, I would have licked my plate if no-one was around!My friend had the tiramisu and also said it was the best she had ever eaten! When the waitress came to take our plates (with me desperately hoping I didn't have chocolate sauce and icing sugar on my nose), I told her how wonderful it was, so she pointed out the young chef who had made it and I gave him the thumbs up! I've been scouring the internet today for something that might resemble it as I think I might give it a try sometime soon! When we paid we left a generous tip (although tipping over here is not even mandatory), and as we went to leave the girl at the cash register shouted out \"mancia\" (tip) and all the wait staff shouted back \"mancia\". Seems that's what they do when someone leaves a good tip! We just laughed and thanked them for a lovely meal!I managed to choose a couple of nice things for my sons for Christmas and a good quality pair of winter boots for myself - fur lined and with 4 wheel drive tracks on the soles in anticipation of the snow! Ha, and to think I used to wear short skirts and high heels! They were on sale and they were giving an additional 30% for the second pair, so since my friend also bought a pair we put them together and got an extra €20 off, which we split, thus both getting a pair of excellent quality boots each at a very good discount!I have to say that there is a certain joie de vivre about Italy. Of course it's not all pink clouds and kittens but they do seem to have a lust for life that I find very appealing. Certainly anything relating to food and drink always has flair and since we are all born and we're all gonna die sometime, I think it's lovely to make the bit in the middle as full of joy as possible!We headed back towards France at 4 p.m. and stopped again at a service station just before the Mont Blanc tunnel in order for people to use the bathrooms and get a coffee and so on. But get this, there then ensued a veritable stampede of our fellow travellers heading for the cigarette section and while we were supposed to be back on the bus in 40 minutes we ended up leaving late because people were still waiting to pay! I have no idea how much cheaper cigarettes are in Italy than in France, but I have to say I'm just so glad I don't smoke as I would have hated to be caught up in that stampede just to buy a few cancer sticks!With yesterday turning into a really long day, I was glad of a lie-in this morning, but when my friend told me that she was going up to a craft fair at Passy (to support our yoga teacher who was selling hand-made jewellery there) I said I would go with her, despite the renewed rain and mist. But this little fair was also very good - better than I expected actually. I picked up a dream catcher (I've always wanted one), some maple syrup, a Christmas tree ornament, hand-made Christmas cards and bought a pair of earrings from my yoga teacher. There were a few men and women dressed in traditional costume too. On the way out we bought locally-produced goat's cheese and again, it was just fabulous! (As you can see, one of my main interests seems to be food so it's maybe no wonder I can't fit into Italian designer clothes is it)! But tomorrow I'll be back on track with my various classes. Even having missed yoga for only one week, I am really looking forward to it!They almost look Amish don't they. And you can just begin to see the snow line out the window behind them!"},
{"title": "Soft as a baby's bottom!", "date": "Friday 29 November 2019", "text": "I just got back from my second visit to the spa in the next village and again I have to say it was a real treat. I didn't grow up having \"beauty treatments\" and getting my nails done because it just wasn't like that for us. We were poor and when I got my first Saturday job I had better things to spend my money on anyway, so all this \"messing about\" goes a bit against the grain for me personally. But in the end I just thought \"stuff it\", if I don't do it now then when - and in any case, there ain't no pockets in shrouds! All that to say that I am still a little uncomfortable being \"pampered\", although I'm sure I'll get over myself! But ladies, have you seen those disposable knickers they give you to put on, \"to protect your modesty\" I suspect. Oh man, those things look more like dental floss for the bum (and I'd probably get more coverage out of that). What's more, I never know whether you put the two inch triangle on the back or the one inch triangle!! Again, you can take the girl out the country but ….Then you have to try \"hopping up\" onto the bed with some kind of dignity while \"the girl\" holds up a large towel in front of her, ostensibly for the sake of discretion, but I reckon it's so she can have a good ol' titter behind it! Still, I made it, at which point she proceeded to rub me all over with a body scrub (felt like being sand-blasted), but I have to say she was very professional and it did feel good. After that you have to get into the shower to wash the Sahara desert out of all the weird places before she then rubs chip fat \"their mystical beauty oils\" all over you. Yeah, I know, I'm a pleb but I have to say my skin feels wonderful so I'm gonna keep going! This ritual humiliation, though, is made all the worse by the fact that most French women are slim and me? Not so much! So I've now decided I'm gonna give up booze at least until Christmas in a bid to try to lose some of my blubber (although since we're heading off to Italy for the day tomorrow I do wonder about my timing sometimes)! Not sure it'll work but if not, I'm still shameless enough to keep going back for more abuse! In reality, I'm sure they've seen it all before and they certainly are very professional so maybe the \"humiliation\" is all in my mind. Yeah, that's probably it! I do remember many years ago, though, going for my one-and-only fake tan attempt (again in the dental floss disguised as knickers). When we got to the bit where I had to hold my boobs up so she could \"get underneath\" I swore I'd never go back - and I never did!But talking of \"silly\", I saw this joke today and it tickled me so I sent it to my friend.Paddy and Mick are walking down the road and Paddy has a bag of doughnuts in his hand. Mick says he's starvin' so Paddy says to Mick: \"If you can guess how many doughnuts are in my bag, you can have both of  'em.\"With all due apolo … nah, sod that! Anyone who's ever seen Dara O'Brien will know that the Irish have the greatest sense of humour! So anyway, my friend wrote back and said that he has just been invited to an open house/drinks do and was asked to bring along \"booze and nipples\" as his contribution! That shouldn't be too difficult I guess!On another note, I know I've always been naive, but I think I'm slowly \"coming of age\". But still, I was somewhat shocked to learn that the RNC had paid out $100,000 to buy copies of Trump Jr.'s book! Way to make it to the best-seller list I guess, but seriously? Which reminds me of the court battle a couple of years ago between the repugnant, to me, Charles Saatchi and his then wife (I think they were still married at the time), the lovely Nigella. The court case had to do with alleged theft by two of their employees, but the trial was quite an eye opener. One of the \"highlights\" of the case was when a \"private\" text message between the two of them - in which he referred to her as \"High-gella\" - oops - and the fact that she had once taken cocaine when her first husband was dying - \"accidentally\" became public knowledge. Assuming that was indeed a private text message and it was never in her best interests to have it become public knowledge, it makes one wonder who on earth could possibly have leaked it! What came out of that trial for me, though, was that (a) Nigella wasn't exactly the desperately busy single mother dashing home from a hard day's work to effortlessly put together a dinner party for 30, but also that (b) she came over as a very generous and likeable person - quite the opposite of Saatchi! What also came out during that trial, though, was that after his book was published, his two assistants were sent around London in a taxi to buy up all copies of his \"best-selling\" book! Well colour me gullible but I never realized that happened! And talking of \"gullible\", someone once told me that the Oxford English Dictionary had decided to delete the word \"gullible\" from its latest edition because of lack of use! Can you imagine that!And finally, somewhere in all my travails I seem to have lost one of my lovely wooly slippers. There just might be a suspicious looking \"bump\" under the new tiling by the front door, but I do hope somebody didn't do a \"Jimmy Hoffa\" on it!"},
{"title": "Christmas crackered!", "date": "Wednesday 27 November 2019", "text": "That's \"knackered\" in Cockney rhyming slang, just FYI! Well my new floor is all done and I have to say I'm very pleased with Saint Maclou yet again. They show up when they say they will, I stayed out of their hair as much as possible and they did a very good job. There has been a slight problem with my \"generic\" skirting boards in the living room though because my original tile skirting boards were larger than standard so they had to put the generic on top, and they're not really deep enough! I actually don't mind too much but in some places there is a gap at the top of the skirting board where the new ones don't meet the wall completely, so I will have to put some kind of foam down there to fill the gap. For the time being though, I just want to get everything cleaned up and back into some kind of order! But otherwise, I'm very happy with them again. What with getting the new heating put in, then emptying and cleaning out the kitchen and now this, I don't think I'll be getting any more home improvements done before the spring (bathrooms, I'm looking at you). And this week I've given my exercise classes a miss as I wanted to be here on site and I'm just too tired anyway. Next week I'll be back at it though! All I want to do right now though is sleep!The kitchen is actually very nice - but it still needs painting and decluttering (again)!Glad I chose the mosaic style though!As I mentioned previously, my friend and I went down to the local \"old fogies\" fair in town on Sunday as we wanted to pick up the latest prospectus from GAL Voyages. Next year they are putting on quite a few trips, Norway/Denmark being of big interest, Holland in the spring (in time for the tulips), Slovenia in autumn (that's a maybe), Brittany …. plus loads of day trips. Right at the moment I haven't got the energy to start figuring out what I want to do but a couple of days of no hassle and I'll be back bouncing around like a kid on too many \"E\" numbers I expect!There was another fair going on at the same time with fancy wine, cheeses and sausages (from Italy), organic stuff and the the ubiquitous salesmen trying to \"invest\" my pension money (sorry mate, I've just spent it all - you can stop by and see my new floor though if you like)! My friend and I just headed out of Dodge once we got to that end of the fair. But on our way back home I saw the \"homeless\" guy who was hassling me the other night and his \"poor leg\" that required that I drive him in to town and give him money looked pretty good to me - in fact I don't think I could have kept up with him if I tried. My friend said she'd seen him around quite a lot and he can be a pain, although I would say that was an understatement!Moving on, I was saddened today to hear of the premature death of popular British chef, Gary Rhodes, at the young age of only 59. As far as I know he wasn't ill so at the moment it's a bit of a mystery what happened, but still, 59 is way too young as far as I'm concerned. I have a couple of his cook books but to me they were probably a bit too \"intricate\", particularly when I was working. Having a 12-hour working day/commute I just didn't have the time or the inclination to put more hours into cooking, but the few recipes I did try turned out very well. But still, very sad all the same!Gary RhodesAnd then just yesterday we heard of the death of a colleague, also 59, who died on Saturday of cancer of the liver!!! Bloody hell! He was a nice guy and a \"health nut\" - didn't drink or smoke, clean living, a runner, and here he is gone in just four months start to finish! I tell you, T's death hit a little too close to home. He will be missed as he genuinely was a nice guy!And finally, on a more pleasant note, to all my US friends out there, I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving and get to enjoy being with your loved ones. I know I'm probably a grinch but as I get older I enjoy \"formal\" celebrations less and less and informal, spontaneous get-togethers all the more. I guess there's less pressure for everything to be perfect isn't there! But still, enjoy that turkey (yumm), pumpkin pie (berk, sorry, just can't do it), and enjoy the company of those you love!"},
{"title": "Walled in!", "date": "Friday 22 November 2019", "text": "St. Maclou (the flooring people) showed up at 8.15 a.m. this morning so they were off to a good start. The main guy was French and I'm not sure if he's done work for me before - I seem to vaguely remember him. Turns out he lives in St. Jeoire so when I told him that Jordan and Jen had just bought there he said he might know him, being as these trades often end up working together. Said he would look out for him! He bought \"Mr. Muscle\" with him, who had been contracted to help with the heavy lifting and getting what was left of my stuff into the garage, and guess what! It all fit!! I'm delighted as I really didn't want to have any of my stuff left outside over the next four days (even if it was covered up) as it is cold and damp at the moment. Mr. Muscle was from Kosovo and I think he might be just starting to learn the trade. Either way, they worked very well together, were polite and efficient, and four hours later they were done for the day!The main guy had told me that I had to chose whether I wanted to be \"cemented in\" or \"cemented out\" because once they had put down the agréage - aggregate? (the best translation I can think for that is \"cement patching\" - you know, what they put down to level the surface off), I had to leave it to set for about seven hours. At first I thought I might go in to Geneva for the day but in the end decided I would just stay home, so they cemented me upstairs with a baguette, a chunk of cheese (and a bottle of wine if I'm being perfectly honest) and that's where I stayed from noon to 7 p.m.!! It wasn't even that bad actually as my TV room is upstairs and I also had my sewing machine, computer and books so it was actually rather nice to have an excuse to do absolutely nothing for a few hours!I sent my friend a photo of my living room and he said \"damn, you could have set up camp at my place\"! Nice timing dingbat! It would have been nice to see him but I wasn't going anywhere after mid-day was I! It turned out ok in the end, but my neighbour had told me that when they laid their new floor about 35 years ago they had to leave the cement to set for 48 hours so they ended up putting a ladder up against their external balcony and climbed in and out their bedroom window that way!!! I kinda hoped the products they would be using had improved since then and thankfully they have. Can you imagine me climbing in and out of my house over the bedroom balcony at my age!! That'd be a picture for Facebook!So the workmen knocked off for the day at noon and the fitter called me this afternoon to confirm that he will be back to start laying the floor at 8 a.m. on Monday morning. Uurgghh! I'm really not a morning person, so I told him if I was still in my PJs to just let himself in (he burst out laughing so I guess the French might be starting to get my sense of humour)!It's weird though because it's amazing how big downstairs looks with no furniture in it. And that, I think, is all the more reason not to put some of the stuff back once the new floor is down isn't it! A good time to declutter methinks. And, with all my stuff pulled out and stored, I don't think my place has ever been so clean, nor will it ever be again I suppose! That being said, I'll be glad when it's done and life can get back to normal - just in time to start thinking about decorating for Christmas eh!Tomorrow my friend and I are off into town to the exhibition centre as I received two free tickets for the \"Cap Senior\" fair. GAL Voyages sent me the tickets (this is the bus company we do many of our trips with) and they will be there and handing out their new programme for 2020. I know Norway and Denmark are on their agenda but I don't know about the rest so we'll see if anything sparks our interest. It is a bit weird, though, to be getting invitations to \"senior\" events!!! Crikey I don't feel that old but then I guess, technically, I am a \"senior\". Apparently when I'm 65 I'll start getting invitations to the free \"seniors\" Christmas lunch in the village too! I imagine it's a lunch because everyone has to be in bed by 6.30 p.m.! Oh well! I wonder if they provide someone to chew your food for you if it's tough!"},
{"title": "Raging boar!", "date": "Thursday 21 November 2019", "text": "I had my Italian class last night and was almost home, just reaching the outskirts of my village, when I ran into a wild boar! Well five of them actually. There are no street lights on that road so everything was pitch black, but I was driving slowly enough that I actually saw them crossing the road ahead of me and was able to swerve enough to just miss them - well four of 'em! Turns out there was a fifth one clambering his way up out of the field and I hit the bugger - or more exactly, he hit me with an almighty thump! He wasn't that big and wasn't even moving that quickly but the impact was pretty impressive, although I didn't stop to chat! There was a car coming the other way and he must have seen what happened so I pulled over but by that time they had already disappeared into the field on the other side of the road. Oddly enough, in 30 years of living here, this is only the second time I've seen wild boar, and it was also on this very spot that I saw deer last year, but only once! Weird that, considering how rural it is! I didn't get out of my car as I didn't want to try and get friendly with a wild boar with a bad shoulder and a grudge, but when I got home the damage didn't seem too bad - that is, until I looked at it again this morning. He must have hit towards my passenger side door and has indeed dented the body work as well as the front bumper. I suppose I'll stop in at Ford to see what they think and then decide if I want to put in a claim on my insurance. I intend to run this car into the ground so I'm not that bothered about a few dents but if the insurance will pay up I may get it fixed if my car won't be off the road too long. If not, since I don't consider my car a status symbol or a \"reflection of my virility\", I'll probably just leave it. It could have been a lot worse I suppose!Ugly, bad tempered buggers - but can you imagine running into five of them!Oh, and I see that ol' \"Air Miles\" has seemingly spoken to mummy and she graciously accepted for him to withdraw from royal duties for the foreseeable future\" (and thus give up his £250,000 royal income). Ha ha, about bloody time too, particularly with all his charities' sponsors dropping him like a hot turd! Not that I think he, the parasite or the offspring will be getting real jobs any time soon though, but I suppose we could always start a \"gofundme\" page just in case. Wouldn't want them to have to rough it like we mere plebs would we!"},
{"title": "Royalty!", "date": "Wednesday 20 November 2019", "text": "Well the never-ending news headline at the moment is the ongoing story of Prince Andrew, his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and whether or not he had sex with underage girls! Of course the story isn't exactly going to fade gently into history any time soon (nor should it be allowed to), but his car crash \"reveal all\" interview the other night did him no favours at all! By all accounts, not only did it do him \"no favours\", but showed him to be what he apparently is - an entitled, boorish, arrogant, unempathetic dick!!! His ex-wife, \"the lovely Fergie\", as always stands resolutely behind her ongoing meal ticket ex-husband and was, apparently, the one who told him to \"go for it and get the truth out there\"! Yeah, well anyone who listens to Fergie for advice on how to be media savvy probably deserves each and every flying cow pat coming their way! And this is the same Fergie who, when caught a few years back trying to flog access to Andrew for £500,000 to a fake Sheikh (undercover journalist), eventually went on \"Oprah\" for a \"tell-all\" interview which ended up about as \"grueling\" as being savaged by a toothless kitten! Even more of a joke was that when they finally got down to the so-called nitty gritty, Fergie then started to refer to herself in the third person - \"she didn't realize what she was doing, she made a big mistake\". I guess if you refer to yourself in the third person that means it wasn't really you then right????One of the things that really jumped out at me in this whole Prince Andrew debacle though was that \"mummy\" apparently provides him with \"pocket money\" to the tune of £250,000 per year, on top of his £20,000/year military pension (and also, I imagine, on top of any money/advantages/living accommodation he receives in addition to the freebie junkets \"Air Miles Andy\" used to enjoy). So no shortage of money there - well not to my eyes at least, but then I guess we have different ideas of what it means to be \"rich\" don't we! Anyway, as I was saying, what jumped out at me was that Andrew apparently went to Epstein a few years back to ask him for money for Fergie in order to get her debts restructured! The Epstein bail out turned out to be in the amount of £15,000! That's all! £15,000!!! Now don't you think if you had your fingers in as many pies as Andrew seemingly has that you wouldn't have to go to an Epstein to beg for £15,000 for your parasitic ex-wife?? Beats me! He could have come to me - I would have been able to rustle up a little something for \"poor Fergie\" - you know, the one who would show up to the opening of an envelope if there was a free buffet!!! Gawd, how the other half live!And then there was the recent brooha over a cosmetic surgery clinic trying to suggest that if you got plastic surgery chez eux you too could end up looking as fresh as Kate Middleton! The media (the Palace?) immediately jumped all over them for trying to infer that Kate had used their services but the clinic did turn out to be where Fergie had had a facelift and other \"rejuvenating\" treatments. Crikey, if I was managing that clinic Sarah Ferguson would be the last person I'd want advertising my clinic!Fergie - aged 60!And talking of aging badly, I saw pictures of the celebrations for Monaco's national day and blimey, haven't they aged badly too! Now this isn't just me being bitchy because I'm certainly no oil painting, but these women have had access to the top stylists/make-up artists/hairdressers and so on all their lives and haven't exactly worked their fingers down to the bone in the local factory before catching the number 25 bus home have they! As they say, \"fine feathers make fine birds\"! But seriously, if they aren't an advert for staying out of the sun I don't know what is (although a lifetime spent smoking probably doesn't help either)!Caroline - aged 62Stephanie - aged 54Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking getting older, but what shocked me was the state of their skin - the wrinkles! Maybe it's just my fat face but those wrinkles really jumped out at me. I think Princess Caroline has always been a beautiful woman (as is her daughter, Charlotte) and certainly the others have looked good (with the right help) but wow, stay out of the sun ladies. It's a killer!And finally, there's Princess Charlene, who has to be the unhappiest looking princess I've ever seen! You know, the same Charlene who was apparently prevented from boarding a plane out of the country at Nice airport just before her wedding to Albert - that Charlene! Now I have a theory that the reason why she (and Victoria Beckham) never smile is because they have diddy little teeth that no amount of cosmetic surgery can alter. But poor Charlene's eyes just never seem to smile, and as they say, a smile that doesn't reach the eyes will never be a real smile will it!"},
{"title": "The bogey man!", "date": "Tuesday 19 November 2019", "text": "Yesterday morning I went to my early morning yoga class and as always it was great! For the second week in a row she worked mainly on our arms and shoulders and I can still feel the effects of it today. Aching muscles but very positive! The gent who came for a \"try-out\" a few weeks ago actually came back too! I really didn't think he would as it can't be easy being the only man amongst a group of women, but nope, he came back after a couple of weeks' absence for a trip to Thailand. On the way out I asked him how he found it and he said \"initially I was pretty skeptical as I'm usually full speed ahead, but it has really been a pleasant surprise\"! I figured since he was pretty sporty he wouldn't be able to take the slower pace of yoga but like he said, it is working different muscles and the relaxed feeling he gets afterwards is just great! Nice huh!Then when I got home I spent maybe an hour shifting more stuff out of the downstairs rooms, either upstairs or down into my basement, so downstairs is nearly empty now in anticipation of the arrival of the workmen who are coming to start prepping for my new floor on Friday. Well, first thing on Friday they will be shifting the big stuff I can't move on my own into my garage before prepping the floors in order to start work on Monday. I'm pretty sure all my remaining stuff will fit in the garage, but if not I may have to put a couple of things under my external balcony, cover them over and pray for reasonable weather! Then my neighbour took my lawnmower and bike down to his shed so we're almost hot to trot. A couple of weeks ago I had bought the paint to paint my kitchen before the new floor was laid but that ended up being a non-starter. I just haven't got round to it which, if I'm honest, is pretty ridiculous as there really isn't that much to paint. Actually, I'm in awe of people who decorate \"this room this weekend and that room next weekend\", when I can't even get my arse into gear for one room. But I know that's how I am. It will get done eventually but all on my schedule. It's almost like I need nine months and a bunch of Lamaze classes in order to get even the smallest DIY project started!!Then last night I went to sewing club. Since I had the two additional sewing machines I had bought for club in my car I got there pretty early so I could make two trips up to our club room with all the gear. As I was unloading my stuff I heard footsteps running towards me and turned round to be confronted by a heavy set guy, about 40 years old, asking if I would drive him in to la Roche!!!!! He told me he was homeless, although he was nicely dressed and looked clean enough (not that that means anything) and \"would I take two minutes to run him back in to la Roche\"? When I said no, I have to be opening up the rooms for our club he started to become pretty insistent. \"It would only take you two minutes, and you could open up the club room later\"!!! So I told him it would only take 10 minutes for him to walk in to la Roche, or two minutes to walk to the main road where he stood a better chance of being picked up, to which he replied that he had a bad leg, but I said it didn't look too bad to me, given how he had run at me when I parked my car! But he kept on and on and when I continued to say no he then switched and asked for money. I again said no, and to leave me alone as I had to open up the club rooms. So then he grabbed my sewing machine and said \"let me help you\", at which point I balled him out, said to put my stuff the f**k down as the damn sewing machine was probably worth more than my car! At that point I knew I wasn't going to be opening up an unoccupied three storey building with psycho here trailing me so I decided to stand outside to wait for more people to show up. Keep in mind I was alone, it was pitch black and only just above freezing!! But I thought, \"nope buddy, I'm not going anywhere with you on my tail and if you think you can freeze me out you haven't got the measure of me. I actually like the cold\"! So I stood there for 20 minutes with him harassing me constantly for money or a ride back in to town. He eventually went over to the club building and tried the doors (which of course were still locked) and then pretended to leave but I saw him hide behind a wall right next to the front door. So then he came back and asked me to open up just for him to get warm but I told him the Mairie would take my keys off me if I let him in and I wasn't about to let him in anyway with a bunch of elderly ladies arriving shortly for club! Now normally on Monday nights there is also a choir that practices in the same building but for some reason it didn't look like it was on last night so I ended up on my own with the jerk!After a while two younger guys pulled up in a car. I would say they were about 35 and they seemed to be looking something up on their phones. Eventually he went over to them and started asking them to run him in to town or to give him money and they both refused. So I'm thinking \"here I'm saying to myself don't be mean and take him in to town and two young men are refusing this guy\"!! I must have been mad to even entertain it!  Eventually Patricia, our teacher, showed up and I was able to drag her back to my car to pick up the other sewing machines and explain to her about creepy guy. So of course he came over and started in on her and she just kept telling him no. Once he realized he was getting nowhere with us he then went over to another, older lady who was just parking her car and started haranguing her. I told Patricia we couldn't leave her on her own to deal with him so we held back until she got to where she needed to go. Once we got inside Patricia said that just wasn't on so decided she would call the gendarmerie. Within about 10 minutes they had sent a patrol down and I think they pulled him over and started questioning him, judging by what some of the later arrivals were saying, but I'm not sure. In the meantime, we kept the front doors locked as he would definitely have come in (and how would we have gotten him out later?) and Patricia opened the doors up as each of the ladies arrived! Now I was a bit shaken at first being out there for 20 minutes with an aggressive guy. I told him he would be better off on the main road (which was literally a two minute walk away) and in any case no woman would give him a ride - all the more so since he smelled quite strongly of alcohol! But afterwards I just got pissed off. And that was quite reassuring (to me at least). I just felt if need be I would take a swing at him - although he was obviously younger and bigger than me - but it was reassuring to know that I wasn't afraid of getting hurt. And that, I guess, is a sad reflection on being married to a violent man. In the end I wasn't afraid of the violence - in fact, when he was \"slugging away at me\" I didn't feel the pain, to be honest. Oh sure, I felt it the next day but in the moment I wasn't afraid. And that's how I felt last night. Bring it on buddy if you must! Thankfully it didn't come to that but geez, all I wanted to do was get some sewing done!!!!And talking of sewing, I tried quilting my baby quilt by machine. Hated it so I unpicked it. Re-did it by hand, and it was still bunching so I unpicked it again! So in the end I spent 20 minutes being harassed by an asshole and two hours getting nowhere with my quilt. Next week, when it's quieter, I'll probably take a trip down to Cluses to see my patchwork teacher so see what she suggests in order to just get the darn thing finished!And then when I got home, I read for a bit on the sofa before getting in to bed to read for a while longer. And bloody hell, at 12.20 a.m. my damn phone rang with an incoming call from Morocco! Now I've been getting these calls for a while - two rings and then they hang up so I'd guess it's just a random computer dial-up. And as routinely as they come in I just as routinely block them but you obviously can't outrun these computer dial ups! I wasn't as mad as I probably should have been because I was still up reading, but about 10 minutes later I put the light out and went to sleep, only to be woken up at 1 a.m. by the same bloody thing! Now this time I was furious and eventually turned my phone off (which I didn't want to do as I wasn't sure if my alarm would work with the phone turned off). Either way it didn't matter in the end as I was awake by 6.30 a.m. as I had to go in to Geneva today. But add that to the three or four \"random\" calls I get on my home phone each day (which I don't answer and also keep blocking as and when), I'm starting to feel like it would be nice to get a break from \"freaky\" for a while!"},
{"title": "Another week has flown by!", "date": "Sunday 17 November 2019", "text": "I don't suppose it's just me, but crikey don't the weeks seem to fly by! It's Sunday night as I'm writing this and yet before I know it it seems like it'll be Sunday night again, with the rest of the week just whizzing by at a rate of knotts!So what's been happening? I was reading an article this week on Sky News where they had followed-up on the very sad case of a young stowaway who had fallen from a plane over London earlier this year! On 30 June a flight from Nairobi was heading to Heathrow airport in London when the body of a young man fell from the plane's fuselage, narrowly missing a man lying in his back garden reading. He said there was a terrific thud and this poor young man hit the ground just a few feet away from him! They are saying that he would have been dead long before he hit the ground - I certainly hope for the poor guy's sake that that was the case!Sky wanted to find out who this young man was and what led him to take such a dangerous, and ultimately deadly, risk! Through a bit of investigative journalism they managed to identify him as a 29 year old Kenyan named Paul Manyasi who worked as a cleaner at Nairobi airport! His partner was able to identify the backpack he had with him on the day he went missing but wasn't able to say whether it was pre-planned or simply a tragic spur of the moment decision! He/they lived in a shack in a slum near the airport, earning just over £2 per day. Apparently the cleaners' contracts were routinely broken just before they accumulated six months' service thus preventing them from being given more stable contracts! Now where have we heard that before??? But looking at the abject poverty they lived in I absolutely understand the desperation that would have pushed this young man to take such a tragic decision!Paul ManyasiThe shanty town where he livedComing just shortly before the discovery of 39 Vietnamese illegals found dead in the back of a truck in England it really makes me question life's inequalities, or maybe my own complacency - who knows! What I do know is that I absolutely understand these people wanting to escape their dire circumstances, and let's face it, they must be pretty dire to take such risks don't you think! Speaking as someone who has been an immigrant for the last 40 years, albeit a legal one, I really feel for these people, and am eternally grateful to have been born with the right to have the passport that I have! Now I didn't leave England at the age of 21 looking for better material circumstances. I left because I couldn't stand the bloody weather. Just sitting at home on a grey Sunday afternoon listening to Songs of Praise droning away in the background I just knew I was getting out of there - and I did! But I was lucky enough to have the right skills, and, as I said, the right passport to be able to do so. The fact that materially my life also improved tremendously was just an added bonus, but who can even begin to imagine walking in these people's shoes? Seriously! I don't know what the solution is, and I know that countries can't just keep on accepting immigrants willy-nilly, but understand? Yep, of course I do!In less depressing news the weather finally picked up again this week, although the snow is creeping ever closer of course. As I was running out to the bakery on Tuesday before heading off to yoga I actually pulled over to try to get a quick picture of the mountains and how pretty they were. I don't always think to pull off and take a picture but this time I managed it!Looking over towards the Mont BlancThe Môle - Jordan and Jen now live on the other side of this mountainJen told me at the beginning of the week about a fabric store called Savoie Tissus which is closing down, so I decided to take a quick trip down to Sallanches to have a look around - and came out with some lovely patchwork fabric at a pretty good discount! Fabric for regular sewing wasn't so much in evidence but for patchwork - score! And today, they held the semi-annual \"Fabric Fair\" in La Roche, where the sellers come down from Holland and Belgium to sell their wares. I'm not sure they were necessarily much cheaper than what we can find locally but the selection was just wonderful - although I was very restrained and only bought a couple of small items! Give me too much choice and I'm scuppered! Then my bloody microwave also managed to blow up on me (I know, more first world problems right!) but since I use it a lot I decided to run back down to Annecy and buy a cheap replacement. I don't really use my microwave for much other than reheating so I didn't need a fancy, expensive one, but again, how lucky am I that I can do these things without giving them much more than a passing thought!And talking of spoiling myself, on Friday I went to a new (to me) place in the next village for my first facial in about five years and it was lovely! So much so that I've decided I'm going to splash out every few weeks and treat myself to some kind of treatment there - whether it be a massage (that's coming up next) or a manicure or whatever. What with Brexit still hanging over our heads I've decided I won't be going on a warm destination winter break until it's sorted so I may as well use some of the money and treat myself!Then on Thursday I ran out to a town on Lake Geneva called Thonon-les-Bains, which is just 10 minutes from Evian, where they bottle the water. Our sewing teacher had ordered a couple of second-hand sewing machines from her contact there so I volunteered to run over and pick up two new (to us) revamped machines. (I guess it had to be me anyway since I'm the one with the signature rights to the Club's account). Patricia was telling me I would like the shop owner as he was a bit of a \"Nutty Professor\" type, and boy was she right. The place was jam packed with sewing machines in various states of repair and he was jumping around looking for this, looking for that, and wondering \"where on earth he'd put …\"! But he was a nice chap and I think we have come away with two fairly decent new machines for the club, although finding his little shop in the middle of old town Thonon was no mean feat!Old town ThononAnd finally, on Friday I received an email from our Pension Fund Secretariat to inform me that my pension was going to be adjusted upwards by 0.1% (!!!!) as from 1 January to reflect the cost of living in Switzerland. (Since I take my pension in Swiss francs they use Switzerland as my reference and not France). Wow, I can't believe that (a) I've been retired almost a year and (b) my pension is going to go up by a massive 4.6 Swiss francs per month (that's not even $5). No wonder I'm throwing my money around with such gay abandon at the moment! But all joking aside, how lucky am I to be able to do just that!"},
{"title": "The Prince's Trust", "date": "Monday 11 November 2019", "text": "As I said yesterday, every so often I see a story in the newspaper or on TV and I think \"oh I must write about that\" and then I end up getting side-tracked. But this story I felt I just had to write about - however late in the day - because I found it so touching!The Prince's Trust was started by Prince Charles in 1976 \"to help vulnerable young people get their lives on track. It supports 11 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed and those struggling at school and at risk of exclusion.\" They have various programmes to assist young people to get back into the work force, start their own businesses or just get their lives back on track!One of the young men helped by The Prince's Trust was a young man from Birmingham named Hezron Brown. When he was just five years old he fell into a bath of boiling water, burning himself badly. In her panic his mother ripped his T-shirt off him and ended up stripping the right side of his torso of most of his skin. This was the trigger for bullying to start at school, which he \"dealt with\" with outbursts of violence and anger. He fought constantly with his mom, she would kick him out and then take him back, until eventually, at the age of 13, she kicked him out for good. He stayed with his sister for a while and then ended up homeless, before falling in with local gangs where he \"experienced the camaraderie and friendship which was missing in his life\"! Things spiralled out of control, with him managing one time to outrun a group of about 30 armed gang members who wanted to \"do him in\" by virtue of the simple fact that he was in the wrong post code area!!! That was when he realized he was on the road to a life (and possibly death) of violence and crime! He was eventually arrested for robbery but, swayed by the encouraging report of his social worker, the judge decided to \"give him a second chance\". Through The Prince's Trust he was able to get a job at Birmingham Repertory Theatre and then went on to work at the National Citizen Service as a youth worker and motivational speaker, encouraging kids to take a path in life other than that offered by gangs!Earlier this year he was told that the media would like to interview him about his motivational speaker role, with the interview to take place at Prince Charles' home at Highgrove. While they were setting up the cameras there was a knock at the door and Prince Charles walked in - and informed Hezron that he had won the Young Achiever of the Year Award! Well to say he was shocked would be an understatement. He was stunned, shook Prince Charles' hand and had to keep wiping away the tears. He was later interviewed by Sky News and proved to be an articulate and eloquent young man - a real pleasure to listen to - and hopefully a motivation for other young people who maybe haven't had the best start in life to take the right path! It was a story that moved me greatly, and I just hope that he and his mother made up and are in each other's lives again! And kudos to the judge that gave him a second chance! What a lovely young man he turned into!Hezron Brown and Prince CharlesOn this Remembrance Day, never to be forgotten!Dad - WWIIThe grandad we never knew, fought and injured in the Dardanelles, WWI"},
{"title": "And in other news ...", "date": "Sunday 10 November 2019", "text": "I had meant to write about this previously but then I end up going off on a tangent and I should know by now where that leads me! Nowhere fast! But I wanted to comment on the fact that both abortion and gay marriage were legalised in Northern Ireland on 22 October! I am pro both, although feel very strongly, obviously, that abortion should never be considered an alternative to contraception. I had heard about this legislation rumbling its way though the corridors of power in NI but never fully understood what had happened until now. It was easier for me to take the text from France24 news rather than type it all out, so here's what happened.The relaxation of the UK-ruled territory's restrictive laws on the issues occurred at midnight (2300 GMT), after a deadline elapsed for local lawmakers to stop the changes imposed by MPs in Westminster.British lawmakers in July approved decriminalising abortion and creating lawful access to abortion services, as well as rolling out new regulations to allow same-sex marriage and civil partnerships.They gave Northern Ireland's assembly—suspended since January 2017—until October 21 to institute alterations to the reforms, which will see the province broadly match the rest of the UK.The assembly was briefly restored on Monday, but without support from opposition parties, they were unable to constitute an executive and pass any changes.So on 22 October both became legal, along the same lines as the rest of the UK, and I'm delighted! Abortion, in particular, is a very divisive issue and I understand people's rejection of it, but rich women have always been able to have access to abortion anyway, while poorer women have always had to deal with the consequences of unwanted pregnancies! I remember watching a very moving episode of \"Call the Midwife\" once on this very issue. The series is set in the poorer areas of London in the 1960s. One family had five kids (I think) and were living in one room, unable to even adequately feed the children they already had. The wife got pregnant again and in desperation went to a back street abortionist as both she and her husband knew they couldn't cope with any more children. The problem was the abortion failed and so a few weeks later, in desperation, she tried again - with almost fatal consequences. In fact, in the programme, they lead you to believe that she did, indeed, die, only for you to find out later that she survived and the family moved out of London and its grinding poverty. It was a lovely programme because the nun-midwives at Novartis House were obviously completely against abortion, but understood exactly what grinding poverty and too many mouths to feed was doing to these people. I know people will say that in this day and age there shouldn't be unwanted pregnancies but contraception can and does fail, rape and incest happen, unviable babies are conceived and the life of the pregnant mother is sometimes in jeopardy so, while wishing there were never a need for it, I am absolutely pro early abortion. The fact that gay marriage also became legal was totally overshadowed by the abortion issue though, which was quite sobering to be honest, but I am so happy that this piece of legislation has finally gone through!In other news, I decided that I wasn't going to go shopping this week because I have so much food in the house that it's just a nonsense to keep shopping every week just because. So I didn't hit the supermarkets and it's amazing how much food I have in store when I really get down to looking at it all! I did run into the next village of St. Pierre on Saturday because I wanted to pick up some stamps so I stopped at their Saturday morning market and bought some fruit and eggs, but other than that I don't actually need anything! So a win-win situation there then!Tomorrow being Armistice Day it's a holiday in France, although I suspect not everything will be closed. Jordan and Jen are both off so they are coming over for a couple of hours. I asked Jordan to bring his tools because the radiator in my bedroom isn't working and I suspect it just needs purging, but I know he will take care of it pretty easily. In any case, I have let Max know, but if Jordan can get it sorted so much the better!I'm still moving stuff out of my living room either upstairs or into the basement. This weekend I moved a couple of my outdoor plants/bushes into the garage to protect them from the frost before I get the chance to \"bubble wrap\" them for the winter! It's just as well actually because we have snow at 1,000 metres already and since I live at 800 metres it won't be long before we start getting hammered I suspect. It's already on the mountains at the back of my house, and very pretty it is too - I just wish it would stay there! I follow the \"Département de la Haute Savoie\" information site on FB (this region is called Haute Savoie) and they posted today that getting snow at the lower altitudes this early has given a very welcome boost to Christmas ski bookings already! I'm glad because when the resorts don't get the snow they lose thousands!I'm not sure which village this is - it was taken from their FB site!Other than that, I really haven't done much this weekend. I finally got a baby quilt I started ages ago almost finished and I'm very pleased with the (almost) end product. But, seeing how many hours I have put into it already, I can understand why it might be impossible to put an honest price on some patchwork creations if you took into account the hours of work that go into them, as opposed to those creations that are made as a labour of love - which this one is. I'll show it to you when it's totally finished though!And finally, I see a few bloggers have been \"hit\" by some vile troll who seems to be doing the rounds lately. Well if it is some guy banging on about how well he \"got his knob polished\" in 1985, it seems he has found his way to my blog too. Not to worry though, I just hit delete, and he can keep polishing his knob to his heart's content - probably in his mommy's basement I suspect!"},
{"title": "A busy week (again)!", "date": "Saturday 9 November 2019", "text": "My classes have started back up again after the school break and I'm back to being pretty full on - and I'm okay with that! Monday started with my early morning yoga class, and by god I soon realized how much I missed it! I felt like I'd gained 20 kg and turned into Lot's wife after just two weeks' absence. But I soon got back into the swing of things and thoroughly enjoyed it! It sets me up for the week actually! Then on Monday night it was back to sewing club and for some weird reason we are now at full capacity, our numbers having gone from eight to 20 this year. That really is the maximum number of ladies we can accept into the club, I feel, taking into account the space each of us needs for our different projects. So \"full house\" then, for the first time ever for the sewing club apparently! I was chatting with Patricia, the teacher, and she was telling me that two out of the three sewing machines that belong to the club are pretty naff (although most people bring their own machines anyway) so I took the \"executive\" decision to buy two new second-hand machines for the club and get rid of the naff ones! Patricia contacted her supplier and I will be heading off out to his place to pick them up next week.I spent Tuesday morning lugging more stuff out of my living room and up into the back bedroom in anticipation of having my new floor laid soon. By 1.30 and realizing I was running a bit short of time, I jumped into the shower and then went to slather my usual body cream on before heading out for my yoga class with my neighbour, but I picked up the wrong bottle and ended up pretty much basting myself with sweet almond oil! I didn't have time to take another shower so sponged off what I could but half way through my class I realized I felt (and probably smelled) slightly like a Thanksgiving turkey! Oh well, at least I've got skin like a baby's bottom now! I asked my neighbour how she felt after the two-week break and she said stiff, \"but I wouldn't give up my place for a cat\", which is the French way of saying she wouldn't miss it for the world! I'm so glad for her! So then I asked her if she would now go on her own even if I didn't go, did she feel comfortable enough with the other ladies? I should have known better, because while her answer was \"yes\", she said she hoped I wasn't going just because of her, that I wasn't sacrificing my time for her!!! Oh cripes!! I should know her better by now! Mrs. \"I-don't-deserve-anything-good\"!!! So I explained to her that I was going because I wanted to take two yoga classes a week and not because of her!! Maybe if I keep hitting her over the head with a metaphorical hammer she will one day realize that yes, indeed, she does deserve to do nice things for herself! Then on Tuesday night I had my once-a-month patchwork lesson, which was our final lesson on how to assemble a Kaffe Fassett mystery quilt. Our teacher has been providing us with a new \"section\" of the quilt each month for 10 months, with instructions on how to make each block, but we won't know what the final quilt will look like until the end! We have made some changes to the basic blocks though in order to \"jazz it up\" a bit! To be honest, given how much we paid, I find the fabric a little disappointing - coordinated of course, but not some of the most exciting fabric I've seen! So yes it's a mystery quilt but I have to admit I'm not overly impressed - well, not considering all the work and money that will have gone in to it! But, and here's the good news, I've made such a cock-up of some of the blocks because I just can't cut straight/accurately! Seriously, I'm useless, and while you can work around covering up some cock-ups, I may have gone beyond that point! That, however means, that I've got to get creative to try to salvage some of the blocks and so my teacher suggested I cut all the \"rubbish\" blocks down to odd shapes and appliqué them on to additional, brighter (and much more to my taste) fabric to give it a different look. So that's what I will be doing (if I ever get the bloody thing finished). Oddly enough, one of the ladies took one look at what I will be doing with the \"wonky blocks\" and said that she would like to have done the same thing, to liven the quilt up a bit. As I say, one lady really wasn't impressed with the fabric provided and I think we are all fairly meh with it, but I'm hoping mine will finally come together when I get it all done, wonky blocks and all!That's not my quilt - but just an idea for \"wonky blocks\"! Pity I've got about 30 to make!Then on Wednesday I went in to work to use the gym/see my friends, had a drink with my friend and then shot off back to the other side of the lake for my next Italian lesson. I told you I like being busy! Thursday - pilates class - and I feel the instructor is starting to up the ante just a little, making us work just that little bit harder, which isn't a bad thing! At one point, to strengthen our lower backs, she had us lying on our stomachs, arms off the floor and then lift our head, shoulders and upper torso - which was fine as far as the head and shoulders go, but \"upper torso\" - forget it! I was telling my friend about it and she subsequently sent me this picture! Nice friend huh!And finally, Friday we had a pre-planned trip for a \"gastronomic tour\" of Lyon. Lyon is considered the gastronomic capital of France and is only a 90 minute drive from La Roche! Actually, many moons ago before I was married my then boyfriend and I went down to Lyon regularly to see friends of his who were studying there (and who still live there, I believe)! So while we had a \"students' eye view\" of Lyon it was still lovely! It's a beautiful city with such a lot going for it! What's more, after pretty much two solid weeks of rain, the clouds cleared and we had an entire day of sunshine right on time!LyonWe spent the first couple of hours wandering round les Halles de Lyon, which was right up my street! The best translation I can think of for les Halles would be \"undercover market\", but it is more of a luxury market rather than your run-of-the-mill market! They have les Halles in Geneva too, of course, and while the produce there is superb, I would probably have to sell a kidney to be able to afford to shop there! But we had a wonderful time exploring all the great stalls - people were already sitting down at 11 a.m. eating oysters (and snails!)! Beautiful place!After that we had lunch in a relatively famous bouchon called chez Paul! A bouchon is a typical small Lyon restaurant known for its good food. (A bouchon is also a traffic jam or a cork, but not in this case, obviously)!When they talk about \"gastronomic\" food, in this instance I would say it is more \"peasant food\", based on the wonderful ingredients available locally. Lyon, being situated in east central France at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers, it lies at the crossroads between northern France and the southern mediterranean region. Also, not being that far from Italy, it was one of the first regions where Italian cuisine was introduced into France! An interesting feature of our trip around les Halles was when we were introduced to the concept of les Mères de Lyon (the Mothers of Lyon), who were the ladies who really initiated the first bouchons! These were working class women who were in service in the big houses where they learned the art of fine cooking. After the first world war many of them were laid off for economic reasons and so \"getting in to cooking\" was a way of making ends meet!Mère Bizolon, was one such woman who set up her own restaurant and, I believe, it was with her that the legendary, Michelin-starred Paul Bocuse started out! Incidentally, the medals that she is wearing denote the fact that she was widowed during WWI and also lost a son in that war!One of the Mères de Lyon, who offered free lunches to returning soldiers!After lunch we had a couple of hours to wander around and take in the sights, and it was lovely! I haven't been to Lyon for years but I'll make sure I don't leave it that long before I go back again! Well in fact we'll be back there in a month's time for the Fête des Lumières (the Lyon light show), which is supposed to be spectacular! I can't wait!"},
{"title": "Done bugger all today!", "date": "Sunday 3 November 2019", "text": "The weather has been pretty crap this weekend, constant rain and wind, although I can't say it's been that cold. But it's been a day to curl up on the sofa and do bugger all - and that's fine by me, although goodness knows I have enough I could be getting on with!St. Maclou, the flooring people, are coming to my place three weeks from now on the Friday to move all of my furniture out of my downstairs in order to begin laying my new floor the following Monday. That means I have to get cupboards and shelves emptied, plants moved and so on so I really could have used my time more wisely today I guess. But no matter, every time I come upstairs I bring a plant up, or if I go down to my basement I take something down there from the garage, as the big stuff will be going in there. I'm usually pretty methodical so hopefully there won't be one last mad rush the day before as there is quite a bit to shift. Anyhoo, I'm sure it'll get done! Zen!So I've spent pretty much the whole day sitting on my backside reading - and it's been great! I finally caved in and signed up to Amazon Prime (€6/month) as I was on Amazon France looking to buy a copy of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\", but it doesn't seem as though it's available to buy yet. I hear it's great! But, of course they suggested it on Amazon Prime so I decided to take up their offer of a free 30-day trial. To be honest, I buy enough off Amazon that it might be worth it anyway just to get free shipping, but we'll see. I'm also organized enough that I write these things down and don't forget to cancel them if I decide not to take it any further. In the meantime, I'll see how it goes!In my mail box this week I got a toy catalogue (already?) for Christmas stuff. I have put a \"no advertising\" sticker on my mailbox but somehow this one got through. But I decided to look through it at the board games as I'm getting a little tired of some of the ones we've been using and think we need to mix it up a bit (before I die of boredom?), so I went ahead and ordered Cluedo and a game called \"Ta mère en slip\" or \"you're mom in her knickers\" off Amazon!It's basically the same as the game where they stick a post-it on your forehead and you have to guess who you are, although in this game you get two cards to slot into the glasses, one with a person and the other showing that person doing an activity. One that I saw was \"Donald Trump on Tinder\" (which may not be any more far-fetched than \"your mom in her knickers\" to my way of thinking)! Hopefully it'll be here before our next board game evening chez Jordan and Jen - should be!I guess bad weather maybe also puts us (me?) at risk of \"internet spending\" too doesn't it. It's so easy to just click on something on Amazon or wherever and \"poof\" it's yours, although to be fair, I'm really not that kind of unmitigated spendthrift (unless it's for second-hand books for myself - my Achilles heel)! I have recently placed a couple of orders but they are for Christmas presents and such and a birthday gift for Lily, my DIL, who will be 32 in December. I think (I hope) I know Lily's taste - it certainly looks to be the case for books as she and I seem to have the same collection - so I'm pretty sure she will like the framed Banksy wall hanging I've ordered for her. I know I do so fingers crossed!I was at a bit of a loose end yesterday though so I decided to check out a beautician's/spa place I had seen on my way to Tuesday afternoon yoga. I haven't been for a facial for years so I've decided I'm going to make it a more regular, monthly treat now because there ain't no pockets in shrouds! So I did a bit of googling, looking to see what Yves Rocher had to offer as I like their stuff, but the YR where I go is difficult to park at and this place is just 10 minutes down the road from me. So I've gone ahead and booked a facial for next week and will see how they pan out, with an eye to a massage next time if they are any good! My idea of bliss - well that and getting lost in a sweetie shop that also sells books!I can now afford all these wonderful new experiences because I've just received my end-of-year \"closing out of accounts\" on various taxes and utilities and seemingly I'm doing really well. I mentioned before how my monthly electric bill has already gone down by €18/month just by switching supplier (and should drop by another €30/month if Max is right). Anyway, I just received my annual bill for trash collection (€118/year), which is a definite improvement over the €180/year I used to pay. The drop came about when I went into town to pick up my access badge for the local recycling centre (only local taxpayers are allowed to use it) and the lady asked me if we were still four people living in my house. When I told her that I had been on my own since 2015 she punched in a different code and I got the lower rate as a single householder! I hadn't thought of it before but I was very grateful that she asked! Actually, though, that got me to thinking that we haven't had \"trash collection\" round here for around 10 years - nothing is picked up from outside your home any more. You have to take even your household rubbish to bins dotted around the local villages (plus all your stuff to the recycling of course). At first I hated it but now I actually prefer it as I can get rid of my rubbish any time I want and don't have to wait for a weekly/fortnightly pick-up by the bin men. But, I tell a lie, this system has been in place longer than the 10 years I thought because it was already in place when my ex was still living here and he's been gone 10 years, so it must be about 15 years. By 'eck doesn't time fly!Anyway, on top of the decrease in my garbage bill, I also got my annual water bill (€146/year) which somehow is down €71 over last year!! I'm not sure how that happened (although my armpits just might be a bit funky I suppose) but either way I'll take it! On top of that I have two other taxes which I guess would be the equivalent of the council tax in the UK. Taxe d'habitation and taxe foncière. They, of course, will never go down but they've only gone up by about €2/month each so I'm happy with that. Hence, my wonderful savings and decision to get a monthly facial/massage!!!I also had my monthly \"ladies lunch\" in Geneva with my girlfriends last week, and Liz was telling me that she had finally been given an appointment with the French authorities for mid-January for her initial interview for French citizenship. So we were right, it takes about a year! I guess that means I'm looking at next July then. Oh well. We have a \"citizens' document\" you can download giving basic info about France, its history and its traditions but, to be honest, we don't think that's the kind of thing they are going to be looking for. When was Bastille Day? Everyone learns that of course (14 July 1789 in case you're interested). What other people have said they were asked was why you want to become French and they want to see if you truly are integrated into French life - are you a member of any groups or associations, etc.? So ya see, my being \"Madame la Présidente\" of the local sewing club (we had our AGM last week) might stand me in good stead anyway, even if I can't bloody well sew!!! That plus all the different activities I have joined in at the local community centres! I knew I was right! I guess you just need to show that you don't only hang around with your own nationality, you speak the language and are well integrated (board game evenings anyone?)! I'll find out more after Liz has been for her interview I guess! I'm glad she's going first though!And finally, my birthday came and went in September, and I was just thinking the other day that I didn't receive a card from Bryan! And Bryan never forgets my birthday! I met Bryan on my very first Solos holiday to Turkey in 2010 and he was a really sweet older chappie. We used to chat a lot, although our relationship was never like that! Before we flew home he handed me a copy of the book \"The Power of Now\", which he told me he carried everywhere with him. (Actually I already had it somewhere but couldn't be doing with it. Seems like it must be a \"man\" thing because Steve loved it too)! Anyway, I digress! I told Bryan if he was going to give it to me he had to write something in the front, which he did, and we have stayed in touch ever since. He has been out here twice for a long weekend and loved it, asking specifically to go back to Annecy the second time also (no hassle for me, I love Annecy)! But he never forgot my birthday (or Christmas) and always sent me a message on Armistice Day (coming up). I sent him a couple of messages but got no reply, which is not like him at all, so sadly, I'm thinking there might not be good news! He would be in his mid-70s I guess and had had heart surgery at the beginning of the year (which went well), but … I won't bother him again right now but if I don't get a message on 11 November I guess I'll know there might be more bad news, although how I would ever find out I'm not sure. Here's hoping though as he is a sweet guy and an absolute gentleman! Fingers crossed for Bryan!"},

They came off the blocks firing on all cylinders - and we didn't! It didn't help that poor Kyle Sinckler got knocked out after just three minutes on the pitch but that's the nature of the game, and luckily he is apparently now ok. I suppose it was a lot to ask to beat Australia one week, New Zealand the next and then South Africa the following, but either way South Africa thoroughly deserved to win!As a footnote, I guess it's a mark of how far South Africa has come in that they had their first black captain, who just happens to have a white wife! Just think how few years ago that alone would not have been possible! Progress, finally!"},

It seems it's true what they say about retirement - you don't see the time whizzing by, but as long as it's pleasurably whizzing by I guess I can't complain can I!So what's new? Well last Saturday's rugby was just fabulous. England versus New Zealand! Of course I was desperately hoping England would win but with NZ being the favourites I sure bit my way through a few nails, I can tell ya! But England played wonderfully and NZ - well it just wasn't their day. I was ecstatic about England's win (obviously) and only hope they can repeat that performance tomorrow in the final against South Africa!!!!Then on Saturday evening we had our latest board game evening at my place. Jen suggested we do a \"halloween\"-themed evening so that's what we did - and it turned out great! I noticed that Jordan looked very tired but he said he had been helping another friend build his house in the morning, band practice in the afternoon and then my place in the evening!! I guess ya gotta be young right? But at least he is learning more and more skills for the day when, hopefully, they will either build or renovate their own place!There were only 10 of this time as a few couldn't make it but it was still a great evening all the same!Halloween itself was fairly quiet, but then it isn't as big here as it is in the US or the UK anyway, even if it is catching on! I made a last minute appointment in town to get my hair cut before I did my usual hack job on it and the kids were parading round the shops and, mostly, the shopkeepers played along and handed out the candies, although from what I heard from my hairdresser not all the local businesses are interested in this \"new\", commercialized celebration. I understand to a point as traditionally it is carnaval that's celebrated in Europe in February but that seems to have gone by the way in many places, and some don't feel the need for an \"imported\" celebration. Still, money talks doesn't it and the shops are certainly not going to pass up the chance of making a few €€€€€€! I got a few visitors when I got home as I decorate my home anyway, but being out of town we really don't get that many trick-or-treaters. I tend to live on the first floor of my house as that's where my TV room and computer are, so I figured I would do some sewing (in the dining room) waiting for the doorbell to ring rather than running up and down stairs all evening. I also took the opportunity to make \"bottom of the fridge\" soup for today so my time was put to good use!In the meantime, my gardener showed up to cut my lawn one last time (I wasn't really expecting him again this season, but he comes as and when) so I asked him to cut my hedges and chop down my dying cherry tree while he was at it. And by golly he made quick work of both! My neighbours, who also use him, got in a bit of a huff the other week and started cutting their side of the hedge (they have absolutely massacred it) but I thought (a) I'd get around to it at some point - admittedly not very likely, or (b) I'd get him to do it next year, but in the end it got done by him at a very reasonable price and looks a darn sight better than their side! The husband on that side is a strange guy, ok with me, but very domineering and very jealous by all accounts (so read \"slightly nuts\"). As an example, she was in the habit of cleaning their bedrooms and changing their sheets on a Tuesday morning and he got it in his head it was because she \"used to see her lover on a Monday\"! At one point he also thought she was having an affair with my husband (she wasn't, but she would have been welcome to him all the same), and with my other neighbour (again, not true). She says she can't go anywhere without him, particularly now that he's retired - not even for a coffee with her friends! Man that would drive me nuts! And I could see that he decided to cut their hedges in a fit of pique (rather than wait for the gardener to show up) and that meant that she had to be out there with him and to hell with what else she had planned for that day! In the end, as I say, he made a real pig's ear out of it and it looks terrible! Did I ever say how happy I am to be single? Yes? Oh well then I guess I don't need to repeat myself - but I will anyway, just because it's music to my ears - man, I'm so, so, so very glad to be single!And finally, I had my twice-yearly medical check-up in central Geneva today and the bloody roads are even worse than I remember them! Geneva is all dug up as the French and Swiss are working togther to put in extended tram lines to link up with the new cross-border trains which will, hopefully, ease the traffic situation in the city. But in the meantime, it is hell! I tell ya, if I didn't know Geneva like the back of my hand I probably wouldn't even be home by now, what with road closures, new one-way streets and never-ending roadworks! Again, I'm so glad that I no longer have to do that trip every day! But get this ladies, how would you feel having your legs up in the stirrups, with the gynae waving his medieval instrument of torture around and then asking you how you feel about Brexit!!! Seriously???? I was tempted to say \"right now it feels like I'm getting f**d over twice\" but thought the better of it, so just said I was against it! But heck, sometimes it makes you wonder about the definition of \"small talk\" doesn't it!"},
{"title": "Getting my groove back!", "date": "Sunday 20 October 2019", "text": "I haven't felt much like experimenting in the kitchen these last few weeks. I just seem to have lost my mojo there for a while. I have always enjoyed cooking but lately? Nah, not so much! But the other day I pulled a pork roast out of the freezer and picked up a very old cookery book that had one of my favourite pork recipes in it and I realized that this book has consistently produced some of my favourite recipes! So I decided to sit down and flick through it to see what I had been skipping over all these years - I mean, you know how when you use a cookery book you tend to use the same couple of recipes over and over and never try anything else right! Well, I'm pretty sure I had this book with me when I first came to Geneva 40 years ago (yikes, 40 years!), its recipes are in ounces and lbs and the covers are hanging on by a thread. But, turns out it's still a great book. You just have to remember that one ounce is 28 grams and off you go!So I spotted a rather nice looking recipe for cherry/almond squares, but since I didn't have any almonds I decided to substitute desiccated coconut (of which I had an abundance). They turned out rather like shortbread (with a glacé cherry on top) and at one trillion calories per slice they proved a roaring success! I also made a variation of Anne's (New Happenings at the Table) pumpkin and sausage soup, and it wasn't bad. I wasn't overly fond of the sausage I chose but it was still pretty nice. And then tonight I made a \"dry potato curry\" recipe also from my old book - now that I loved! One of the nice things about living on your own is that you can please yourself what you eat and it doesn't have to be a \"proper\" meal (shortbread and potato curry anyone?). It also doesn't matter if it doesn't turn out too well - but somehow this weekend everything seemed to turn out pretty tasty! Maybe I just need to take time out more often! When I was at the market on Thursday the fruit and veg vendor started handing me slices of clementine, kaki fruit, mango etc. to try (he knows a fruit-lover when he sees one), and as I was paying he came trotting over with a few avocadoes that were \"right on the edge\" and a couple of limes. Said it was better for me to use them up than for them to go off. I also have shrimp and chicken defrosting so I'm looking forward to experimenting a bit more this week! I'm glad I've got my mojo back, to be honest! I'll always remember one lady saying how she loved Christmas because she never had to think what on earth to cook that day - I think we all know how that feels don't we!Then earlier this week I got an email from Engie, my new electricity company. I have always been with EDF but Engie had a young man going door-to-door in March trying to persuade people to switch in view of the fact that EDF were putting their prices up on 1 July and if I switched to Engie they would remain on the lower tariff for at least the next year. How long those prices stay at that level after that I don't know but I was very pleased to see that my monthly direct debit has dropped from €90/month to €72 already. Add to that the expected €30/month I should save (according to Max) by no longer heating my water with electricity and I will be well pleased as he said my new, more efficient heating system (let's face it, anything has to be more efficient than a 33 year old heating system) will supposedly not use more fuel even though it is now heating my water as well. We'll see I guess, but with potential savings of €50/month so far I'm pretty happy!As I've said previously, I'm slowly trying to get my garage and basement sorted, as well as major cleaning throughout the house and putting the garden to bed and guess what - I'm finally starting to see some progress! I guess when you keep flitting from one thing to another rather than just sticking in one spot until it's done it's gonna take a while, but I'm afraid I'm not that way inclined - I like to \"flit\"! Either way, I am starting to see progress. I was just wondering how to overwinter my new lemon tree and bougainvillier when up on my Facebook feed popped a post from \"Rustica\", which seems to be a French gardening site, and the guy on there was \"showing me how to overwinter my lemon tree\". I have no idea how I ended up getting this on my FB feed but I'm rather glad I did as being French it's maybe more relevant to the weather conditions in my location than other sites! Without his expertise I think I would have made the mistake of bringing it into my house but apparently they can't take the dry heat and are better off left outdoors but protected from the cold!! So now you know!While I was out in my garden late this afternoon putting another raised bed \"to sleep\" (i.e. covering it with compost and a sheet of weighted cardboard to keep the weeds down), my neighbour walked over and we were discussing the group of huge mushrooms (probably more properly called funghi I guess) which seem to have suddenly sprung up in my garden. Now, I routinely get a few mushrooms at certain spots on the lawn but I have never seen anything like these. We were saying, if they were edible they would be a little goldmine, but since neither of us knew much about mushrooms we decided to play it safe!I put my hand next to one of them so you can get an idea of the size!I had a quick \"chat\" with Mr. Google and they would seem to be Chlorophyllum rhacodes, or Shaggy Parasols.\"The shaggy parasol is popularly praised as a choice edible mushroom. However, it contains toxins which can cause gastric upsets when eaten raw or undercooked, ... Furthermore, young shaggy parasols look identical to the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites (the mushroom that causes the most poisonings in North America yearly).\"Nah, I think I'll give it a miss, just in case! But, while I was chatting away with my neighbour I noticed how lovely one of the mountains looked with the sun on it just before it set! Stunning!I also received an email the other day offering me a 15% discount on tickets for an upcoming Johann Strauss \"concert\". As a \"frequent flyer\" to such kinds of concerts it's nice to get these offers and as I like Strauss I sent a text message to my friend on the off-chance, asking if he fancied an evening at the theatre and I got a \"yes, of course\" back immediately! I nearly fell over, as I usually get a \"we'll see, I don't know what my plans are\" and so on. He must be feverish! Anyway, I jumped on it and we have now got tickets to see the New Year's concert on 9 January at the Hotel Kempinski in Geneva!As the schools are on autumn break most of my classes are on hold for the next two weeks, although since we are all \"old fogies\" without school-age children my Monday night sewing club is still on. Other than that, I suspect the next couple of weeks will be quite quiet, as was this weekend, and I have rather enjoyed it. I very much enjoyed the England/Australia rugby match this weekend which I think England deservedly won, but there were flashes of brilliance from both sides, so a good match. That means that England now has to play New Zealand in the semi-finals next weekend (yikes - playing the favourites!), with Wales playing South Africa in the other semi-finals. So that's another great weekend's rugby to look forward to!And on that note I'll love you and leave you. It's almost 11 p.m. on Sunday night here, it's raining and I don't have to get up tomorrow morning and slog my way in to work. Could life be any better!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 9 October 2019", "text": "Well not much is happening here at the moment - just what has now become my new \"normal\" - my different classes and clubs are all up and running with me seeing if this amount of \"busyness\" suits me - and so far it does! I started the week with my morning yoga lesson at our young teacher's home on Monday. She is limited for space so we are a maximum of five people per lesson but that's not a bad thing at all. She was telling us that she has now received permission to build a yoga studio in her garden so hopefully by next autumn she will be better set up to take her association a step further. I have to say, though, that she actually lives and breathes the entire \"yoga\" lifestyle and while it doesn't all appeal to me, as yet (the chanting for instance), she certainly looks wonderful on it. She told us she has a newly-retired gent who will be joining us on Monday for a trial class. He is apparently very into different sports and wants to add the flexibility of yoga to his list of strengths. We'll see what he makes of it, of course, as men are often very strong but don't have the flexibility that women seem to have so it will be interesting!Then on Tuesday my neighbour and I had our Tuesday afternoon yoga session - you know, the one I virtually dragged her to kicking and screaming and which she now loves! Actually, it gives me a lot of pleasure to see her get so much out of it as I am very fond of this neighbour. She is a very \"nervous\" type, says she can never sleep (this I believe as I often hear her up and around throughout the night) and suffers from various aches and pains, in part due to scoliosis! Anyway, \"Mrs Hyper\" here actually fell asleep in the relaxation part at the end of the yoga class yesterday! I know!!! I actually had to wake her and we were all laughing - as was she as she said she never would have thought that just a 90-minute lesson could do that for her! To be fair she wasn't the only one though. The lady next to me seems to start snoring at the drop of a hat, but this is the first time my neighbour has done it. So I guess we now have a new \"in joke\", but good for her!Our Monday night sewing club has grown fairly exponentially too. I don't know where they put out the advertising but all of a sudden we have eight new members, making our relatively small sewing room fairly cramped, but I'm sure we'll get something figured out. And they seem to be a nice crowd so here's hoping. I was talking to one of the new ladies as I left and she was saying that one of their group had taught sewing for about 20 years at another local MJC (community college) but that suddenly they wanted to add extra classes to her schedule and drop the amount they paid her so she told them to get lost! So now that particular MJC no longer has a sewing group and I guess that is where our new members came from. It sounds to me like someone had an ax to grind but .... Our group didn't have a paid teacher until last year in fact. We had a couple of ladies who knew how to sew and would help out as and when necessary. Since they have both decided to stop (they are both a fair old age), we now have Patricia who we actually pay, but I don't feel €100 per person per year is a lot to shell out for such a group. On top of that the local commune actually gives us the room rent-free so we really have nothing to complain about do we!And talking of sewing, I finally got my new curtains put up in the living room. If you remember my others shrunk by about 10 inches after I washed them so I dashed out and picked out two new sets, hemmed them very roughly and got the new rods put up in time to get them all up and hanging over my lovely clean windows by yesterday evening!It's been peeing down rain today so I decided not to go in to work to use the gym as bad weather inevitably brings with it accidents/tailbacks on the motorway and I didn't feel I could face it today as I've got my Italian lesson tonight and need to be back out my side of the lake in good time for that. Goody Two Shoes that I am, I've done my homework already though! And I've actually starting going through the paperwork contained in the \"handbook for French citizens\", trying to learn all about the French political system, it's values and French history. I don't think it'll be too bad actually, but since I could have my interview for French citizenship sprung on me at any time (although I doubt it'll be any time soon), I suppose I should get moving on it!In other news, I mentioned the other day that I seem to be getting more and more scam artists coming through on my email. You know, the ones who have millions of dollars they want to put into my bank account out of the goodness of their hearts! I've been updating a word document of all of their scams and each time a new one comes in I send my word document back to all of them and suggest they may want to keep in touch with each other. I guess that's why their numbers are multiplying but at the moment it tickles me to keep doing this. But I've received about 15 since my birthday on 24 September, including one supposedly from Yahoo saying that my yahoo account would be closed unless I did X, Y and Z but I was not to change my password/log-on ! Crikey! That one I forwarded to the Yahoo abuse line and no, strangely enough, my account didn't get closed yesterday evening after all. I'm also being bombarded with info from the British Government about \"what to do after Brexit\" - I received 15 in just the last 10 minutes, would you believe! Now admittedly I signed up for these emails and most of them aren't relevant to me anyway but crikey, talk about being bombarded!And talking of Brexit, last night Jordan invited me, Jen and Jen's mom out for dinner near them for our respective birthdays - mine on 24 September, Jen's mom on 30 September and Jen's 30th birthday on 7 October! It was just a five minute walk from their place so he could actually enjoy himself and have a rum cocktail for starters and wine with dinner. I stuck to a glass of white wine as I had to drive, but it was a really pleasant evening with the kids I have to say. On the way back to their place I was walking with Jordan and he was telling me that he has two jobs in Switzerland \"ready to go\" as and when he wants them (think double, or even triple his French salary) but  ... \"bloody Brexit\"!!! For the one job he just has to give the date when he would be available - i.e. give his notice in with his French employers but I told him to hang fire because when Brexit rolls around he will need to prove that he has an income and that he has been gainfully employed for some time. He actually likes his French company but says it is so badly run that they can't keep the staff. For instance, he has to be at the office to pick up his work load for the day by 7.45 a.m. and then they very often have him making his first maintenance call 30 km away at 8 a.m. in rush hour traffic, and of course it's impossible! The night before last he finished at 8.45 p.m. because he couldn't get all his appointments done during the day because of the traffic! They have all told their employers that the scheduling is all over the place and they keep promising to do something about it but it doesn't seem to be happening. Then his other problem is that to take up one of the offers of employment in Switzerland he has to prove that he is legally-resident in France - which he is until ..... and even though he can get residency and citizenship in France as he fulfills all the requirements you can't actually get a bloody appointment to hand in your dossier because the French won't set up the appointments until they know where they stand! I can't blame them for that but bloody hell! Living on a knife-edge is just so bloody miserable and yet we are the lucky ones. There are some British expats who may well end up having to go back to the UK because they don't meet all the new requirements for residency in their respective countries! Can you imagine! You've been legally living in country A for X number of years and all of a sudden they rip up the rule book and move the goal posts! I know I bang on about Brexit but hey, people's livelihoods are at stake here and we are being sold down the swannie, as, I fear, will Northern Ireland be. I hope to God not, but I really think the powers that be will cut we expats and Northern Ireland adrift without a second thought and God alone knows what will happen on the island of Ireland after that!! Again, \"piss up\" and \"brewery\" spring to mind!And finally, I have taken to watching Strictly again after a couple of years of \"nah, I can't be bothered\" (to US readers I guess that equates to your \"Dancing with the Stars\"). Now I love Kelvin and think young Karim stands a very good chance of winning, but I have to say I am very impressed with Michelle Visage! She's not my cup of tea in any way, shape or form (she'd be what I call a \"brassy blond\" if she wasn't a brunette), but I have to say she just oozes confidence and she can actually dance! Add to that that she is dancing with the gorgeous Giovanni who seems to have so much fun with his partners, she has actually been a pleasure to watch. Do I think she'll go far? No, not really, but you just have to admire her chutzpah!"},
{"title": "Sorry about that!", "date": "Thursday 3 October 2019", "text": "I went into Geneva yesterday to have lunch with some friends and on the way in my car \"diagnostics\" began to \"ping\", informing me that my headlight had just gone! Bugger! Once you cross the border there are three fairly long tunnels and I could tell instantly it was the right headlight that had gone as it was hard going in the tunnels! Anyway, I made it in to work in time for a very pleasant lunch, and then tootled off back home a couple of hours later in time, hopefully, to miss the worst of the traffic and the encroaching dusk. What I never thought about (until I got home, that is) was that I should have left earlier and dashed off to Ford to get them to fix it before they closed for the evening. But I never thought that far ahead and that effectively put the kibosh on my going to my Italian lesson last night as it means taking the back roads and what with the pelting rain and the darkness I didn't feel safe! Oh well, I'm sure I can make up what I missed in one lesson, although it was a bit disappointing not to go as I had actually done my homework you see!! Damn, and here's me being all Goody Two Shoes and all!So this morning I had my third pilates class (it's beginning to grow on me - I wasn't sure at first) but instead of heading off to the market afterwards I ran down to Ford to have them replace the bulb before they closed for lunch. Now with my old car I used to be able to change the bulb myself but, seemingly, with this car it's more difficult so I knew I had to get down there before lunch as I had things to do in the afternoon.After that I decided I might as well come home for lunch before heading off to do my grocery shopping so I was checking my emails when another bloody \"scam\" email came in - they are coming in thick and fast at the moment - you know, General X's widow who needs somewhere to stash millions of dollars in a foreign bank account! Since last week I decided I won't delete them any more but have created a word document with all their texts and emails in so as soon as a new one comes in I forward it to all the others. Little things please little minds I guess!Anyway, while I was out shopping I received a message to say that a gift I had ordered for Jen's birthday could be picked up in town. Jen will be 30 on Monday so I thought it would be nice to get her, among other things, a copy of a French newspaper issued on the day of her birth. When I had a look at what they had, though, I wasn't too thrilled so decided to get her a copy of the Paris Match that came out the week of her birth. Now that it's arrived it doesn't seem to be the most exciting issue I've ever seen, but I guess there's not much I can do about that, is there!Just look at that 1980s hairstyle!Then as I was coming out of the shop I felt a hand on my arm, and when I turned round it was the \"kissy guy\" I made an idiot of myself with at the market the other week - you know, the one I waved at thinking it was my neighbour and as he took his glasses off and went in for the kill (the kiss on both cheeks), I realized to my horror that I didn't know him!!! Anyway, it was him and he obviously recognized me from then and said he wanted to apologize!!! Err, actually I would say it was more my fault but hey, if he thinks he goofed I can live with that! So he said he wanted to apologize to me for his \"lack of respect\" the other week (in French it's perfectly ok to say \"I showed disrespect to you\" - in English it sounds a bit naff though eh)! He said it was disrespectful of him to shout \"hallo gorgeous\" across the road and then trot over to kiss me (and here's me thinking \"any time bud, any time!\") but I explained that I had mistaken him for a neighbour too so I'm sure we were both to blame! But guess what, he told me his name was Dominique and asked if he could buy me a drink!!!! Yikes!!! When I explained to him that I had a car full of groceries melting as we spoke, he said maybe next Thursday, if I was at the market, and he would look out for me!!! I suppose that leaves me a whole week to decide if I ever intend to go to our local market again then!!! Oh dear!"},
{"title": "My first time at a \"desalp\"!", "date": "Sunday 29 September 2019", "text": "So yesterday I got up at stupid o'clock to meet my friend for our trip up to Gruyères to see our first \"désalp\". The \"désalp\" is when the cattle are brought down from the higher pastures for the winter, although I always knew it as \"la transhumance\", but whatever! I'd never been to one anyway so it was another first for me. We booked this trip with the bus company that we did our trip to Cinque Terre with as they were so well organized, although I'm not really sure why we treked almost three hours into Switzerland when they do the désalp around here too! Oh well, no matter I guess. Moreover, my friend very kindly paid for my ticket as a birthday present - I kept asking her when she thought we should go and pay for our tickets and she said she had called them and they had said we could pay on the bus - not true - she had already been and paid a couple of weeks ago! Very nice huh!Our route took us through Geneva and along the northern bank of Lake Geneva, which is just stunning. As you get towards Vevey, which is just 10 minutes from Montreux (think Montreux Jazz Festival), the motorway starts to climb and the view over the lake and the mountains is so beautiful. At that point I guess we had been on the road a couple of hours so the bus pulled off and the drivers (there were three buses) laid out the picnic that they always bring for the passengers on these trips - bread, various cheeses, ham, salami, cake etc. and tea, coffee, water and red wine! I know! Much as I like a drink I couldn't drink red wine at 9 a.m. (or at any time really as I don't actually like red wine - give me white any day)! The drivers obviously didn't drink but there were a few people partaking - still, I guess since most of us had been up since around 5 a.m. it could technically be classed as lunchtime. Or, as the saying goes, the sun is always over the yardarm somewhere isn't it! Still it was a wise move as Switzerland is anything but cheap and that particular service station, while spotlessly clean and serving very good food, is particularly expensive!Vevey - where Charlie Chaplin lived until his death. Picture by MySwitzerland.comWe made it to the village of Charmey at bang on 10 o'clock and only had to wait a few minutes for the first cattle to come through. This being Switzerland it was very well organized - and somehow they even managed to have the sun shine all day when it had actually forecast rain! I guess a herd was driven through the village about every 30 minutes or so, so we had plenty of time to wander around the cute little back streets in between times. It was, however, pretty crowded, and quite an effort to get from A to B in good order. They had all kinds of market stalls and food and drinks tents on the go all day. There were also various brass bands playing at different times which were very good - but my absolute favourite part was hearing the alpine horns in the distance!!! I wasn't quick enough to get over to film them but their sound is just beautiful! They used to be used to call the cattle in from the pastures at milking time, but that has obviously fallen by the wayside nowadays, which is such a shame as their sound is just beautiful!I also saw this cute little plant holder which I thought about going back to buy (I didn't want to carry it round with me all day) but never made it back to the stall in time! Shame, as I think it's really sweet!Each herd was driven through the village by its owners, who were all dressed in traditional costume. The cattle were also all decked out in their Sunday best, with huge cowbells and beautiful flower headdresses. Now while this all looks lovely, a friend who did a désalp last year to help a neighbour out was telling us what hard work it was - walking through the mountains for hours at a time, then sleeping overnight in a tent and continuing the next day until all the cattle were brought down. She said it wasn't for the faint of heart - as was proved when a few people called it quits after the first day! We calculated that all in all they must have driven over 1,000 head of cattle through the village that day!Cattle drivers in traditional dress!What neither of us realized was that there was to be no trip to the village of Gruyères (where they make the cheese), which we felt was a shame as it is a lovely little village and definitely worth a visit - as are the cheese factory and the Cailler chocolate factory. It didn't bother us much as we had both lived in Switzerland (me for six years) and had been to Gruyères many times, but I think some people were disappointed, and given that it was only 10 minutes away and we had all day, we think it should have been on the programme. We mentioned this to our driver at the end of our trip and he said that this was their first time at the désalp but they would definitely rethink their programme next timeGruyères Castle - picture by leman-sans-frontiere.orgMedieval Gruyères - picture by oleandraSince we had plenty of time to kill we treated ourselves to a rather long lunch of fillet of perch (a local speciality), followed by meringues with Gruyère cream - again, another local speciality! Talk about the diet being blown to smithereens yesterday!Thanks to making good time and no accidents we got back around 8 p.m. - so all in all it was a lovely way to spend a day out!In other news, my neighbour got back to me to say that apparently our team came in 10th out of between 150-200 teams (there were 806 participants so I'm not sure how many teams that meant) at last weekend's whodunnit (no thanks to me), so I was dead impressed!And tomorrow sees my sewing club starting up again for the year, so what with my other classes my weeks are going to be pretty full from now on. I did see the following on Facebook this morning though, that kinda tickled me: \"A yoga retreat\" - translation - \"an expensive stretching holiday\"!And finally, I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but a couple of people sent me a \"friend\" request on Facebook recently. One person I knew so just hit \"accept\" and I must have accidentally hit \"accept\" for the other lady. Only problem is, I have no idea who she is! She \"likes\" pictures I post and so on, and I've looked at her profile to see if we have any mutual friends but nope - like I say, I have no idea who she is! Oh well, maybe that mystery will clear itself up one day - or then again, maybe it won't and I shall forever be none the wiser!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Thursday 26 September 2019", "text": "Max called me on Tuesday night asking if he could come over the next day to finish installing the valves on my radiators. I told him I had to go in to Geneva but would leave the back door open for him and to let himself in through the garage. So when I got back from Geneva he was pretty much finished up and I'm now done with workmen for a couple of months!!!! We got chatting over a cup of coffee and I told him I was looking to do both my bathrooms, probably next spring, and he was just full of ideas from projects that he had carried out in other homes. He gave me quite a lot to think about going forwards so I have a few months to have a look around and see what I might want/be able to afford and how much upheaval it might entail. It's exciting stuff!Then yesterday morning, as I was getting in to my car to drive in to Geneva for lunch with a friend, my phone pinged and I got a WhatsApp message from an old flame, Luis, wishing me happy birthday!! After my husband left me in 2010 I had a brief foray into internet dating and as weird as it was for me (I'd been married 26 years after all), I actually met up with probably eight men for coffee or dinner and dated two of them - a sexy Spanish lawyer in Lausanne and Luis - a lovely Panamanian (now Swiss through his ex-wife) engineer working in Berne! We dated briefly but the problem (for me) was that (1) he lived in Berne (which is about three hours away by expensive train) and (2) he is 12 years younger than me!!! I am more than wary of dating someone that much younger than me because I honestly don't see much future in it when there is a big age gap. However that notion is pretty ridiculous really as my friend is 13 years older than me and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. What attracts me to a man is his intelligence and his humour. I also need a man to be his own man and know his own worth - all qualities these guys possess! Anyway, back to the plot. I wrote a quick message back to thank him for the birthday wishes, saying I couldn't talk right now as I was about to drive in to Geneva. At that, he texted back saying \"at last, it only took me two years to get an answer from you\"!!! Say what? Now he did, indeed, text me birthday wishes on my 60th birthday last year when I was in Sicily. I wrote back to thank him - and then that was the end of it - nothing, nada, zip - which I found pretty strange because why bother getting back in touch so many years later if you don't at least intend to keep up the communication? I was intrigued by his comment about my not replying so asked him what he was talking about. At that he sent me a screen shot of his message from last year and the one from yesterday with no response from me in between! I wrote back and said I did indeed write back several times but that he hadn't responded - ever!!! So we went back and forth for a while and I thought I would just send him a screenshot of my messages which, weirdly, I still had in my phone - and it was at that point that I discovered that I had two mobile phone numbers for him! Turns out, he had switched phones (and numbers) sometime ago and I had been sending my replies to his old number - the one that either no longer worked or now belonged to some poor sod somewhere else in Switzerland who must have been wondering who the hell I was!!!Anyway, with that mystery cleared up (and both of us feeling somewhat less \"wronged\"), we have been chatting back and forth today catching up on the last 8-9 years!!!! He is good company and we have so much in common but I don't know if or where, if anywhere, this is going. Maybe I'm a chicken but I'm not sure how I feel about his renewed \"enthusiasm\". He actually asked me to move up to Berne to be with him (this was in 2010) and he would \"take care of me\". I told him no way, I had a mortgage, a kid still living at home, a pension pot to fill and no way was I giving up my financial independence! So it pretty much fizzled after that, more on my part than on his, I have to say! After that my friend and I got together and the rest, as they say is …. just how life turned out, I guess! He's now 49 to my 61 and while it's nice to be back in touch it still feels kinda weird to be \"chatted up\" by someone so much younger. And like I said, it really isn't a case of the \"older woman with money and a passport\" in this case because (a) I ain't got no money anymore and (b) a British passport? Really? Right now? As I was saying, he is Swiss and earns good money as an engineer! Yikes, I really don't think I'm cut out for dating any more!And in other news, I understand there is a possibility of a new post opening up for a part-time staff counsellor at work (or something to that effect). Now this would have been right up my alley when I was still at work as it involves knowledge of the staff rules and regulations and those of the pension fund and the medical insurance, all of which I had - and guess what, feelers have been put out to see if I might be interested in it! The idea is that it would be part-time and pro bono, and while that wouldn't bother me I really don't know if I want to get into all that again even on a very limited basis, as I really don't want to start doing that God-awful rush-hour commute again. One of the \"big bosses\" asked me something along these lines sometime ago but, like I say, it isn't a lack of goodwill on my part, but more the idea of that dreadful commute, and the fact that my retired life is filling up nicely and I'm loving it!And talking of filling up my time, I had my second Italian lesson last night, and now have to work out the best way to discipline myself to get my admittedly very limited amount of homework done to best effect! But, as I was driving home last night in the dark I started to get a little worried because I was having real difficulty finding my way on the unlit backroads - gosh, I thought my bloomin' eyesight had suddenly gone totally to pot! It was only when a couple of people flashed their lights at me that I realized I hadn't got my headlights on!!! That's a relief, at least, to think I'm not suddenly going blind! Senile maybe, but not blind!Then this morning I had another pilates lesson, and while I did have my doubts about whether I would like this class, this morning, for definite, I absolutely loved it! I'm already starting to feel like I might just be strengthening my shoulders and core/lower back muscles just a little as it is already so much easier to stay in a seated position with a pretty straight spine for a good while - something I found more difficult previously - probably as a result of poor posture!Then after the pilates class I settled in to watch England's second match in the rugby world cup. It was against the US and they absolutely nailed it - end result 45-7 to England! It was an exciting match so I was happy. Their next match is against Argentina, which could be a whole new kettle of fish but one I'm looking forward to all the same!!! After that I set to and cleaned my front windows and frames before putting up my new curtain rods and the newly-washed curtains - and then - bloody hell! I finally got those babies hanging and the bloody things had shrunk - by about 20 inches!!!! Damn and drat! So now I have to go out and buy new curtains. Aaarrrggghh! Not the end of the world I guess, but I'll have to be more careful when it comes to washing curtains next time!And finally, just in case Anne in Alabam' is reading this, I don't know if it was deliberate or not but I tried commenting on your latest blog post but seemingly \"comments are no longer allowed\". I thought you might want to know just in case! Cheers!"},
{"title": "Whodunnit!", "date": "Tuesday 24 September 2019", "text": "At our last board game evening, my neighbour, Isabelle, mentioned that they had seen an upcoming \"Whodunnit\" event to be held in Annecy and did I want to go! When I jumped at the chance she went ahead and got tickets for herself and her husband, Philippe, and for Jen and me for last Saturday's \"Sherlock Holmes\" whodunnit being held about 20 minutes from here. Now Annecy is stunningly beautiful and on a sunny day it can be hell as it gets so crowded, but even though we had trouble getting into our preferred parking lot, and considering over 800 people (as it turns out) had signed up for the event, it really wasn't too crowded at all! So a definite win there, even before we started! (All pictures taken from the Annecy Tourist Board site).The old prison!Lake AnnecyWhen we arrived at the starting point we were given a map of the city with (I think) 36 different locations marked out, all indicating places where clues could be found. We then downloaded their app, walked over for a small \"pep talk\" by one of the \"cast\" and set off. Now, considering there were over 800 people taking part, it really wasn't too bad at all as departures seemed to be pretty staggered, with all teams having three hours, more or less, to solve the crime.In a nutshell, the \"crime\" took place around 1892 (I can't remember the exact date), with someone blowing up a car factory in France causing two deaths. At the same time, the local town was gearing up for the imminent take-off of a zepplin/blimp, but we had to try to solve the crime because we knew the culprit also intended to blow up the blimp!We started off pretty slowly, looking for clues at the closest spots indicated on the map. The organizers told us that we didn't have to visit all the clue sites, and that indeed some of them would prove to be red herrings, so to be careful how often we used the app to \"question\" potential suspects as doing so would score points against us! Turns out most, but not all, of the clues were on yellow cards tied to lampposts and such like!The clue to be taken from this card and punched into the app was 03403!After we had solved a few riddles we reached a location where a cast member was handing out a newspaper \"published\" on the day of the explosion and containing more details of the crime, but also more red herrings!As time started to run a bit short we split up into two groups of two, sending Philippe and Jen off to locate the clues at the most far-flung spots (we're not daft are we), while Isabelle and I tried to locate clues around the cathedral area. Trouble is, once we got to the cathedral we couldn't find clues anywhere! We wandered round and around for a good 10 minutes but nothing doing - that is, until Isabelle took a closer look at a local artist in the square!Turns out, he was the clue! In \"jigsaw puzzle\" pieces attached to the back of his shirt were snippets of the code we were after but which he kept well hidden by the cloth over his shoulder and by constantly turning his back away from us! In the end, we had to volunteer to draw something on his canvas, after which he handed us his cloth to \"wipe our hands\" - and stitched into it was the code we were after!! Clever huh!Anyway, the four of us met up back at the starting point and tried to hash out what we made of the clues we had collected! In the end, Jen figured out the killer and his motive! I was really stunned, but then as a psychiatric nurse I reckon she always had the edge!!!! As for me, frankly I was about as useful as a chocolate teapot! Seriously! I guess it's just the way your brain works, but whichever way you look at it I was useless! Just as I can not do cryptic crosswords! Ever! My sister can bang them out in record time while I don't even get off the starting block! Still, having participated in one event now I reckon I'd have more of an idea what to look for next time, but in the meantime, thank God for Jen!When I got home I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep straight away so I stayed up (until 2 a.m. as it turns out) and watched a 1998 de Niro/Samuel L. Jackson movie called \"Jackie Brown\". And you know what, it was really good! I'm not a great fan of de Niro as I find he always plays the gangster, and this film was, indeed, a \"gangster\" movie with all the inherent bad language! But it was still a very clever and entertaining film about a corrupt air stewardess who couriers dirty money from Mexico back to the States for the bad guy (Samuel L. Jackson). When things go horrendously wrong, she tries to not only get herself out of her dangerous predicament but also to put one over on both the police and the bad guys! You end up feeling strangely sympathetic to \"Jackie Brown\", as played by the very sexy actress Pam Grier! Very well worth staying up late for!And finally, today is my birthday, and while being 61 feels a bit weird, it definitely beats the alternative doesn't it! I didn't see my kids because André is still in Korea and Jordan worked very late, but I'm sure I'll see them at some point. What I did do was attend my regular Tuesday afternoon yoga class with my neighbour, who came out of there today in raptures about how \"she didn't have a single ache or pain in her body for the first time in years\"! Result then - I'm so glad I was able to nag her into it in the end! Then when I got home my friend was just getting ready to leave my place (I told him I wouldn't be home that afternoon but he is, and always has been, a law unto himself)! Anyway, he had bought a birthday gift over for me, which was all the more remarkable since he always used to whinge about the one-hour journey over to my place! He must be going soft in his old age huh! And judging by the birthday cards I received from my sister and my friend, I guess the \"classy\" image I try to project in my daily life isn't exactly working for me!The birthday card from my sister - that's not me by the way - as if I would drink beer!And the birthday card received from my friend.But I forgave her when I opened it and found this.It's a photograph taken from the brochure for our trip next Saturday. We're heading up to Gruyère (in Switzerland - where they make the cheese) to see the \"désalp\" - or where they bring the cattle down from the mountain pastures at the end of the summer! And she'd only gone ahead and paid for my ticket too!  So all in all, it was a lovely way to spend a quiet birthday!"},
{"title": "A busy week!", "date": "Sunday 22 September 2019", "text": "Crikey, last week was busy! Not that I mind that for the most part, but what with the house being all torn up (my furniture is still in the middle of every room so that the heating engineers can have access to the radiators) the chaos has taken some serious ignoring skills, I can tell you!I went to yoga twice (Monday and Tuesday) and then went on the hike I mentioned in a previous post. Normally I try to go in to work on a Wednesday also to use the gym and meet up with friends, but Max phoned and asked if they could come over on Wednesday to finish hooking up of my water heater and the fuel heating system, so I had to stick around. It took the three of them all day to get it set up but I have to admit I'm dead impressed! That stuff looks complicated! So when my hot water started coming through and even the radiators that had previously died on me started heating up, I was dead chuffed! \"Oooooh look Max, it works\" - at which point he gave me the evil eye which, if I'm not mistaken, seemed to say of course it works you dumbkopf, that's my job! He has to come back sometime this week to install adjustment valves on the radiators but that shouldn't take him long, and in the meantime I have heat and hot water, which is just as well since the weather is starting to turn (although I can usually live without turning the heating on for a long time too - you know, being English and all that)! But, after they had left for the day I realized that Max had left his sweatshirt in my basement, so I threw it in the wash with some of my stuff, ironed it and since I had my sewing machine out I sewed a name tag in it - you know, like your mom did when you were at school - and sent him a message to remember to pick it up when he comes by this week!!!So since I was somewhat trapped at home I went back to pulling apart and cleaning my kitchen and this time it was the turn of the spice cabinet. Crikey, some of that stuff was ooooolllllldddd! Now normally I don't care too much if stuff like that is out of date but there does come a point when it no longer has any flavour either so I decided to get rid of a lot of it. I must have thrown 20-25 bottles of various herbs and spices (there were many duplicates of things like allspice that used to be so difficult to find here) so I emptied each bottle into my bin and put the glass bottles in the recycling but, honestly, my home smelled like a curry house for a good 24 hours until I got that bin out of there! After that, still trapped at home, I started work in the garage and found 13 gas bottle caps - you know what you put back on the gas bottle when it's finished which helps you to lift it (the bottles are pretty heavy). But thirteen! I probably had five bottles myself - for the BBQ, the hob and the camper, when I had one - and got rid of any excess bottles. But when my husband went back to the States without emptying his house I ended up with God-alone knows how many more gas bottles and caps (one guy asked him if he was planning to blow up the town hall), so I'm now planning to get rid of all that as well! In the meantime, my lovely neighbour was out in my garden hacking back my hazelnut, damson and plum trees (I get the impression he didn't like my handy work so decided to put himself out of his own misery and finish it himself)! And, he took it all to the tip for me too! Win/win then! He gets to keep his sanity and I get my garden sorted!Michel - terrorising my damson tree!Then on Wednesday night I had my very first Italian lesson and I loved it! I got there pretty early so I could find my way around - and then sat there, and sat there. You see, the lady teacher was a \"typical\" Italian and was chatting away gaily with the group before us, seemingly oblivious to our group waiting outside. That being said, she was delightful - your very stereotypical Italian, talking very loudly and using her hands constantly! I actually found the lesson pretty straightforward (ok, it was only the first lesson) because I speak Spanish and so it seemed to sink in easily. She also didn't clock-watch at the end of our lesson and as there are only seven of us in the class I suspect I might enjoy myself very much. I realized long ago how lucky I was to have had such an excellent French teacher in high school. He was so strict but he drilled French grammar into our heads with silly little rhymes and songs and it worked! The grammar stuck! Actually, after I got my job in Switzerland in 1980 I wrote to thank him for his wonderful teaching skills as I felt that they went a long way to helping me to get such a great job - he wrote the sweetest letter back (which I still have somewhere). I learned that he died not long afterwards, so I'm so glad I made the effort to show him my appreciation!As I couldn't find Italian lessons in my local town I had to drive 45 minutes to another community centre, but since it was dark on the way back I made the decision to stay on the motorway (I usually like to take the back roads) because the Facebook group I follow on \"the state of the roads\" has had \"scam\" warnings one after another, after another lately about foreign-registered cars (usually Bulgarian or Romanian, sad to say) supposedly broken down on the side of the road with the guy waving a bank note at passing motorists. I mean seriously, we might get five of these warning a day and it will very often be exactly the same \"broken down car\" at various spots along the lesser-frequented roads! People call them in to the police but there is very little they can do to stop them, I reckon. Having had a friend almost caught out by these bastards over 30 years ago on a dark country lane (she managed to throw her car into reverse and swerve round the four men who got out of the car), there is no way I would stop for anyone, particularly late at night! Sad though, isn't it!Then on Thursday morning I had my first pilates lesson in town - and crikey, I discovered muscles in places I didn't even know I had places!!!! I had tried pilates very briefly a few years ago, but as ever it was the eternal problem of not being able to make the class on time because of the traffic. I must admit I had visions then of doing a few \"piddly little exercises while sitting on a space hopper\", but boy did I ever get a shock (and some very sore core muscles the next day). But all's well and good this time because at least it gets me into town early on a Thursday morning in time for the market, when otherwise I might get hooked on reading on the computer and end up missing the market yet again!!!Oh, and I was playing Words with Friends on FB the other day (I actually had one word score 198 points would you believe!!!!) when I realized my oldest was online. I had forgotten that he and Lily are in Korea so bugged him to send me some pictures, and how lovely they are! Lily's mom was originally from Korea and Lily spent nine (I think) months in Korea learning the language a few years back. It's a country they both love (Seoul is a young people's city I understand) so if they ever decided to leave Switzerland I could see them heading out that way, although I don't actually reckon they will ever leave Switzerland, to be honest!And finally, I sat down today to watch England's opening match of the rugby world cup. My friend was obviously doing the same as he kept sending me WhatsApp messages throughout the match!!! I had mentioned to him that a retired colleague had seemingly suddenly been taken very very ill and it turns out she died on Friday night. Anyway, C then sent me a message that another retired colleague died this morning also, having not been ill for very long either!!! We worked for a relatively small, friendly organization and all tended to know each other, so two deaths in two days has come as a big shock, and since I don't think either of these colleagues was 65 yet, that made the shock even worse! I guess you really never know what's around the corner do you - I hope that's enough to make all of us more determined than ever to go for it while we can!"},
{"title": "10,000 steps!", "date": "Tuesday 17 September 2019", "text": "I got my 10,000 steps (and more) in yesterday, and how!!! Since I have retired I've only been getting 4,000-5,000 steps in in a day unless I make a huge effort, and to be honest, making a huge effort while it was so hot was not going to happen. So now, seemingly, I have no excuse!On Saturday I stopped in at Jordan and Jen's to take something over that Jen had asked for. She had not been well (spent the night in hospital) so I wanted to see how she was doing. Initially they suspected appendicitis but that turned out not to be the case, although they found massive internal inflammation instead. Hopefully with a bit of treatment, rest and some TLC she will be feeling better soon! Anyway, I was telling Jen that I wanted to get one hike in, either up Le Môle or up to Balme while the weather was so perfect. But she told me that she had recently taken her patients on a hike up to a place called La Bourgeoise, which was a pretty easy hike but with the most spectacular views! So I decided to take a trip out there on Sunday just to see what it looked like. First I stopped in at a local vide-grenier which was much bigger than I expected and very well organized. I didn't buy anything though as nothing really caught my eye, but it was still nice to be out and about anyway. And then I set out to find La Bourgeoise. It was about an hour from home and just over 50 km and what a lovely spot it turned out to be! I drove up to the top of the pass to a small café which is the starting point for the hike. Since, by this time, it was already 5 p.m. I decided not to go up to the look-out but that I would come back \"some time soon\". So I sat and had a Perrier water while taking in the sunshine and the beautiful view (all the while trying desperately to look like I'd just done a gruelling hike - but nah, that didn't work). Behind me was a large party having a drink and as they got up to go someone called out \"grandma, you forgot your walking stick\". I was just thinking how sweet it was that they took \"little ol' grandma\" up the mountains for a day out, when I turned round and 70+ year old grandma\" came striding back to the table all shorts, thigh muscles and hiking boots, picked up her hiking stick and then ran back off to join the rest of her group! That'll teach me about stereotypes I guess, especially around here!Anyway, yesterday morning I had my early morning yoga class in the next village, and I've come to realize that doing that first thing, right at the beginning of the week, is a wonderful way to set up my week. As so often with yoga, I've found that it doesn't really feel like I'm actually doing anything, but when I leave I feel absolutely wonderful! I love it! So on the way back I was telling my friend about La Bourgeoise and when she said \"let's give it a shot\", I suggested \"how about this afternoon\" so off we went. And my was it ever pretty!The walk to the top was pretty easy actually, although I agree with my friend that it's still probably better to do these hikes with someone as it would have been easy enough to twist an ankle in some of the more treacherous spots. We came across sheep and cows (and a few goats), all with their bells on, and it was just glorious. Most people do this hike in about an hour or less - we took an hour but were fine with that as neither of us like to rush and it was pretty hot to boot!Right in the distance, to the right, you can see the tip of the Mont Blanc!That \"little dot\" in the middle of the patch of green is actually a chalet!And then didn't we just totally luck out when a group of men came up behind us and were setting up for hang-gliding lessons - and we had an eagle's eye view!My friend and I were talking about how strong the instructor must be because with a novice they have to be prepared to take the weight of the student, if necessary, when they come back in to land. So my friend was saying she'd need knee pads and shoulder pads (and here's me thinking incontinence pads would be more likely to be on my list of essentials)! Still, it was such a thrill to see them up close in action!And in other news, seems my scammers are back. There were two yesterday and one of them, a widow, formerly married to General Somebody-or-other in the Congo, apparently wants to marry me!!! Now I must definitely be giving off the wrong vibe - not in the sense that I'm a \"woman looking for another woman\", but anybody who knows me knows darn well that if they think I am ever getting married again they want their head looking at! But thanks for the offer anyway!Then last Friday the Swiss/French emergency services carried out a simulation of a \"catastrophic\" event in one of the tunnels of the new CEVA train line, which will begin running mid-December. The CEVA, or the Léman Express (lake Geneva is called lac Léman in French) will eventually link Geneva airport all the way through to Chamonix/Mont Blanc because skiing, in particular, is very big money around here. In December, however, the section of the line linking Annecy to Geneva (the section that would have benefitted me had I still been at work) will be opening up so they simulated an \"incident\" (crash/bomb) inside one of the tunnels with 2,000 \"victims\" and around 900 emergency service personnel/first responders to see how they would cope in such an event. I'm told it went pretty well, but of course the upshot of that, very necessary, exercise is that roads were closed for hours, although they had forewarned people via the press. Unfortunately, on top of that, there was what I understand was a relatively minor three-car smash on the motorway leading to France, but which involved having to close off more roads so that the emergency services could get in! And again, I can only say that I'm just so, so glad that I don't have to do that commute any more!And I saw in the newspapers this morning how an elderly cyclist in Australia had died falling off his bike after being \"attacked\" by magpies! How very sad! But I remember being in Australia in 1983 (my six-month \"round Australia\" trip) and at one youth hostel in Queensland they had put up signs advising us to \"beware of the thieving magpies\". Well we just thought it was to warn us to keep an eye on our valuables, but no, it was, indeed, to watch out for the bloody magpies who swooped and basically attacked pedestrians as they were walking down the street. It was quite amazing really!And finally, I got a call from Max last night to say they would be here tomorrow morning to finish hooking up my heating/hot water system, so I'll finally be able to get my house looking somewhat less like the site of a nuclear \"incident\"! I also got a call from Patrick, the \"official\" French translator, to meet him for a drink tomorrow afternoon so I can drop off my parents' death certificates for him to translate in connection with my request for French citizenship. Now I'm not totally convinced I need their death certificates but since it only costs 30 cents a word to get them translated I may as well just go ahead and have everything ready for if and when I ever get my initial appointment with French immigration (don't hold your breath)! So on that note I will love you and leave you as I have my second yoga class of the week a little later this afternoon and I'm sure the ladies would probably appreciate it if I had a shower first!"},

{"title": "Ha ha!", "date": "Thursday 12 September 2019", "text": "Hey, \"Sharon from the USA\" just contacted me. Apparently she knows Mrs. Victoria, who knows a spell caster who can make your husband faithful again. If anyone should need her services please see below. (I took the liberty of deleting the phone number just in case, but 0234 is the country code for Nigeria)! But hell, if anyone tries to cast a spell to make my cheating ex-husband come back I might have to put out a contract on them! Anyway, see below the message from \"Sharon\".\"Hello everyone out there, I'm here to share my unexpected miracle that happened to me through the help of Dr OKHUELEGBE. My name is Sharon, I'm from USA. I was happily married with two kids; we lived together as one because we both loved each other. All of a sudden, my husband started acting funny and started keeping late nights. I took out time to know what was actually going on and realized that he was cheating on me. Later on, he told me that he cannot continue with me, I even pleaded with him but he never listened. The worst part of it was that he left me and my two kids with nothing to hold on to. But there was nothing I could do to stop him or bring him back to me. I work so hard to pay the kids school fees and other responsibilities for good three years. I cried all day and night because I didn't know what to do to have my husband back to me until this fateful day i read a short piece from one Mrs. Victoria testifying how the great spell caster helped her to get her ex back. I said let me give it a try because I never believed it will work. I contacted the great spell caster and he told me not to worry that my husband will return to me in no distance time after he must have finished casting out the spell placed on my husband. The unbelievable happened on Sunday when I got a call and I was so surprised to hear my husband’s voice apologizing to me that he is so sorry for all his Wrong did, telling me he is coming back home to fix all the pains and hardship he brought upon me. Wow! I really appreciated the great work of DR. OKHUELEGBE. I will always acknowledge your \"FABULOUS WORKS\" and there is nothing I could say than to tell the whole world about my miracle. So, if anyone is out there reading this post and you have similar issue like this, worry no more, Dr. OKHUELEGBE is there for you, he can also offer any type of help like Reuniting of marriage and relationship, Curing of genital herpes and all types of Diseases, Court Cases, Pregnancy Spell, Spiritual protection and lot's more. Call/WhatsApp him on:+234XXXX or through his email: XXXXXmail.com\"Oddly enough, I also got two messages today from another lady who wanted to give me $2 million since she was dying. The lady the week before only wanted to leave me $30,000 so obviously I'm on the up and up! I wrote back and asked if she could possibly put her message into intelligible English. No reply as yet but I will let you know when I have that $2 million to share around!BTW, have you ever felt like a complete idiot? I have on a few occasions and I did again today. I went into town to our weekly market and saw a neighbour. Not a close neighbour but one who had once given ski lessons in our ski club and who I knew vaguely, although I can never remember his name as I only see him about two times a year. Anyway, I saw him coming towards me at the market with his sunglasses on and waved quickly. He took his sunglasses off and came over for la bise - you know, the two kisses on either side of the cheek. That was when I realized it wasn't my neighbour and this guy couldn't have known me. Bloody hell! I have no idea what to make of that and I'm sure he didn't either but who knows, maybe I have just made a new friend! I guess we'll see at the market next week!And I think I mentioned some time ago about someone telling me when my dad had just died that a white feather is the symbol of your guardian angel. Well I have to admit Steve's death has really bothered me. On Monday, at 1 o'clock French time (the time the funeral began in England), I went out and sat in the garden and just absorbed the stillness of my garden, just thinking about Steve, and it really upset me. Yesterday I went in to work to use the gym and as I parked in the parking lot I pulled out my ID badge from the inner pocket of my bag and there was a small white feather hooked into the chain of my badge! And last night, I was a bit \"moithered\" and didn't sleep well. At one point, I remember dreaming various odd things and then Steve walked over and hugged me while I was crying in my dream! How weird is that! But I just know that was Steve saying he was ok and everything was good with him! Like I said before, it might just be poppycock but it is very reassuring either way!And finally, I have been plugging away and struggling to get several trees/bushes cut back in my garden. Then I came back from shopping today and my neighbour was outside at my hazelnut tree cutting it back to half its size, so I went out to help him. He has just come over to ask how I want my damson bush cut back this weekend!!! Now I'm not struggling to get this stuff done as it will get done as and when, and in any case I would be willing to pay someone to do it if necessary, but isn't it nice when someone comes over and takes over, maybe when they see you are a bit fragile!And just in case, I've been having problems with my computer. First I couldn't play videos and then when I got that fixed I couldn't get the sound on the videos. So I updated Windows 10 and switched to Chrome but in the meantime I have been very remiss on reading and commenting on your blogs. Hopefully that is all fixed now so onwards and upwards! Speak soon, and don't forget Mrs. Victoria and the spell caster!"},
{"title": "All booked up!", "date": "Sunday 8 September 2019", "text": "I mentioned in an earlier post that I was debating whether to enrol in a Thursday morning pilates class at the MJC (the local community centre), as I was wondering whether it might be taking on too many commitments in one week. Buuutt, in the end I decided to go for it as I realize I like to be busy and feel I need something that is a little more challenging than just yoga. Truth be told, I really need to get my backside into gear and do something slightly aerobic, but I'm still valiantly resisting that urge (rather easily as it turns out). But yesterday between 14-17h was enrolment time at the MJC so after dropping more hedge clippings off at the tip I decided to drive past the MJC to check it out. It was only 13h30 and I could see that the queue was already snaked through the corridors of the building and round the entire block!!! Say what! Well there was no way I was going to stand out there in the heat for goodness knows how long so I took myself off back into town and decided to treat myself to lunch out, having had the forethought to bring my kindle just in case the queue at the MJC was a little long! Crikey, I could have read \"War and Peace\" by the time that lot had worked their way through the enrolment process! So after about two hours I drove back up there and it was still chocablock, so I decided that maybe pilates wasn't for me after all and drove home. But then again I'm a stubborn bugger so at 4.30 p.m. I decided to give it one last shot with just 30 minutes to go before closing time, found a place right in front of the building and was in and out in about 10 minutes flat! So it seems that, yes, God really did want me to take pilates classes after all! It was pretty well organized (as I found out later), in that you did your initial enrolment at various desks depending on the subject you were interested in and then you headed off to another room to pay. I suspect a large percentage of the initial group was all the young kids enrolling for judo and karate and so on, but I saw that all the yoga classes had quickly filled up and they had posted a note at the front gate to that effect. These classes were given by a lady called Sylvie, and I'm pretty sure she was the lady I enrolled with about eight years ago but had to give up in the end because her class started at 7 p.m. and more and more I never made it back to La Roche before 7.30 p.m! She was very good, so I'm not surprised her classes are all fully booked and I guess teaching yoga maybe 10 times a week is one reason why she is in such great shape!And talking of yoga, my neighbour did, indeed, finally come with me for a trial run at Tuesday's class and she loved it. I told her to be sure and tell the teacher that she suffered from scoliosis and she would guide her as to what and what not to do. In fact the teacher was very attentive to her, making sure that she was comfortable in everything she did, but M, my neighbour, hung in there and managed to do every movement that the rest of us did and she loved it. She was just bubbling afterwards and it gave me such pleasure to see her so happy! We both ached later that evening (for me particularly the neck and shoulder region) but she said that she had tried out some of the moves at home to \"keep up the momentum\" and has decided she will sign up. Score for me then, as I've been \"nagging\" her for ages to give it a go as I just knew she would get a lot out of it!Then on Wednesday I decided it was time to get back on some kind of walking schedule as I no longer had the excuse of it being too hot! The weather has turned almost 180° - but then I guess that's normal for September - and it has gone from chilly to warm to chilly again (and guess whose heating still isn't installed!). I did the one hour walk round the Church of the Blessed Fountain and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd planned a longer walk in the mountains today but it is currently peeing down, with thunder in the offing, and the last place you want to be in a thunder storm is in the mountains. Oh well, it will perk up again soon enough so I will get that walk in at some time. I can't wait actually, as it's a new one to me, despite having lived here over 30 years! And looking out the window at the rain I see that some of my neighbours have already got their heating on, but I'll be damned if I'm turning mine on before end-September (not least because, as I say, it isn't installed yet, but as a matter of principle I don't want to turn it on before October ever!). Max had to order specific tubing in order to hook it all up so as soon as that arrives it should just take another day to finish the installation. I can't wait, actually, because I'm curious to see if it really turns out to be as economical as he says!Then the other day Jen called to ask if I had gotten rid of all my ex's CDs yet. He must have left about 300 of the bloody things in the farmhouse that he was renting when he buggered off back to the States (without emptying the farmhouse) and I had been slowly going through them to see if any were salvageable. Trouble is, he never took care of anything so most of them were scratched to sh*t anyway. In the end I had pretty much given up because you can't even give CDs away and I was damned if I was listening to any more of his CDs to find out if I could put any of them on Freecycle, his taste in music not being anything like mine! In fact, one of the joys of being divorced is never having to listen to Willy Nelson ever again (I know, I know, all you Willy Nelson fans out there will probably chime in) but I got so sick of listening to the same songs (not just WN) over and over and over again! And now I don't have to! Anyway, back to the plot, Jen has a project lined up with some of her patients (she is a psychiatric nurse) and was looking for CDs to use - not the cases, just the actual CDs themselves - so it looks like I will be getting rid of pretty much the whole lot in one fell swoop without actually throwing them away. I'm not sure what she plans to do with them but …. all I know is that they are wending their way out my house as we speak. But, I did come across a few that I have listened to again and got a lot of pleasure out of. Simply Red and Santana anyone? So yesterday afternoon I was standing out in my garden in the glorious sunshine watching the hangliders soaring over the mountains behind my house blasting Santana. And then I got to thinking about Steve and I started crying! I just felt so sad but it was a really poignant moment all the same! When I got in I opened up my mail and there in my inbox was a lovely message from his daughter, Josie, thanking me for the beautiful letter I had written to her and her brothers and for the cheque I asked her to donate to a charity of their choice in memory of her dad. I told her that I just wrote from the heart and that it just came spilling out, that their dad was so very, very proud of them and that they were his everything! And you know what, I'm good with it now. She said she wished they had gotten to meet me so I said maybe one day we will as I really am hoping to spend more time in the UK and in the north in particular, so maybe we can meet up sometime when all the sadness is over. And I would like that. Who knows, one day!"},
{"title": "Life goes on!", "date": "Monday 2 September 2019", "text": "When I went back to the flooring place to return the samples, the sales rep was very helpful and full of ideas about how it might work best (aren't they all though). But, like I said previously, I have had work done by these people before and have been very pleased with them, so I went ahead and ordered my new floor! I guess I tend to be like that in most things - think about it for quite a while - chew the cud if you like - and then just go for it. I tend not to spend an awful lot of time going back and forth once the decision is made, so I went ahead and ordered the tiling I posted pictures of the other day. The rep is coming out later this month to do the final measuring up and then a few weeks later they will come to lay it. Which means that I will have to get everything out of the rather large living/dining room beforehand - and I mean everything! Apparently, they clean and pre-treat the original floor so there is no question of just moving furniture around - it all has to go! While we were looking at numbers I told her there was no way I could move some of that furniture on my own, so included in my quote is the cost of two half days' manual labour by a second person (hope he's got bigger muscles than mine) to get everything moved out and then back again on the final day. They reckon it should take 4-5 days all told, so that'll be more chaos to look forward to. Still, it should be pretty nice once it's all done. And, I must be getting good at this \"gestimating\" business because the quote has come in at €200 less than I had reckoned on spending, so I'm happy with that!Problem is, Max and his team have to have my new heating installed before they can start on the flooring so it looks like I won't be able to go to Steve's funeral. I could make it out to the UK over the weekend but need to be back here by Tuesday morning and from what I can see there are no suitable flights. I know his family will understand and I'm actually ok with that as I wouldn't know anyone anyway. I would basically have to show up and then dash back to the airport so I'm not sure what the point would be really. I will send Josie a cheque, however, and ask her to donate it to a charity of her choosing in memory of her dad. As a \"no fuss\" Yorkshireman, I know Steve would understand!And moving swiftly on, our latest board game evening was scheduled at my place on Saturday night, but Jordan and Jen asked if they could host it at their new place as a kind of \"housewarming\". When I got there I realized they had already moved in - they had spent their first night there the night before - and had it all set up pretty nicely to host our evening. We had a lovely time and spent the entire evening playing Cranium. I was useless, but in my defence, a lot of the questions were \"French-biased\". Buuut Jordan surprised me and his brother with one of his answers to a puzzle. I gave up before I even started - not my kind of thing obviously, or maybe I'm just thick! Just in case you want to try it: \"A woman has two pairs of red socks, two pairs of black socks and two pairs of white socks in her drawer. What is the minimum number of individual socks she can remove from the drawer before she cannot fail to have a matching pair of red socks?\" When Jordan came up with the right answer I was stunned - as was his brother! I guess the facility for logical thinking wasn't something I ever recognized in him before. Just as well he has it, I guess, what with being a plumber and all and installing complicated heating systems. (Oh, I'll put the answer in another post if you're interested)!To play Cranium we split into three teams of four and towards the end of the evening Jordan was wandering around making sure everyone had drinks and Jen's mom and her partner actually nodded off, so my poor neighbour, Philippe, whose team they were all on, said \"I guess it looks like I'm now relegated to a team of one since the rest of my team seem to be either sleeping or have gone AWOL\"! Not to worry, as he's probably smart enough to beat the rest of us all on his own!The day before it had been André's 32nd birthday so I took two bottles of champagne over, one for the house-warming and one for André's birthday. As this was the first time André and Lily had come to one of our get-togethers it ended up being a very nice evening, for me in particular, spending time with both my kids and their wives, although getting home at 2 a.m. knocked me for six the next day, I can tell you!André and LilyLilyAlexandre - 17 years old and one smart cookie. He was the one that answered the question re \"Beethoven's Ode to Joy\"!As we were leaving we set the date for the next get-together (at my place) and Alexandre's parents asked if I might be interested in joining them for an \"enigma challenge\" which will take place in Annecy later this month. Apparently as a team you're given a set of clues and have to find various \"staging points\" around Annecy - or at least that's the way I understand it - a bit like geocaching (or Pokemon Go, I guess)! The last one they went to was in Lyon and there were over 600 participants so it could be quite fun!And moving seamlessly on, the lovely young woman that was giving the yoga classes on Tuesdays contacted me to say that she will now be giving classes to a small group on Monday afternoons and was I interested? Yes, very much so, in fact. She was a replacement teacher when the other, Tuesday afternoon, teacher was placed on long-term sick leave and my friend and I agreed that we both preferred Tiphaine's classes so are happy to go to her Monday class, in addition to the Tuesday class we went to previously. My neighbour popped round the other day and asked if she could go with me as she has terrible back pain due to having scoliosis, so I called the organizers and she can have a couple of free sessions at both classes to see if she likes them (I think she would enjoy the Monday class more, so will be interested to see what she thinks). I've also decided to go to the Thursday pilates/gym class at the local community centre that I mentioned previously. It's only for an hour - so I added up all the time I would be spending at these various classes and in the end it doesn't really eat up much of my time so I reckon I have no excuse!And finally - and I have no idea why I did this - but haven't I just gone ahead and enrolled for Wednesday evening beginners' Italian classes! I suppose I got the feeling that I needed to do something to actually use my brain and since I have always loved languages I thought I would give Italian a shot. It's a beautiful language and as we are only an hour from the Italian border I might well be able to use it sooner rather than later. I'll be curious to see how fast I can pick it up as when we learned languages at school, of necessity it would have been rather slow going since \"we were kids and obviously not that quick\" (my interpretation of the snails' pace we worked at). Could be interesting and a good way to start using my brain again. So until the next time \"Ciao\"!"},
{"title": "And then there was Steve!", "date": "Friday 30 August 2019", "text": "Because I had to hang around the house yesterday morning I missed the Thursday morning market in La Roche. Since I prefer to get my fresh food from the market I decided to go to the Friday market in Bonneville, where I inevitably stop off in the main square for a tonic water before heading home. While I was sitting there my phone rang and I saw that it was from \"Southport, UK\". And I knew immediately what it was! Steve lives in Southport but this call didn't flash up as \"Steve\" - just \"Southport\". Turns out it was Steve's daughter, Josie, who had found my number on her dad's phone, knew we were friends, and called to tell me that Steve had died on Monday evening!While I say \"I knew immediately what was up\" I mean that Steve and I usually chatted about once a week at the weekends but he had been letting things slip a little these past couple of months. I sent him a message about six weeks ago to ask what was up as he was very quiet and he told me that he had been back in hospital for four weeks with pneumonia, brought on by his compromised immune system. So we chatted a couple of times and then he went quiet yet again. A couple of times I messaged him and said I hoped he was OK, but, as I said to my sister last weekend, I didn't want to keep hassling the guy if he wasn't feeling well. Turns out he was having difficulty breathing again this weekend so Josie rushed him into hospital where, sadly, he died on Monday night.So in one way I knew something was up but it was still a shock. I'm so glad she was thoughtful enough to let me know and she apologized for breaking it to me while I was out, but hey, is there ever an easy way to break this kind of news? I was still at the market so what with the noise in the background I couldn't catch everything she was saying, but I did grasp that it wasn't the cancer that killed him in the end, but rather breathing difficulties. I think she mentioned \"thrombosis\" also but, as I say, I was upset and couldn't keep asking her to repeat herself.I know we've all got to go sometime but I just couldn't help feeling that Steve was a bon vivant and somebody who really would have enjoyed his retirement. He retired three years ago at age 62 because, as he said, he would have enough money to live on and he had had enough of marching to the beat of somebody else's drum. The first year he retired he travelled all over the world - I think he said he did 12 trips! That makes sense as we actually met on a trip to Machu Picchu six years ago. We hit it off and he came out to me twice (see my post on our magical New Year's eve here) and I spent a week in England with him last year, after meeting up with him in Rhodes a couple of years ago. We were just great friends! Maybe it would have been something more if I had lived in England but it wasn't to be. It didn't change much though because we could certainly yack for England and spent many an hour putting the world to rights and arguing about Brexit - he was pro and I'm against! Doesn't matter much now though does it!The second year after his retirement he spent doing his house up so that it would be his \"forever home\" and he was quite happy to just pootle around the UK for that year. That was followed by my going out there in August, which was when he found out he had lymphoma - I went with him to the hospital in Liverpool and sat there all afternoon reading while he was having his tests. He kept the results to himself for a while though as his son was getting married shortly thereafter and he didn't want to put a damper on their day - although apparently they noticed that he wasn't his usual self and suspected something was up. And then year three of his retirement was spent dealing with chemo and a bone marrow transplant to fight lymphoma - and by all accounts it was a success! And yet … he was diagnosed last August and here he is gone just a year later! It just doesn't seem \"fair\" to me. I know, I know, nothing is fair in life and many people have it much worse, but I can't get over that he only got to enjoy his \"freedom\" for two years all told. All the more so since he was someone who loved life and lived it to the full. Maybe that kind are just destined to go early - I don't know. My lovely friend, J, was another bon vivant and while her mother lived to be 102 and lived on her own in her own home in central London until the end, J only made it a few years past retirement and didn't get to see 70!So Steve, my old mate, I'm so sorry your brave fight against cancer wasn't enough. I shall miss our chats and miss looking forward to the time \"when I'm well enough to travel again and we can get together\". I believe in life after death so send us a sign mate won't you, and I'll know you're all right! Love ya my old buddy!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 27 August 2019", "text": "I had quite a productive day today, moving things along with the big clean-up/declutter. I'm trying to clean out one kitchen cupboard every day, do a bit of gardening and get at least a couple of things out the garage and at the moment I'm on a roll. The young neighbour I ended up giving my ex's fishing stuff to I saw actually loading up his small boat on Sunday heading off to the lake. When I first approached him he said he hadn't been out on the boat for ages so I guess maybe having all this brand new stuff spurred him into action!This afternoon (I can rarely get my backside into gear in the mornings) I ran down to the tip to drop off some garden rubbish and a few other things when I got stuck behind a guy with a trailer right at the entrance. He was trying to reverse it towards the bins but his bloody trailer was all over the place. I sat there for about 10 minutes (literally) but because of his manoeuvering I couldn't get past to get into the recycling centre. It was quite embarrassing, actually, not only for him but also for me, as he was making such a pig's ear out of reversing this trailer. Eventually he went out the exit and came back in in order to let me pass so I went over to him and asked if he would like my help guiding him towards the bins! Eventually we got it there and he got out his car laughing, saying it was the first time he had driven this trailer, but I just said he was lucky he wasn't behind me trying to reverse that thing or we would still be there!After that I dropped some more stuff off at the charity store and then went on to another large DIY place to have a look at their flooring. I asked if they had a service that could strip my flooring and reseal it and they gave me the same response as Max did - that it wouldn't look good at all! So I had a wander round and eventually asked for help from the young woman responsible for that section. I showed her pictures of my flooring and told her that I had already seen a couple of things that I might be interested in. I always tend to go for lots of colour so was immediately drawn to a mozaic-style tile that I think would look good in my kitchen, which has a colourful, marble-effect work surface but where all the cupboards are white (or at least they will be when I've finished scrubbing them)! I also picked out a pale tile which I think will  look good in the living room and entryway so the young woman told me to take the samples home with me to check how I feel about it at home. I'm thinking of going with it and when I take the samples back to her on Thursday she can arrange a date to come out and give me a quote. I've had work done by these people on several occasions and have been very happy with them, so depending on the quote I think I'll go with them and just get the darn thing done, rather than diddling around. I have money put away to buy a car in case I need to get one urgently (although not any time soon I hope), and enough money to do one of my bathrooms, so once the other bathroom is done (at which point I will definitely be broke) everything that really needs to be done will be done. The rest (I hope) will just be cosmetic and in need of elbow grease (mine). Well, I'm hoping that'll be the way it works out, of course! I know taste is very subjective, but this is what I'm leaning towards.I'm thinking of this for the living room and entrywayFor the kitchen floor (imagine all white cupboards - otherwise it's a bit \"busy\")!In other news, my ex's relative that I mentioned the other day really does seem to have \"flipped\". He's still posting pretty offensive and/or insulting stuff on FB but the curious thing is he seems to be posting this stuff at about 3 or 4 a.m. Pennsylvania time. That seems to be his \"witching hour\". Unless someone steps in soon, or unless he goes too far and the authorities \"step in\", I don't see good things in his future any time soon!Moving seamlessly on, on Saturday night we have our re-convened board game evening at my place, so I sent round a WhatsApp message asking who would be coming and explaining that while my place was a bit of a tip with all my furniture all over the place, it shouldn't interfere with our evening, if that was ok with everyone. Valérie offered to host at her place and then Jen piped up that they would like to host at their new apartment so we seem to have plenty of venues to choose from. I did ask Jen if she had enough tables/chairs in their new place already and she wasn't sure so it might still end up at my place, which makes more sense at the moment, I think. Maybe they can host the next one! In any case, my oldest and his wife have also said they would like to come (it will be their first time) and since Friday is André's 32nd birthday it would be nice to have them all here. I guess we'll play it by ear as to the venue!In other news I was pretty disgusted with the comments of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, making crude remarks about the French first lady at the G7. Something to the effect that President Macron should be jealous of him, what with him (Bolsonaro) having a beautiful, much younger wife and Macron's wife being older and ugly!! Say what! Now I'm no fan of Macron or his wife but since when did it become acceptable for public figures to behave so appallingly? I know that \"thing\" in the White House is no reference when it comes to how to behave, but I was gratified to see that at least Macron knows how to behave in public. His response to the insult to his wife: \"He said very disrespectful things about my wife. I have greatrespect for the Brazilian people and can only hope they soon have a presidentwho is up to the job. What can I say?\" What's all the more galling is that Bolsonaro is 27 years older than his wife, while Macron's wife is 25 years older than him. Seems that men like this feel absolutely entitled to disparage women's looks - all the while sporting a big gut, balding pâte and bad teeth! Does anyone else see the irony here?And finally, Northern Living Allowance (sorry, I don't know your name) posted a recipe for Nanaimo bars so I made them yesterday in order to use Max and his colleagues as guinea pigs! I have to admit they were very sweet - too sweet to my taste - but I'm not sure how I could cut down on that! Oh well, at least I tried a new recipe! Tomorrow I'm going in to work to use the gym and meet up with my friend afterwards for a drink. Gotta get back in the saddle at some point I suppose, and with the weather being slightly cooler now I can't think up a good enough excuse not to go - although it's not for want of trying!"},
{"title": "DIY superstar!", "date": "Sunday 25 August 2019", "text": "I was talking to my neighbour yesterday telling him about my plans to parquet over my downstairs floor. He made what I thought was a valid point that my flooring is actually pretty nice so why didn't I just try cleaning it up! To be honest, the living room/dining room area isn't too bad but due to a dishwasher having leaked all over my kitchen floor some time ago the kitchen looks pretty naff. So this morning I tried scrubbing it with soda crystals, bicarb, bleach, soap - you name it - but nothing  made much difference. An indoor pressure spray hardly made a dent in it either so I think I'm pretty resigned to getting a new floor (eventually). To be honest, what I've seen for the kitchen is (I think) pretty nice anyway but it will involve more expense and more hassle, getting all the stuff downstairs moved out the way. Still, it won't be for quite some time, so with that in mind I looked up the DIY classes that they have on offer at Leroy Merlin (a big DIY place here) and guess what? They do fairly frequent \"lay your own parquet flooring courses\", so I've signed up for one in October!!! Now I'm not sure I will go ahead and do it myself but who knows. I've also signed up for a course on how to \"relook\" furniture in September, which could be pretty interesting as I have a few pieces of furniture I wouldn't mind giving a new lease of life to! We'll see how it goes I suppose, but I honestly don't think \"Tim the Tool Man\" has much to worry about just yet (loved that programme)!And today, my friend and I decided to go out to our first vide-grenier in a while. She ended up buying a very old wicker sunbed - you know, the kind you can just imagine Hercule Poirot lying on - and we were lucky enough to be able to get it in my car (we don't always think these things through properly)! There was also a chap there with a large table full of second-hand tools for sale, so since I don't have a crowbar and have often thought I could use one I picked up one for €7 and a rather nice hammer for €5 which was just the right weight for me and which I will be able to use to re-set the flower borders in my back garden! As I was putting them in my bag the guy's friend walked over and asked if I was planning to go on a burglary spree! Tee hee, I hadn't thought of that! Cat Burglar Annie here we come!"},
{"title": "The hip bone's connected to the thigh bone ...", "date": "Friday 23 August 2019", "text": "Max (Jordan's mate and former boss) called me the other night to ask if they could deliver my new heating system ready for them to install next week. No problem for me as I can be here pretty much any time, so he reckoned he would be at the house around 8.30 a.m. I tend to slob around in my jim-jams when I get up so I made the effort to get up early and showered and dressed in good time. Nine o'clock, still no sign - they eventually showed up at 9.30! So I asked him if he was working on UK time (his new girlfriend is Welsh) but he said no, it was just \"le petit quart d'heure Savoyard\" (the little Savoyard quarter of an hour). Basically, that means, you'll see me when you see me! It wasn't a problem anyway as I was pottering around but I remember thinking \"you cheeky little bugger\". Actually Max has always been a \"cheeky little bugger\" since I met him when he was 15. He was always the one with the twinkle in his eye and you just knew he was up to no good. He used to come over to my house where \"the band\" would practice in my basement. Oh my poor eardrums (and oh the poor neighbours). Then I would inevitably end up driving him 30 minutes home because he had no way of getting back or giving him train fare because he didn't have any money! One new year's day when he was about 17 he called my house fairly piddled at around 4 a.m. to say he was in La Roche (our local town) and he didn't know where to go. My kids had already come home and I don't know how he thought he was going to get home so I asked where he was and went down and picked him up. Thankfully I don't like new year's eve and hadn't had a drink but …. Sometimes I could have wrung his neck but you know what, I like the little sod!Now of course, he isn't so little (nor is he a sod anymore). He's 31 (I think) and he and his brother have taken over their dad's very successful plumbing business. Well, when they showed up my new heating system was a helluva lot bigger than I expected. The water heater unit alone weighed 90 kg and the actual heat pump unit weighed 180 kg!!!! Between the two of them they got the water heater down into my basement but there was no way they could lug the rest down so Max drilled a huge hook into the ceiling of my garage and set up a winch system to get it down there. Very impressed!The old heating system - 33 years old!The new water heaterThe furnace - which will sit on top of the water heaterI currently heat my house with fuel and my water by electricity. The new system will have both the heating and the water heater running on fuel. I wasn't too keen on having the water heated by fuel but Max said it will save money in the long run, I won't be heating as much water (I don't need 300 litres a day just for myself) and that if it runs down the system will automatically start heating more water. My son had his doubts too but Max just said \"you know what your trouble is, the B family (that would be us) are just so damn intent on keeping useless stuff\" - to which I replied that that wasn't fair as he knew damn well I had divorced my husband 10 years ago! He just laughed as he knew my ex well (though not always with fond memories)!Anyway, they worked all day setting it up and taking the old furnace away and will come back on Monday to start working on the radiators. In the meantime my house looks like a bomb has hit it as I have piled everything that was once in front of a radiator into the middle of each room to give them access (and will be leaving it that way until they have finished). But of course, that makes you look at the curtains (oh my God, when was the last time I washed them?). And then you look at the curtain rods, and the state of the windows! Everywhere I look something needs updating or painting. In fact I took all my curtains down and washed them and then I ran out today to buy new rods for downstairs - which I will install when he has finished with the radiators. It's like painting the Forth Bridge - a never-ending project - but at the moment I am quite enjoying it! In fact, when I was buying the curtain rods I spotted some rather nice floor covering, with a lovely sort of Arab-looking floor tile that I think would look nice in the kitchen. I had asked Max what I could use to strip my tiled floor downstairs and repaint it and he told me the end result wouldn't be even if I stripped and re-sealed it and it would probably be easier just to recover it (and he knew someone who would do it for me for the right price!!!). Now I respect Max's opinion because he bought an old farmhouse and renovated it himself after work and at weekends (with Jordan helping pretty much every weekend) and it is beautiful. Not bad for a young man of just 30-ish to have a beautiful home and a very small mortgage (actually, I'm hoping Jordan will be able to do the same thing once he gets better established). So there you go, idea after idea - I'm actually quite excited about it, although the new floor won't be happening just yet. Or at least, not until I can get all the other work done (and the money tree has started to bloom)!The clean up/declutter in the kitchen is moving slowly on - I've emptied and \"bleached\" about half of the kitchen cupboards so I'm hoping I'll be able to paint it sometime soon, although trying to get the garden sorted and putting the garage back in order is also taking quite a bit of time. Like I say though, I don't mind and am actually quite enjoying it!On the weight front, I'm pretty happy to be down 11 lbs since I retired and it seems to be staying off! Yay me! I used to go down and then up 4-5 lbs pretty much overnight but at the moment it's looking good! Not that it's moving much lower right at the moment but I'll keep hoping!Oh and I see that they published the final jokes that were judged to be the best at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. I kinda like this one. \"Some bastard managed to run off with my anti-depressants. I HOPE HE'S VERY HAPPY!\" It just tickled me for some reason! The one that was voted the most popular was \"I keep yelling out cauliflower, broccoli! Apparently I have florets\"! So I decided to send them to my lovely chappie in New York with whom (see that - \"posh English\") I play words with friends on Facebook. While I was playing a game with him, though, FB \"suggested\" I might know S, whose sister, D, I actually worked with and who I see occasionally for lunch. No, I don't want to become friends with S as it happens, but by golly what a sight! She is probably knocking 80 (because her sister is 75) and she's all hair piece, false eyelashes, false nails and a shed load of make-up. In fact, she had posted a photo of herself next to a photo of a young Elizabeth Taylor!!!! Err sorry! Not! She's not the only one I know who posts photos \"showing\" how much she looks like a beautiful film star though - I just don't get it! To be honest, she looked more like Ru Paul than Liz Taylor but that might be just my opinion!Ru PaulI might post a picture of me next to Danny de Vito - see if anyone spots the resemblance!Love Danny!And talking of FB, another \"friend\" suggestion was the soon-to-be-ex husband of a cousin of my ex. I didn't really know this couple too well (although they did come out to France and stay with my ex a few years back) but they seemed nice enough. Last time I spoke to my ex-mother-in-law she said that the husband had \"flipped\" and seemed to be hell bent on drinking himself to death, so his wife had left him (I suspect there was more to it than just the booze, though, to be honest). Anyway, FB now suggested I might want to befriend J, the husband, so I had a look at his page to see what he was up to and my God, talk about putting it all out there! He is vehemently anti-Trump (nothing wrong with that in my eyes) but seems to be angry at the world and his mother. In half the videos he's posted he appears to be drunk or hungover, and he even posted something today claiming that the first President Bush was a paedophile and a Satanist!!!  Say what!!!! Even if I sincerely believed this stuff to be true, the hell if I'd post it on FB! In another post he ranted how three of the cousins had testified against him last year and had him sectioned!! Now knowing these three cousins I don't think there is a spiteful bone in their bodies so if they felt he needed psychiatric help I would believe them! Then there was a foul-mouthed rant calling one of the servers at the family restaurant every vile name under the sun and threatening her and her family. And today he posts a copy of a court summons ordering him to go and be finger-printed in connection with 11 accusations of stalking and harassment! And just when you think he can't keep going, he posts a photo of his hand with stitches in it because he had had to \"break into his own, locked home!\" After that (yes, it just keeps going), there was an article in the local paper about him and the complaints filed against him. Two people posted comments on that, one saying that he and his family were a bunch of stuck-up losers who thought they were better than everyone else even way back in high school, and the other saying that \"in the interests of getting the true facts out there\", why didn't he share that he had been kicked out of a church and asked not to go back, as well as quite a few other places where he was persona non grata! Lordy, lordy, it looks like J is in full \"self-destruct\" mode, but I can't for the life of me understand why he keeps posting all this stuff and airing all his dirty laundry in public! I hope he gets the help he so obviously needs, but in the meantime, I don't think I'll be FB \"friending\" him any time soon!"},
{"title": "Strippers!", "date": "Tuesday 20 August 2019", "text": "Things have been pretty quiet these last few weeks. The wedding is over, I have no holiday plans and my autumn classes haven't started up yet so I've just been enjoying a bit of \"down\" time. The temperatures have dropped too, although Sunday was in the 30s with a glorious breeze - the perfect weather - even if it didn't last long. Still, I'm not complaining, as I can't bear the heat!So what's new? Well the kids picked up the keys to their new apartment on Saturday and Jen called to ask if I could take a couple of empty trunks over to them so they can start packing. They have already taken two trunks so I threw another three in my car and headed out to their new place. Now I know pretty much where St. Jeoire is but if I hadn't put my GPS on I would definitely have taken the \"scenic\" (i.e. \"wrong\") route over a mountain pass! In fact I didn't have to go over the mountain pass at all so it turned out to be a very pleasant 30 minute/27 km trip. I threw some snacks, trash bags, a bucket, scraper and sponge in too, plus a spare T-shirt because I knew they were talking about stripping the wallpaper off the two bedrooms so I thought I may as well go over and give them a hand. Jen's friend, Julian, was also there, so Jordan set to and removed the radiators and between the four of us we got two bedrooms completely stripped in three hours!! Pretty good going I thought.A bunch of \"strippers\"!Crikey, was it hot though! It did prove, however, that St. Jeoire is a pretty quiet place to live despite their being a large-ish road nearby, so that's a definite plus! Talking of Julian, he is an identical twin and he and his brother are a hairdresser (at a top Paris salon) and a garage mechanic. I was joking with him before the wedding and asked if he would do my hair for me - so he said \"sure, but you do realize that I'm the mechanic don't you\"? Damn! Foiled again! On the Sunday they went back to the apartment and put an undercoat of paint on both bedrooms so they are getting well ahead of the game. They have paid the rent on their current place until 6 September so that gives them a fair amount of time to move in at their leisure. With this in mind, and since they haven't had a honeymoon or even a vacation so far this year, they're heading off to Eurodisney, Paris, next weekend for a few days. Jordan, certainly, has been there quite a few times but I know I never get tired of the place! In fact, whenever we had to renew their US passports we went up to Paris on what is a long weekend here in Geneva so that we could do all the necessary paperwork at the consulate on the first day and then enjoy Paris and Eurodisney thereafter. Good memories indeed!PaintingIn other news, last Thursday France celebrated Assumption which is, generally, a public holiday, although not everywhere closes. Thursday is market day in my local town so as I wasn't sure if the market would be on I decided to give it a miss and go to the Friday market in Bonneville for a change. As I was buying my fruit and veg the lady seller complimented me on my pretty woven basket (actually, I get quite a few compliments on it - as I have made a point of telling the lady who sells them at my regular Saturday market). Anyway, this lady also complimented me on bringing my own mesh bags and said she wished everyone would do the same as providing the plastic bags was a big expense for them. She explained that the small, flimsy bags that you might put your tomatoes in cost 4 cents each and the bigger, more solid bags that you might use for potatoes, or heavier items, cost 14 cents a piece!! Crikey, I have to admit I had never given it much thought, except to say that I love using my basket and have had the mesh bags for about 15 years now. Such a small effort yet such big savings all round!On a totally different subject, I saw in the news that the small town of Porthcawl in Wales was planning to install \"anti-sex\" toilets in the town centre! Basically, they are the kind of toilets that get hosed down after every use but these toilets were designed to monitor if there is more than one set of feet in there, if the weight exceeds the expected weight of a single adult and if that person \"took too long\" in there!!! It was not only designed to discourage sexual encounters but also to prevent people gathering there to take drugs or rough sleepers. Well apparently it caused much consternation because, as one guy pointed out, \"I weigh easily as much as two slim teenagers, what about a mother taking a young child to the toilet, or an older, disabled adult or an elderly person who needed help?\" Anyway, I think Porthcawl have had to have a re-think - but it makes you wonder how much ££££ and thought went into this project to begin with! They have these kinds of toilets in town and at the market too and I really don't like them. I'm always worried that something will go wrong and I will end up getting my veggie basket and myself \"hosed down\" through accidentally getting locked in or staying in there too long!Oh, and do you remember an old post of mine about my first love, Nacer, who I met when I was attending Montpellier University when I was 19? Well Naç sent me a message last week asking for advice. His son is going to be attending Geneva University to study pharmacy and Naç had \"left it a bit late (!!!)\" to start looking for accommodation for him, so he was asking for my help. Now there's no way I will be taking in lodgers because firstly I'm not interested and in any case I live too far out (hence the reason I retired early - the God-awful commute), but I was able to give him the names of good neighbourhoods for his son to live in which wouldn't require a lengthy commute and I started looking on FB marketplace for reasonable accommodation in suitable areas. He had thought a place called Ferney-Voltaire (in neighbouring France) might be ok as it is only about 5-6 km from the uni, but I told him to forget it because even on public transport it would take 60-90 minutes one way (on a good day - and there aren't too many of them, traffic-wise, in Geneva lately)! So he was going to come over with his son to see what they could find through the university housing facility (he was on a waiting list) and I said maybe we could meet up if and when he gets his son sorted out. Small world isn't it!Anyway, as I said at the beginning of my post, things are pretty quiet here at the moment, so I've been taking advantage of that to spend about an hour a day in my garden and the same again taking my kitchen to pieces, emptying all the cupboards and scrubbing the place from top to bottom, as I want to paint it. It isn't finished yet but lordy can you see the difference between the places I have scrubbed and those that I haven't, although having had my hands dunked in bleach for the last week there's no way I would ever make a \"hand model\"! I remember doing this in my tv room when I moved a picture and thought I would just wipe down the white wood behind it - I ended up scrubbing the whole place from top to bottom as it was stained a horrible gharish yellow from my ex's cigarette smoke, which wasn't so obvious until I started cleaning one little spot! Yuck! I guess the trick is not to start right! That being said, I've still had a few hours a day to either potter around cooking and/or reading and am ploughing through books at the rate of knots at the moment! I just finished Minette Walters' \"The Breaker\" in two days and am now on a Ruth Rendall book. It's bliss getting my reading \"groove\" back, especially since I have so many books waiting to be read! That might go by the way for a little while, though, as Max (Jordan's friend/former boss) is coming by tomorrow with a view to installing my new heating system. I know he has ordered the new heating unit and he said it will take about a week to get it all hooked up to the radiators, but it needs to be done and it will be good to get that out the way before it gets cold.And finally, I haven't been too interested in booking an autumn holiday this year as I've had too much going on, but just yesterday I started to get \"itchy feet\" about booking something for next spring - my annual \"explore\" holiday, if you like, just like my Sri Lanka trip in March. So far I've looked at Mexico and Thailand but it's not limited to those two places - although they are both high up on my list. Time to put my thinking cap on that one I guess!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 14 August 2019", "text": "I got a lot done today and I love that feeling. I must be on a roll, I guess, but then again, the different classes I want to take in the autumn haven't started up yet so we'll see how long it lasts once I don't have so much free time! I spent another hour in the garden and cut back a buddleia tree pretty hard. It's lovely but starting to encroach on my driveway so better to cut it back while I still have the strength to cut those suckers as the branches grow really strong really quickly! So I took a trip out to Emmaus, the big charity store here, and then back to the recycling to dump some more stuff. There's a satisfying \"thwack\" when another load of stuff that isn't re-usable hits that bin don't you think! But, after having had one unfortunate experience, I finally learned that when you empty your grass clippings into the \"mulch\" bin, you don't have your car keys in your hand! Yep, I did that once, threw my car keys in with the grass and a very \"nice\" man who worked there had to climb in and get them for me! Yikes, how embarrassing! Funnily enough, turns out two of my neighbours did more or less the same \"recycling/charity shop circuit\" today, with us all ending up at Emmaus at the same time. I told 'em next time we should bring a picnic and a couple of deckchairs and have a little party! Oh, and I offered my ex' fishing gear to one of my neighbours and he jumped at it, so job done!In other news, I read yesterday about a near-tragedy in Porthleven, Cornwall, where a young child was swept out to sea on his airbed. The RNLI were called out (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) and they had to scramble a helicopter, with a rescuer being dropped into the sea to rescue the child. Now the RNLI is a charity staffed by volunteers which, I believe, refuses Government funding because they want to retain complete control of the way they run things. They are a wonderful institution! Anyway, a few days after the rescue, the child's parents sent the RNLI a bill for £7 because they hadn't brought the kid's airbed back!!! One of the rescuers said \"if they feel like sending us the £7,000 to cover the cost of scrambling the chopper we'll send 'em the £7!\" Funnily enough, I remember some years ago a case where firefighters rescued a young child from a burning building and one of the parents gave them some \"lip\" because they had torn his coat!  Can you believe the nerve of some people!Also in the news quite a bit lately are stories of older women (usually) getting taken to the cleaners by \"dashing suitors\" they meet over the internet. We all know the stories, and people inevitably comment what idiots these women are. Well maybe, but my feeling is that these scammers are very good at what they do and prey on vulnerable people. Just as an example, about eight years ago I met a young Nigerian lad who was studying here in Geneva at the American University. I can't remember how we met (maybe since I worked with these schools as part of my job), but it definitely wasn't over the internet - I'm pretty sure I wasn't looking for \"romance\" with a 25 year old Nigerian!!! Anyway, I actually knew him and once gave him a ride back to the uni since it was on my way home. A couple of times we had a coffee while I was hanging around waiting for someone and I also went to his graduation ceremony as he had no-one from his family who could be there for him. Anyway, he \"fell in love with me\" (yeah, right, I know - don't laugh). I was 51 at the time and my oldest was the same age as him. Now, I'm not daft and wasn't the slightest bit interested in a Nigerian toy boy, but he became very persistent. And I mean, really persistent! He started calling me up, telling me he loved me, he told a couple of students in front of me that he intended to marry me! Oh boy! In the end I got fed up of his whitterings and told him point blank to sod off and maaan did that little viper turn! He went back to Nigeria after he got his degree and a couple of months later I got this \"panicked\" call from him at work saying that his dad had thrown him out and he had nowhere to go and nothing to eat. Now, my Nigerian friend, Stan - remember him, the café owner - told me that was a crock of sh*t and that you would never be allowed to starve to death in Nigeria. Although, to be honest, I didn't need Stan to tell me that! But he kept pestering me, I had to marry him because he was in love blah, blah, blah and in the end he asked me for 5,000 Swiss francs (that's $5,000) to \"tide him over\". At which point I told him I had two words for him and the second one was \"off\"! But my point is, he was very persistent and after months of pestering someone vulnerable over the internet, I can kinda understand how these ladies can get taken in! Played for a sucker and then humiliated! I should have asked him if his uncle had $3 million he needed me to place in my foreign bank account!Anyway, on another note, a woman I worked with and quite liked retired about eight years ago and went back to live in Cornwall with her American husband, G. G was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago and has been going backwards and forwards with treatment for ages. I only met G a couple of times so don't claim to know him at all but from what I have seen on FB he has borne his \"up and down\" treatment with amazing grace and humour. I don't keep in touch with them but today I spotted a post on FB where he said he was being \"chauffeur-driven\" (i.e. pushed by a hospital porter) in his wheelchair down an empty hospital corridor having completed his final radiotherapy! On the way out he passed \"the bell\" that patients get to ring when they have had their final treatment, so G asked his \"chauffeur\" to stop and allow him to ring the bell three times in the empty corridor - at which point a bunch of doctors, nurses and technicians who were in nearby offices cames out and they all clapped! How lovely! Well done G, you've been very brave!And finally, I stopped in at the whole foods shop yesterday as I really fancied some good quality, wholegrain sliced bread. When I got there they only had one loaf left so I took that, but it was so heavy and didn't look that appetising. Anyway, this morning I thought I'd have a couple of slices for breakfast but when I went to slice it it was - how do you put this - well, it felt like trying to cut soft soap with goat's droppings in it (sorry for the visual, but I couldn't think of a better way of describing it)! Moreover, the taste was beeerrrrkkkkk so I threw it out for the birds. But then I had a thought, so I fished the plastic wrap (yeah, plastic wrap at the organic store) out of the bin and saw that I should have put it in the oven for XXX minutes at 180°! Crikey, no wonder it tasted bloody awful! Actually, I think I saw a couple of magpies with very poorly tummies flying past my back window just now (they're probably intending to leave a little \"gift\" on my car), although judging by some of their offerings lately I can only thank the good Lord that cows can't fly!"},
{"title": "Back in the land of the living!", "date": "Tuesday 13 August 2019", "text": "I've been pretty much offline for a few weeks as I suddenly felt so tired that I wasn't up to doing much of anything at all, what with the heat and the after-effects of all the excitement I suppose. But, I have started taking time to sit and read and I'm delighted as it was something I had missed since giving up work. I have so many books sitting begging to be read so I'm really glad that has kicked in again. It's been really hot too, so slobbing around reading was probably one of the few things I was capable of, to be honest!So what's new? We still haven't received the website for the wedding photos but it can't be too long now! I can't wait! Oh and I'm thinking the kids will be able to pick up the keys to their new apartment any day now - they must be so excited - I know I am! To that end, I have been slogging away trying to empty so many of the trunks my ex had down in the basement so the kids can take them for the move. So far I have emptied seven huge trunks - and I think I probably have another four or five to go! What the heck my ex thought he needed all those trunks for is beyond me! We didn't need more storage, we needed less stuff! I have a pretty large basement so it was easy to just keep stuffing things down there, forever to be forgotten - or until I ended up going through it all. Just a case in point, a couple of years ago I bought an above-ground inflatable pool because when it gets hot here it gets hot! But I didn't see the point in having an in-ground pool in a place like this. Too much snow and too much work. So I was talking to my neighbour about measuring up the best spot to locate this pool in future (I'm thinking on my terrace rather than on the grass), but when we opened up the huge box that I thought my pool was in I found a shedload of fishing stuff! There was so much stuff, I tell ya, we cudda bought a fishmonger's store with the value of that stuff (and I don't ever recall him catching a single fish)! Still, I guess as long as he got pleasure out of it it was ok, but now I'm left with reels, boxes of bait, the stools and the bloody fishing jacket! I have been slowly going through it all, throwing the rubbish and will take the rest to the charity store if I can't find somebody locally who would like it. But have you any idea how many bloody pockets there are in a fisherman's jacket! What a pain in the butt it has been emptying all that stuff and getting it sorted!I'm trying to get myself into some kind of routine now where I get some decluttering/ cleaning/scrubbing done every day, work in the garden for a while, maybe some sewing and also trying new recipes. My house has always been \"clean enough\" but now that I have the time I want to go through it from top to bottom once and for all, starting with my kitchen. It's not much fun to do but so satisfying when it's done, isn't it! All this industry means that for once in my life I have a very slight tan on my arms and my legs are no longer lily white - more like very, milky coffee-coloured - since I live in shorts and t-shirts (all nicely offset by the mozzie bites at the moment, sadly)! Not sure I've seen a bra or a pair of shoes in quite some time either (TMI?) and it's bliss. However, all this energetic output is somewhat dependent on getting a decent night's sleep - which isn't happening too much at the moment. Some bloody dogs from way over the other side of the field shown in my header picture barked all damn night last night! I know all about \"living in the country and accepting the noise\". I have no problem with that, but this wasn't the farmer's dogs - I know where he lives (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) and it's further away - so I'm pretty certain it was in the houses beyond the field. I'm surprised somebody didn't shoot the bloody things (I can see the farmer doing it), but I'm pretty sure someone will have complained because it goes on all night, most nights and they are big dogs with a loud bark! Anyway, other than that, I'm enjoying trying out new recipes and getting the house and garden into some sort of order, although it's early days as yet. I especially love my beautiful hibiscus bush at the moment, but by god do they drop all over the place!Actually, right now I'm watching \"Escape to the Château\", which some of the Brits might know. I love Dick and Angel Strawbridge! He can do anything and she doesn't have an uncreative bone in her body! What's more they work so well together and seem so nice! It's a programme I really love, showing the hard work the Brits who move to France and renovate old homes/châteaux have to put in, but I'm sure their (amazing) experience isn't true for most!And finally, last Friday I was invited to lunch chez J and M with other former colleagues. I shared an office with J when I first came to Geneva and she and her husband are lovely, she is a fabulous cook and he is a wonderful host. All of us (except her hubbie) having worked at the same place, we naturally talked shop most of the afternoon, but M took it in good stead! When the subject of Brexit inevitably came up, a couple of them teased the cr*p out of those of us who are British only, saying we were gonna get kicked out (we won't!)! But, what was more interesting to me was one of the guys saying that yes, there will probably be a trade deal between the US and the UK, but no it isn't gonna be an easy deal because, in his opinion, the US will insist on three things being included. Maybe not immediately, but included ultimately. And those three things were access to the NHS (the National Health Service) - say what!!!!!!! That has always supposedly been non-negotiable (or at least until it becomes \"negotiable\", I guess). Two, the US would insist on being able to export \"bleach washed poultry\" (or whatever you call it), and three, they would also insist on including the exporting of GM food to the UK, which isn't allowed under EU regulations!!!! It's scary stuff but I will be very  interested to see if he proves right!"},
{"title": "Sometimes your feet just never seem to touch the floor!", "date": "Sunday 28 July 2019", "text": "On the Saturday morning Jordan and Jen told us that they had arranged to meet the realtor at 11 a.m. at the apartment they had just put an offer on and \"did we want to come to see it\"? Now at this point, while the vendor had accepted their offer and the bank had said, in principle, it was fine, nothing had been finalized as yet, so they were still crossing their fingers. Anyway we arranged to meet them at their place at 10.45 a.m. and then drove up to St. Jeoire, which is about 15 minutes \"further\" into the mountains. This makes no difference, work-wise, for Jordan and for Jen it is 20 minutes closer to her work, so what's not to love!St. Jeoire - photo Lesbrasses.comI have been to St. Jeoire many times before - or rather,  have driven past it many times before - but I have never really stopped there - turns out it's a lovely little town! They have everything they need there - a school, parks, shops, doctors - everything they could possibly want, in fact. The apartment has two bedrooms and is on the second floor of a two-storey building with a lift and it is really nice. OK, it needs freshening up but otherwise it is \"hot to trot\", as we say! Before we all went in I made Jordan do the right thing though, and carry Jen over the threshold! Aaaahh, to be young again!The big selling point of this place, though, is the peace and tranquility! It is off the main road with plenty of parking, but just 100 metres from the small high street. It also has the most wonderful, large balcony ever, with a view overlooking the Môle mountain. It isn't where they want to be forever as they want to renovate a larger place with land eventually, but as a starter home it is fabulous!The view from their balconyActually, Jen sent me a message a couple of hours ago to say that they had received final approval from the bank and can pick up the keys in three weeks! They are so excited, it's lovely. I sent her a message to say I had several large boxes plus six empty trunks in my basement if they wanted them for the move. I also offered to come over and help pack - \"pack\" in French is \"emballer\". Only problem is, my phone is programmed in English and it changed \"emballer\" to \"embalm\" - just hope Jen doesn't realize I offered to \"embalm\" her!After we left them we headed up to my favourite ski resort of La Clusaz, because the last time my sister was over she had bought a winter jacket there which she says is \"the best jacket she's ever had\" and she wanted to buy another one. While we found the right shop she didn't find what she was looking for, but we still ended up having a delicious lunch in one of the restaurants in the village and for some bizarre reason the municipal parking lot was free - between seasons maybe - either way, that was a definite plus!La ClusazWe could have taken a cable car up to a place called Beauregard but given the heat and the accumulated tiredness we decided to head back home for a rest - because of course we had been invited out again later that evening for a drink! Well actually it was a surprise 40th birthday party that my neighbour had organized for her daughter, Mathilde! She had invited the neighbours round for a drink but she had also been conspiring with Mathilde's friends to have them all show up to make it an even bigger surprise! The plan was for Ben, her boyfriend, to get her to her parents under false pretences and we, the neighbours, would be there as the surprise. Well that worked!But then as we started singing happy birthday all her friends came running round from behind my hedge. To be honest, she looked like she was going to have a coronary (thankfully she didn't!). There was one slight blip in the proceedings because her mom had made a big \"vat\" of planter's punch which her husband had put into a cooler, on top of which he stacked blocks of ice because of the appalling heat. Only thing was, he had managed to wedge one of the blocks of ice onto the tap in the punch barrel - and subsequently emptied all the punch into the bottom of the cooler! I said to Mathilde's brother \"I bet your mom went 'oh you silly goose, Michel, what a frightfully unfortunate thing to happen'\" or words to that effect, at which Seb, the brother, just burst out laughing and said \"I think you know mom better than that\"! And he was right! She then had to dash off and make more punch (which was just a little too strong, so cheers!) but everything turned out ok in the end - mom having done a great job!Jen, the little minx, went up to Mathilde to hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Trouble is, Jen is also a psychiatric nurse and, on occasion, has had to restrain patients, so using her nursing skills she stood behind Mathilde, grabbed her wrists and raised her arms - apparently in this position you can't free yourself - at which point the girlfriends came running over and threw her in the pool! Thankfully, she took it in good sport - but I now know not to get too close to Jen if she's in a bad mood!Mom, Mathilde and BenAfter the cocktails we neighbours left to allow the family and friends to get on with dinner. Turns out Ben had one more surprise up his sleeve (in addition to buying her a beautiful bike - which he hid under all the green wrapping paper above). After dinner he whisked an engagement ring out of his pocket and asked her to marry him! Luckily she said yes!! But I would say that's a weekend she won't forget in a hurry - and it couldn't happen to nicer young woman!"},
{"title": "A dilemma!", "date": "Saturday 27 July 2019", "text": "The day after the wedding, \"groggy but unbowed from so little sleep\", we set off to visit the Plâteau de Glières, site of a remarkable and courageous battle between the occupying Germans and the French resistance in March 1944. France was occupied during the war, of course, but many interior areas of France were left \"unoccupied\" by German troops, to be \"governed\" by the local French administrations. This region of Haute Savoie was not so lucky, given its proximity to neutral Switzerland, and so suffered more than many other regions during the war. My nephew particularly wanted to visit this site so off we went, up a mountain road which, in places, was little more than a goat track! I seriously wonder how my nephew's rented Fiat 500 made it up there, to be honest, but made it we did! I won't go into the whole story of the battle at Glières, except to say that fewer than 200 maquisard (resistance fighters) took on 2,000 German soldiers up at the plâteau. The British parachuted supplies in to the resistance and it was fascinating to see the metal cylinders that they used to get the arms on to the mountainside! As I said, I won't try to tell the entire story, except to say that although the maquisard were ultimately defeated, this defeat would be transformed into a moral victory, giving a much-needed boost to the French resistance. If you want to read more about it you can do so here:http://worldatwar.net/article/glieres/index.html - Article contributed by Alain CerriFittingly, the plâteau has not been turned into a tourist trap - no cafés, no nothing, except a museum, and a couple of places where you can sit and picnic as it is pretty well frequented by hikers and history buffs alike! But get this! I had somewhat \"over-cooked\" the previous couple of days so we just threw all our leftovers into a cooler and took that with us for lunch. When I have a few people over, rather than setting the table, I just put out a very pretty ceramic jug with all the cutlery in it, so I took this as well. And you know how when you are out \"slumming it\" with your supermarket sandwich where the corners of the bread are all turned up and the people next to you pull out a three-course picnic? Well that was us!! Tee hee! Seriously, when the people at the next table saw us get out the pretty cutlery jar they must have wondered where the chandelier and the wine-waiter were!! Doesn't happen very often but it did feel pretty good, I can tell you!Plâteau de GlièresThe resistance monumentAfter lunch we headed back towards Annecy to visit the Jardins Secrets that I had visited with my friend last year. I have to say the menfolk were probably less enthralled than we women and to be honest the gardens were probably not as pretty as last time - different season I guess. Plus it was incredibly hot so while we enjoyed it we didn't stay much longer than hour as we just had to get out of the heat!That evening we were invited to Jen's mom's house to have dinner with her grandparents and a few friends. It was somewhat awkward since only Jordan and I spoke both languages so we were seated in the middle of the table to do running commentaries. Still, it was a nice evening, even if the conversation didn't exactly \"flow\"!Which puts me in mind of my sister's wedding many years ago when my mom and dad \"dropped me in it\". My sister married a Dane and his parents came over to England for the wedding. Now I know we assume that all Danes speak English - which is probably true of the younger generation - but neither of his parents spoke a word of it! So my mom, using logical thinking, landed me with accompanying them around when the bride and groom left because \"you speak French\"! Yeah mom - that makes a lot of sense! Still, they were sweet and we got through it in the end!And on a totally different note, the other day I went to the market and since our town's market is one of the larger local markets, they always have one of those, what I call \"everything for €1 stalls\". Well, technically everything isn't priced at €1 but you can certainly pick up some good bargains. Anyway, I spotted a garlic press in what seemed to be the €1 bucket and it had the \"cherry stoner\" bit that I wanted too. I had broken mine ages ago so at €1 it was a bargain. But when I went to pay the guy he said \"that'll be €6\"! When I queried it he said that it was, indeed, €6, but he had an identical one at €1 in another bin. When I asked why the difference in price he said that the €1 press had been made in China and the €6 press in Europe so which did I want? Bugger it, I'll take the Chinese one - and seriously, they appeared to be identical!Anyway, that wasn't the dilemma I was referring to in the heading to this post! The other night I was looking up the courses at the MJC (the local community centre) and see that enrolments take place on 7 September. I have seen a beginners pilates class on a Monday (same day as my sewing club, but there is no clash) and they have a \"pilates+gentle gym\" class on a Thursday, specifically aimed at exercises for your back. Now I don't have a bad back (and long may it last) but I am always up for any form of exercise that keeps it that way. So, my dilemma is, do I sign up for both of the classes, seeing as I already have my wonderful yoga lesson on a Tuesday and my commitment to going to my work's gym on a Wednesday? That would be four classes in one week! Do I actually have the staying power to commit to all these classes? I'm a Libran so you can only imagine my anguish! What to do? What to do? I know, I'll toss a coin! There you go - sorted! I'll sign up for both!"},
{"title": "Everything except the photos!", "date": "Friday 26 July 2019", "text": "We're still waiting for the photographer's pictures of the wedding - more exactly, we're waiting for him to finish the web site that he will then forward on to the kids so that we can make up our own albums/choose our favourites. Can't be long now though can it! Anyway, back to the visit from my family. On the morning of the wedding we had a wander around the market in our little town followed by a drink in a local café. I also wanted to buy flowers as it was my neighbour's daughter's 40th birthday and I wanted Jordan and Jen to present them to her at the wedding. This was the neighbour who took care of Jordan when I went back to work after my maternity leave. She only ever babysat one kid - him (was he that awful that she couldn't face any more? Nah. She loved him - and still does). So Jordan was deliciously spoilt by a lady (and her husband) who treated him like the third child that she had wanted but never had. He also got to grow up with her kids as though they were an older brother and sister and they are still close to this day. Anyway, after the market we got changed and headed off to the château and oh, was it ever pretty! It's a lovely spot anyway, but all the more so all done up in its finery - I'll post more pictures when I get the photographer's photos, which are obviously much better than my iPhone pix!The kids looked absolutely stunning of course - by gosh they scrub up well - but we got the shock of our lives when we saw Jordan - because he had had his long hair all cut off! His hair was so long he could sit on it; he used to wear it up in a \"man bun\", which I kinda liked, but nah, he decided he wanted to go with something different and got it all cut off the day before. Jen's grandfather led the service and it was really sweet, with Jen struggling on valiantly saying some of her vows in English. She did really well - and didn't blub until after she had gotten through it (at which point my family cheered her!). Very thoughtfully, the caterers were handing out ice cold water bottles, including during the ceremony, as it was so hot! Then they had what they call a \"vin d'honneur\" which is what the French do to invite a wider group of people to have a drink with them but who would not normally be invited to the sit-down meal. There was a lovely selection of snacks and cocktails out on the terrace with, what I am told, was a pretty strong gin and orange mix, champagne, beer and non-alcoholic drinks, all the while with a saxophone player playing in the background and the photographer's drone flying overhead taking pictures. Really neat huh!A few hours later we went indoors for what turned out to be an excellent meal accompanied by delicious wine, all chosen by the kids. They really excelled themselves to be honest as everything was perfect. After the main course the saxophone player starting playing a few bars of different songs and each table had to try to \"name that song\". We were at a serious disadvantage here as many of the songs were French but we had a lot of fun anyway. At the end he played \"the most difficult song of all\" and started playing \"Happy birthday to you\", at which point Jordan picked up the birthday card I had had everyone sign, I handed him the bunch of roses and he went up to Mathilde, the neighbours' daughter, and wished her a happy birthday - at which point she promptly burst out crying! Great eh!Mathilde - at 40!Then there was music and dancing which went on until 3 a.m. (the cut-off point for music). We managed to last until 1 a.m. but after that we decided to leave it to the youngsters. I was pretty hyped up and couldn't get to sleep anyway, so it was no surprise that I heard my oldest son and four others coming in the back door at 5 a.m. going \"shhhh, don't make a noise\", followed by creak, creak, creak as they tiptoed up my noisy stairs. They tried really hard not to make a noise but that's pretty much impossible in my place.  I had made up five more beds/mattresses for them to crash on, although I swear I have no idea who one of those kids was (I just hope my son did and that they hadn't picked up a \"stray\" on the way over). It was ok with my ex too, which was a relief. As I have been sorting/decluttering a load of his stuff from my basement I found a leather-bound bible that a previous girlfriend had had engraved for him (one of the gfs after our divorce but before the latest gf - hard to keep track of sometimes isn't it!) and I handed that to him at the wedding and he surprised me with a photo of our son that he had had blown up and made into a picture for me - so it was all very civilized in the end. Thank god for that!!! It really was a perfect end to a perfect day!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Sunday 21 July 2019", "text": "Well things have finally calmed down now after all the excitement of the wedding and I seem to have (almost) come to a full stop. Some days I really need to give myself a good kick up the behind to get anything done, but that may be because of the heat. After the god-awful heat of a couple of weeks ago it cooled down a little last week but I understand the mercury is set to rise again this week and we're looking at 100°+ by Wednesday. Yuck!I did manage to shift into gear a little last week though and decided to go in to work on Wednesday to use the gym and then meet up with my friend for a drink and to give him his birthday presents. I showered and washed my hair before leaving home and tried using what was tantamount to quick-setting cement as a hair spray to try to keep my hair somewhat decent looking but after a work-out in the gym followed by a cold shower I still ended up looking like this!Cartoon by ShutterstockI give up! Seriously! My hair isn't even that curly but it always ends up looking like I just stuck my finger in the electric socket! In fact, the day before the wedding I had just gotten out of the shower and plugged in the hairdryer when the bloody electricity went off (again) - my brother-in-law just burst out laughing as you should have seen my hair. I ended up having to put on a headband and go for the au naturel look, but I was praying it wouldn't happen again before the wedding. At least give me a chance to look semi-decent during the ceremony! Oh, and we're still waiting for the photographer to get back with the wedding photos so I will write more about that when I get them, although those that I have seen are beautiful. He actually took fabulous aerial photos with a drone too - neat huh!Anyway, I met up with my friend and gave him a book for his birthday as he is as avid a reader as I am (probably more so in fact). But, I also gave him a rubik's cube, which is probably driving him to distraction even as I write!! Or he may have thrown it out the window by now - we'll see I guess.And talking of reading, after I retired I found, sadly, that I wasn't reading as much - unlike when I worked and had 90 minutes each day on the bus to read. This saddened me because I have always loved to read but I'm glad to say that I now seem to have mastered the art of sitting on my back terrace in the shade and ploughing my way through a good book again. I have so many books sitting looking at me waiting to be read, so I'm glad I have started up again. On another note, having discovered some 20 year old cookery magazines stuffed away in the basement while decluttering, I have also decided that I am going to try at least one new recipe a week from now on. The down side of being alone means that I have no-one to cook for other than myself, but the upside is that I get to cook (and eat leftovers) just 3-4 times a week so I really enjoy it. The other day I made a Moroccan cucumber salad that had icing sugar (powdered sugar) in it but meh. Not so great! I then made a lovely (again Moroccan - it was a feature in that particular 20-year-old magazine) aubergine (eggplant) dish that had tons of garlic in it, as well as cumin and chilies. Lovely! So I guess it's a good thing I live on my own as the amount of garlic in that recipe definitely kept the vampires away!Oh and guess what? Ya can't guess? Well I suppose I'll have to tell you then! When I weighed myself this morning I had actually lost 14 lbs (one stone) from my highest weight, although probably about 10 lbs since I retired and all that without trying! Now I'm quite aware that I can go up and down 3-4 lbs overnight anyway, but this is the first time I have got anywhere near that figure. I weigh myself in stones/lbs (14lbs in a stone) because it means more to me and, as I told my friend, the numbers go down quicker in lbs than kg! To which she replied that they also go up quicker in lbs!! Damn, I wish I hadn't told her now! I have tried various online weight loss programmes over the years but I honestly can't be bothered to stick with them (read \"I don't like being told what to do\"). I also loathe all these 0% items - particularly 0% yoghurt as I feel I can just taste the chemicals in them. So I recently decided \"sod it\" and went back to buying full fat Greek yoghurt (with honey - yumm) and just going with whatever I fancied and the bloody weight is coming off (albeit slowly). I know, losing a pound a month isn't exactly gonna get me on \"The Biggest Loser\" is it, but I'm happy with that. Oddly enough, I have never been a big eater but put on 16 kg (35 lbs) with the menopause. I know this because I weighed 66 kg when my dad died and within a few years had raced up to over 80! I think it was the speed at which it went on that shocked me more than anything - but, sadly ladies, I'm not alone am I! So why does it seem to be coming off now when I'm nowhere near as active as I was when I was working? The only thing I can think is that when I was at work I ate breakfast because \"I had to eat breakfast\", and then lunch \"because it was 1 p.m.\" and then dinner because I \"had to eat when I got home\". Now, not so much! I don't eat by the clock any more because I have more time - well that's the only thing I can put it down to - but long may it last!And going off on a totally different tangent, yesterday I decided to stop and take pictures of remodeling work being done by one of my new neighbours and thought my old neighbour who used to live in that house (15? 20?) years ago might like to see what they have done to it. (Hi Marilyn!). I must have looked like some weird pervert in a flasher mac jumping out from behind the bushes taking pictures of this house but … Anyway, the divorced dad that lives there now has taken out the garage and a lot of the garden to make an independent studio for his disabled son. The son is very seriously physically disabled (he has a huge mobility scooter) but not, apparently, mentally disabled. I believe he also has a job. But dad has been working on this studio for quite some time now so I decided to send pictures to Marilyn!Which then got me chatting away to Marilyn on What'sApp for about 40 minutes. It's always lovely to have a good old chinwag! Marilyn is American (and also now French) and after losing her lovely husband three years ago she left the US to be with her son who is working in Cork, Ireland. Turns out Mathieu just got engaged so they are busy looking for a wedding venue in the Czech  Republic - exciting times huh! I have no idea how we got on the subject (do women ever know how they jump from one subject to another?!) but she said something about Ireland being a dump! Say what? Well that wasn't what she meant. What she meant was that Ireland actually seems to be the dumping ground for all the crap make-up the Kardashians can't sell in the US (you know, like the dollar bin at Walmart), and so many young Irish girls are buying this cheap, marked-down make-up and slapping it all over their faces and it looks horrible! Their beautiful, pale, freckle-faced Irish skin was not made to be smothered with Kardashian-colouring make-up. So it would seem that the Kardashian brand is maybe not quite as successful as they would have you believe! Who wudda thunk!And going off on yet another tangent, I bumped into an old (divorced from my friend) neighbour yesterday who I hadn't seen for about a year - and I got the shock of my life! He has cirrhosis and he didn't recognize me after living next door to me for 30 years! When I explained that I used to live next door to him and that we would take each others kids on holiday he still didn't recognize me! So I said, \"you know my ex, P, the American\" and it either clicked or he pretended it had! My goodness, he was in a state. Now while I have compassion for him for his current health problems (and there is a very sad back story too) I never actually liked him - his ex-wife yes, but not him! He was born and bred around here (in Haute Savoie) and used to say things like \"I'm a real Savoyard and the rest of you are just a bunch of pigs\"! Nice eh! I think in reality he was very jealous of people working in Switzerland and earning good money - but if that was the case why didn't he look for work in Switzerland. My ex's skank that he ran off with also made comments about how \"lucky\" we (my ex, me and my son) were to be working in Switzerland so ex told her to start looking - which she did, and she got a job. But, you know, sometimes it's easier to just sit around and complain about how everyone \"has it better\" rather than try getting off your backside occasionally. Heck, that's how I got my job in Switzerland - I started applying - as I knew I didn't want to stay in the UK. Anyway, when he realized that I was now divorced he asked me to stop in and see him for a coffee \"sometime\" - I may or may not do so because, as I say, I never did like him and don't need to be cosying up to a man who has never been anything but a loud-mouthed trouble-maker but … who knows! It sure was a shock though when he didn't even recognize me after 30 years as his neighbour! Sad really!And I see that WTO chief, Roberto Azevêdo, has put Boris straight on a few of his claims on \"trade matters\"! Apparently Boris has been spouting that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK could use an old clause called GATT 24 to continue to enjoy tariff-free trade with the EU. Err, or not, as it would seem. As Mr. Azevêdo pointed out, GATT 24 is not applicable in this case. Seems Boris just spouts out whatever springs to mind and sees what sticks. Now who does that remind you of? Just like the £350 million a week that was going to get pumped into the NHS eh Boris?And finally, (yes finally - I don't half rattle on), I guess we all know where we were when they put a man on the moon don't we. I was 10 years old and in junior school and the teacher dragged a big old TV into the classroom so we could watch the moon landing. Even as young as I was I knew what a momentous and magical event that was! Wow! And wadda ya know! Fifty years ago today they put a man on the moon - and just a couple of days ago I managed to upload my own video onto my blog. So now the sky would really seem to be the limit wouldn't it - to infinity and beyond!"},

It was driving me nuts that I could put other videos on my blog but not my own - I couldn't even take them off Facebook, but it looks like this is working! Hallelujah!Anyway, back to the plot. The day after my family arrived for the wedding I dropped my sister, brother and brother-in-law in town and picked up my nephew and his partner to take them out to pick up their rental car. While I could get everyone a bed of sorts in my home I couldn't get everyone in my car to go sight-seeing so D and L rented a small car. Trouble is when they say \"small\" in Europe they mean small - so they ended up getting a dinky little Fiat 500 - which I reckon has a slightly less powerful motor than my sewing machine, but hey, they weren't complaining! I did wonder how they would follow me up some of those mountain passes but believe it or not they made it, even if they had to take it very slowly!Since we effectively only had the afternoon that day to do touristy stuff I thought I would take them up to the Plâteau d'Agy, which is only about 30 minutes from here and an easy climb for the Fiat! This is the place I had been with my friend and forgot my hiking boots so ended up looking like a right dillon trecking up there in my flip-flops! Had to give up in the end when my flip-flops broke!When we got to the plateau we decided to have lunch in the lovely little restaurant there which turned out to be really good! After that we set off for a short walk part-way up the mountain to check out how far it was to the top. Turns out it would be around two hours all the way up so we decided to give it a miss as it was getting late, but again, what a pretty spot it is; I don't think I will ever get tired of the sound of cowbells! In fact, my friend mentioned today that we should give it a shot this weekend and go back up there for a hike. As long as the weather isn't too hot I'm up for it!Since we were part way there we decided to stop for a coffee at the horseshoe gorge (\"Fer à Cheval\" in French). I had already taken my family there in the past but, again, it's a place that never gets old!After that it was back home for dinner (which luckily made it through the power outage debacle) and a relatively early night for my family ahead of the wedding the next day - not me though, I never go to bed much before midnight/one o'clock and this was no different - I won't go to sleep anyway so there doesn't seem much point in going earlier. I still made it out of bed by seven though!On a totally different note, I have slowly been putting together my paperwork to request French citizenship. When I look online it would seem that I have to go through the Préfecture (local authority) in Grenoble, but there was also a note on their website which said that I had to go through Annecy! So I contacted both and asked which was it. Turns out I have to go to Annecy first so that they can make sure my paperwork is in order and then Grenoble will give me an appointment \"at some point\". But get this, the waiting time just for an appointment in Annecy is minimum 12 months! Holy cr*p! Thank God I have a sense of humour eh!"},
{"title": "Being lazy!", "date": "Saturday 13 July 2019", "text": "Since all my visitors have left I have got the house straightened out, done the shopping and washed and dried 11 sets of bed linen thanks to the wonderful weather we are having. It's a nice feeling to get everything done and I think I am finally learning that it is ok to just sit and do nothing - or sit and read in my case. I got all my running around done today and still had hours to sit and read in my back garden. Total bliss!Up at the Plateau d'Agy last weekTomorrow (14th) is Bastille Day here in France so, for the most part, the fireworks are starting off tonight so that everyone can sleep in tomorrow. In fact, they've just started now. My youngest (the newly-wed) just sent me a video of a group of about 12 friends. They had gone up the \"Petit Môle\" mountain to watch the fireworks. Ah how wonderful it is to be young and enthusiastic!And Bastille Day is also my friend's birthday so I will see if he is free for a few hours so I can take a birthday present over to him. Life at the moment is very sweet!"},
{"title": "The storm that nearly ruined everything!", "date": "Friday 12 July 2019", "text": "I already had a few ideas for meals while my family were here staying with me but knew I wanted to get myself really organized food-wise so that I would have one less thing to think about during the week. So the weekend before the wedding I wrote down what I planned to cook every day (or most days), plus an idea of what site-seeing we could do. Then on the Monday before everyone arrived I took my detailed shopping list and bought everything I needed, storing it in the fridge and two freezers in my basement. A storm had been predicted for that evening and while I love storms I (and, as it turns out, everyone in the village) got the shock my life when an absolute doozy hit around 9.30 p.m. It was absolutely awful! At one point I thought I should try and close the shutters on my bathroom window \"just in case\" and the wind nearly ripped my arm off! Seriously, if I hadn't managed to get my hand out of the way it would have been touch and go for my arm! I live at the end of a valley and the storms usually bang around overhead for a while and then rumble on back up the valley, but not this time. I have lived in France for 30 years and I have never seen anything like it. It howled and banged for a good 90 minutes, at which point the electricity went off. Not that that is unusual though, so taking my flashlight and kindle I decided to go to bed and \"wait it out\".In the morning I had a look round and most things chez moi were where they were supposed to be buuut trees had been bought down in the village, apparently a few rooves had been blown off and a large tree had bought down an electric pylon (hence the power outage). My neighbour is on the village council and he had been told that the electricity should be back on \"around 10 a.m.\". Then it was pushed back to \"maybe noon\" and then ….. who knew! After a few hours I was starting to worry about all the food I had in my freezers and a couple of things I had left in the fridge to prep for Tuesday, so I decided to at least pre-cook the stuff I had in the fridge and pack it into the cooler. But just as I got the gas going under the frying pan the bloody gas ran out!!!! We don't have mains gas in the village so use gas bottles which, in my case, last easily over a year - and the bottle chose this moment to run out!!!! Luckily I always keep a spare bottle in the garage so I ran round to change it but couldn't find the spanner that allows me to loosen the nut and change the bottle. The bloody garage is so full of junk brought about by my \"decluttering phase\" that I couldn't find anything!So I ran round to my neighbour's and she came back with me, wrench in hand, to help change the bottle. After much cussing and sweating we got it changed, at which point I picked up the cooler I intended to use to keep the cooked food cold - and the bloody handle broke off, meaning I couldn't get the lid to close properly. Now at this point you either laugh or cry - luckily my neighbour and I just sat down and laughed. It was hot, I was tired and stressed and we just collapsed into fits of giggles! The obvious solution was to run into town and buy a new cooler, along with a few kilos of ice. I guess at least one thing got accomplished that day, although the idea of making a cake for my soon-to-arrive visitors went straight out the window, what with having an electric oven and all and still no electricity! Thankfully my neighbour has a generator and was able to hook up both my and my other neighbour's freezers to his generator so at least the contents were saved thank goodness!At 4 p.m. I had to drive in to Geneva to pick up my nephew and his partner from the airport and I got stuck in traffic!!! Again, now I know why I gave up work. I bought them back to town, dropped them off and then dashed back to Geneva a couple of hours later to pick up my sister, brother and brother-in-law. Trouble was, their flight was delayed and they had no way of contacting me because my mobile phone charge had run out and I had no way to re-charge it!!  Bloody hell! There was another storm advisory posted on the motorway so I was pretty nervous driving back with black, black clouds hanging over the mountains but we made it back just in time for the next big storm which, thankfully, was nowhere near as bad as the previous one. The electricity finally came back on around 9 p.m. (after a 23-hour power cut) so I was able to get everyone settled in without having to resort to flashlights and candles! But methinks it's finally time to go shopping for that generator I keep putting off, since that storm was surely not a one off! I'm just glad it happened a couple of days ahead of the wedding to enable us all to get back on our feet again! You have to be thankful for small mercies I guess!"},

{"title": "Gonna be offline for a few days!", "date": "Friday 28 June 2019", "text": "With son number two's wedding celebration next Thursday and family arriving on Tuesday I guess I will be offline for a few days. I'm really looking forward to it but I wish this heat would go away. Apparently it hit 45°C (113°C) in France today and the French have been pulling out all the stops to try to make sure the very young and the very old are getting the help they need, since the last time we hit these kinds of temperatures 15,000 French people died. I've had three cold showers today already as it's unbearable!It was just a little cooler on Sunday when we had our annual clean-up of the neighbourhood (followed by an hours-long pot luck, which was again very good). One of our neighbours is moving out in August so invited the new, young owners to come and meet everyone, with several former neighbours also stopping by! It was very good as usual but I imagine there were a few sore heads the next day (and a few emails sent around saying \"has anybody seen my ….\" - you know the different pots and dishes that kept getting misplaced).Jen came over today as she had asked me to translate her vows into English and then practice them with me. As Jordan says \"she puts \"h\" in all over the place where they aren't needed\" but it's cute and as long as she speaks slowly enough we will all understand her. She'll probably burst out crying anyway as she is emotional so it could be a feat to get through it.Then the other day, \"the mates\" showed up at Jordan's work to take him out for his stag night. They had him all dressed up and made-up (in front of his boss, who took it in great sport), and then dragged him out to the village fète in their little village. Said they had a great time! After that a bit of bar hopping, a restaurant and a night club, so again a few sore heads the next day I guess but they had two designated drivers and André texted Jen at 4 a.m. to let her know that they were sleeping it off at a mate's house and all was good!Jen said there had been a bit of friction about some of the last minute wedding arrangements and I pretty much nailed it that most of it was caused by my ex being his usual d****head self. He is insisting that \"someone\" pick them up from the airport and then run them around, and it looks like being my oldest, who has a lot of running around too himself with friends coming from Zurich and the photographer coming out from England and staying with them. I already have two trips to Geneva airport that day and I'll be buggered if I'm picking him up anyway. Why the hell doesn't he rent a car? It's never been a problem for him before! And then it occurred to me he just might not have a driving licence any more (that was a bit of a speciality of his over here)! He and the kids are going out to dinner on the Wednesday night but then \"he will need to see his mates at Ghys Bar in town\" - at which point the wives said \"no way José\". Jen doesn't drink anyway and with my ex it has never been a question of \"just one drink\" - it was usually an all night bender and none of the kids are interested in that. Plus it's a scuzzy bar anyway, why would you want to even go there? Oh and that's where he met the barroom skank he left me for in 2010 (not the latest gf), so I can understand that the kids have better things to do than that. But yet again, it is my selfish ex thinking everything revolves around him! Could be interesting (but I damn well hope it isn't)!And finally, did anyone (in the UK I guess) see the Piers Morgan programme called Psychopath last night? Wow! Now I can't stand Morgan but this young man's \"reading\" on the psychopath scale is apparently off the barometer - and he looks it. Since I had an absolute psycho of a boss some years ago I actually became fascinated by them - they are so interesting (and scary), so I've read up a lot about them because they are just so unfathomable! This young lad, Paris Bennett, manipulated the baby sitter into leaving the house and then stabbed his four year old sister 18 times \"in order to see his mom suffer\". He was just 13 years old at the time and as a minor he will indeed be eligible for parole in a few years. His amazing mother has stood by him as far as she can, but since in the meantime she has had another child and pretty much expects him to come after her and her new son if and when he gets out, she knows for her own safety and that of her young son she will have to \"disappear off the face of the earth\" if and when parole is granted! Wow, she was an amazing lady who had suffered so much but has still tried to \"be there\" for her son as much as she can. But I have to admit I have never seen such cold, deadly, emotionless shark eyes in my life! Scary indeed!Paris Bennett"},
{"title": "I was nobbled!", "date": "Saturday 22 June 2019", "text": "The first week after I retired I was back in work using the gym when I bumped into an old HR colleague who had retired five years earlier. After chatting for a while she said \"why don't you join us on the committee of the retirees' association - having been in HR you know the pension fund and sickness insurance plan inside out\"! I told her I had only just retired and wanted to have some time to get used to that fact and see just how committed I would be to taking on any new responsibilites. Then, as I was walking down the corridor to get to the gym I bumped into another retired colleague who was coming from a meeting on the sickness insurance plan and she said \"oh why don't you join us on the committe, we need fresh blood\"! Same response. A couple of weeks later I get an email from P, the former head of HR who I worked with for years, asking the same thing! Again I gave the same answer. I'm not against getting involved in this kind of thing but I really felt I need some time to just \"be\" retired! Anyway, last week I attended my first annual general meeting of the retirees' association and it was actually pretty interesting. The number two boss of the whole organization gave us an update on what was going on within the organization, how it had become increasingly more politicized and the difficulties they were having trying to get trade disputes resolved amid some of the tactics being used by certain Members! He told us of a recent incident where the Ambassador of a Latin American country took the floor and several Ambassadors walked out on the pretext that they did not recognize this Ambassador as the legitimate representative of his country! Wow, firey stuff! (If you picture the UN, you'll get the idea, although it isn't a UN organization).Anyway, the meeting was well chaired by my friend, with the exception of the fact that he kept forgetting to turn his mike on when speaking so the interpreters couldn't hear him!!! It was quite funny actually as everyone started laughing each time he went to speak and realized he hadn't turned the mike on again. The retirees reps on the various committees then gave a summary of the goings on in each committee and we were pretty much wrapped up after a couple of hours until a miserable sodding French Canadian decided that he was, yet again, thoroughly unhappy with life and everything in it (this was a permanent feature of Mr. Complainypants) and went on a pretty rude rant about how everything was badly done (why don't you get involved yourself then you miserable git?) and kept taking the floor to add to his litany of complaints! This was then followed up by a thoroughly miserable Chilean (we used to refer to him as \"Happy H\") who more or less did the same thing and tried to spring a major change on the representative to the pension committee at the last minute! No forewarning at all! Now we're not talking self-important members of the village hall committee here. We are talking about a pension fund with millions of Swiss francs in assets - said pension fund being now 20 years old after having been set up when we pulled out of the UN $-denominated pension fund in 1998.  So the sh*t hits the proverbial fan a couple of times before my friend managed to get it calmed down, but some people!!!! I guess we all know people like them. Nothing is ever right, they are permanently dissatisfied and permanently miserable, and if they can make everyone else's life miserable then so much the better! Didn't work this time though I have no doubt they will keep trying!Oddly enough they both look a bit like this!After the meeting closed most of us went out to lunch and it was really good to see everyone - and how well they looked. One lady had recruited me in 1980 and here she was at the lunch, 93 years old and looking great. Snow white hair, bright red lipstick and still a very attractive lady. S was there also - the lady I replaced when I moved to HR on her retirement in 1994. She is 84, has a kinda buzz cut hair do and looks wonderful. Now either retirement agrees with most of these people or the ones not doing so well couldn't be bothered to come to the meeting! But, I did get nobbled at the end of the meeting when P came over and again asked me to join the executive committee of the retirees' association and I caved!!!! For the most part we are former HR staff members because we knew the subjects dealt with inside out but I really had been hoping to hang fire for a bit - it was not to be apparently!It was funny too because as I went back to the gym there was, yet again, another red carpet laid out for important visitors (not me obviously!). This time I saw the Prime Minister of Jamaica getting out of his official car and the King of Swaziland (now called Eswatini). When I asked a colleague why these visitors were here it turned out that it was the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the International Labour Organization, said organization having initially been housed in our building. So quite a few dignitaries had also stopped in to our (listed) lakeside building to see how it had been renovated. Eventually the ILO moved out and on to bigger premises so we had the great good fortune of being the only international organization actually located on Lake Geneva!Again on the subject of joining the executive committee, I suppose I really should give something back and participate in some of these committees because we really do have very good benefits as both active and retired staff, in particular our medical insurance plan, which was negotiated by B, my former boss! In fact he drafted the rules and regulations of the new pension plan too (which meant I got to type them about a million times), as well as the Headquarters Agreement, whereby we left the UN common system and the Swiss handed the above building over to the organization for free!  So yep I do know quite a bit about the various agreements, not because I was particularly smart but because I typed the darn things over and over and over again!Anyway, as I said our medical insurance is wonderful. It was cheaper than my ex-husband's (who worked for the UN) but with much better, worldwide coverage and an annual deductible of only 300 Swiss francs! It was bought home to me how good it is when I went to the dermatologist in Geneva last week. Medical settings in Geneva are so luxurious compared to France, but then they cost about four times the price. My lovely dermatologist (Dr. Twinkly Eyes) had broken his foot so I got a young female doctor, young enough to be my daughter (ouch) but she was very thorough and had her assistant laser something off my leg \"just in case\" since \"your skin really doesn't like the sun does it!\". You can say that again! Now Doctor Twinkly Eyes used to freeze anything off with his pot of \"steam\" (which made him look like something out of Harry Potter) but this time she lasered it - ouch! That hurt! Anyway, she then gave me a prescription for an antibiotic cream just in case, so I tootled over the road to the pharmacy and again I was amazed at how luxurious it all is. There were armchairs for people waiting to be served and then the pharmacist asked if I would like a coffee while I waited!!!! Again, I know all this has to be paid for but wow - talk about service!Then yesterday I again drove in to Geneva to have lunch with friends. We do this about once a month and another group of former colleagues meet every Friday afternoon for coffee (although I don't go to that - it means hitting rush hour traffic to get back). Very nice it was too. But when I was walking back to my car I spotted a lady I used to occasionally see on the bus - the lady with identical baby triplet girls! Now this lady was amazing, the epitome of calm and seemed to sail through getting round Geneva with those babies like it was \"no big deal\". Well the triplets would seem to be about six by now (beautiful little kiddies too) and this lady had a newborn strapped to her chest in a baby carrier! Say what! This baby must have been one or two months old but really!!! She's braver than I am. If I had had triplets I don't think there was any way I would have had another one, but they certainly made a beautiful family!Oh, and on the subject of nothing in particular - get this. I read somewhere recently that it is really easy to grow your own celery. The lady mentioned cutting the stalks off the celery and \"replanting it\". Now I wondered how those stalks were going to re-grow (I'm a bit dim sometimes) but then I realized that you replant the root and guess what, it works (but then why wouldn't it!). In just a couple of days my celery started growing through. Fascinating stuff (but then I'm easily fascinated)!And finally, I saw on FB that the motorway near my house had been closed again because of a car going the wrong way! This was the second time in 10 days, and my first thought was \"another hold-up in Geneva\". And sure enough, thugs tend to come to Geneva from around the Lyon area of France (rich pickin's) and then hare back off over the border to get away, oftentimes going the wrong way down the motorway so that the police won't chase them. Now I'm not sure if that is what happened this time but I later learned that there had, indeed, been another hold-up at the petrol station right next to the border in Geneva so who knows. Thankfully nobody was hurt but really??? I hope if they do wreck (which they will eventually) they are the only people who get hurt/killed!"},
{"title": "More this and that!...", "date": "Sunday 16 June 2019", "text": "Things have been relatively quiet here the last few days but the weather is still all over the place. A couple of days of nice weather and then \"bam\" - we get hammered. Last night we had a helluva storm and when I went outside this morning I see that it had ripped my rose trellis off the wall! Now that thing was solid but I suppose I'll  have to cut it all back and put another trellis back up. Then things in the back garden had been hurled all over the place. I did think twice about going out to our planned board game evening last night but by the time I left it had calmed right down again. Weird huh! Below is a video taken inside one of the parking lots in central Geneva. Crikey! It really was that bad!Anyway, last night we had our latest board game evening, held at Valérie and Marc's house, which is high up the Môle mountain near here. They used to live in our little housing plan but decided that they wanted to be in a more isolated location to have more land and more solitude. Valérie's son, Hugo, was one of the kids killed in a horrific car crash that happened eight years ago involving four kids from our little village. Her home here held too many memories for her so they decided to move - much to our loss but I can understand of course. Hell, I still miss Hugo and his cheeky grin when I go out my front door and used to see him pottering around fixing some kind of engine or other!So my neighbours, Philippe and Isabelle, gave me a lift up to Valérie and Marc's. Their kids (14 and 17) also still join in so as you can see it's a very inclusive get together including young and not so young. Valérie and Marc had both been married before but their 17 year old daughter, Chloé, showed up with her boyfriend to play with us so, again, it's lovely to have the youngsters playing with us. And Chloé's boyfriend, Léo, fit right in! Actually I don't think he knew what hit him but …. good for you buddy for joining in! We had tons of food, swapped recipes and then played a few silly games until about 1 a.m. when we all headed back home. Next time is in August at my place, so let's hope the weather picks up between now and then. In fact, I just ordered a game off Amazon called \"Pass the Bomb\" (I think it's time limited rather than terrorist inspired) so I'm hoping that gets here in time for the wedding so we can have a game to play between the anglophones.Philippe reading out the clues!Then on Thursday I had an appointment for the chimney sweep to come by at 10 a.m.  Here in France your home insurance is not valid if you don't have an up-to-date chimney sweep's certificate (if you have a chimney, obviously)! Anyway, for once in my (retired) life I got up and jumped straight in the shower at 8 a.m., only to get a knock on the door 20 minutes later - it was the chimney sweep! When I pointed out that he was almost two hours early and had almost caught me in my PJs he just laughed and said he had been up for hours! Crikey! That'll teach me not to slob around in future!And finally, happy Father's Day to all those wonderful dads, past and present, who were there for their families. Pretty much anyone can father a child but it takes a real man to raise one. Gentlemen, I salute you!My lovely dad!"},
{"title": "Finally!", "date": "Thursday 13 June 2019", "text": "Finally it has stopped raining and (I hope) the good weather is well and truly here. I don't mind rain at all but even I was thinking about calling Hertz to see if I could rent an ark, we got that much rain! Anyway, today was just glorious, not particularly hot - around 25 degrees C - so it was a real pleasure to be out and about without the galoshes!  So what's new? Let me see.Oh yes, the other week I finally got around to buying a stand for a hammock I must have bought 10 years ago. On the rare occasion I used it I strung it up between the cherry tree and the plum tree but when the trees were laden with fruit it/I kept getting crapped on by greedy birds gorged with ripe fruit. It tell ya, it got so bad I had to admit I'm so glad cows can't fly! So I rolled up my hammock and put it away in the basement, never to be seen again! Well that is, until I bought a stand the other week. The stand was pretty easy to assemble and I thought I'd got the height of the hammock sorted - well that is until I sat on it and just ended up sitting on my bum on the floor on top of my brightly coloured hammock. I guess that says as much about my weight as it does about my knot-tying ability right! Still, I think I've got it sorted now, just in time to drag it out into the back garden with all the other sunbeds when my family arrive here for the wedding in a couple of weeks!What else? Oh, get this, I mentioned before that I play Words With Friends on FB against a few friends and one or two people I don't know. It's a pleasant way to spend 10 minutes first thing in the morning. But I also play once a day against \"botts\", or computers. I quite like these games because they are instantaneous, just five moves each, and they are over in less than five minutes. Well yesterday I got my best score ever against a bott - 175 points!!!! It was for the word \"breezed\" but it had a couple of \"triples\" in there so I was well pleased! Oh, and the creepy guy in Texas who wanted me to give him my email so we could \"get to know each other better\" - never heard from him again, so I guess we know what that was all about don't we!Moving on, I was saddened to learn today that the NYT (I think it's them), is no longer going to have political cartoonists on staff. Finished, because of a political cartoon (which I admit I haven't seen) about Netanyahu which wasn't even produced by their cartoonists! Wow! I guess I'm not totally surprised that events are moving in this direction but it really will be a sad day when political cartoonists can no longer weave their magic won't it!And finally, I mentioned previously that I had sent birthday wishes to my former BF on 28 May. He called me shortly thereafter and said let's have lunch when he could fit it around his schedule. He's a surgeon and I'm retired so I guess we go with his flow, right! Anyway, we agreed to meet up near his surgery and ended up having lunch in the inner courtyard of Geneva's natural history museum (I love natural history). The food was excellent and even though we go back 40 years he and I still hit it off like a house on fire. He was good company and although I'm fatter and he's balder you wouldn't think it had been 35 years since we dated! When he realized my family were coming out for the wedding he asked if we could all get together for a drink as he really liked my family (and they him)! Although we didn't end up together isn't it nice that we have remained friends to this day!The natural history museumTwo \"relics\" having lunch in amongst the relics!The Russian Orthodox Church next door!"},
{"title": "A productive day - and a misogynistic troll!", "date": "Sunday 9 June 2019", "text": "The weather is just unbelievable here. We get a few days of sunshine and then it's back to piddling down rain. I can't really say we have even had a spring, it's so weird. Buuuuttt the weather was glorious yesterday when our local town of La Roche held its annual (or is that semi-annual?) vide grenier! I routinely refer to a \"vide grenier\" - \"attic emptier\" in English - but for those that don't understand, they are not car boot sales as such, nor are they garage sales. They don't really have either here. Vide greniers are organized by the local village, commune or town where people can indeed set up stalls/tables and try to sell their unwanted items. You have to reserve and pay for your spot and all the stalls are centrally located. There is always food and drink available, sometimes a bouncy castle and sometimes even music! It's a very sociable event and also a great way to pick up a few items cheaply. Anyhoo, La Roche had theirs yesterday and were lucky enough to have the most glorious weather! I'm on a bit of a roll with the decluttering so I wanted to take a trip down to the recycling centre first (one of my \"foibles\" is that I have to get the stuff out of my house now if possible so I don't change my mind), and so I arranged to meet my friend in town. We had a merguez sandwich (a spicy North African sausage) as we wandered round but nothing seemed to catch our eye - or maybe we've just wise up to the fact that we don't always have to buy things - so we decided to go sit on the terrace of a lovely local restaurant and have a drink. The place was heaving so we had to wait ages, but we didn't mind actually as we were sat in the shade trying to decipher the latest missive from the UK Government on the \"driving licence position\" after Brexit! Great fun. We had quite a giggle because this shit makes the US constitution look like kindergarten reading! My friend's problem is that she never swapped her British driving licence for a French one when she moved into France (I did) because she didn't have to. Now she has sent off her licence to the French to get it swapped and they are either sending them back saying \"not necessary\" (as yet) or, as in her case, have just hung on to it. From what we can decipher, it may well come to the point that she will have to retake her test (including the highway code) at the age of 62!!!! What a bloody mess! I'm so glad I went ahead and swapped mine. It was like trying to read a Harry Potter novel in one sitting so we were really glad when the drinks came, I can tell ya!The church in La Roche. My husband used to hang out in the skuzzie bar opposite! \"Fond\" memories!A local drum band formed the only entertainment, as far as I could tell. Very loud, very inclusive (all ages) and actually great. They made you picture Rob Roy and the \"marauding\" clans swarming over the mountain top (or that could have been the wine)! But seriously they added a great (and unusual) atmosphere!When I got back I ended up spending an hour tidying up my front garden - which is a joke actually because it is about the size of a postage stamp, but at least I trimmed back the wisteria and the rose bushes as (a) I don't want the wisteria growing up into the eaves and (b) trimming back the roses allows me to open and close my shutters more easily!I stayed up late again (!!) because I saw that \"Mrs. Brown, Da Movie\" was on so I thought I would watch that. It's daft really because I bought it when it came out and I wasn't overly impressed (even though I love Mrs. Brown's Boys) but last night I either just \"got it\", or my taste has changed. Either way it tickled me this time!On to today (and most likely the rest of the week), and the weather has been crap! I wasn't too bothered about it though as I decided today would be the day to \"get things done\" - and I actually did! Now I've had my hair cut I decided to colour it - I don't have any grey (thank you dad - he never went grey) but I get a bit bored with the colour so occasionally decide to colour it to \"jizz\" things up a bit. Now this I can do, though that being said, many moons ago, when I was living in the States, I picked up the wrong colour dye and came out with jet black hair. I have pale skin and that hair colour would have put Morticia Addams to shame, so I have finally learned to be really careful to pick up the right box!With that needing 20 minutes to fix I set to and started working on my middle bedroom (the junk room) and got quite a bit done in 20 minutes, sorting sewing fabric and putting it into proper storage boxes (as opposed to in bags on the floor). After that it was a pedicure (ahhh bliss!) and I decided I was adamant that two bags of decluttering were also going to leave the house that afternoon. I managed to pick out five or six (can't remember) handbags, so that filled one trash bag, and then set to working on my sweaters (I mean, how many does one person need?) and fairly easily filled a second bag! Too much stuff!!!! So I hopped in the car right away and off I went to get it out the house immediately. It really is true what they say, you feel instantly \"lighter\" when something - anything - goes out that door (actually my divorce had the same effect)! So just another million bags to go then!Then, since I was on a roll, I decided to use up the odds and ends in the fridge to make lunch (and dinner as it turns out), so I put the Gypsy Kings on at full blast and worked my way through the \"leftovers\" compartment of my fridge, deciding to throw it all into a quiche. Lovely!I finalized the translation of the order of service for the wedding yesterday and sent that to Jen (it sounds less \"translated\" now), and because I must have been on speed or something, I decided I really had to sit down and get Jordan's US taxes done. So I pulled out his US tax paperwork and got started. Now he earns a pittance and in any case is entitled to over $100,000 \"foreign earned income exclusion\", but you still  have to do the paperwork to prove that he is fiscally resident here. Anyway, the forms have changed and even though much of it doesn't apply to him I took my time and waded through it nicely on the pdf form (bearing in mind that he left one job, was unemployed for a month, did one day's temporary work in a factory and then got another job - oh and filed French taxes) - and the first time I went to save it the bloody thing crashed. Damn, blast and sod it! So with much gnashing of teeth I did it all again, saved it and when I went to print it I was \"told\" that to use the fill-in pdf form I had to pay! Of course they offered a 30-day free trial but even with that they wanted my credit card number. NOOOOOO WAY JOSE!!! So I ended up going onto the IRS site proper (lesson learned) and did it yet again. Even then, when I went to print the various forms (1040, 2555-EZ and Schedule 6) many of the boxes that I had filled in didn't print. Some did - like his name and address - but not his social security number, so while it is correct online it didn't print properly! I had to go back through and hand fill-in the missing info! I seriously hopes he appreciates all my effort. Yeah, all that sodding effort for a filing where he owes diddly squat![And by the way, I'm having problems with the space bar on my computer so if you see words that looklikethisitsnotmespeakingGermanitsthebloodyspacebar!]And speaking of misogynistic trolls (I was at one time wasn't I?) I have spotted comments on a few ladies' blogs by an absolute dickhead of a troll, with a link to his bile-spewing blog (I had a look)! He obviously hates women - ok; he particularly hates white women - again ok; and he seemingly hates white American women more than anything else in the world! Wow! Just wow! I mean, they can be writing a post about kittens and he spews his bile! You see, all women over the age of 25 should just shrivel up and die because they are no longer beautiful and they offend his sensibilities. And did you know the ideal biological age for a woman to reproduce is between 18 and 23! Now having reproduced at, say, 23, I wonder who this dickhead thinks is going to raise these poor little orphans - their nubile mothers having had to shrivel up and die once they hit 25!!!! He rants about white women with black men, with Arabs - you name it, his loathing of women, and white women in particular is quite spectacular. One British lady whose blog he infested just wrote \"oh dear, he must be pms.ing\"! But I've seen  him on more than one blog (not mine as yet but he won't get through anyway). Now either this troll is a joker just trying to drive traffic to his vile blog, or he is deadly serious - and that's kinda scary in a \"who's gonna be the next mass shooter\" kinda way! I hope I'm wrong. For me I just picture a sad virgin with short, fat hairy legs, a bald pate and bad breath sitting behind his computer in his underpants in mommy's basement waging war on all those evil white bitches! So ladies, be warned!"},
{"title": "Made it!", "date": "Friday 7 June 2019", "text": "After four days of pretty crappy sleep I think things are starting to settle down a little. This kind of thing happens every so often - terrible sleep and nightmares - lasts about four days and then things go back to normal. I've no idea why but I know there seems to be a cycle, and I'm trying to break it with yoga and better habits. One of the \"habits\" I'm starting to get away from is blog reading in the morning. When I get up I have my breakfast and read the news online. But if I start blog reading I can be online for hours and end up pretty much wasting the whole day, so I'm trying (and so far succeeding) to keep my blog reading for the evenings. Anyway, this morning I was up and out and off to another market in a town called Bonneville and I think I just might make this my local market - well for a time at least.I wouldn't want to live in Bonneville as the traffic is horrendous. Whichever way you come at it it is just two-lane, nose to tail traffic. I know people at work who live in Bonneville and you struggle to make it to the motorway exit and end up with just a couple of kilometres to go - and it can end up taking you another 45 minutes! So nope, there's no way I would want to live there. Buut, I have to say it was a great little market, probably just a little bigger than my town's, with little bars and cafés all around. So I had a shufty, bought a couple of things and then decided to enjoy the sunshine and sit and have a drink before heading back.On the way back to my car I stopped to admire what looked like allotments but were most likely private gardens. Very, very long and pretty wide and full to the brim with beautiful flowers and veg. These were older homes and today you would never get a garden like that round here, so those people are very lucky - but they are certainly making the most of them! I follow a site on FB called Un Jardin au Paradis - which is a local small-holding pretty much built from scratch and given over to sustainable and organic farming. They are offering one-day courses on 14 and 16 June so I think I might go on one - not that I have that much land anyway - but it is a subject that really interests me. A friend went on one of their courses and loved it. Which makes me think I must go up and visit her. She has quite a bit of land (she used to keep donkeys) and I am keen to see if she has put any of their ideas into practice. A propos of nothing, she is also a vegan, yoga teacher, having completely turned her life around from being a pretty hard drinking, pot grower! She's still great fun either way!On my way home I stopped off for a hair appointment. I had taken the scissors to my hair a couple of weeks ago when it got on my nerves. I routinely do this, but eventually have to go and get Christelle to clean up my messes! I mean, fancy hacking at your own hair three weeks before your son's wedding! Must be nuts right! Anyway, while she was peering in disgust at the bird's nest that passed as my hair she asked what I had studied at university. When I said \"languages\" she just said \"right, well leave your bloody hair alone\"! I've known her for years so I wasn't the least bit insulted - and she was right anyway!When I got home the wind started to pick up. I guess we might be getting the tail end of the dreadful storm that has hit the west coast of France. Just my bloody luck as my roses and peonies are finally started to bloom. There probably won't be a head left on them by tomorrow morning!I had a quick snack of one of my newly-minted organic peaches smothered in Greek yoghurt and honey which was to die for! Seriously, if I ever got the death sentence, say, for murdering someone in Texas or dropping litter in Switzerland, I swear that would have to be my last meal! Then I settled down in my back garden to translate the order of ceremony for the wedding into English. I kept putting this off but realized I had to set to at some point. It took me about two hours and tomorrow I want to spend another hour on it de-franglicizing it with fresh eyes, just in case. Other than that I'm on track, but there is stuff in there that Jen asked me to keep secret from Jordan as she has some hush-hushh stuff going on! My lips are sealed!And finally, we were informed through the retirees' association yesterday of the recent death of a colleague. Sylvain was only 62 and it hit pretty near to home I can tell you! I know \"of\" him as I would have input his file into the computer when I worked in HR. I also knew him personally, although not well at all. I have no idea how he died but 62???? Seriously! And I'll say it again, I'm so glad I made the decision to retire when I did. Just have to step up the work on the healthy lifestyle now!"},
{"title": "Well that didn't work!", "date": "Thursday 6 June 2019", "text": "I think I mentioned a couple of days ago that I wanted to start going to bed earlier (than 1-2 a.m.) in order to get up earlier, so last night I duly forced myself to go to bed at 11 p.m. with the idea of reading for a little while and switching the lights off. At 1 a.m. I got back up again as I couldn't bloody sleep! I figured it wouldn't be easy for a few days but I could feel that there was no way sleep was coming any time soon. My doctor had given me tablets before my Sri Lanka trip to help me relax/sleep on the plane so I decided to take one of those, although I doubt I take even 3-4 a year! Anyway, I had a fairly decent night's sleep and was raring to go when I woke up - at 10.50 a.m.!!!! Bloody hell! So much for getting an early start! But I have also decided that I want to try to do some form of exercise every day if I can (but not during the mid-day sun) so I duly set to and did a few yoga exercises our wonderful young teacher had taught us. And you know what? Even just doing 20 or so minutes was so worth it as I felt so good afterwards!Anyway, \"getting up with the larks\" (not) meant that I missed our local town's Thursday market! Damn and dratt, but I guess I'll go to another one in Bonneville tomorrow. By the time I did trot into town I was in time to stop in at the notary's to pick up the attestation they had prepared for me. It took a month and cost me €50 but they had done a search of the local property registers and were able to give me an attestation to the effect that I actually own my own home. So that's one thing crossed of my list towards my French naturalisation request. I think my birth certificate and mom and dad's marriage certificate etc. should also be here by next week (in French), so that's another check mark. My next project is to fill out a form called \"cerfa\" but crikey it's detailed. I have to give all the details of my brothers and sisters and all my previous addresses! The \"addresses\" bit took some thinking about as I have moved about a bit but I think I've got them all down. The Pittsburgh address was actually the most difficult to pin down as I no longer have our US tax returns (my ex took those) but with a bit of help from google maps I managed to find our little street!After that I planned to go grocery shopping. Now just down from the supermarket is a sportswear shop (they're big around here obviously) and there used to be a kind of paper/diary/music/book shop which I thought was very nice but it went out of business. I had heard that a burger joint was going to replace it (yuck - I mean there's a McDonald's 30 minutes away, we don't need another one). Buuuut, it turns out it was replaced with a health food/vegan/vegetarian/bio (organic) shop so that's good news. I didn't need much in the way of groceries anyway so thought I would have a look round. Very nice it is too, but obviously it's pretty pricey. Organic food (they call it \"bio\" here) is more expensive than the non-organic stuff but I realised while I don't spend a fortune I am still buying/cooking too much for one person so I am still wasting food. I guess the \"bright\" idea then is to buy and cook less so while I don't think I'll do all my shopping there (our other store sells bio stuff also) I might give it a shot. I do wonder, though, if it will work out as there is another similar store about 500 metres away and yet another, much smaller, store right in the centre of town. I hope it works though. And I really hope going back to organic is something that will be feasible in the future. After all, it used to be the only way older generations ate didn't it - I mean, it was normal! I don't think it will be possible for everyone as producing food for the masses just isn't possible that way, but you can only do what's possible for you can't you!"},
{"title": "How to cause a revolution!", "date": "Wednesday 5 June 2019", "text": "I almost fell off my seat when the Donald gave a speech the other day with Theresa May about how he was going to negotiate the \"biggest trade deal ever between our two countries - but that also includes the NHS being on the table …\". I'm paraphrasing here as my eyes were glued on Theresa May - whose own eyeballs almost popped out of her head! The British people had always been assured that the NHS (the National Health Service) was never going to be \"up for grabs\" so I think any party that tried to put that on the table would be kicked out of power before they had ever gotten their bums off their seats!Thankfully the Donald did a complete reversal (surprise, surprise) in very short order as people were instantly up in arms! Bloody hell, with all due respect, the last thing we need in the UK is a US-style health system! That's not to say that some facets of it couldn't be incorporated into it and I believe many medications are indeed bought from the US, but to (eventually) switch to an insurance-style health system would, I feel, be catastrophic for the country and for any party who tried to introduce it! I know we already have a dual system which includes private medical insurance (for some) but free treatment at the point of delivery should be inscribed into our (unwritten) constitution! I have no idea what Steve's recent treatment (chemo and bone marrow transplant) cost, including almost five weeks in hospital. Then my brother was in hospital for one month before he died. My dad had two bypasses 20 years apart. And the list goes on. No bills! In fact, I think I was the only one in my family lucky enough to never have to go into hospital when I lived in the UK. While the NHS desperately needs a revamp, and support for our wonderful doctors and nurses, importing foreign management will never be the way to do it!Still, the look on Theresa May's face (and others') was almost worth it!"},
{"title": "Time to get a grip!", "date": "Tuesday 4 June 2019", "text": "Having done pretty much bugger all all day I realize I have to get a grip on this retirement thingy. I have always been a late bird but going to bed at 1 a.m. (or even 2 a.m.) most nights probably isn't the best way to go about it. It means I tend to get up around 8.30 a.m., so not horrendous but I think I really need to get into a better routine. All the more so since the good weather is on its way and I can't take the mid-day heat! I know, I know, here I am already whinging about the heat when they have had 500 tornadoes in one month in the US mid-west! But I really can't take the heat - hence I need to start getting up earlier. Otherwise, lately, I just seem to be wasting my days. Not that I minded looking at the scenery and with the peonies just starting to bud it was a pleasure but I don't want too many days like that, to be honest!For once I don't even want to be on that plane!What wasn't a waste though was my Tuesday afternoon yoga lesson. I love it. But, the young teacher is into yoga all the way and occasionally brings in a harmonium for anyone who wants 10 minutes of \"mantra chanting\" in Sanskrit at the end of the lesson. Maybe it'll grow on me but so far I can't say it's my thing. To make matters worse, you know how when you go to your kids' Christmas concert and the kid who is completely tone deaf is the one with the loudest voice. Well we've got one of them in our group. All I could hear was her off-key screeching and it made me just want to giggle. I didn't want to be rude so just closed my eyes and tried to keep myself in check - it wasn't easy though! But, like I say, this young teacher is excellent - and it turns out she isn't as young as she looks! I had her pegged at early 30s but when she realized I was English she told me she had been engaged to a Brummie (someone from Birmingham, England) about 20 years ago, so easily making her in her 40s. Well I'm a Brummie and with apologies to any other Brummies out there - seriously we have the worst accents you can imagine. If you have ever watched Peeky Blinders you'll get it! She said there was no way she could understand his mother and had to try to just wing it. I laughed when I described the look of absolute horror on my Algerian boyfriend's face when he met my family. His English wasn't very good anyway, and while my family really took to him - he just couldn't understand them!And talking of Karim, as I was marking off the day on my wall calendar on 28 May I realized it was his birthday. We had got back in touch again when I found out he did an emergency operation one Easter Sunday on a friend's son and her husband recognized him from way back when. Anyway, I sent him a \"happy birthday\" message and he called me back about 10 minutes later and we are going to get together for lunch sometime soon - and he said he will show me around his surgery. Did well for himself, I guess, but then I always knew he would!Then on Wednesday I met up with my friend for a drink after I had used the gym. He was in a bit of a \"pissy\" mood because he had started smoking again and felt rough. So he told me he was going to have just \"one more\" then give the packet to me to dispose of. Well I just threw them in my bag (although why I don't know because I have never smoked). Traffic on the way home was bloody awful for both of us. I got stuck near the airport at a complete standstill for about 40 minutes and it took me 90 minutes to get all the way home. Again! I tell ya, I don't miss that at all. In fact, one day last week someone posted a travel advisory to \"watch out\" at a particular spot just after the border because sheep had broken loose from their paddock and were on the motorway. It just keeps getting better doesn't it!So when I was at a standstill (engine off) I texted C to say that I \"felt like a ciggie\" - just to annoy him really - so found the cigarette lighter, lit one up and sent him a photo of me \"enjoying that ciggie\". Yuck! Then of course because I had never smoked I didn't have the right \"wrist flick\" action to get the ash off that thing. Started panicking looking for the ashtray (which I have never used either) but finally figure out how to open it before I burned my car seats! I guess that'll teach me to play smart ass huh!And finally, I see the Donald is bestowing his presence on the UK again (and his four adult kids - what's with that?) Not to worry, Queenie can handle him. But while I have never liked him, I have to admit Melania can pull it off in the fashion stakes! I know, lots of money and stylists help but she is definitely a credit to the (mainly US) designers whose gowns she wears! I could have all those advantages and still end up looking like something the dog threw up! Oh well, I guess we all have different vocations in life don't we!"},

{"title": "Slowly but surely!", "date": "Thursday 30 May 2019", "text": "Well I still  have a million things flitting through my head to write about - hence the name of this blog really I suppose. But somehow, I added a few more! Today, being Ascension, it is a public holiday here in France, so not much going on. I didn't know if our local market was on as usual because of the  holiday but decided to forget about it and settle down to get a few things done at home. I mean, in France there is always another market tomorrow. And yes, indeed, I will head off to the market in Bonneville tomorrow before doing my grocery shopping. I have occasionally been to this market (not routinely being off on a Friday), but it will be good in any case to check out another one.Anyway, where was I? Oh yes. There is an expression in French that goes \"je saute du coq à l'âne\" which basically means I \"jump from the rooster to the donkey\" - or my mind goes in a million different directions at once! I guess that's me at the moment.Anyhoo, back to the real world. Mother's Day in France is always the last Sunday in May. Jordan was born on Sunday, 31 May in 1992, so on French Mother's Day. In Switzerland (where my oldest lives), Mother's Day is two weeks prior, so mid-May. Anyway, I knew Jordan and Jen were going to lunch at her mother's for Mother's Day and it didn't bother me, so I invited them to stop over on the evening. I can't say this stuff bothers me that much so having them go to her mom's for lunch was fine by me. (I remember one Christmas after my divorce that there was absolutely no way I was going to spend Christmas with their dad and his skank so told the kids to go to his place. They were torn of course but I just thought \"get on with it\", I ain't having him here so go there)! And I was fine with it!Anyway, after lunch Jordan sent me a message to ask if Jen's mom could come over with them! WELL OF COURSE SHE CAN! I learned afterwards that mom wasn't doing too well so \"come on over\"! Well they came over and we started off playing some extremely daft board games while dinner was cooking, but you know what? It was fun!I tend to cook for an army anyway so I don't see where the problem is and we ended up having a very nice evening together! Monday night was our last \"Monday night sewing club\", of which I am now the \"Présidente\". We didn't plan on sewing but had decided that we would all eat together. Everyone bought a dish and it was a very, very nice evening. The club meetings are not a course as such as everyone takes their projects and does what they want but we have a lady who comes along and who really knows how to sew and she helps out wherever. This is the first year for Patricia to help us out, and to say that she is really \"rough around the edges\" would be an understatement! She has had a tough life and it shows but she is actually very, very nice and we all appreciate her. Anecdotally, her father was a \"native (US) Indian\" (not sure how I'm supposed to phrase that), who came over to France just after WWII and never went back. But she said he was an evil, alcoholic bastard who ruled with a rod of iron (when he was sober enough to do so) and her mom lived a life of hell - until he abandoned her and their five children! So to say she is \"tough\" probably is an understatement! Add to that, a few years ago her 20-something year old son was dashing down the stairs to go out, fell, smashed the back of his skull in and is now permanently brain-damaged. She has had to fight to get him the help he needs knowing that he will never get better, so I'm sure you can see why we all take her \"abrasive\" tongue with so much leeway! In fact, on Monday evening she was ranting about something when I looked at her and said (in French), \"you know Patricia, to hear you speak is pure poetry! When my appointment comes through for my naturalisation (to become French) and where I will have to have prove that I speak French fluently - maybe we can get together so that I can practice with you - I'm sure they will be impressed!\" At which point she just doubled up laughing! Which was the whole point really! She is rough around the edges, but is good at what she does and we like her! I had spoken to Geneviève previously and she said she would buy a wine set for Patricia as a thank you from all of us, so I said I would get some flowers, to show our appreciation. Well I went down to St. Pierre to my local shop that morning only to find out that they weren't open on Mondays! Damn! So I dashed off back to our local town where I thought/hoped our bigger flower shop would be open - which it was! I picked out a lovely arrangement and took it in to pay for it when the lady asked if \"it was to be placed on the coffin immediately?\" I said \"I hope not, she's not dead\"! At which point the lady was at pains to point out that \"no of course, they weren't typically funereal flowers\". When I think about it, that shop is mainly for funeral flowers but …. how was I to know. I thought \"shall I tell Patricia or shan't I\" - and in the end I thought \"sod it\" and I did. We all had a great laugh!One big issue that came up as we were chatting over dinner was that our group is a very friendly, happy group. Mid-year Pascale showed up and asked if she could join! No prior contact, she just showed up! Well that was no problem of course, yep come along and join in! Except, Pascale was a miserable, demanding sodding cow from day one! What to do! She was obviously (physically) not well - that was apparent from the get go. Terribly, terribly thin, with a pinched mouth! But she was also very, very demanding right from the start! It didn't matter whether Patricia was helping someone else or not Pascale interrupted and \"demanded\" attention immediately! Now, looking at her you could see that there was something very, very wrong immediately. She was stick thin with a pinched mouth and a very, very sour personality. I had been absent one week (probably when I was in Sri Lanka or Cinque Terre) but the following week they asked me how old I was!!!! I said \"you know I celebrated my 60th in Sicily in September so what gives?\" So they asked me how old I thought Pascale was - to which I answered \"not far off 80\".  Turns out, she was also 60. So compare fatty old me to skinny old her at the same age, and I can tell you she didn't come out of that comparison well! I was stunned!Now apparently she suffers from anorexia. Seemingly many years ago a boyfriend had told her she was too fat and …. there you go. But she is a thoroughly, thoroughly unpleasant person. Cynthia, one of our group, is Swiss and moved into France probably 20-30 years ago. At the time she had Swiss plates and said she remembered going to get her Swiss plates changed to French and Pascale happened to be working there (pre-anorexia). She told her that she would \"denounce\" her to the authorities if she didn't get it done in time!!! As Cynthia said, \"I was well within the time limits and here I was doing the necessary to get my Swiss plates changed to French plates when this miserable cow 'threatened' me\"! And she was right! She has always been a miserable sod apparently! It turns out that Pascale is married and has a daughter but is unpleasant to everyone. AND it turns out that when I missed one night when I was away she had been so, so rude to Patricia and Cynthia because Patricia was helping Cynthia and not her! I realize that this woman has problems, but it seems to me that she was more than unpleasant before that. My ex-husband had \"problems\", but beyond a certain point, \"hey asshole, deal with them\"!So obviously a lot going on here. Cynthia knows her mom and says she is very sweet. God alone knows what Pascale's husband and daughter go through. BUT she is a thoroughly unpleasant person at the club and Patricia said \"nope, she goes\"! Now there were two of us who were willing to give her another chance but as Patricia rightly said if you end up with a \"cow\" like that coming to the club other nicer people will stay away so she has to accept the consequences of her behaviour. And they are right. She has, seemingly always been a thoroughly unpleasant person, so they have decided it is \"niet\" to her re-enrolling. But it's sad really isn't it!And finally (for today), Jen asked me (confidentially) to translate something for her from French to English. So today I was intending to translate the order of service for their wedding ceremony but was having terrible problems with my computer. I had downloaded Office 365 as a staff member of my former employer and honestly there was no problem with my continuing to use it (until when?)! But every time I tried opening a word document I kept having to sign in with my former, employer account - and I had forgotten the password! In the meantime I had bought Office 365 for myself and downloaded it but couldn't get \"word\" to switch from the employer account to my personal account. Anyhoo, I logged on to Microsoft support with my problem, whereupon a lovely lady called Trista spent two-and-a-half hours trying to fix my problem by remote logging - and in the end she did it! But two-and-a-half-hours! Anyway, what can I say. I had nothing confidential on my computer so told her to go ahead and kept checking when she needed me to try logging in again (and again, and again). But hats off to Microsoft support - I was really impressed! In the meantime, I hope it will allow me to go ahead and translate Jen's order of service and, completely confidentially (schhhhtttt - don't tell Jordan) - she is practicing to recite her vows to him in English (once I have translated them of course)!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Wednesday 29 May 2019", "text": "It seems like ages since I posted but I suppose it hasn't been really. I guess I've just been so busy (nothing that important of course) that time has flown by! And I've come to realize that I actually like being busy (for the most part) even in retirement. When I was at work I much preferred being busy rather than not having much to do. You get lazy don't you? Or at least I did! So where was I? Oh yes, Turin.Last Saturday my friend and I took our, now annual, trip to Turin market, only this time, for the first time, we weren't lucky with the weather at all! It absolutely peed down all day, to the point that I think everyone on our bus was thoroughly soaked! For once I thought ahead and actually took a towel and change of socks in my bag, but boy did we get wet! Still, we both enjoyed it as always, and ate, yet again, in a little bistro off the main market square. And as always it was excellent. To be honest, I'm not sure you can eat badly in Italy at all!!! I didn't go nuts at the market this time though, just bought myself a very cheap pair of lazing around slacks (wish I'd bought three or four pairs - they turned out to be great), a nice, new handbag and a couple of shirts for my son. After that, it was fruit and veggies, and again they are just out of this world - and so cheap compared to here!Now I know these are different varieties of avocado (bought in France on the left and in Italy on the right) but the quality of the much cheaper Italian avocado just bore no comparison!We had a wander around the indoor fish and meat market, where everything looked so wonderful. I think next time I will get myself better organized and take a large cooler to stock up!To get out of the rain, just before we were to head back to the bus my friend and I stopped off for a drink. Her hot chocolate was so thick you could have stood your spoon up in it!On the way back we again stopped off at the Italian hypermarket where people stocked up on the cheaper Italian produce and alcohol and then back home for around 8 p.m. It was a shame about the weather but what can I say … we still love going! We found out at the end of our trip that there had been a second bus going from our depot and bumped into a lovely lady that I used to know when I went to my Monday evening patchwork club. We also bumped into a colleague who is still working - the one who forwarded my tax information regarding my lump sum to the French tax authorities without my permission! She is one of those big \"blousy\" women, with trowelled on make-up, beehive hair and a loud mouth and though I tried to dodge her I got caught out. She was asking how retirement was and I told her how much I was enjoying it, to which she replied \"well of course you were a higher grade than me - that's why you can afford to retire and I can't, even though I'm older\"!!! She didn't see the irony of then going on to tell us that she went down to Turin clothes shopping every weekend while they were running these bus trips! I bit my tongue as there honestly is no point trying to reason with some people is there!The next day was the semi-annual Foire du Tissus (Fabric Fair), where the big fabric sellers come down from Holland and Belgium to sell their beautiful fabrics. We were late getting there but whole busloads of people had come from Switzerland and taken back suitcases of fabric - I guess it's that much cheaper than in Switzerland. I wouldn't know, actually, as I wouldn't even know where to shop for fabric in Switzerland any more. Here again we bumped into three ladies from my former patchwork group and I promised to stop in and see them the following week. I was actually very reasonable and only bought two pieces of fabric for €10. You could go mad there, of course, but I reckon I have enough fabric to keep me happy for quite a while and a few projects on the go that need finishing up first. (In any case, don't tell anyone, but the Fair will be back in town in November!!).Anyway, I decided that I would, indeed, stop back in to visit my patchwork ladies as they were a nice group. So I had a shot at baking Anzac cookies (for the first time) to take to visit. They didn't work out exactly as planned as I made them too runny and they were \"gooping\" all over the place. Not to worry, I cut them out with a cookie-cutter after baking and they turned out great in the end! Anyway, I popped in to see the ladies just as they were having a coffee and cake break during their all-afternoon sewing session. I told them that I wouldn't be coming back to the group as I didn't want to take on too many weekly commitments, but they said to just to pop along a couple of times a month when I felt like it - so I probably will as I have so much to learn from them. Their work is beautiful!  But .. don't laugh … when I got home I felt like I was going to sneeze so tried to reach into my trouser pocket for my hankie, only I couldn't get it … I had had my brand new Italian trousers on backwards all day and hadn't noticed! Seriously! You wouldn't want me to make alterations to your clothes now would you!And I know I was saying in a previous post about how we Brits love to talk about the weather but look at these babies which have been hanging overhead for about the last week! Yeah, spring! Ya gotta love it!"},
{"title": "Oh God!", "date": "Monday 27 May 2019", "text": "We played a few board games yesterday and ate outside, but I just read this about being British too!  Damn, I really am such a cliché!\"Being so determined to sit in the lovely warm sunshine that you completely disregard how cold you are!\"Oh dear, I have another \"odds and sods\" post all lined up in my head but I have tons to do today and yesterday was full on (being Mother's Day here in France), so I'm re-posting something I just saw about \"being British\".

{"title": "Odds and sods!", "date": "Thursday 16 May 2019", "text": "It's been a funny ol' couple of days I have to admit, but the best news is that I just received a message from Steve to say that he came out of hospital last night after over four weeks in isolation following his bone marrow transplant! Way to go mate! I posted about him not being quite his normal self when I was staying with him in August last year - with it turning out that shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with cancer. So he immediately started chemo and various other treatments with a view to having a bone marrow transplant \"as and when\". Well he went in to hospital just over a month ago, spent the entire time after the transplant in isolation in Liverpool Hospital and is now home! I'm so, so pleased for him. Other than being incredibly tired (and bald) he is doing really well. And yet again, I say thank God for the NHS because after all that treatment (and continuing check-ups) he walked out of there with not a single bill to pay. Socialized medicine at its best!In other news, I have finally decided to go ahead and begin the paperwork to request French citizenship. It will take at least two years from when I submit the paperwork but knowing that most of this paperwork will be necessary for me to get a French resident's permit after Brexit anyway (if it ever happens - I still hope not), I may as well go ahead and request citizenship. So with that in mind, I drew up a list of all the paperwork they will need, which isn't particularly onerous if, like me, you are administratively minded anyway. So today I called the notary's office to ask for an attestation from them to the effect that I own my own home here in Haute Savoie. I just have to take a few papers down to them tomorrow and they will begin the \"search\" to prove that I am still the registered owner of my home and I should get my attestation in a couple of weeks. Then I was faffing about online as I needed a copy of my parents' birth certificates, their marriage certificate and my own birth certificate, but the kicker here is that while I know all the relevant dates, what the official search engine in the U.K. needs to find the appropriate references is not the dates of those events but when they were registered! Crikey! For instance, I know my mom was born 5 October 1921 but they don't want that to find the reference number, they need the date her birth was registered!!! It's pretty funny actually because she was Welsh and her maiden name was Jones, and if you ever look at the names of the Welsh rugby team you will see that 75 per cent of the team are called Jones - so it should be a doddle to find her reference (not!) - especially given that her mother's maiden name was Williams (see the remaining 25 per cent of the Welsh rugby team)! Anyway, I found a \"Gwladys M. T, née Jones\" registered in the right quarter in a small town called Llanrwst, so I'm hoping and praying I got the right one. Dad was easier as his mom's maiden name was more unusual, so with a bit of luck all that paperwork is winging its way to me as I speak. The good news though is that for a small extra fee the UK authorities offer to provide that paperwork in a multilingual format (I had to specify \"French\") so hopefully that will mean that I won't have to go to the trouble of having it re-translated by a recognized French translator. We'll see I suppose!  And like I say, I'm doing it a bit at a time so I'm not exactly stressing about it! It's weird though because had I chosen to request U.S. citizenship \"in the day\" when I was living in the U.S., it wouldn't have taken one-tenth of the work that French citizenship will. I didn't do it because at the time I would have had to give up my British citizenship and there was no way I was doing that. The U.S. changed the rules on that shortly thereafter and began recognizing dual citizenship, hence my boys have both U.S. and U.K. passports!And talking of \"Jones\", I heard from my sister last night that my mom's last remaining sibling died yesterday in North Wales. My sister must have had some kind of premonition because she and her husband went up there on Tuesday to see our aunt, only for her to die yesterday as they were on their way back. So that's the last of my family on the \"Jones\" side - all gone now!In other news, I got a call from my youngest and his wife on Tuesday to say that they had been to see an apartment in a place called St. Jeoire, had put in an offer on it, which had been accepted, and they were hoping to go ahead with the purchase when they got the final approval from the bank - but they have been told it will go through. I'm so excited for them. They've both knuckled down and worked hard so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for them that they are, indeed, able to get on this first step of the ladder!On the home front, I'm slowly learning that it's ok if something doesn't get done today because, you know what, there's always tomorrow! And that is a really nice feeling. That being said, I'm trying to get myself into a routine of getting in some exercise, something done in the house, a little sewing and some gardening done every day just to keep things ticking over - and so far it seems to be working! To that end on Monday I spent four hours pressure spraying my front and back terrace to get the winter's crud off and boy was it hard work. It was also quite windy so as I was spraying the moss and crap loose the wind was blowing it back in my face and I ended up looking like I had a beard!! Talk about cruddy! So with all the aches and pains that came with that I was really looking forward to my Tuesday afternoon yoga lesson to iron all those creaks out. Except I got a message from my friend asking if he could come over and buy me lunch! Say what? We split up about four years ago (it was my decision, I just felt we weren't going anywhere), but have remained friends all the same. But he hasn't been to my place in four years so I'm wondering what's going on. Anyway, we went to the one and only restaurant in the village for lunch and had a great time! He was saying how much he loved where I live, how calm it is and so on and then we came back to my place and spent another four or five hours chatting away and it was really nice! I have no idea what was going on there but I guess it doesn't really matter either does it! We will always be friends and he will always be welcome here - it's just that I'm curious as to why now? Why come over after four years? Oh well! Then yesterday I was determined to drive in to work to use the gym as I really needed some kind of exercise, having missed out on the yoga. I bumped into a few colleagues and every one of them said how well I looked - \"younger\" was the most common term! Now I don't know about \"younger\" but I guess more rested could have something to do with it. It hit home to me last night, though, as my nephew sent me a message to ask if I knew that mom's sister had died and after a bit of a chat he said he was going to go to bed!!! What!!!! It was 9.30 pm in the UK!!!! When I told him I never went to bed before 12.30 - 1 a.m. he couldn't believe it. But, even when I was working I would only go to bed around 12.30 a.m. as I felt that if I went any earlier I really didn't have a life, what with getting home so late! And it's true! I didn't! So maybe I do look more rested now that I'm still going to bed at the same time but not getting up until I darn well feel like it. I guess sleep really is the big healer isn't it!Then after using the work's gym I met up again with my friend for a drink and also with a couple of other colleagues who go way back to when I first came to Geneva in 1980. We had such a laugh reminiscing! It was really great!And talking of exercise, I went to the market this morning and then on to the supermarket. From there I always take a small back road back home instead of going through town. Now I don't know what made me do it but I saw a woman parking up in a rather remote spot and getting out of her car with her hiking gear. So I screeched in next to her leaving her covered in a cloud of dust from my tyres (for which I apologized) and asked if she could recommend any good hiking trails in the area as she would seem to be \"in the know\"! Well I got talking to her and she told me she was off to join her hiking group to hike up \"le Grand Môle\" and I might want to join them next Thursday. Turns out this was the lady I had once called about the Thursday afternoon walking group but didn't join up in the end as I didn't want to have too many commitments! How odd! I actually asked if her name was Christiane and when she said yes we knew we had already talked on the phone. I guess that's God's way of saying \"so what's your excuse now\"?, although to be honest, once the hot weather hits the thought of hiking in the mid-day sun could be as good an excuse as any!And I see that the Jeremy Kyle show has been definitively cancelled! Good, is all I can say! For those that don't know it, it's a kinda U.K. version of the Jerry Springer show. Bear-baiting to all intents and purposes, where the \"participants\" usually have a grand total of 56 tattoos and four teeth between them! It is (was) absolute crap and I, for one, am glad it has been canned. Then again, if they canned all the \"Real Housewives of XXX\", \"Keeping up with the XXXX\", \"Don't be tardy\" crap I think the world would be a better place, to be honest. Yeah I know, we don't need censorship since we all have an on/off switch on our TVs, and to be honest the only one I have ever seen in any detail was the Kyle show anyway, but honestly, it's no loss. I'm sorry for the guy who committed suicide but I can't help believing these people know what they are getting into and in any case the show really is simply scripted bear-baiting! OK, rant over!Anyway, on that note, I shall probably not post for a few days. I'm off to Turin (again) on Saturday for our annual day trip to the market. I hear the weather isn't supposed to be great but that doesn't really matter. Then on Sunday they have the annual fabric fair here in town so it could be a \"spendy\" weekend.  Oh well. Onwards and upwards, as they say!"},
{"title": "Never plant out before les Saints de Glace!", "date": "Saturday 11 May 2019", "text": "And the locals should know, although having lived here in this village for 30 years (and in this region for 36) you'd figure I would \"think\" like a local wouldn't you! Well apparently not! Ya see, round here they say never to plant your veggie plot until after les Saints de Glace have passed - that's from 11 to 13 May this year - because you can still get frost! Our village is at 800 metres above sea level (so around 2,400 feet) and yep, we did get frost twice last week! But every year we have such glorious months of March and April that I think \"hey, spring is here, let's plant out all those seedlings I started\". And every year I get shat upon from a great height (forgive the expression), the bloody weather turns and my seedlings get pummeled to smithereens! What's the expression - \"keep doing what you always do and don't be surprised if you keep getting what you always get\" - or something like that. Well I guess, to be honest, I did  listen somewhat this year because although I planted out a few cucumbers that I had grown from seed I did ferry them in and out of the house as the weather changed. So I've lost a few but I've still got some coming up that I finally learned to treat like the delicate seedlings that they are!I absolutely love \"roma\" tomatoes - not sure what they call them in English - a kind of plum tomato that has little juice but tons of taste. But I find if I don't jump on the plants and buy them when I see them they often sell out! So I bought five decent-looking plants and have, indeed, been hardening them outside and bringing them in at night \"just in case\". I've got more seedlings on the go of course but I was thinking I would plant them all outside this weekend as I have a quiet few days - and then this happened!Sous-Cou - the Mont Blanc is off to the left out of pictureThe mountain behind my house is called Sous-Cou and is at about 1,600 metres. And we've still got bloody snow on it!!!!! Behind that to the right (but immersed in cloud) is Sous-Dine, which is the place to go locally if you want to see wild life (and where the hunters go). Beyond that is the Massif des Aravis, which is stunning of course, but seriously, at this point in the year shouldn't winter be over?Sous-DineMassif des AravisI had great plans to pressure spray my back terrace this morning - well that was until the hail came! Anyway, I nipped to our next village for the Saturday market and was chatting to the stall-holder there. He just laughed when I told him I had planted stuff out already and said \"look at the bloody hail\". His response? \"Oh, you should always wait till after the Saints de Glace\"! Maybe one day I'll learn!Anyway, moving on, I went in to work yesterday as I had made plans to meet friends for lunch. I normally try to go in to work to use the gym on Wednesday (because the traffic is, theoretically, easier) but since I was meeting friends I took my gym bag and flowers for an adorable colleague who has just announced she is pregnant and pootled into Geneva around 10 a.m. So I piddled around in the gym for an hour or so, but you know what, although it is \"piddling\" (and it really is) I always feel so great when I leave! After that I went to lunch with a couple of friends - great Italian food (again!) and good company - and then came back to work as I had offered to drive one of my colleagues to the airport on the way home. But when we got back to work there were diplomatic cars arriving one after the other after the other - and the red carpet was out! Now since I'm no longer a staff member (but retirees still have access badges) I didn't know that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was coming today to meet the big boss and give a speech - to which all staff were also invited! I would have been interested to hear his speech but since I had showed up in jeans and a t-shirt I thought it would have been out of place for me to attend. But still, here's me thinking that red carpet was for me (yeah, as if!)!Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary GeneralSo moving on, I finally got around to starting reading \"Fire and Fury\" this week! I've had this book for a couple of months but since I always have piles of books sitting looking at me waiting to be read this one kinda got buried for a while. (A propos of nothing, I just finished reading \"Thin Air\" by Michelle Paver, which I kinda enjoyed - the story of ghostly hauntings out in the Himalayas, if you're interested)! Anyway, I haven't been able to put the book down, going to bed at 1-2 a.m. reading it every night. It's very well written (although too many \"commas\" maybe to my taste - you'd have to read it to understand, I guess. Sometimes the sentences get a bit convoluted with \"sub\" texts written between commas so I have to keep going back and re-reading to make sure I get all it all - and I'm no dummy when it comes to English - so that's only a minor criticism from my point of view)! That criticism aside, I find it an absolutely fascinating insight into the workings of the White House - or more exactly - the non-workings of the cast of characters in the current White House! It's pretty fascinating (and horrifying) stuff so far, so if you want a good read (and to totally depress yourself) read on!And finally, I see that the newspapers are full of the story of Vlad (\"the Impaler\"?) doing a face-plant while playing ice hockey! Don't get me wrong, as someone who can't skate I'm in no way making fun of his face-plant, but apparently his team won 14-6 (I think) with him scoring eight of the goals! Seriously? Do you think any of the opposing team would dare to tackle old shark eyes! And this, seemingly, a guy who the Donald worships at the alter of (I know, I know, Churchill would hate that sentence!)  Oh well, I hear the Donald was thinking of warming up on the sidelines just in case Vlad's victory was ever in doubt! Nah, I don't think there was ever any doubt who would score the winning goal do you?"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Wednesday 8 May 2019", "text": "Well what crappy weather we've been having! Rain, rain and more rain! I put four large buckets outside on my garden wall to catch rainwater and they were all full to the brim in just a couple of days! I suppose it's probably a good thing a group of us neighbours decided a couple of years ago to dig up part of our back gardens and put in large drainage pipes to channel the underground springs away from our homes as this is exactly the kind of weather that gets homes (usually our basements) flooded! But even though as a Brit I generally don't mind the rain, even I'm ready for it to go away now!Other than that, what's new! Not a lot really. I was on a bit of a roll last week and got a lot done by my new \"retired person\" standards. I had a bunch of stuff I wanted to take to Emmaus, which is the big charity organization in France, but I had never gotten round to finding out exactly where the drop off point is. So last Monday I punched their address into my GPS and took a whole load of stuff over there - only thing is, it doesn't look like I got rid of anything when I go back down into my basement! It's weird how those little gremlins move in overnight and fill up the empty space you've just made isn't it! Still, it's a start! And funnily enough my friend must have had the same idea the same day and I found out that she was there just before me! Now she was donating some nice stuff and it got me to thinking that for young couples starting out you could pick up some very nice stuff second-hand if you were prepared to look around!And talking of \"starting out\", on Saturday we held our latest board game evening at my neighbours' house. We were quite a few down on our normal numbers but my son and his new wife were there and they told me that they had been to look at a two-bedroomed apartment for sale just down the valley from them. It seemed to be in pretty good condition and they were going to see if they could negotiate the price down a little and put in an offer. The only thing that worried them was that what with the wedding and the down payment on the apartment their savings would be wiped out! And man I know how that feels because on 26 April those \"greedy bankers\" wiped out my nice, healthy bank balance and took the final payment on my house! About $100,000 - so I'm down to bread and gruel from now on but at least the house is all mine! Well actually this is the second time this house has been \"all mine\" because my husband and I had it paid off about 15 years ago - and then he decided to go AWOL and buggered off with his fat-ankled skank (it didn't last - I mean, who couldn't have seen that coming)! Not that I'm complaining about that but having to buy him out means I've actually paid off this house twice now. But at least this time it's all mine and only mine! Yay me!Oh and here's another weird thing! I read quite a few blogs and one of the \"blogging ladies\" mentioned one time how creepy (usually married) guys often start up games of Words With Friends on Facebook to try to pick up women!!! Say what! I play Words With Friends with a few people I don't know, including one chappie in New York who sends me silly jokes from time to time. Other than him, if I don't know the person I don't communicate, just play. It's all women anyway as far as I can see, although one lady did play the word \"fart\" once and then sent me a message saying \"sorry about that\". I just sent her a \"no worries\" back! Well this person with a very \"gender ambiguous\" name asked me to play a game. There was a very blurred photo attached to the request and it seemed to be a woman, with a man behind her with his arms around her, so I just assumed it was the woman. Well no it wasn't, it was the guy! Not that that's a problem at all but I have to say that as the picture was pretty blurred it was hard to make out much of his appearance! Anyway, after playing a couple of words he sent me a message asking where I was. I told him France and he told me he was in Texas. A couple of moves later and he sends me another message asking for my email address so \"we can get to know each other better!\" Say what!!! Why would I be wanting to get to know you better? So I told him that wouldn't be necessary and it was fine by me if he didn't want to play again. He's come back and played a couple of words with a few inane comments thrown in but it's pretty much dead now. But what a creep! When I mentioned it on this web site somebody said that she ended up receiving unsolicited \"dick picks\" that way (sorry to use that expression but that's the way she put it!) Crikey, I wonder if his real name is Anthony Weiner! Anyway, I guess you're never too old to learn are you!Other than that, what's new? Well I went to a rather fancy health club the other week to have a look around thinking that I need to get back to some regular form of exercise and was looking to avoid having that long drive into Geneva to use the gym at work. I looked at a couple of gyms here in town but they weren't up to much but this place was really luxurious. Like really nice! Trouble is, it was also pretty expensive and to make it worthwhile I knew I had to really commit to going two to three times a week. For once I did the right thing and decided to sleep on it - and in the end I decided not to go for it (yet). For the time being at least, I think I'll stick with walking at least once a week, yoga on Tuesdays and the work's gym on Wednesdays. After yoga yesterday I asked the young (replacement) teacher if she gave other classes in the area as I really enjoy her classes. She told me that as from next \"term\" (September) she will have a room available to her here in the local area so I think I might sign up to a couple of times a week with her from then on. It isn't particularly dynamic yoga (or at least it doesn't seem like it) but by gosh I feel wonderful when I come out of there! Then I might sign up for a Monday afternoon pilates class at the local community centre when they start up again in September as hopefully by then I'll have a better idea of how many \"commitments\" I want to sign up for (or rather, how much free time I really want). I have been checking out a few arm exercises online to try to get rid of the nascent bingo wings - I even bought myself a couple of 5 kg weights to use at home - but crikey, the first time I picked them up and tried to do this exercise a couple of times I almost fell over backwards!Then, shooting off on a totally unrelated tangent, I was at our little market in town on Thursday having a shufty. That's one of the true pleasures of being retired - I get to visit all the bigger markets that are held locally but on weekdays. I love it! Anyway, I managed to find a parking space and stopped off at the bank to get some cash out. When I rounded the corner to head over to the market I became aware of a \"body\" sitting on the floor by the bank. Turns out it was an Eastern European beggar (Roma gypsies usually). Now I have a hard time with beggars and never usually give to the Roma, but sometimes give to other beggars. This bothered me as a I was walking round the market but this woman looked so pathetic I put a couple of euros in my pocket and decided I would give it to her on the way back. Buuuuuttt, just as I drew level with her she whipped out a mobile phone and was talking to someone counting out the amount of change in her begging cup and giving them the run down!!! Now I know this is what they are like but I guess I needed hitting over the head with that 2 x 4 to finally realize \"no, you don't give these people money. It's a business to them!\" I tell ya, I'm a real slow learner sometimes!And finally, my friend told me that she had received free tickets to the local Fair currently being held in our little town and did I want to go today. If you are looking for a new camper, a new fireplace, a jacuzzi or even just good bottles of olive oil they have it all at this fair. Now today is VE day (Victory in Europe) so it's a public holiday in France, but even given the fact that it is a public holiday I have never seen so many cars trying to get into the parking lots. Never! What with the crowds and the fact that it was pissing down rain we decided to give up and head out to a couple of vide-greniers. The first was in a picturesque town called Taninges which was also pretty washed out, although we had a wander round and spotted a couple of walks that might be interesting to think about if and when we ever get our act together. Oh, and they had a pretty \"Roman-ish\" bridge I had never noticed before too!I did pick up a small, collapsible metal table which will be perfect for when I'm sitting out in my garden reading (that is, if it ever stops raining), all for the grand price of €5. After that we decided \"in for a penny, in for a pound\", so headed out to another vide-grenier in a place called Frangy. This was pretty much closing up for the day but my friend picked up a beautiful bougainvillea on the way out. So all in all, not a bad day out really but boy am I ever ready for spring to finally get here!"},
{"title": "And then it was off home!", "date": "Monday 6 May 2019", "text": "We had yet another early start on our last day as our driver was saying that it could be quite hit and miss with the traffic (in more ways than one) during the week. But, as luck would have it, the traffic conditions on our way home were really good and we made pretty good time. We left after yet another sumptuous breakfast and I made sure to tell the hotel manager how much we appreciated the wonderful food and asked him to thank the chef and kitchen staff in particular! We stopped at a service station after a couple of hours for coffee and snacks then headed back up the Aosta valley where we were to have lunch at a place called Pont St. Martin, not too far from the French border. Another four-course meal? Nah, this time it was five-courses, and again it was excellent! When you take into account the travel, the hotel, the excursions and all the meals (which included wine and coffee), I really think our trip was very fairly priced at just over €600!After lunch we had around 30 minutes for a little wander so we all trudged up to the famous \"pont\" - or Roman bridge which was built in … errrr Roman times!This picture just tickled me - \"don't do it Winnie, don't do it!\"Another thing I found kinda interesting was the vines in this area! The supports for the vines were actually constructed horizontally sticking out from the side of the hill - thus making it easier to pick the (future) grapes! Smart huh!About 30 minutes later we stopped at a large hypermarket for some last minute shopping. Just as the Swiss fairly routinely hop over to France to do their grocery shopping - it's quite a bit cheaper, especially wine, meat and cheese - many French also pop into Italy to buy certain goods, with Italian cheeses and hard liquor being considerably cheaper than in France. Now in this instance you have to take into account the cost of the toll for using the Mont Blanc tunnel but I guess if the savings are big enough it can be worth paying it and having a few people going by car!Which kinda brings up the thought that if/when Brexit ever happens some towns in northern France (particularly near the Channel tunnel) will be very seriously affected if the Brits can no longer take day trips to France and fill up their cars with French goods without having to pay duty on them upon returning to the UK. I know the association of Maires in northern France is very worried about this situation and have taken it up with President Macron. I don't know if it will do them any good but …!Anyway, my friend and I tootled round the supermarket and then got in line to pay in order to be back at the bus by 4.45 pm. Except, our lady cashier was a stereotypical Italian, chatting away to two men in front of us, kisses on both cheeks, talking with her hands, \"hey Luigi, how's mamma? And Isabella. Cara mia, she must be so big no!\" You get the gist of it. My friend was getting a bit pissed off but I found it quite charming (and in any case the bus wouldn't have left without us) - and we made it back on time anyway! But that kinda reminds me of my mom who seemed to think all foreigners were deaf so IF …. YOU ….. SPEAK ….. VERY ….. LOUDLY …. THEN …. THEY …. WILL …. UNDERSTAND! That's what this lady did to me when she was counting out my change VERY SLOWLY (this despite the fact that I live in France and yes, we use euros too)! Ah well, no harm done!So we made it through the Mont Blanc tunnel with only about a 10 minute delay but on the French side! Oh my! They were showing at least a 90 minute delay to get into the tunnel which would have been very frustrating for people who thought they'd just pop into Italy to spend a few days over Easter!The next day was the Thursday before Good Friday and this is what the motorway looked like …although to be fair I think that was more down to a gas leak than holiday traffic!So that's it for the time being. Well not really I suppose as we are off to Turin market in two weeks time, but that is only a day trip (our annual mosy round the market). Oh and we have picked out another five trips we would like to take with this company, but only one is an overnighter. That's to the Christmas market in Alsace in December (obviously) and that trip is already almost fully booked up!!!! So now it's back to the routine and back on the diet, trying to shift goodness how many kilos I managed to pile on on such a short trip! But it was well worth it!"},
{"title": "Italy - day 3!", "date": "Friday 3 May 2019", "text": "After our visit to Cinque Terre the schedule for the next day was the leaning tower of \"pizza\" and a trip to a marble quarry. I had mixed feelings about Pisa because for some reason I had this idea that it was a bit \"shabby\", although why I thought that I have no idea! So I got quite a shock when we pulled into the parking lot at Pisa and found out what a delightful place it is. Not shabby at all - it was beautiful!The entrance way to the \"walled part\" was full of market stalls and the ever-present Senegalese selling their \"real Luis Vuitton\" bags. I did \"cave\" and bought myself a nice leather backpack (not Luis Vuitton) for use as cabin luggage on future travels, although I have none planned as yet! It's rather nice, if I do say so myself! When we walked through the arched entrance to the old town it actually took my breath away as it was so stunning!Picture courtesy of GoogleOf course people were taking all the \"corny\" pictures of themselves \"holding\" the tower up but luckily we got there around 10 a.m. before the crowds started piling in. Good planning all round on the part of our tour operator! My friend and I decided not to go into the buildings but rather to take a wander round the town itself and, my, how pretty it was. There was a plaza called Piazza dei Cavalieri just a couple of hundred metres away from the main square which seemed to house the main school district of Pisa, and again it was stunning!Can you believe this is actually a school!After a couple of hours in Pisa it was back to the hotel for another four-course lunch (!) before we were due to head up to Carrara to visit the marble quarries! The mountains all along the coast oddly seemed to have \"snow\" on them but our driver explained to us that all that white \"snow\" was, in fact, white marble!  He took us up the mountain as far as he could but after that it was into jeeps for the hair-raising trip up to the main quarry! We had six jeeps (I think) and four people had to go into the back of each, open-sided jeep for the trip up. My friend and I were with two older ladies, one of whom was absolutely terrified! So terrified, in fact, that she kept her eyes shut for most of the journey. We were all bouncing around like bill-yo and her friend was roaring laughing. I suppose it would have been more frightening for us if we could have seen that there were no guard rails or anything over those ravines but sometimes we were just \"driving blind\". Once we got there a much older lady (I would put her at about 80) hopped out of the front jeep and doubled up laughing. Her laughter was so infectious she had us all in hysterics! Our guide knew his spiel inside out and made it a fun trip, but I would almost say that that jeep journey was the best part of our trip!After that it was again back to the hotel because we obviously hadn't eaten a four-course meal in a while (I'm being facetious!), a couple of drinks and off to bed for yet another early start the next day!"},
{"title": "Italy - day 2!", "date": "Wednesday 1 May 2019", "text": "We stayed in a hotel that was about 30 minutes out of La Spezia - which turned out to be a good choice as it happens, even if our little town hadn't really opened up for the season yet. It didn't matter anyway as we were always on the go and didn't really have any time to wander round! La Spezia was very pretty and it was from here that we were to catch the boat out to Cinque Terre - \"the five hamlets\", I guess, in English. Our driver dropped us off at the harbour where a guide was waiting for us and then the plan was that he would go park the coach and cycle back to meet us. Unfortunately he didn't make it because - as we found out later - he had been knocked off his bike by a young woman driving too fast!!! Thankfully he only suffered fairly minor bruising but did not want to take it any further! I'm just glad he was all right!La SpeziaThe bay leading out to Cinque Terre is referred to as the Golfo dei Poeti, or the Bay of Poets, but doesn't it sound so much more romantic in Italian!! and it was on the western side that we made our first stop at Portovenere - the Port of Venus. The boats we were on were kinda like taxi boats and people just hopped on and off all day visiting the different locations as they pleased. Our guide told us that we were very lucky to  have come before Easter (the start of the season) and to have good weather, because come May and June the weather would be hot and the place heaving!PortovenereHow many hats does one guy need!As each boat moored we were met by these guys (Senegalese mainly), hawking their wares and \"real\" Gucci handbags and \"real\" Rolex watches - all for the grand price of €10! I'm surprised they get away with hawking counterfeits and I wouldn't buy one anyway even though some of the stuff was pretty nice because I remember a few years ago people being stopped by mobile customs officers on the lake side in Evian just for buying this stuff and having it confiscated!We didn't stop at each of the five hamlets - Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore - as we didn't have enough time, so our first port of call after Portovenere was Corniglia.CornigliaCorniglia was very pretty but was already starting to get crowded so my friend and I decided to forego the guided tour and just have a wander round on our own!\"Nonna\" enjoying the view - courtesy of my friendAfter that it was on to Riomaggiore and finally on to Monterosso for another four-course lunch, a wander round and a souvenir hunt. The vendors were all nice and cheerful, unlike some places I have visited, so I bought myself a pretty water jug and a few knick-knacks (to add to my ever-growing collection).I just loved this focacceria - and that \"fly net\" is actually made out of pasta strung together! Neat huh!Then it was back to our hotel for yet another four-course dinner!!! Wonderful food (again) but you wouldn't want to go swimming afterwards. So after dinner and a few drinks with our table companions it was off to bed for another early start the next day!"},
{"title": "And then there was Italy!", "date": "Sunday 28 April 2019", "text": "Just before Easter I got back from a four-day trip to Cinque Terre in Italy, and while I'm completely knackered it was so worth it! I know it sounds like I never stop travelling - and truth be told I feel like my feet haven't touched the ground since I retired - but it wasn't actually planned that way! Of course no-one could predict having to fly back and forth to Wales due to my brother's illness and subsequent death. Then the trip to Sri Lanka in March had been planned before I even knew I was retiring, so it was to be my annual \"winter sunshine break\" before going back to work! Well as we all know it didn't quite work out like that! After that, my friend spotted that our local bus company was doing a trip to Cinque Terre in Italy in April (it has long been on my bucket list) and \"should we go for it\"? They hadn't done this trip last year as they tend to alternate years but the girl that we booked with said it's a trip that could reasonably sell out every year so we jumped on it and reserved in January. Good job we did too as there were only eight places remaining (I think) and no single rooms left. That meant my friend having to put up with my snoring in a twin room (I did forewarn her) but guess what? She snores too so it didn't work out too badly in the end!Anyway, we dropped off my car at the travel agent's and picked up the bus at 6 a.m. It's only around 500 km to Cinque Terre but bear in mind that you have to go through the Mont Blanc tunnel (11 km/7 miles under the Mont Blanc) before you get into Italy and then down through the winding roads of the Aosta valley before you hit any kind of straight roads. So you're obviously not going to be breaking any world speed records here! In fact, our driver told us that the Italians had recently introduced \"tronçon\" radars. A \"tronçon\" is a \"leg\" as in the \"leg\" of a journey, so they know that if you went through one radar at place X in the Aosta valley you should not pass the radar at place Y in less than XX number of hours - if you do you have been speeding and they will catch you. Our driver said it works too! So now you know - if you are driving in Italy watch out for the maximum speed limits!I always find it sad and kinda weird going through this tunnel though as our (very knowledgeable) bus driver was talking about the 1999 fire as we went through (has it really been 20 years?) and the changes that had been made to tunnel security since. The fire was caused by a refrigerated truck carrying margarine and flour catching fire, killing 39 people in the process, including a brave young Italian named Pierluccio Tinazzi who managed to ferry nine victims out on his scooter before being overcome himself and dying as he tried to save a tenth victim!Pierluccio TinazziAnyway, after travelling for a couple more hours, we stopped just after 9 o'clock for a break where the driver broke out the bread, ham, cheese, coffee and red wine that was provided by the company! Not that he drank any wine of course - I think only one man had a glass. Then again, I suppose the sun is always over the yardarm somewhere in the world isn't it!Around mid-day we arrived in Genoa where we were treated to our first, four course Italian meal!!! Four courses!!! Crikey - and that is just routine in Italy - but it was so good!  And Genoa, of course, is where the bridge tragically collapsed in August 2018 killing over 40 people! Again, crikey! Can you see a pattern here? But when you see the landscape round there and realize it is subject to earthquakes and therefore how the landscape is virtually just mountains and valleys, you can imagine how difficult transiting Genoa had become because of that collapse!Our driver was telling us that on one trip they were actually hit with a fairly substantial earth tremor but I was kinda hoping we could give that a miss! I've had enough \"excitement\" to do me! And, although we didn't get to see much of Genoa I have to admit it was a very beautiful city!In another couple of hours we made it to our hotel where my friend and I had a decent enough twin room - and another wonderful four-course evening meal before going to bed for an early morning start the next day to visit Cinque Terre! Blimey, we hadn't even spent one night in Italy yet and we already felt like Tweedledum and Tweedledee!Tim Burton's Tweedledum and Tweedledee"},
{"title": "Some (small) consolation!", "date": "Friday 26 April 2019", "text": "I got an email yesterday from the lovely Canadian lady I met in Sri Lanka. L was asking if I had any news of our guide, Prasana, or our driver and his assistant. Sometimes when you go on these trips the guides give you their mobile phone number in case something happens but not this time. As we were heading back to the airport Prasana pointed out where the three of them lived  - the driver, his assistant and Prasana himself - (in the suburbs of Colombo) so I can only hope and pray that they and their families are safe.This morning I was reading more details of the atrocities - it's so heartbreaking when the names, faces and stories start coming out - when in today's news they showed a picture of the one, \"failed\" suicide bomber whose bomb failed to detonate. He was pictured in the lift in the Hotel Taj!!!! And to think I had sent up a silent prayer of thanks when I realized that the hotel I stayed in on my first night had not been hit! It had been targeted but the bomb hadn't gone off! Like I mentioned before, if I am going to be alone before the start of a trip I always stay in a good hotel in order to feel secure, and to think this delusional, spoiled, brainwashed jerk had actually tried to hit the Hotel Taj!!! And it turns out this was the guy who had actually studied in the UK!The staff at the hotel were unfailingly polite and helpful so I can only offer very small thanks to the powers that be that they were spared! Of course, that then meant that another poor couple ended up being killed by this jerk when he blew himself up at a small guesthouse nearby! Fate works in mysterious ways doesn't it - I'm just so sorry for that couple who happened to be \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\"!Hotel TajAfter the end of our trip there was the possibility of extending the trip by taking a week to go snorkelling in the Maldives. Now I booked this trip when I was fully expecting to still be working and since I didn't have the leave (and most likely wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway), I chose to fly home straight after Sri Lanka. L and T, the Canadian couple, booked the add on, as did \"Miserable Pete\" and L was telling me he was a complete pain in the butt, as he had been on our leg of the trip. Unfortunately, people assumed he was with them (that's what I thought when I first met them too) and he was just as ungracious (and racist) as he had been with us!She said he wasn't able to climb down the rope ladder from their boat into the dingy so he couldn't go snorkelling (hallo, you booked yourself on a snorkelling holiday in the Maldives!), then he burnt the tops of his feet and was totally ignorant in his behaviour towards the staff who tried every which way to make his stay better! In fact, he was the guy that was not ready for the bus on the first day (they had to wake him up), who, while we were all piling onto the bus to go into Ngombo, sat down to have his breakfast!!, and who we then had to double back and pick up on our way out of Ngombo. He didn't like rice (again, halloooo, you're in Sri Lanka!), he obviously didn't like people with dark skin (that's what made his living in South Africa such a puzzle to me), and then to top it all he realized he had left both his electric shaver and his iPad somewhere but didn't know where. Prasana tracked it down to our first hotel in Ngombo and on the way back was able to arrange a taxi to meet us in a layby on the way to the airport so he could get his stuff back!! Then he didn't feel he should have to pay the taxi driver (!!!!) because \"he had only forgotten these things because they had hurried him up on the first day\"! I tell you, there is always one on these trips but you would think that if you can't manage the physical side of it (or don't like \"foreigners\") wouldn't you think twice about booking with a company called Explore?????? I don't know, contrasting the experience I had with the lovely people of Sri Lanka and this guy's behaviour makes me want to scream!Anyway, now that I've got \"Miserable Pete\" out of my mind, I'll have to start writing up my \"diary\" of our recent short trip to Cinque Terre - although I'm not sure even beautiful Italy would manage to please someone as thoroughly miserable as \"Miserable Pete\"!"},
{"title": "So desperately sad for Sri Lanka!", "date": "Sunday 21 April 2019", "text": "I can't believe it! Although to be honest, I suppose we should all \"believe\" it shouldn't we! Those bastards are just getting sicker and sicker - whether it be killing muslims in New Zealand or killing Christians in Sri Lanka!The latest atrocities this Easter Sunday mornng in Sri Lanka just break my heart for the very gentle people we met. I stayed my first night in Colombo in a pretty luxurious hotel but thankfully it wasn't one of those hit in the bombings. Our first night on tour we did spend in a rather ramshackle hotel in Ngombo though. It was a pretty poor fishing village about 15 minutes out of Colombo. Oh there were a few nice hotels and some lovely small restaurants where you could eat really well, but basically it was just a poor village trying to make its money from fishing and tourism. I suppose the tourists will stay away now though won't they. And that was where St. Sebastian Church was. I remember it - slightly set back from what was, pretty much, the one and only road through town. So very, very sad!St. Sebastian Church, Ngombo"},
{"title": "And finally!", "date": "Thursday 18 April 2019", "text": "Crikey, if I don't finish writing up my \"diary\" of my trip to Sri Lanka soon I'll forget what we did - and that is the point of this online diary business - well for me at least. It's to write down my memories so I can revisit them later should I wish! Trouble is, I've been away again and only got back last night. Now don't be thinking all this travelling was planned - mostly it wasn't - but \"circumstances\" happened and I feel like my feet haven't touched the ground since I retired, even if it was mostly of a pleasant nature! Oh well, hopefully it'll start calming down a bit from now on!Anyway, our last evening in Sri Lanka was spent in Unawatuna where the beach was just lovely (although sadly we only got to spend one night there)! In fact one of my comments back to the travel agent was that it would have been nice to spend maybe another couple of nights there just to relax a little after what turned out to be a very fast-paced trip! I hope they take that into consideration when they are planning the next trip - I think people might appreciate it!This was the day those of us that wanted to got to get up before the imps and pixies to go out whale \"hunting\". I have never seen whales in the wild before so I dutifully got up, got dressed in the dark and was on my way to our rendez-vous point by about 5 a.m. The trip organizers had thoughtfully put out sea sickness pills for anyone that wanted them \"just in case\" and since I didn't know how I would feel after about five hours on a boat out at sea I thought I would take one! It honestly didn't take too long before we came across a pod of dolphins (they were playing with the boat almost immediately), and then a group of pilot whales, which are much smaller than the blue whales we were after but just as fun!!!! But guess what, we lucked out! Now I don't know if we saw four blue whales or, more likely, the same two several times but boy were they impressive! My pictures weren't very good unfortunately and I felt that I was spending too much time trying to get pictures and not enough just breathing in the thrill of being so close to the world's biggest mammal - so I put my camera down and just enjoyed the moment!When we got back to \"base camp\" we had a couple of hours to clean up before we headed off to our final destination of Galle - a pretty coastal town built by the Portuguese and then Dutch from the 16th and 17th centuries. Unfortunately this was the one time on our trip that it actually peed down rain so the tuk tuk ride to Galle was a white-knuckle event. The traffic and heat was horrendous, the rain torrential and what's more it was International Women's Day so there was a march also taking place made up of young girls all wearing t-shirts saying \"I am the voice, not the echo\"! Very appropriate!In the end the rain stopped and we got to visit Galle and do some shopping before going out to a final, very good evening meal.GalleThe next morning it was again up early and off to the airport. Our guide did ask if we wanted to stop and get pictures of the famous Sri Lankan pole fisherman, but when he explained that the legitimate fishermen were out there before dawn and that \"our fishermen\" were just locals trying to make a buck out of the tourists with the photos we gave it a miss!So then we headed straight to the airport for my eleven hour flight back to Zurich. As I flew over the various landscapes I took the same picture out of the plane to show the different \"seasons\" we were flying through!Leaving Sri LankaOver southern India I thinkSomewhere over Turkey I thinkWhen I landed in Zurich and turned my phone back on I got a \"welcome to Turkey\" message - I just hope they didn't charge me for data roaming! Anyway, I spent a very comfortable night at the Radisson Blu Hotel at Zurich airport before catching the train the next morning for my three-hour journey back to Geneva. We hit a snow storm somewhere around Berne - boy was I suddenly feeling cold!When I got home we got a pretty heavy snow dump over night, which was somewhat unexpected, but happily the sun came out later in the day leaving the world looking a prettier place altogether!Tuesday morningWednesday morning - now that's much better!"},
{"title": "Unawatuna!", "date": "Tuesday 9 April 2019", "text": "Our first stop on leaving Kandy the next day was to visit the Botanical Gardens in Peredeniya. I remember when we were in Mauritius many years ago we visited the botanical gardens but made sure to hire a guide and it was so worth it. There were so many things we would simply have missed without her knowledge and the smell of the tree bark she handed to us to sniff has always remained with me - it was what they made Old Spice aftershave out of!Anyway these gardens were very different from Mauritius - less \"intense\" to a degree because they were more spread out, but still very, very beautiful. But crikey it was hot! And we saw a whole gaggle of little school kids dashing about playing tag while we were all hopping from one shady spot to another! Still, it wouldn't do if we were all the same would it! But the gardens were truly amazing and it was here, apparently, that Earl Mountbatten often stayed during his time as \"Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, Southeast Asia\" during WWII!These little devils were never very far away!   A google image - I couldn't \"capture\" it!That's not a very good picture but those are actually bats in that tree - known as flying foxes!Prasana, our guide - he was excellent!After leaving the gardens we stopped off at the Luckgrove Spice Gardens - which, again, were really interesting to me. Our guide was very knowledgeable but \"weird\" in an \"Elvis has left the building\" kinda way. I don't really know how to explain it but by the time we had gone through the tour he had asked me very insistently for my telephone number!!!! He found out that I lived in France and since he \"loved France\" I guess I was fair pickins'!  Not that it worked of course but he was sure gonna try! Their spice production was very much centred around ayurvedic medicine - indeed that was their biggest export - and towards the end we all got a short massage (designed to make us buy stuff I guess) that was really great. They used a kind of \"hot\" oil for the massage and my neck and legs really did have a lovely warm glow after the massage (or it could just have been the handsome young man that was massaging me!). I bought a few items but I was happy to do so anyway because that is an area that really interests me!Before heading to our final destination of Unawatuna, we stopped off at a small tea plantation. Now frankly this didn't interest me so much because \"tea\" - you know - but the tea they served us at the end of our visit was actually quite delicious and very refreshing (and not a jug of milk in sight)! They showed us how to drink it with \"jaggery\" - basically raw sugar - but they don't drop it in the tea they dip it and then take a bite. Either way it was delicious!Jaggery!But the thing that really caught my attention was when we left the tea plantation we passed a flatbed truck going in the other direction … on top of which was an elephant being transported further inland! Our guide explained that elephants are working animals in any case, but to see an elephant being transported as we would see a cattle truck was really weird. I guess it's the little things that stay in your mind isn't it!"},
{"title": "Kandy!", "date": "Monday 8 April 2019", "text": "Crikey, I don't half get side-tracked don't I!!!!! Anyway, back to Sri Lanka again! Next day we headed up to Kandy, which is situated in the centre of the country. Actually, and going off on a totally different tangent (yet again), I read \"The Tea Planter's Wife\" by Dinah Jefferies sometime ago, which is set in Ceylon (as it was then) and loved it. I've read a few of her books and love the way she manages to give you the feel of the place in her writing. I remember her describing travelling down to Kandy for supplies and so on and now, having seen the place for myself, I can see how evocative her writing is!Our hotel for this night was the fairly majestic Queens Hotel. Well I say \"fairly majestic\" as it had obviously been pretty classy and, I suppose, fashionable, many years ago, but I have to admit it was a little \"tired\". Oh the main reception and dining room and so on were pretty nice, all beautiful wooden floors, but the rooms and the bathrooms definitely needed money spent on them and updating!Queens Hotel, KandyActually, my room had a kind of small corridor leading off it with a door to an adjoining room (I'm guessing) and then on to my bathroom, but I did find it somewhat \"spooky\" so whenever I feel like that I always wedge either a chair or my suitcase up against the adjoining door \"just in case\"! On our trip there was a group of three friends who travelled together once a year, having met up in India on a previous trip. They were about my age, I would guess, or maybe just a couple of years younger. Anyway, while they were friendly enough they pretty much kept to themselves and did their own thing, so I got quite a shock the next morning when one of the woman said she had had a man banging on her door during the night. Now these three could put the booze away and there was also much drinking and revelry coming from a wedding party at the same hotel, but she said it frightened the life out of her! I don't know if she called reception but I certainly would have and asked them to send someone up to make him go away! Then the next morning we were told to put our suitcases outside our rooms by 7.30 a.m. so that the porters could load them on to the bus. I was at the end of a long corridor in the penultimate room and there was a Buddhist monk just \"prowling\" around as I was putting my suitcase out. All the different nationalities were pretty much kept on separate floors and I'm 100% certain he wasn't staying in that corridor so I made an excuse to go back to my room \"to check on something\" and he was just coming out of the last room in my corridor where the door was unlocked! You know, the one with the adjoining door to my room! He wasn't staying in that room and he definitely gave me the creeps, what with the hotel having a bit of a feel like the hotel in \"The Shining\". Can't say I was unhappy to leave there!A group of us decided to go out for dinner that evening and again the food was very good, after which we went to a display of Sri Lankan dancing (and drumming - which was pretty impressive). Both the men and the women wore beautiful costumes and as long as it doesn't go on forever I actually enjoy it very much!Anyway, the whole point of that stopover was to visit the Temple of the Tooth (which, it is said, contains a shrine housing one of Buddha's teeth), and the temple was indeed really spectacular! Whenever you visit these temples you are expected to cover your arms and your legs (at least as far down as your knees - both men and women) AND your head must be uncovered and shoes are not allowed (although you could walk around in socks). Now at some of the other temples I saw people in shorts, which I thought was disrespectful, but nobody said anything to them. At this temple, however, there was no way anyone would have gotten in if they didn't meet the strict dress code. The men went in through one door and the women through another, and although I had on long trousers and a shawl to cover my arms, there was a lady security guard there who tugged my shawl high up to my neck and knotted it (the shawl not my neck)! Our guide, Prasana, told us that one time he had a Turkish lady on one of his trips and she insisted that she was going to keep her veil on - but there was no way she would get past the security at the temple like that! Oh she kicked up a big fuss but there was no doing. My thoughts are \"if you are adamant that you are not removing your veil, why go visit a temple in the first place\"? Doesn't make sense to me!The temple, of course, was stunningly beautiful but very crowded and I was as hot as hell with my torniquet of a shawl! But it was definitely worth a visit, although I felt my pictures couldn't do it justice so had to use some google pictures to try to show how beautiful it was!The lake at Kandy The Temple of the ToothAs I say, I don't feel that even the google pictures do it justice - but it really was just stunning and so worth the visit!"},

Damn!Actually that wasn't the half of it as it snowed most of the morning, so I would guess we got about eight inches in all, judging by the state of my car. The garage just laughed when I called them to cancel the appointment - obviously they were up to their eyeballs in snow too. Still, it didn't last too much longer as the electric came back on (and hence the heating), the sun came out and the roads are (finally) looking pretty decent again after the snow plough came round. Hopefully most of it will be gone by morning, although I understand getting to work was, once again, a laugh a minute for most people!"},
{"title": "I think I'm in love ... well not really, but \"yay\" me anyway!", "date": "Tuesday 2 April 2019", "text": "I had an appointment last week with my bank to organize the final pay-off of my mortgage at the end of this month. I had calculated I owed about 90,000 Swiss francs (that's just over $90,000) but \"allowed\" 95,000 in my calculations just in case. Well I was bang on and I'm so glad 'cos if I had messed up somehow and \"forgotten\" or \"missed\" an additional, massive amount I would have been totally screwed now that I've retired! Anyway, I'm all signed up and \"it's all mine!!!!!!\" as of 26 April. So that's a relief! As I was talking to her, though, I happened to mention the situation of my brother and how we had managed to sign him up for a funeral package just before he died so that everything was taken care of for his sons … and that's when she pulled out the relevant paperwork for me! Well actually it wasn't telepathy as she reminded me she had actually called me for something when I happened to be in Wales for the funeral so had put together the basic \"package\" and intended to bring it up at my appointment. Wise minds think alike I guess. Not that thinking about your own funeral is a barrel of laughs but I realized that I wanted to avoid my sons having all that to deal with \"if and when\". It doesn't cover a burial plot but I want to be cremated anyway, so she said I would have to sign up for spot in a \"cremation pillar\" if that's what I wanted!! Nah, I told her I wanted to be cremated in banana leaves (not possible apparently - although I think a raffia coffin is) and then my ashes scattered on the mountains behind my house. Apparently that's illegal but then there's not much they can do about a carrier bag with a hole in it is there! And since the mortgage insurance will now drop off my monthly payments the amount saved will now pay for my funeral package. Great fun! I just have to mention it to my boys now, but at least that's checked off my \"to do\" list! That should be an interesting conversation next time they come for dinner!After everything was signed I asked her if she could tell me how much interest I had saved by paying off my 17 year mortgage in seven years and she said she couldn't do it just like that. So when I got home I took my original loan amortization paperwork and worked out that I saved roughly €32,000!!! I know it's complicated switching from euros and Swiss francs but that's the way it is over here. Wow, €32,000 (that's almost $36,000)! I tell ya, it was so worth it knuckling down and throwing as much as possible at that mortgage. Well, in all honesty, if I hadn't done that I wouldn't be retired now (or any time soon I suspect). So yay me!On the not so \"yay me\" side, I just received my mobile phone bill covering the period I was in Sri Lanka! Bloody hell. €120!!!! It's usually about €30, and since I crossed the border every day for work I knew to keep mobile roaming turned off, but 5-6 times when I was in Sri Lanka I switched it on briefly to check my messages! Well lesson learned I guess!!! And another horror story … I was in the newsagent's on Saturday buying stamps and I told the man next to me to go ahead as I was rummaging about in my purse. So he asked for one of those little \"roller thingies\" to roll his own cigarettes \"because they were cheaper that way\". Out of curiosity I asked the lady how much a carton of 200 was and she said €86!!!!! Bloody hell, I used to buy my ex's cigarettes every week in a vain bid to stop him going into town to buy them (after which he always ended up legless in the bar opposite the newsagents - yeah, that really worked well!), but crikey! €86!!! And to be honest my ex would get through two cartons a week because he would light them up and leave them burn in the ash tray after only taking a couple of drags!!! I'm so glad I'm not paying for them any more. He did tell me around this time last year that he had quit smoking three months earlier. Good for him as I'm sure it can't be easy. But I did point out how glad I was not to be living with him at that time - or any time since actually!!! I don't know if he has remained \"quit\" as I don't have any contact with him by choice, but since my next door neighbour was taken seriously ill in January (hospitalized with pneumonia) and she has had to quit I can see how hard it is on her. But she no longer has that rasping cough and sounds so much better! I'm so glad I never started though!On a totally different subject (Brexit - yay Brexit) I had dinner with my old friend last Wednesday and it was good to have a catch up after so long. She is British and lives in France like me. She has her paperwork pretty squared away to get her resident's permit for France to be followed by her request for naturalization. I'm gonna wait until this whole debacle is sorted (if it ever is), so she's ahead of the game at least. It was important to her anyway because she gets a small UK pension which her daughter is using while she is studying in the UK and there is some talk that UK pensions of British expats might no longer be index-linked! Great fun, screwed over again, after not having a vote to begin with. Anyway, she was telling me that her son has just been offered a job in Switzerland. For which he needs what they call a \"frontalier permit\". For which he needs proof that he is legally resident in France. For which he now needs to apply for a resident's permit. And for which the local French administrative offices are no longer giving appointments for us to hand in our paperwork! Like I saw on a sign in Wales - \"bollocks to Brexit\"! I'll drink to that!And finally, I had my appointment with another tax guy today after getting the shock of my life when the last \"expert\" told me that I would have to pay €29,000 tax on my €132,000 lump sum when I was expecting to pay just over €9,000! I went back and forward with him until a colleague in a similar situation took it up with the local tax authorities, who basically told her my \"expert\" didn't know his a$$ from a hole in the ground. So I got an appointment with this other guy today. When I showed him what expert no. 1 had given me he burst out laughing and said you had to be careful as there were a lot of \"charlatans\" out there (I know, that probably sounds better in French than English!). But he confirmed what the tax people had told my colleague and now I will be paying the €9,000 figure and not his €29,000 figure! Wow! Just wow! I'm so relieved. As I told my new \"I'm in love with you\" tax guy, I just want everything to be in order as I can't afford for the tax people to come back in a couple of years time saying I owe them €20,000 (plus a fine probably). So a good day all round. And \"yay me\" like I said!"},
{"title": "Then on Thursday ...", "date": "Saturday 30 March 2019", "text": "… we set off again en route to visit Sigiriya Rock, also known as Lion Rock because of the two enormous lion paws carved into the rock. It was here that you could see the ruins of the fifth century \"Sky Fortress\", which was built in just seven years years as a fortified palace for King Kassapa - who became king by assassinating his father and deposing his brother. I guess there's a \"black sheep\" in every family then isn't there! Said brother managed to take back his \"kingdom\" 18 years later though - so it all got a bit complicated for me to follow! But it was a beautiful site, although a hard climb in horrendously hot weather meant we had to start off pretty early to beat the crowds and the heat!Sigiriya RockAfter lunch we headed out to a game park to go elephant spotting. It wasn't difficult, actually, because there turned out to be quite a few elephants for us to \"spot\". The Canadian lady traveller made a valid point though in that she felt that there were just too many jeeps allowed into the park at the same time. We counted 25-30 jeeps in one spot and while none of the jeeps deliberately got close to the elephants, as the elephants wandered on their way sometimes we felt that we really were just too close to them. I can't say we felt in any danger - more that we were crowding them out. Still, I was very glad to have seen them - they are so impressive, even if they are not as big as African elephants!After that we headed on to our next hotel - which again turned out to be a pretty nice place. It was quite late by the time we got there so it really was a case of get washed up, eat and go to bed because we were on the road again to Kandy the next day!"},
{"title": "Got a little side-tracked there!", "date": "Thursday 28 March 2019", "text": "Heck if I don't write about the rest of my Sri Lanka trip soon I will have forgotten most of it, and I don't want to do that as this here blog is my online \"diary\". So here we go. After leaving Ngombo we headed up to Nuwarawewa where the hotel was sooooo much better than the first night. In fact, I had three double beds in my room but Miserable Pete managed to do one better and have five in his room! I told him the party was at his place that night - and everyone laughed except for Miserable Pete - aka - \"He Who Should Never Bother Travelling\"!Our hotel - The Lakeside Nuwarawewa!A strange thing happened when we went down to dinner that evening though as while we were sitting there chatting a group of about 20 older Indian women in saris came over and sat down next to us and just started taking pictures of us at our table. No chatting, no \"do you mind\" - they just sat there, took their pictures and then got up and left. I tell you it was like being prize exhibits in the zoo - but everyone seemed to want to get their pictures taken with us. The little kids did this too - not that they wanted money or anything. They would just come over and mime \"can we have our picture taken with you\" and off they ran giggling. But they, at least, were sweet. Katie, one of our group who was employed by the tour operator to take pictures, had come along with her boyfriend, Luke. Luke was a rather handsome, well built and extremely sociable young man. Problem was, that evening Katie decided to have an early night and all of a sudden Luke was \"swarmed\" by a group of older (maybe 60-something) Indian women all wanting to have their picture taken with him! But he took it in good sport and was laughing about it. (The next morning when we got on the bus I told him that 20 Indian grandmas had been looking for him to say goodbye and he burst out laughing)!What was interesting too was that our guide told us to watch the two other foreign groups at the buffet, saying that it was lucky we got there early but \"just watch this\". He said \"group 1\" would take their food and then stand at the buffet rather than sit down so that they could just keep \"shovelling it in\". And \"group 2\" would pile their plates so high that the food would be falling off their plates before they could get back to their tables! And he was right! Now I would have said, given his description, that he would have been talking about European groups because sometimes I am just so ashamed at how they behave at the buffet. But not a bit of it. These were two, different nationality, Asian tour groups and he was bang on! I suppose we all have our \"foibles\" but it was interesting to hear him describe the behaviours in groups of people who I would never have expected to behave like that. I noticed afterwards that the hotel staff would ask us if we wanted a meat dish and if we said yes they would put it on our table rather than put it out at the buffet, because if you didn't get there before these two groups you wouldn't get any! And sadly that held true throughout the trip! Oh well!But moving seamlessly on, after breakfast we headed out to Mihintale which is where, it is believed, the monk Mahinda met King Devanampiyatissa, thus introducing Bhuddism to Sri Lanka. This involved climbing 1,840 steps! Yes, you read that right! 1,840!!!! which actually wouldn't have been so bad because there were flat areas in between. The killer, however, was the heat, and I was puce in the face by the time I arrived (barefoot) at the top! To add to my embarrassment, though, there was a group of (Cambodian, I think) tourists also visiting the shrine and I would guess their average age was 70! All dressed up in traditional dress, barefoot, and slogging up but not even breaking a sweat! Hats off to them, is all I can say!Call me a pleb but I couldn't resist this picture of one monkey checking the other's butt for bugs!After that it was on to Lake Hiriwaduna. We took a bullock cart for the short ride to the lake and then on to canoes over to the village where we were served local food in a hut with elephant wires around it! Fascinating. We ate with our hands so it was a bit strange to us but everyone got stuck in, except He Who Should Never Travel, aka Miserable Pete!That's not my picture - I couldn't get a decent one because I was trying to stop \"Miserable Pete\"from falling in! Sorry, I couldn't find where to attribute it!Invasive Japanese \"???\" on Lake Hiriwadunna!An interesting point our guide made was that the Sri Lankans had deliberately introduced this plant to the lake in order to prevent the Japanese from crossing the lake in the event of an invasion during WWII! They called it \"Japanese ….\" - and I can't for the life of me remember what he called it - but it was introduced because it was so invasive that it would (hopefully) prevent the Japanese from crossing the lake. I don't think it was put to the test but we had problems getting ashore trying to navigate these plants!After that it was on to the World Heritage Site of the Dambulla Caves. I didn't try to get photos inside the caves because they just wouldn't have come out but they were impressive! Sorry, I don't always seem able to attribute these photos - I found them on google!Our guide told us that they think that when the sleeping buddha has his feet one on top of the other it was because he was dead, but if his feet were slightly misaligned it would be because he was sleeping!  Like I say, fascinating stuff!Another useless bit of information was that it was so hot and we had to take our shoes off before entering the site (and cover our arms and knees of course). Well I had left my socks in the bus like most of the others and so I was trekking barefoot to these caves and it almost burned the soles of your feet off! Okay, they had placed small amounts of fabric on the floor where possible so that people could try to hop from one bit to the next but where oh where was Dudley Moore's \"manservant\" in \"10\" when you needed him to carry you over hot sands!"},
{"title": "Knackered!", "date": "Sunday 24 March 2019", "text": "I was planning to host our board game evening in (January or February - can't remember now) when I had to cancel because of having to dash home for my brother. They went ahead without me but I signed back up to host yesterday now that things have calmed down somewhat. Anyway, yesterday I was heading out to our little local market to pick up a few fresh fruit and veg for the game night when I decided to stop in at our local Mairie to ask for an \"attestation de résidence\" - an attestation to prove how long I have been living in France. One way or another I guess I will need this to prove that I have been registered as living in our little village for more than five years - since 1990 in fact - whether it be for my resident's permit and/or naturalisation request.I asked the young woman to to put \"Ms T., formerly Mrs B\" on the attestation as I was married in 1990 when I got my first resident's permit so I needed it to be clear that Ms T and Mrs B were the same person. Luckily for me I knew the exact date of my arrival in France (17 April 1990) as it was more a \"paper and post-it\" set up then and she had no way of knowing when I arrived! I wonder how many others will be scuppered at that point! But she had the same problem as me when I go onto the French website regarding resident's permits because (a) I don't have a blue EU resident's permit (because I don't need one), (b) I'm not considered a first-time permit-holder (since I had one in 1990 - shortly thereafter I no longer needed one), and (c) I couldn't really apply as a \"non-European\" because I bloody well am a European - just shortly to be non-EU citizen. What a bloody mess! Anyway she said she will have my attestation ready for me when I stop in on Tuesday, but then she started reading off the list of requirements for a bog standard resident's permit:- proof of adequate income - check- proof of health insurance - check- proof of having a place to live - check- \"proof of full integration into French society\" - well at this point I happened to let slip that I was Présidente of the local sewing club - and she burst out laughing! But I think we can call that a \"check\".- proof of French language skills - no problem there- had I ever committed a crime - I had to come clean about my two speeding tickets in 30 years but again she burst out laughing!I did admit that I did not know the words to the Marseillaise but she told me that like most French she didn't know the second verse either (I mean, who actually knows the second verse of God Save the Queen?)! So I guess we can call that a \"check\"!Anyway at this point the lady who did my original paperwork when I first moved here walked out of the back office. She knew my ex and my kids and did the paperwork when I came in to register my second son in 1992. She was stunned to find out that my \"baby\" had gotten married last week! But aren't we all the same! I mean, you see your own kids getting older but don't realize that other people's kids are too! She and I always got along and she told me that there would be no problem getting any paperwork I needed once we all knew what we were dealing with with this Brexit debacle! Oh but she did comment that joking about looking for a French man for a marriage of convenience might not be the best thing to do in the local Mairie! Thankfully they all burst out laughing as I guess they get my sense of humour, but I told her one husband was more than enough thank you very much so there were no worries on that score!Anyway, back to the plot. We had our latest board game evening at my place yesterday. There were only nine of us this time but it was still great, and I think we might be getting into the hang of not cooking too much food for one evening! We seem to be getting it down to a fine art! On a side note, today is my next door neighbour's birthday and she was spilling her heart out to me a bit yesterday, so I had everybody sign a card I had for her (and took her peppermint brownies round today as a birthday present). She was almost crying when she opened the card as she told me that her husband hadn't even acknowledged her for the last seven years! Go figure! She just breaks my heart! Anyway, back to our evening. The first game we played was \"Time's Up\", which I can't say I particularly enjoyed as it was \"way too French\" for me for the most part. What I mean is, it was a French game so obviously most of the questions were French orientated. For example, do any of you know how you would get someone to say \"Natoo\" - or even who \"Natoo\" is! No, I didn't think so. Or which famous French actor played in \"Un gendarme à St. Tropez\"? Still, it wasn't too bad as being the hostess I was bobbing up and down and clearing plates and making sure everyone had enough to eat and drink. But, afterwards we started another game (around 11.30 pm I think) but I can't for the life of me think of the name. This was much more \"egalitarian\" in that it wasn't French orientated. Trouble was, it was the kind of game you couldn't just abandon when the witching hour arrived! We had to play it out to the end! Which turned out to be around 1.30 - 2 a.m.! Which in turn meant I got to bed around 3 a.m. after clearing up! I did mention though that it would be kinda nice to play a few card games next time - Bellote, Tarot for instance and the others agreed. Oh and the subject of the farmer asking me out came up (I wonder how they found out) so I was the butt of quite a few jokes and guffaws of laughter! You see, he is well known for being somewhat of an ass but I felt obliged to defend him for having been an absolute gent and good company when I was with him. Ha, they won't laugh so loud and so long when I am the mistress of all I survey if I take him up on his offer of a date (extremely unlikely but they don't know that)! Anyway, just a few pictures and I hope to post more about Sri Lanka tomorrow!Playing Big Mouth!"},
{"title": "I am so spoilt!", "date": "Friday 22 March 2019", "text": "Things are beginning to calm down a bit now and hopefully I'll start getting into some kind of retirement routine. I had all kinds of plans for what I would do each week as I had a vague feeling I might be \"bored\" without the discipline of going to work - but not a bit of it! In fact, I have had to rein in my ideas a little because I now realize I don't want to have every day \"scheduled\". So far I have my sewing club on a Monday night, Tuesday afternoon yoga and on Wednesday I go in to work to use the gym, meet up afterwards with friends for a drink quite often, and do any \"Geneva\" shopping I need to do. I was going to join a Thursday hiking group too but as time has gone on I realize that I want to keep a few days clear to do my own thing so, for the time being at least, I think I'll leave it at that!I also decided that I was going to get in touch with all the people I had always been meaning to keep in touch with but didn't get round to it very often because work got in the way. So I have been contacting a few old friends and arranging to meet up, if possible. Oh that and catching up on all my doctor's check-ups and other necessary evils. I suppose getting the paperwork together for my French residency/naturalization request will be the next thing. Anyway, I have an appointment at the bank on Tuesday to arrange the final pay-off of my mortgage and am meeting up with a very old friend on Wednesday night for dinner. When I say \"very old friend\", I mean we actually met on the first day we arrived in Geneva in May 1980. Our employer had flown us both out from England and put us up in the same hotel for the first week, so when I realized she would be working at the same place as me we got chatting and the rest, as they say, is history! She didn't stay with my employer too long as she moved on to the World Health Organization but we have stayed in touch sporadically over the years.Then last week I got in touch with a colleague who retired one month before me. She lives about 500 metres from where my ex husband used to live in fact so she isn't too far from me. Anyway, we agreed to meet up for tea and a chinwag in her local town, and very pleasant it was too.Viuz-en-SallazLike me she is loving retirement, has loads of interests and agrees that there never seem to be enough hours in the day! I know everyone says that in retirement but it certainly seems true for us. Before I met up with her I managed to fit in an hour's walk through La Bénite and fill up my bottles with spring water. On the way back my neighbour (the farmer's sister) invited me for an apéritif later, so that's where I ended up after my trip to Viuz. I guess Isabelle had heard through the grapevine (my other neighbour, I imagine!) about her brother asking me out, and she and her partner got a real laugh out of that! In fact Rémy kept getting a fit of the giggles! I told her that her brother had been a real gentleman and was actually quite good company - it's just that I'm not looking for anyone. She didn't dispute that he \"can actually act like a real human being when he has to\" but said it's just a shame that he has always been such a jerk to the sisters! I believe her actually as he does have a bad reputation but I had to at least let her know that he was a gent with me. It's weird when you think of it, though, that she and her sisters have never seen the inside of the house he renovated and I have! It's also weird that his wife was dead and buried before any of them found out! A strange family dynamic (but not necessarily all that unusual round here where families often live so close to each other), but we all had a good laugh at the idea that, as she put it, \"we could have ended up being sisters-in-law\"! Nah, that's not going to happen!Then today I finally got to use the retirement gift my former colleagues gave me. I hadn't had time previously, what with all that was going on in my life, but today at last I was able to write to them and thank them properly! They had given me a Smartbox - for those that haven't heard of them, it is kind of a gift voucher where you get to chose from a wide range of \"experiences\" available from service providers who sign up for it. More often than not it's facials, massages, and so on, so I decided to use it for a one hour massage at a spa in Geneva that I had never visited before. And oh how lovely it was! Turns out I got the entrance to the spa included, a lovely, relaxing massage, another free entrance to be used at a later date - and a free drink and cookie! What's not to love!After the massage I decided to take advantage of the sauna (not my cup of tea really - way too hot), then the hammam (I'm starting to like that) and a room where you sit and enjoy various natural scents which are supposed to be very relaxing (not sure what they call it - I called it the \"smelly room\")! After that it was in to the jacuzzi which was completely empty but to be honest I wasn't too impressed! I sat there for about 10 minutes thinking \"well this isn't much cop\" until a man got in and pushed the \"start\" button!!!! What a dillon! I hadn't realized there was an \"on/off\" button! There's an expression in French which basically translates as \"I forgot to take the straw out of my clogs\" - or \"take no notice of country bumpkin over there\" - talk about looking like a bloody idiot! After that, it was into the main baths, which weren't very full given that it was a Friday afternoon, on for a free coffee and cookie (!!!!) and back home in rush hour traffic which, for once, wasn't too bad at all! So gosh what a successful day that turned out to be! Now my skin feels soft as a baby's bottom and I'm all weak and wobbly (or \"wobblier\" more like). So yep, I think I can get to like this retirement lark!"},
{"title": "Anyway, back to Sri Lanka!", "date": "Wednesday 20 March 2019", "text": "Well not really - just in my imagination - but I did want to write up a little about my Sri Lanka trip before my memory became \"fuzzy\"! I think I've mentioned before that what tends to suit me vacation-wise is to take a warm weather holiday sometime in the winter - to break up the cold weather a little - and then a European vacation around September/October time - a kind of last hurrah before the bad weather kicks in. It's beautiful here in the summer and we don't get huge numbers of tourists to be honest - unlike in the winter - so this set-up seems to work for me (for the time being, at least). One of the drawbacks of going away in the winter, of course, is that there is always the slight risk that bad weather might cause one of my flights to be delayed or cancelled but so far, touch wood, I have always been lucky! Anyway, with that in mind I made the decision to make my own travel arrangements (flying from Switzerland rather than back to England and out again) and choosing to arrive the day before the rest of my group and spend a night recuperating from the flight in Colombo. Well that was the plan anyway. So again, with a view to avoiding any possible flight delays, I chose to make the trip from Geneva to Zurich by train rather than plane, just in case. It turned out to be a rather nice three-hour train journey through Switzerland, although it did bring home to me that I think \"our\" part of Switzerland (western Switzerland) is prettier than the northern/eastern parts, although they are still lovely of course!Anyway, I arrived well in advance of my flight - only to get a text message from the airline to say that my flight would be delayed by 90 minutes due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft!!! Bloody hell, I was so hoping that it was only going to be a 90 minute delay and not end up being cancelled! I was there six hours early anyway so the thought of spending another two hours just hanging around didn't exactly fill me with joy! But at least I had a good book so having checked in (always a positive sign when the let you check in!) I bellied up to the bar to get something to eat and nurse a glass of wine as long as I could before I got dirty looks! Not that they should be giving me dirty looks anyway (they didn't!) given the prices but … you know the guilty feeling. All in all it wasn't too bad given the wine, the book and a rather lovely young Irish lad I ended up chatting to when I paid for his apple juice!! No, no, it wasn't like that. He was about 13 I would guess and had wanted to order an apple juice when the waiter explained that while they would accept his 50 euros they would have to give him his change back in Swiss francs! Well he didn't want the Swissies because he (his family) had no use for them, so I told the waiter I would pay for it - which set us up for a lovely chat in which we sorted out Brexit and figured out who was going to win the rugby 6 Nations (we were both wrong - he said Ireland and I said England. Turns out it was Wales)! Mom and dad came over afterwards and thanked me for paying for his drink and we had a nice chat, but what a lovely young lad he was - so charming and sweetly confident! It certainly helped pass the time!It turned out in the end that the incoming flight was delayed because it could not fly over Pakistani airspace given the current tensions between India and Pakistan! So while I was somewhat fed up of having to hang around even longer I guess it's always better to arrive late than never! The flight was a good one, almost 10 hours and I never slept a wink, although I have now learned to dress comfortably and take mini toiletries on the plane so I at least feel/smell better even if I do end up looking like Phylis Diller when I get off!I did get to watch the movie \"The Wife\" on the plane though and I can see why Glen Close was nominated for the Oscar! She was brilliant (as was Jonathan Pryce). It wasn't a film that I would have chosen to go and see but it helped pass the time and, as I say, she was excellent!I spent my first night in the beautiful Gateway Hotel in Colombo. It was pretty expensive but an excellent choice. Indeed the whole experience was excellent and the food in the Chinese restaurant was sublime! Whenever I'm going to be in a foreign country on my own I make sure to stay in a good hotel and it didn't disappoint!The next day I got a taxi to our tour's first hotel in Ngombo to meet the rest of my group. To be honest this hotel was a real disappointment, pretty shabby and definitely very tired. But, the bed was clean and the water was hot so I knew I could put up with it until we moved on. Later that evening I met the rest of the group, who turned out to be really nice. Well, with one exception as it turns out, but then there's always one. There was an older Canadian couple who were just great. Instantly chatting with everyone and when we went out to eat that evening the husband would sit apart from his wife and chat away to everyone. She was the same. They were obviously seasoned travellers and such good company, so a good start!The next morning we had a short trip around Ngombo fishing village before loading up and heading on to our next hotel.My hotel room in ColomboNgombo portDrying fishOn the way we stopped at a spot where the locals showed us how they climb up the palm trees to slash them and use the sap to produce arrack, which is distilled from toddy or palm syrup! Not that they used anything as boring as harnesses or hard hats (or even rope ladders!). Nope, straight up he went and in about five minutes he had whipped round and slashed all the trees!Can you see him at the top of that tree - not a harness in sight!En route we stopped at Wilpattu National Park where we switched to jeeps and set off in the hopes of spotting all kinds of wild life. The only disappointment was that we didn't see any leopards (there are about 20 in the park they think), although there was some discussion about whether one of our group had spotted one. Even with my binoculars I couldn't make it out but … who knows. We did see a good variety of other animals though, so the day wasn't wasted. Then after about four hours in the Park it was on to our next hotel in Nuwarawewa!Temple on the way to NuwarawewaWater buffaloNot a good picture - but a mother bear and her cubWhen I saw this I ran back and got my bag out the jeep - \"thieving monkeys\" is pretty accurateand I wasn't going to let that little bugger get away with my passport!"},

It was very informal, with the Maire making it a nice, funny service and in about 15 minutes they were married! After that it was back to mom's house for a rather nice tartiflette (mom) and rather good cookies, shortbread and fruit salad (me and my friend). All in all a lovely, informal wedding. At least they are married before Brexit so that's a positive! Now we get to look forward to the big party in July.  Congratulations Jordan and Jen!"},
{"title": "How to waste an entire morning!", "date": "Thursday 14 March 2019", "text": "I haven't really gotten my head straight since getting back from Sri Lanka on Monday but I will post more about the trip when I get my thoughts together. Not that buying a Rubrik's cube helps with getting anything done! You see, when I go away I am always looking for small souvenir-type gifts to bring back for my kids and a few friends. Nothing \"souveniry\" in the sense of a decorative dust catcher, but usually something consumable or useful. This time I bought back wonderful spiced cashew nuts, which feature widely in Sri Lankan agricultural production, so they won't be gathering too much dust I imagine. I bought other things back too of course, but I am also always on the look-out for Christmas presents/stocking fillers! Just on the off chance! When I was in Costa Rica this time last year I bought back beautiful photo albums - they almost looked like they were made of papyrus - and Jen told me that she is going to put their wedding photos in it as she loves it so much!Anyway, this time I picked up some beautiful silk scarves for the girls and a few other small items buuuut I spotted Rubik's cubes in a small toy shop in Galle and something clicked. Now I don't know that Mr. Rubik was Sri Lankan (probably not, don't you think), but I remember having one when they first became popular and learning how to do it. Can you believe they first came out in 1974!!! Crikey, I'm showing my age now. Of course, after a while the craze wore off and I forgot how to do it, although I'm pretty sure I still have it somewhere. So, me having a warped mind, I like to buy small Christmas gifts that are either silly or drive you slightly nuts! Last year I bought my kids Mad Libs and got the biggest grin out of my sons as they remembered all the stupid \"stories\" we put together when they were young. Of course all the nouns or verbs we provided were generally along the lines of \"fart\" or \"onions\", so the finished story usually ended up being pretty silly. Still, they both like that kind of thing! Anyway this year I am already thinking of Where's Waldo/Wally books (they have different names in different countries) as I know it is the kind of thing my boys get a laugh out of. I know, I know, but it's easier to buy for the girls - my sons get what momma here thinks will amuse them!Anyway, to cut a long story short I bought three Rubik's cubes, two for my sons and one for me. But of course, as I mentioned, I had forgotten how to do it! So yesterday morning I spent almost four hours watching a Youtube video on how to put it back together! I completed it several times in time with the video and so far have memorized about two-thirds of the moves, so I'll be back at it tonight. But talk about a way to waste your morning! Thankfully I'm not quite this obsessive with most things! I had a drink with my friend last night and mentioned it to him and get this - he is completely impressed and wants me to teach him how to do it (hey buddy, you can get Youtube too), so I'm thinking I already have a good idea of what to get him for Christmas too!Cartoon by The Internet Scaengers - PHSLwab.comOn a different note, while I was in Sri Lanka I could only occasionally check my emails or read my favourite blogs as the internet was often very iffy - hence the lack of comments on other people's blogs. But one day I got an email from FedEx about a parcel that they were trying to deliver and apparently I was to \"click here\"! I didn't of course because I frequently used to get these kinds of scam emails at work, but since the email apparently came from a work colleague who did, indeed, work in my employer's mailing room, I wrote to him and asked him if it was legit. Turns out it was, and in recognition of my long service my employer sent me a personally engraved plaque which is actually rather nice, plus a signed letter from the Director-General. Now I'm not usually one for the old \"carriage clock and pen\" kind of leaving token, but I have to admit this was rather nicely done!And finally, Brexit! We were talking about that weren't we!!!! Well, as someone who is intimately caught up in the whole debacle by virtue of being a Brit living in France, I signed up for a link to the UK Government website which is trying to handle this whole bloody mess, and to be fair, they are ploughing out the information in what seems to be a very efficient way. Now as someone who has a slight inkling of just some of the problems that are heading the UK's way (my former employer dealt with international trade), I have to admit that even I had no idea how bloody involved and complicated this whole matter is. And to think people were asked to vote \"do you want to stay in the EU or leave\"? As simple as that! I took a screen shot of my inbox showing the emails I get on a daily basis just from this UK Government website, and I would say, in all honesty, I get three times this many emails per day on all the different issues they are having to deal with! Bloody hell, glad I'm not responsible for that!"},

They are asking £400,000 for it, which doesn't seem a lot to me but then I know I haven't lived in the UK for years and you really do have to compare apples to apples.I reckon that there would be a steady income stream from it with the walkers in North Wales, even in winter, and with Betws being located inside Snowdonia National Park.

I find myself going to bed pretty late - anywhere between midnight and 1 a.m. (or 1.30 last night!), and then getting up around 8.30. I have always been a \"late\" bird but, ideally, I would like to get that down to getting up a bit earlier. I suppose, though, since it's still officially winter why would I want to get up earlier in the dark and cold right? That being said, the weather is absolutely gorgeous here, with temperatures around 14°C, or in the 50s F, so if I can get my act together I will aim to start going to bed by midnight and up by around 7-7.30! We'll see how that pans out though won't we!What I have been putting off, however, is looking into what I need to do for residency after Brexit, so yesterday, after taking myself off for an hour's walk in the sunshine, I decided I would get online and have a look at the kind of paperwork I will need to stump up in order to get my resident's papers (carte de séjour in French). A friend sent me a link to what turned out to be a fairly efficient UK Government website which has been set up to help Brits in Europe. After signing up I must have received 50 emails immediately on \"living in Germany after Brexit\", \"living in Greece after Brexit\", \"living in ….\" you get the idea. But in addition to those emails there were also emails entitled \"IP (intellectual property) issues after Brexit\", \"import and export procedures after Brexit\", and so on. Anyway, I clicked on the \"French\" link and got some fairly standard info there. The French, though, have also set up a website for Brits living in France but the big problem is that they have to keep keep referring to \"in the event of a deal\", you will need to provide this, but \"in the event of no deal\" you will need to provide that. Basically nobody knows! So it's all still as clear as mud you see! The positives, as far as I can see, is that deals are being negotiated (and hopefully pushed through) on the issue of medical coverage for Brits in various EU countries and pension security. It's by no means sorted but at least it is moving forward, and frankly it is in nobody's interests for this to be screwed up. Seeing all the pages and pages of information I have to wade through, though, does make me wonder what those Brits will do (many in Spain as far as I can see) who never bothered to learn the language! I would not like to be trying to trudge through this stuff if I didn't speak French, I can tell you and, most likely, there will be a French language proficiency test thrown in for good measure! But then why not - we live in the bloody country don't we! On the issue of medical insurance and pensions I will be ok as I have private medical insurance for life through my former employer and a private pension, again through my former employer and not dependent on Britain. My youngest son - the one still living in France - is employed and has medical insurance through his employer and will be married to a French girl by the time it goes through. Ditto my oldest son, although he is in Switzerland and married to a Swiss. So there you have it, despite my best intentions and sitting down to \"really go through this stuff\", I am no further forward than I was a couple of days ago, so I guess I will just wait until April and take it from there. The good news is that we will have at least until July 2020 to prepare our files, as opposed to the three months my husband and I had in 1990 to submit our requests for cartes de séjour.Then to add to the paperwork, up until this year the French have always received full, untaxed salaries and, at the end of each tax year, they file taxes and pay what is owed to the State. Since 1 January 2019 they have instituted a PAYE (pay as you earn) system so everyone should now be having taxes deducted at source by their employers. Except for people like me, though, because I have a foreign (non-French) pension which they cannot touch so I have to set it up myself to allow them to direct debit my monthly taxes from my bank account. The problem with that, though, is (a) I don't actually know if I have to wait until the end of 2019 for them to estimate my taxes (as was usually done up until now since this is my first year as a pensioner), or if I should be paying in already! No idea! I am of course putting the money aside so I can pay it immediately once it gets sorted but I still have to correct the issue of the bad information provided to me by my \"tax advisor\" regarding the amount of tax I have to pay on the lump sum! So, really, I can't do anything until I get that sorted! I am, therefore, going to make an appointment with a real tax expert for when I come back from Sri Lanka and hopefully get that sorted pretty quickly.And talking of Sri Lanka (I was wasn't I), I'm off there on Saturday! Yay me. I'm flying from Zurich and will arrive a day before my tour starts so I have booked into what I hope is a nice hotel in Colombo for the first night, allowing me to recuperate from jet lag a little before we set off on our tour. Same for when I get back too, as my flight arrives in Zurich around 9 p.m. and I don't want to then set off on a three hour train journey to get in to Geneva probably around 1 a.m. Sooo, I have booked myself into what looks to be a rather nice hotel at Zurich airport on the way back.As luck would have it, this evening I saw that Top Gear was on tonight and just happened to catch that they would be having a race from Colombo to northern Sri Lanka in two tuk-tuks to try to make it over \"Adam's Bridge\" (hint, it's not a real bridge) to India! So I got to see the kind of scenery that awaits me and it looks beautiful. I'm not much of a Top Gear fan to be honest (particularly since Clarkson left) but it was lovely to see all that lush scenery and the beautiful beaches. Kinda exciting!Then to add more flavour to the mix, my son and his fiancée are getting married on the Saturday after I get back. It is the mairie wedding (the legal wedding), which will last about 30 minutes and then we are all going back to the bride's mom's place for lunch. They are making \"tartiflette\" (my favourite meal in the whole world I think) and have asked me to make desert for 20-25. Since tartiflette is pretty heavy we have agreed that I will make a fruit salad with rum and a cardamom sauce, millionaire's shortbread, and I think I will also make a heart-shaped chocolate cake, which is one of Jordan's favourites. My friend is making her \"to die for\" chocolate chip cookies so I don't suppose we will starve. I just hope this glorious weather holds out for them. My other son got married two years ago on 17 March in beautiful weather and Jordan and Jen are getting married on 16 March, so fingers crossed.Other than that, there's not much going on. I took myself off to the Bénite Fontaine (the Church of the Blessed Fountain), in order to get a walk in but ostensibly to fill up my water bottles from the mountain spring water that runs through there (a bit like bottling your own Evian water - which you can also do for free). I noticed the farmer in the distance on the way back tending to his horses but other than that haven't seen him since. So all's good here. Packing almost done, and I haven't forgotten the mozzie repellent so Sri Lanka here I come!"},
{"title": "I'm beginning to love Sundays!", "date": "Thursday 21 February 2019", "text": "I know, I know, it's not Sunday, but do you remember that awful sinking feeling you would get (well most of us, I would guess) on a Sunday evening knowing that tomorrow would mean \"up at the crack of dawn and back to the daily grind\"? Of course I don't have to do that any more and as such I am starting to really appreciate Sundays. I was thinking just this last Sunday as I marvelled at how quiet and peaceful it was, with people out cleaning their cars or just pottering in their gardens. You see, over here in France nothing is really open on Sundays so while I enjoyed doing a bit of shopping on Sundays in the UK there is none of that here. And now I really appreciate the quietness of it, often just tootling around the garden and watching the planes overhead wondering where they are off to!Well I suppose \"totally quiet\" isn't strictly true! I was driving down to the market in the next little village on Sunday and the traffic heading up and down the mountain was pretty awful seeing as the schools' winter break/ski holidays have already started. What! But they've only just gone back to school after the Christmas break! To be honest, I don't know how we did it when the kids were young, coping with those never ending school holidays, although I'm pretty sure we never tied them to a chair and left them home alone! Anyway, the next village of St. Pierre is the access route to a winding mountain gorge that takes you up to some lovely ski resorts - La Clusaz (my favourite), Grand Bornand etc. - and the traffic was horrendous, as it was \"changeover day\" for many renters and ski day for quite a few locals, although I always tried to avoid the resorts when the schools were on their break. In fact the day before there was a traffic jam heading north (towards Paris) that we know was about 130 km long. It started way before the toll road just near me and stretched at least until Bourg-en-Bresse, 130 km away! What a nightmare! I have a vague thought that I might go back to downhill skiing again next year but only with a group that goes on Tuesdays and Thursdays rather than the weekend. The Swiss Alpine Club do this so I might try them out, although I'd need to be a lot fitter before joining them I think. Ha, I once joined CAS (the Swiss club) a few years ago and signed up for what I thought was a cross country trip. On the list of recommended equipment was a \"piolet\", so I asked my friend what that was in English. When she said an ice axe I nearly died, I had signed myself up for ski touring, you know skiing up mountains and not just down or across them. Hell, could you imagine me turning up for that!I was keeping an eye on the traffic though as I had arranged to meet my friend in Geneva to go to the cinema and wanted to know if I needed to take the back roads but by Sunday afternoon it was flowing freely. Just as well really as it's almost an hour's drive even without the traffic. We went to see \"Green Book\" and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. It is based on a true story of the unlikely friendship between a black concert pianist who elected to do a tour of the US South in the 1960s and a hard hitting Italian New Yorker hired as his chauffeur. It was funny but also thought-provoking on just what it must have been like to be a black person in the South in the 60s. The next film I want to go and see is \"Stan and Ollie\", which doesn't come out here until 3 March so it will have to wait until I get back from Sri Lanka. My nephew made me laugh though as he said he had seen it (and thoroughly enjoyed it) but while he was queueing up to get tickets somebody behind him said \"so what's it about anyway?\" Sweet!And going off on a totally different tangent, being at home more has brought home to me how many bloody scam/telemarketing calls I get on my home phone! I got three in the space of an hour the other day while I was sitting reading. If I don't recognize the number I never pick up as my friends know to start leaving a message. These callers never leave a message of course. And I was getting quite a few calls from Tunisia on my mobile until recently, even though I never give out my mobile number unless it is necessary. I routinely block them as they come in but then of course they just call from another number. Tunisia seems to be on the wane now and Tonga seems to have taken up the slack! Bloody hell, Tonga!!! Again I just keep blocking the numbers but seriously?After my experience with the farmer yesterday I must admit I have spent a good amount of time today looking out my window to make sure he wasn't in the field at the back of my house. He has the horses in a field nearer to my house today but I only saw him from a distance. You see, while I didn't mind having a coffee with him I really don't want to get taken \"unawares\" again as he was quite insistent yesterday! Time to get the wig and false mustache out I guess!And finally, I see that Karl Lagerfeld died yesterday. I'm no fashionista (haven't got the figure for it) but I did find some of his \"bitchy\" comments quite amusing. I particularly like the one about sweatpants. \"Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants!\" Oh dear, I wonder what he would have said about woolly socks, no bra and sweatpants!"},
{"title": "What the hell just happened!", "date": "Tuesday 19 February 2019", "text": "Gosh I had so many things I was going to write about but I seem to have just gotten side-swiped!  I suppose I should start at the beginning though right. I have, once again, decided that I really should try to lose some weight. I know, I know, I've said it all before but this time I really can't seem to come up with any valid excuse why not. I have the time to read, to cook and to exercise, so as I can't think of any other excuses here we go again. I have signed up to several dieting websites over the years which I'm sure work but the problem is … you have to follow them, and I have a real hard time being \"told\" what I can and can't eat. I think, more importantly, I read up on these diets and think \"oh that sounds right\" and then another one completely contradicts what the first one said and I end up being so totally confused as to what to believe! In the past I have signed up to Weight Watchers online (twice I think) and also attended their meetings (also on two different occasions), but firstly it was hell trying to get to the meetings because of the traffic round here and, as usual, I always have big problems sticking to a \"plan\". I have no doubt that they work but, as I said, I really don't like being \"told\" what to do! I have (briefly) tried the Dukan diet (I lasted three days), Slimming World online (they don't have meetings here) and was looking into keto but I hadn't got past the \"oh I think I could do that\" stage! Anyway, while I was in England the other week a neighbour of my sister's walked past and was chatting away with my sister and her husband and he commented on how he had already lost one stone (14lbs) with Slimming World and it was \"fantastic\". My sister got to chatting with him and afterwards was telling me that, yes, it really was a great system and so many friends had lost weight easily with it. OK quite a few had put weight back on too but that was because they didn't stick to the principles of SW. So when I got back from the funeral I thought \"sod it\", I'll sign up online again and see how it goes. I guess the only difference is I now have time to look through their recipes and try to follow it that way rather than looking through my store cupboard and trying to adapt their principles to my store cupboard - although I'm sure that's also possible. So I started SW online last week and have lost 2 lbs this week. That in itself is OK but in reality I can lose or gain 3-4 lbs overnight (hormones I guess) so I want to wait until next week to see if I think this will work for me. The big thing in their favour, as far as I'm concerned, is that I can eat fruit, and with the other plans I was just not willing to give up my fruit ration! Yeah, yeah, I know fruit is nature's candy but I still wasn't willing to give it up.Anyhoo, all that to say, I have also been making an effort to get out and walk in this glorious weather we have going here. As my car needed some work after failing it's MOT last week I drove into town yesterday to drop it off then slugged my way back up home (I live at 800 metres) afterwards. Not too bad but it is hard work. Then, when it was time to pick it up, I walked back into town again so I managed over 13,000 steps yesterday. Today I had a bit of running around to do and when I got back I hesitated over whether I wanted to go out walking again but in the end I thought \"sod it, put your money where your mouth is and get out there\"! The weather is glorious, bright sunshine and around 14°C (57°F) so I decided at the last minute to head out for a walk up behind our houses before the sun started to go down. I have mentioned this walk before when I posted a picture of the pretty chalet and where I stopped to talk to the horses.They were out again today (minus the snow), so I had a good excuse to stop and catch my breath (read \"prevent myself from regurgitating a lung\") so I went over and started talking to them. There was a man there a little further up with his \"Savoyard\" hat on (like a French cowboy hat) - they wear them a lot round here up in the mountains - and he wandered over and started chatting to me. I recognized him immediately as the owner of the farm up at the back of my house (you can see where his fields start in my header picture) and asked if they were his. They were, and he was explaining to me that they were females and one had just had twins - he said he misjudged her due date by two days so had taken her inside with her foals. So that's when I told him I recognized him and he was \"Dédé A\", or \"André A\", my neighbour. Now I have been friends with his sister for years, our kids grew up together, her only child being killed eight years ago in a car crash involving four kids from our little village. Two of the boys were killed in fact, and V, the mother of Hugo, the other boy who was killed, is one of the (founding) members of our board game evening and we are still friends. The other two kids in the car were M, the driver, who was badly injured, and C, Stan's daughter, who was also seriously injured but survived. So yes, I knew Dédé, but not well. Problem was, his sister couldn't stand him, said he was a \"brute\" (\"a savage\", I guess, in French) and they have nothing to do with each other. That being said, he did go to her son's funeral and stand at the back of the church so she at least realized that there was a heart there!Anyway, as I got chatting to Dédé he asked me if I would like for him to show me round his farm and have a coffee with him. I didn't really know what to say so ended up saying yes. What I didn't know was that his wife had died in August and he was alone!  But like I say, I knew this man vaguely so off we went in his jeep further up the mountain to his farmhouse. Here he showed me his sheep and lambs (80 in total) and his Pyreneen mountain dogs that take care of them. A couple of years ago I did a post about how lovely it was to see the sheep and their dog/guardian in the field behind me. Then he took me over to see the goats. I just loved that shed as those goats were so pretty. Apparently he has 800 animals in all, but was telling me how lonely he had been since his wife had died. Anyway, we ended up having a coffee at his place and he asked me out!!!!! I said \"but you don't know me, or at least only slightly\", and he said he didn't care but did I want to go out with him!!!! Oh crikey. I said thank you but no I am very happy alone and not looking but I understood that he was lonely. Don't get me wrong, he was an absolute gentleman, but I have a hard time reconciling this man who was very good company and an absolute treasure-trove of information about local customs and the local landscape with the \"brute\" that his sister describes. I tend to believe her as he can be more than a bit \"rough around the edges\" but then I guess that is the nature of alpine farmers isn't it!So we got chatting and he was asking me about my ex. I told him that many moons ago he had bought his tractor into our garden to take out a hazelnut tree for us (we couldn't dig the roots up) and he said \"oh yeah, your husband had the baseball cap on\" (well he is American). Then I explained that when Jordan was around 10 he and two friends had been up on the farm and thrown stones into the bath tub that served as a drinking trough for his cattle and that he had balled them out. So he said \"so that's why you don't want to go out with me - because I balled your kids out\"? So I said \"no, Stan and I actually sent our kids back up to your place to apologize\" (which they did - but he terrified them) and he remembered them. Shotgun in hand he yelled at them \"je ne viens pas vous emmerder chez vous, ne venez pas m'emmerder chez moi\", which basically means I don't \"f...k around at your place so don't come f....ing around at mine\"! He just laughed when I told him how scared the kids had been, but you know what, I don't blame him for balling them out because a farmer has a living to make and his animals are more than precious to him.Anyway, after the coffee he got out the \"niol\" alcohol - homemade - and explained to me that it is made from a mountain plant called isopline (in English), where he went looking for it and how he made it. If you're interested - 40 isopline plants, 40 sugar cubes, cover with niol and leave for 40 days - easy right! Isopline - looks a bit like lavender doesn't it!It is quite common here to have an alcohol \"chaser\" after a cup of coffee and I really was fascinated by all that he knows about the local area and its traditions. Under other circumstances he would be a dream man (for me) but I still wasn't interested in going out with him!!! Crikey, I only stopped to pat the horses! But you know what, I don't regret going for a coffee with a lonely widower - I just hope he knows to respect my boundaries and not show the \"brute\" side! So there you have it - a \"brute\" of an alpine farmer who invited me for coffee (and niol) and all I was trying to do was lose some weight! I told him up front I wasn't interested and was trying, kindly, to tell him that there were loads of women out there who would jump at the chance to date him. I did, however, say I would gladly have coffee with him occasionally - but the look on my neighbours' faces when man mountain/the \"brute\" dropped me off at my front door was a sight to behold!"},
{"title": "Returning to normal - hopefully!", "date": "Thursday 14 February 2019", "text": "I flew back from the funeral via Manchester on Sunday night after a week full of 360° weather changes and very mixed emotions. Sadness, of course, for the loss of my brother, but full of laughter - as usually happens on these occasions when we allow ourselves to remember the silly things too. The funeral was nicely done and the celebrant spoke well, I thought. Turns out he knew my mom's family from when he was a child and he managed to bring quite a personal touch to it. After the funeral I actually commented to Phil's oldest son, Darren, that it was a shame we now only seemed to meet up at funerals since, for a large family, we (mostly) get along very well so did anyone have any thoughts on meeting up occasionally somewhere \"neutral\" - to which Darren replied \"but who would we have to shoot\"? He has my brother's sense of humour and just cracks me up!We set off from Dorset on the Thursday morning before the funeral as on a \"good\" day it would be a 6-7 hour journey and on a \"usual\" day it could take any number of hours! For that reason, my brother-in-law decided to take the back roads as the last time he had driven up to North Wales on the motorway the traffic jams were horrendous. And honestly, it was a real pleasure to take that route and visit (or re-visit) places I hadn't seen in decades. On the way up we went through a lovely town called Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire - it was so, so pretty it would be hard to do it justice. It was also near here that we stopped to eat in an unassuming little place that ended up doing the most amazing food! Homemade venison or chicken pies, fabulous cakes, sticky toffee puddings, you name it!! It really was superb, although after last week I don't think I'll even set foot on a set of scales for at least a month!Bradford-on-AvonNear Ledbury we passed a lovely looking pub that I had never seen before. Ledbury is only a few miles from where BIL grew up so he and my sister spent quite some time reminiscing about the different places they had been when dating/first married.The Trumpet Pub near LedburyMy youngest son and his fiancée were able to get a couple of days off in order to come to the funeral so afterwards, having shown them around Conwy and Llandudno, I thought they might enjoy \"UK prices\" and took them to that young person's shopping paradise - Primark! Well that was a hit! Basically Jordan followed Jen around like a sherpa carrying a shopping basket, with her going \"oh my goodness look at these prices! How much is that in real money?\" and so on. After her shopping spree it was Jordan's turn and we went upstairs to the men's department where he got to satisfy his urge to shout \"oh my goodness …\"! Anyway, they were both really happy with their purchases and, since they made sure not to bring too much stuff with them, we were able to get all their goodies back without having to pay any excess baggage! Which did trigger an interesting question (provoked by me, I have to admit) about whether they would be able to have such a \"spend up\" if a no deal Brexit meant import duties were re-imposed on goods coming into France from the UK! Which also gave way to a more interesting discussion with my family when we saw a similar sign to the one below on a door in Conwy!On our final day in Wales we decided to visit Portmeirion since none of us had ever been there before and I/we were very pleasantly surprised. It was so pretty and the china in the gift shop was to die for! Expensive and fabulous so unfortunately I couldn't indulge but I was drooling, I have to admit!PortmerionPortmerionI had forewarned my sister that on the way back I wanted to take the kids for a drive up through Betws-y-Coed so wouldn't be following them back to Llandudno via the normal route (through Llanrwst - where my grandfather used to have a cobbler's shop). Well! By the time we got there it was dark and starting to snow and as we were leaving Betws I was having a hard time seeing where I was going as there were no lights, no cats' eyes and walkers heading up the road in the dark, presumably to the Snowdonia hostel further up, It was really hard work, bearing in mind I was on the \"wrong side of the road\" too! At one point I had had to chose between going straight on (unsignposted) or taking a left turn but going that way would take me over Llanberis Pass, in the dark, in the snow, on the wrong side of the road and still not sure I was going the right way! Turns out I was right, but by golly that was hard work, although listening to Jen trying to pronounce Welsh names from the GPS on her telephone was hilarious!Llanberis PassWhen I got back to France I ended up coming down with the lurgy, which could have been due to stress in addition to the cold and howling wind that we had to put up with in Wales, but I have to say we were actually pretty lucky for the most part in that when the weather was doing its worst we were mainly in the car and actually managed to avoid the worst it could throw at us. Not completely, of course, or else I wouldn't have got sick but ….. Either way I'm starting to feel better already after a few lazy days and am already thinking it's time to get back to the old exercise malarky to compensate for the surfeit of calories I managed to cram into my poor body last week!And finally, when I got home I realized that the bloody handle on my (relatively) new suitcase had come right off, either in Manchester or in Geneva upon arrival, so somewhere or other there is a suitcase handle with my name and phone number attached to it squeaking forlornly around a baggage carousel, somewhat like Rhod Gilbert describes below!"},

And we were all directed out of the airport (to stand for the next 90 minutes in the snow as it turned out). I eventually discovered that there was an unattended suitcase found outside a bookstore and they ended up calling in the bomb squad and sniffer dogs! The Easyjet check ins seemed to be where it was \"all occurring\" and most of those flights were UK bound (mainly skiers) so in the end I ended up standing outside in the snow with a group of very good natured Brits, I have to admit! Maybe we're just more used to getting stuck in delays and we're definitely experts at queuing, but nobody got worked up or ratty and one man cracked me up after about an hour when he proclaimed in a very loud voice \"well that's the last time I pay for speedy boarding\"! We all burst out laughing!They had a robot x-ray the case and then sent in the dog and the bomb squad and it turned out to be a false alarm luckily! I hope they came down hard on the bag's owner (presuming they found them) as it must have cost the airport/airlines a small fortune! I had resigned myself to missing my flight (and possibly also the funeral) but I have to admit the staff pulled out all the stops (Easyjet ground staff in particular) and I made it to the UK with just a one hour delay!We're off to Wales on Thursday for the funeral on Friday and then it's back to Geneva on Sunday for me.

{"title": "Let it snow!", "date": "Friday 1 February 2019", "text": "Crikey, I know I've been saying winter hasn't even started here for a while but then today happened! Starting yesterday evening with rain it must have turned to snow during the night because this morning it was coming down thick and fast! And it didn't stop all day! I heard the snowplough come through around 5 a.m. but the snow never stopped. I can't say it was cold at all (I guess it has to warm up in order to snow) but that snow was just relentless. Which would have been fine if I didn't have to go anywhere (normally I don't) but I recently received a reminder that my car was coming due for its contrôle technique (MOT in the UK) and I had it booked in for this afternoon! Typical! It has barely snowed at all this season and now I have to drive into town behind the plough! Still, on a positive note, yet again I am eternally grateful that I wasn't pushing snow off my car at 6 a.m. this morning trying to get to work on what I'm now beginning to believe is the world's greatest parking lot - the Geneva ring road! I swear two days a week the traffic on that road doesn't move at all, thus becoming one massive parking lot!Anyway, I made it into town ok and dropped off my car for it's inspection, which, conveniently enough, was located right next door to Intersport - a local sporting goods chain - where they were having their sales! Yay me! Thirty minutes to spare and the sales are on next door!  I managed to find a nice lightweight, but windproof, top in the sale - which kinda surprised even me to be honest, as I usually can't find anything in my size - French women are just so diddy for the most part and I can rarely find a sports top to fit!! I guess I might have lost a little weight then! In addition I also picked up a long rain poncho for my trip to Sri Lanka in March. We were told to bring warm-ish clothes as certain parts can get cold and can also be wet (though I doubt as cold and wet as here) and I wanted something really lightweight as I only want to pack a small case! For the other stuff I want I will look around when I get to England as there are good sporting goods stores near my sister and they will be a lot cheaper!Anyway, my car was basically OK but I have to have a couple of minor things sorted. He mentioned something about the \"power steering having a little too much give\" and a small light that needed changing, but frankly I know very little about cars and even less when they explain it to me in French! I have two months to get it sorted in order for my car to be fully compliant, so I dropped straight in at my garage and booked an appointment for when I get back from England. I have known Thierry at Ford for ages and he is a really good guy. He also speaks fairly decent English and likes to practice with me! He has me booked in for the work when I get back and then offered to drop it back off at the MOT place when it was done so that I didn't have to bother - so all good then!Well \"all good\" until I got home of course, which was when I found out the electricity was out! I have no idea when it went off and they have always been very good about getting it up and running quickly, but having no electricity does make you realize how dependent you are on it doesn't it. I mean, I heat my home with fuel but obviously the system can't run without electricity! Still, I was able to make myself a cup of tea on my gas hob so all was not lost! I keep a couple of torches dotted around my house but the the one in my bedroom didn't work when I picked it up because of course the batteries had been in it too long! Not a worry though as I had others but it could, indeed, have been a cold evening had they not got the electricity up and running fairly sharply! The longest we have been without electricity since I have been here was over New Year 1999/2000 when I think it was out for about 24 hours and by golly it was cold. I'm lucky in that I have a log fire that I can use to heat the house but it obviously wouldn't be a long term solution. And another little tidbit, our little town of La Roche was the first in France to get electricity! You never know what you don't know do you!Anyway, it has started to rain now so I'm hoping it will wash away a lot of the snow by the time I fly on Sunday. I can already hear the snow falling off the roof right now so fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "I think she was taking the mickey!", "date": "Thursday 31 January 2019", "text": "After hearing I had signed up for a new yoga class my friend sent me a video of this little 98 year old Indian lady yogi with words to the effect \"that'll be you soon\"! I think she was making fun of me don't you! But that's where the similarities end apparently. Firstly, I'm not Indian, secondly I have all my own teeth but seriously!!! This lady is just amazing. I could only ever aspire to be 1/10th as good as her in my dreams! But it says a lot for yoga doesn't it! I had my second lesson on Tuesday and again I loved it. Actually, said friend came with me. Not sure what she made of it or whether she will sign up but for me at least it was great! This week our teacher concentrated on shoulders and arms and it was even less \"dynamic\" than last week, but yet again I came out of there feeling wonderful. At the end of the class I get a kind of \"stinging\" feeling in the base of my spine which I reckon is down to the fact that I have a small \"hollow\" in my spine due to poor posture I guess. You know, when you lie on the floor your spine doesn't touch the ground all the way from neck to hips - I guess most of us have that little hollow right. Buuuut, at the end of the class when I lay down my spine was completely flat on the floor. And on waking up the next morning I realized that my back was again touching the mattress all the way down and it felt great. I realize this is something that you have to keep working on but I have to admit I think I'm completely hooked!Anyway, yesterday we had quite a heavy snow fall and I did hesitate to drive in to Geneva to my work's gym but … damn and drat .... the snow plough came through at 5 a.m. and then again at mid-day and I had no excuse, so off I went. I think I will have to learn to go to the gym first before stopping to chat with colleagues though as I didn't get as much time in as I would have liked! I made a cake to take in and got chatting to my former boss so that cut into my gym time (but at least the cake is all gone). I wanted to get out of there before 4 pm as I didn't want to get caught in rush hour traffic - but no such luck! If you take the Geneva ring road to France there are three tunnels before the border, and just as I was passing the airport I saw a sign to say that there had been an accident in the first tunnel and everything was at a standstill! Seems nothing ever changes right! It took me 90 minutes to get home and yet again I was so so glad I don't have to do that commute any more. And then, this morning on my FB feed I saw that there was another accident at the toll booth and traffic was yet again completely blocked heading in to Geneva. Thank GOD I no longer have to do that! On the other hand, I finally got paid my first pension payment! It felt like it would never happen! We routinely got paid early in December (17th December I think) and since my pension isn't paid until the last day of the month (as opposed to 25th of the month for my salary), it felt like my December salary had to last until the 91st of January! Still, even though my pension is only about one-third of my salary this one didn't seem so bad as I also received the lump sum I am going to be using to pay off my mortgage in April. So the bank account is (temporarily) looking very healthy indeed. Not that it will last but I just might take a picture of that balance to frame and put on my wall!In other news, on Tuesday night I had my first patchwork lesson of the year. This time we are making a Kaffee Fassett mystery quilt, which is made up basically of two repeating blocks. At least I hope to get it down pat by force of sheer repetition. It isn't difficult as such but I find it hard to be so accurate (down to the millimetre) in order to get the repeating patterns lined up. Fingers crossed I can get the hang of it as it sure isn't cheap. And since I am no longer at work, getting home at 11 p.m. after my class didn't phase me in the least!I mentioned in my last post that I have rented a car in North Wales to get around while I am back for my brother's funeral. Well I got an email from them confirming the reservation and asking me to call them. I tried a couple of times but it sounded like someone was trying to make a call wearing ear plugs and snorkeling gear while chewing on marbles so I had to give up in the end. I sent them a mail asking what they needed to know but in fact it was just asking me if I needed to be picked up (from the train station, for instance) in order to get to my rental car! I'm quite impressed I have to say. Good service and all that.Talking of \"good service\" though, I was reading an article about poverty in the UK this morning and people on the low or no income scale who are struggling with usurious loans. I thought these horrendous loan \"deals\" had been done away with when Wonga went bust, but one instance they quoted was car loans at 535%!!! Now you may ask why someone with a low income would be thinking of buying a car but public transport isn't a given in all areas and is definitely not always cheaper. Either way, these people are, for the most part, definitely being taken to the cleaners and falling ever deeper into the debt spiral because of these crooks posing as benevolent lenders. I know it's not true of everyone and some people are just stupid with money, but I can't help feeling that these kinds of lending rates are just criminal! It does, however, beggar belief that some of these young women are continuing to have babies with (seemingly) no father in the picture. Surely it is madness to keep having children if you can't count on the child's father to be there!! Where are these fathers and where is their accountability (read \"financial responsibility\")? And again I know that this is a stereotype and some got into this awful position through no fault of their own - but surely it's time to stop these kinds of loans once and for all. To save people who can't seem to save themselves! This is where social services need to step in, in my opinion, but of course their budgets are being cut way back to the bone also. Rant over!Anyway, moving on, I have been watching the weather to see if there will be a problem with my flight on Sunday. It seems like (from this end at least) all should be well. Fingers crossed. Then I had a call from Steve who told me he was supposed to be \"snowed in\" - and all they got was about one-eighth of an inch of snow. I burst out laughing. According to Steve, for the most part the newspapers send some poor sod off to the far north of Scotland to photograph a car in a ditch and then that becomes the \"norm\" as far as the UK is concerned. Now I know the north does get dreadful weather (as indeed does Wales) but if you live there you know it's coming and, presumably, know how to deal with it! As for Steve, he has a series of hospital appointments prior to going in for his bone marrow transplant but he actually does look rather well. Poor bugger had to have a skin lesion removed from his head - which they spotted some time ago but didn't want to touch until he was over his first bout of chemo. Now he has a rather large scar on the top of his head and scarring down his arm where they took skin for the skin graft. Still, it's better than last time I spoke to him as he had what looked like a rather large piece of ravioli stuck on his head while the scarring healed. Now all he needs is a baseball cap in order not to scare the local kiddies. Poor devil, I know he will be glad when it's all over, but then, as he said, he would rather that than my brother's situation!And finally, I know I should get my ex husband's FB feed off my page, but this morning he certainly took the biscuit. He posts the most racist pro-Trump crap I have ever seen, totally \"anti immigrant\" and \"anti foreigner\". He seems to forget his ex wife is a \"foreigner\", as are his two daughters-in-law, and that he himself was an \"immigrant\" for over 30 years! Man, please stop me banging my head against a wall. At least I have now blocked his FB drivel from appearing on my own. Buuuut, this morning he wrote something along the lines of \"kids who have to walk 1,000 yards to get to school in this weather should get the day off????? But kids who only have to walk two blocks should get their a$$$ into school\"! And this from a man who wrecked his car (drunk) and called me at 1 a.m. from the border where he had abandoned his car. Next day I drove him to Ford where his car was dropped off (although where the girlfriend was I have no idea). When I went to drive off he hopped back in my car yelling \"hey I need you to take me home\" (home being the girlfriend's house). I couldn't believe it! So I put my km counter back to zero and clocked up the distance that was \"too far for him to walk\". It was 800 metres!!! God give me strength!"},
{"title": "It's all go!", "date": "Monday 28 January 2019", "text": "Honestly, I feel like I've booked so many \"planes, trains and automobiles\" this January that I should open a travel agent's! Or maybe not, as it happens! Many years ago I thought that I would enjoy that as a job but now? Nah, not so much! I think I get so paranoid I will miss something that I couldn't imagine taking on the responsibility for someone else's travels! Oddly enough, my daughter-in-law loves organizing and booking all their tailor-made trips - she says that is the best part! Not me, I guess old dogs/new tricks and what not!I have already booked my flight back to the UK for this Sunday. I will be flying to Bournemouth to stay with my sister and her husband and then we will drive up to Wales for the funeral on Friday. My oldest son and his wife can't make the funeral but since they were good enough to fly out and see my brother while he was still alive nobody has any problem with them not being able to make it! Nobody would have any problem in any case because that's just the way it is sometimes isn't it. My youngest son, on the other hand, has said that he really wants to go as both he and his fiancée have been able to get the Thursday and Friday off. But trying to figure out the best way to get us all to meet up was tricky. Flying in to Liverpool was a non-starter for them so we looked at Manchester and managed to get half-decent priced flights. When I asked my son how he felt about my renting a car at the airport and him driving (on the left) to get to Wales he said he didn't feel too bad about that part but he was worried about changing gears with his left hand so could he maybe get an automatic! And then, bless him, he wanted to know what paperwork he would have to show at the border! Which border? He meant the England/Wales border! Ah, that's sweet! It never occurred to me that he wouldn't know that there is no physical border between the two countries, no customs, no border crossing and so on. But then, he's never been to Wales and has only ever been to family in England so why should he think it would be any different from here where we cross the Swiss/French border constantly!Anyway, in the end we decided that they would get the train to Wales and I would rent a car in Wales that we would use to run around and I would fly back out with them from Manchester, dropping the rental car off at the airport. Phew, that's one thing sorted! Also, since only my brother's oldest son and gf will be staying at his house, the kids and I can stay there too (my credit card is saying \"thank you, thank you, thank you\", as I have paid for the kids' flights too and my credit card is groaning at the moment!). Either way, we could have stayed in Llandudno in a hotel and driven the 10 minutes to Conwy or stayed in Conwy at my brother's where it is just a 10 minute walk into town, so it's a good solution for all of us. Then my friend will pick the three of us up from the airport in Geneva so that cuts out worrying about expensive taxis!As I am slowly getting the hang of this retirement business, I realize I have to make an effort to actually get things done now, whereas before I constantly had my diary in front of me at work and it felt easier to just knock out things on my \"to do\" list. Today's project was to get my train tickets sorted for my trip to Sri Lanka. I will be flying Zurich/Colombo so decided to take the train to Zurich rather than fly but every time I tried to book it it has always been \"too early\". In the meantime, the timings of both my outgoing and incoming flights have changed (slightly) but at least I was able to get the return train tickets booked and printed today. When I arrive back it will be around 8 p.m. in Zurich and as I don't want to run the risk of missing the last flight to Geneva and I don't want to be making a three-hour train journey and arriving in Geneva around midnight I decided I will spend the night at Zurich airport, so more expense (and more groans from my credit card). Oh well, it was all planned for!Also, a friend and I decided that this year we would definitely make the trip to Cinque Terre in Italy. My friend phoned up today and the places are booking up fast! In fact, the single rooms have all gone so we dashed down there and booked a double room with twin beds - just hope she can cope with my snoring as I could honestly snore for Britain! Anyway, that's done, (the trip is in April) and while we were at it we paid for our next day trip (in May) to the market in Turin! So all done. These are bus trips (I reckon six hours to Cinque Terre) so not as expensive as you might imagine but needing to be booked sooner rather than later.Cinque TerreActually they have quite a few nice looking trips that we will consider later in the year. I know, I know, we're becoming little old ladies with our bus trips, but while I don't mind driving, I guess, like most people, I'm not too keen on driving round major European cities looking for parking spaces/hotels!And finally, I have been very good about exercising recently and managed seven for seven last week. Then on Sunday we got very heavy rain/snow so I took a break, but am hoping to get back on the bandwagon again soon. We'll see how that works won't we! It seems like I already have so many things planned (weekly as well as one-off) I think I might need to hire a PA - oh that's right, I was one! So onwards and upwards then!"},
{"title": "You win some, you lose some!", "date": "Friday 25 January 2019", "text": "Or I guess this post could be titled \"the pluses and minuses of retirement\" - kinda! Well so far I'm finding that I'm going to bed late - around 12 or 12.30 and consequently not getting up until 8 or 8.30. I had hoped to start getting up earlier than that but at the moment this seems to be my natural rhythm! Oh well, I guess I was never meant to be a lark was I! On the plus side, I am keeping up with some form of exercise most days. Yesterday I went with my friend to an exercise group which takes place in Geneva on Thursday afternoons. I had thought it was a hiking group but in fact it is more of a \"keep fit\" all year round group. There were about 30 of us and I would guess only five of us were under 70, but by gosh these people were fit! We started off warming up on the track, either running or walking - you can imagine which group I joined - and then they had us doing warm-up exercises for about 15 minutes before setting off on a walk up into the woods behind the sports centre. About 15 of them set off running and the rest of us chose to walk it. The walk wasn't difficult but what was tricky was knowing what to wear! You see, it had snowed heavily the night before and it was bloody freezing that day so I put on a rather heavy winter jacket. But as soon as we set off walking I obviously warmed up and my jacket became uncomfortably hot and heavy. Then when we got back we did some stretching exercises and the chill began to set in. Which makes me think, when I head back to the UK next Sunday I will stop in at the sporting goods shop to check out what they have by way of lightweight winter wear. You can get it all here of course but everything is so much cheaper in Britain! With my trip to Sri Lanka in mind I have also bought a lightweight \"sleeping bag\" to sleep in at the hotels and a microlight towel. I have never really bothered much about hotels as long as my bed is clean but my friend was telling me she always takes an old single duvet cover to sleep in and then leaves it behind when she goes to places where the accommodation is not exactly 4-5 star! I didn't want to pack something that might be heavy so I ordered the kind of lightweight sleeping bag that you would use in a Youth Hostel and it really weighs just a matter of ounces! (Note to self, I was a member of the Youth Hostel Association until I was about 50 so who knows, when I decide I want to travel round Britain again I might take up youth hostelling again. Why not, the hostels are rather nice nowadays and pretty much always in lovely locations)!Anyway, back to the exercise group. While I was walking through the woods I started chatting to a rather nice Swiss lady and as we chatted an absolute \"bullet\" of a little lady went running past us at full tilt! My new friend pointed out that \"bullet lady\" was over 80 years old. She had a full head of thick hair, a great figure and would have put a greyhound to shame! I want to be her when I grow up! Actually, most of these people were very fit - I suppose they had been doing this all their lives and it certainly showed! So while the weather was pretty rotten, my friend explained that this group meets every week come rain or shine, so I will sign up (and pay up) next week and keep plugging away.Yesterday's snowfallThen today, after coming back from shopping, I took myself off for another local walk. My friend had told me about a route round our little village but I'm pretty sure I took the wrong path and ended up half way up the mountain behind my house. I didn't mind the walking as the weather was beautiful but around 4.30 p.m. the sun starts to go behind the mountain and it becomes colder and darker, so I decided to double back before it got too dark and cold. In the meantime, I managed to get some nice pictures from further up the mountain behind me.Stopping to chat to these lovelies was just an excuse to catch my breath really!I love this pretty chalet just up behind my house!Another thing I wanted to do when I quit work was start experimenting in the kitchen again since I have always liked cooking. I had seen a recipe for \"sopa seca\" (dry soup) so thought I would have a shot at that. I didn't have the fine pasta that it called for but I had some Swiss spaetzli that I wanted to use up so threw that in. Maybe I should have stuck with the recipe but I would give my version maybe six out of ten! Either way I ate it! Then when I went shopping last week I bought some unsweetened almond milk - berrrkkkk! So I was looking for a recipe that would use that up plus a second bag of spinach I had in the freezer, when lo and behold up popped a recipe for \"creamy spinach soup\" which called for almond milk! Bingo! Or not, as the case may be. Yuck, you could taste the almond milk throughout so I sprinkled liberal amounts of soy sauce into it and ate it for dinner tonight. I will definitely finish it but I will definitely not be making that recipe again! In fact, I will be avoiding the supermarket aisle with the almond milk in it all together!And finally, we now have a date for my brother's funeral. Friday, 8th February. These things take a long time to set up in the UK so I knew I had time to come back home beforehand. I had wanted to fly to Dorset next Monday but when I checked out EasyJet they wanted 200 Swiss francs one way, without the luggage (that's about $210) and I wasn't paying that! So I got a flight out on the Sunday into Bournemouth, where I will be staying with my sister and we will all drive up to Wales on the Thursday before the funeral. My return flight will depend on whether or not my youngest son can fly out (and that depends on whether or not he can get time off). If he can make it I will probably fly out from Liverpool with him after the funeral. If not, I may well drive back down to Dorset with my sister and her husband and fly out from Bournemouth. We can work that out later I guess!"},
{"title": "A semblance of normality!", "date": "Wednesday 23 January 2019", "text": "Well more than just my usual normality actually, it's better than my \"normal\". Since getting back from Wales I have been trying to get into some kind of routine to find out what being retired actually feels like. So on Sunday and Monday I forced myself off the sofa to go out walking as the weather was absolutely gorgeous. Freezing cold - but I never mind the cold - with bright sunshine. And of course, being out in the fresh air blew away all the cobwebs and allowed me time to just daydream and think. Then Monday evening it was back to my weekly sewing club where I am now Madame la Présidente! I have to admit that I like routine, with maybe just the occasional \"blips\" like holidays and outings (though certainly not deaths), but generally, as I say, I like routine. I was a little scared what retirement and lack of routine would feel like so I knew that I would have to get a routine established pretty quickly. The other side of that coin, of course, is being careful not to sign up to too many activities where I would overcommit myself as I don't want to go down that road either.Before Christmas I had spoken with a lady at my sewing club about a local yoga class that she attends in the next village. Before I quit work I tended to do things in Geneva as there are lots of well organized opportunities, but Geneva is very expensive and I knew I didn't want to get into a new routine of driving into Geneva all the time - that's what I was getting away from by retiring right! Anyway, I had planned to go with Geneviève to this Tuesday afternoon yoga class (now I'm a little old lady I won't be wanting to drive in the dark right?) but of course having to dash off to Wales meant that I missed the first two classes. Anyway, I went yesterday and I reckon I was the youngest one there by about 15 years!!! To my taste it could have been a little bit more dynamic but either way it was great! The young teacher had us doing loads of exercises aimed specifically at the spine and the neck and I tell ya, after that 90 minute class I came out of there like Raggedy Anne - all wobbly and glowing! So I will definitely be going back. But just to put me right in my place about those \"little old ladies\", the group organizer gave me a flyer for a snow-shoe outing that they were all going on on 29 January and \"would I like to join them\"? Put me in my place why don't you! I have never snow-shoed or cross country skied, although I used to do downhill (very badly) many moons ago. Who knows, I  have even given some thought to getting back to that too. So there you go, never judge a book by its cover, nor little old ladies by their ability (or otherwise) to put their legs behind their heads - these old ducks are going snow-shoeing next week!Actually, my first aim is to get fit(ter) as I am woefully out of shape. The stupid thing is I always loved sport as a young woman but I guess like most of us marriage, kids, jobs, commutes and so on meant that these things fell by the wayside. So I decided that Wednesday would be my day to drive into work to use our work's gym. It is very very cheap (about one-tenth of local prices) and well equipped. I like the machines anyway and they only ask that retirees don't use the gym during the busy periods. It (finally) started snowing this morning but I was determined to go so drove in at 1 p.m. so I could get my retiree badge and stop by the office to chat with my former boss. He is a bit worried as the recruitment of my replacement has gone pretty much nowhere so far and, he was told, they were unlikely to have anyone in post before April/May. To be honest it only starts hotting up towards the end of March anyway and really busy in June/July so those dates are doable but I sense he won't rest until he gets someone in that post.So anyway, I spent a rather nice 90 minutes in the (empty) gym and then met some friends for drinks afterwards, thus allowing the rush hour traffic to subside. It felt great not to be sitting in that traffic I can tell you, particularly as it was snowing hard enough for the snow ploughs to be out. I am still on a Facebook feed about local traffic conditions and on Sunday night traffic was apparently at a standstill in the direction Geneva/Chamonix and then on Monday morning the major border into Geneva was also at a complete standstill! I'm so glad I'm out of that it's incredible. I did have a bit of a scare as I was driving into Geneva though as as I was driving on the motorway towards the toll booth I noticed that the hood of my car was juddering and I soon realized that we must not have shut it properly after messing around with the battery when I got a flat battery on 2 January. Obviously having to dash off to Wales and since then just tootling down into town occasionally I hadn't noticed it, but belting along the motorway at 110 km an hour I was just praying that it would hold until I could pull off at the toll and get it locked down. Thankfully I was able to slow right down, pull over and shut it properly - Lord knows what would have happened if it had flown up and left me \"driving blind\" on the motorway!Tomorrow, all being well, I am joining my friend in a hiking group that she was introduced to by another former colleague. Throughout the skiing season they go on local walks, initially around some rather nice spots in Geneva and then, as spring nears, going on hikes further into the mountains, with those that want to either run or ski being free to do so (I don't think I'll be joining either of those two groups just yet!). D said she has always been the youngest and the least fit in the group - time to hand over that mantle to me then I guess! We'll see what the weather is like tomorrow though. If it's still snowing heavily I don't suppose we will go but we have time to make our minds up tomorrow!Regarding my brother's death, my nephew just contacted me to say that they had finally been able to get the death certificate (him being \"selfish\" enough to die late on a Friday afternoon meant they couldn't get the death registered until yesterday). The funeral is on 8 February so I plan to fly back for that, but guess what, yesterday as I was making dinner I looked down and there was a little white feather on my kitchen floor. Very small really, but it hadn't blown in from outside (I had my doors and shutters shut because of the cold and the dark). It may just be baloney but I felt it was a message from my \"guardian angel\" and it made me smile. Thanks Phil!"},
{"title": "RIP my lovely brother!", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2019", "text": "Well as we knew it was going to happen, my brother Phil died on Friday afternoon. I made the decision to fly back on Thursday as I felt his partner, Margaret, and oldest son, Darren, needed to spend some private time with him. And it was the right decision! I got to say my goodbyes while he was still \"with it\", although sleeping a lot. After I left I think he lost the ability to speak and would just doze most of the time, but occasionally open his eyes and smile or give them the thumbs up. Darren and Margaret had been to see him on Friday and had just returned home when they got a call from the hospital to say they might want to get back there quickly as they felt the end was near - and it was. They were with him when he died and I'm sure he knew he was loved - although I'm not sure he will ever know how much!It was cancer of the stomach that killed him in the end and it came on very, very suddenly! He was only taken ill at the beginning of December and after initial tests they thought they might have caught it in time. It turns out that that gave him cruelly false hope as they quickly discovered it was a quick-spreading, very aggressive cancer and there was no hope! When I got to Wales to see him he actually looked a lot better than I expected (terribly thin of course but then there wasn't much of him to begin with). My sister and her husband and other brother drove up from Dorset the same day and we all went to the hospital together. There was some thought that maybe he had just been \"hanging on\" knowing we were coming but as I say, apart from being terribly thin, he was on good form, cracking jokes and being his usual self. We were all there when the doctor came in to talk to him and he gave his permission for us to stay so that we could all hear what was going on. The doctor very gently explained that there was no hope and said that he maybe had a week or two at the most. Then he asked if there was anything else he could do for him and my brother said \"yeah, just one thing. Can you keep me alive till the end of the cricket season!\" The doctor was Italian and I don't think he knew where to put himself but we all burst out laughing - that was my brother to a \"T\", always joking and, I suspect, trying to put us all at ease. In any case, it worked!I went in to see him every day but you could honestly only stay so long as he just wanted to sleep. Still, he was compus mentis right up until the last days and we had time to have a good talk. Margaret and I made the difficult decision to ask him to talk about his final wishes - which he was happy to do - so as she gently questioned him I would write it down word for word. Occasionally they went right off tack and they would start reminiscing! \"Hey Maggie, do you remember that time we went out for dinner and I had that poxy Moroccan tajine and you had four beautiful pieces of sea bass and you wouldn't give me any, you miserable bugger\"! Then off they went in guffaws of laughter! It was really nice to hear and I wrote it all down, with the intention of writing it all up afterwards - which I did, \"poxy Moroccan tajine\" included!He told us what clothes he wanted to wear, what music he wanted and the fact that he wanted his ashes scattered with his late wife's ashes in South Wales, then a few small things that he specifically wanted each son to have. They only have two sons so there will be an easy 50-50 split of assets of course!Then he got on to the subject of where his will was, who he wanted to sell the house and his various bank accounts. One account had quite a substantial amount in it so at this point I put my pen down, took his hand and said \"you do know you've always been my favourite brother don't you\"! He burst out laughing and told me to piss off, so yep, he was still on the ball. He said that I could take anything I wanted from the home and I did indeed take a pretty china teacup and saucer (one of many that my sister-in-law had) as the boys wouldn't want most of it and it would go to charity. I then asked him for a very special item - his egg poacher! You know, the ones that cost £1 from Poundland (I couldn't find one) as I can't for the life of me poach an egg! He just gave me the evil eye and I successfully got that poacher through customs and safely stored in my cupboard now!Armed with this knowledge I typed everything up and had him sign it - with me witnessing it - and then Margaret and I decided to head off to his bank to find out about the administrative formalities his sons would have to complete upon his death, as we knew they would be overwhelmed when the time came! Well believe it or not we walked out of there with a fully paid-up funeral plan (he had the choice of three) and had everything set up for when the time came. I know this might sound a bit ghoulish but we wanted to get as much done as possible and take that burden off the boys. Phil was happy with it all and so signed all the paperwork and as it turns out the boys are greatly relieved. They, of course, get to make final decisions regarding flowers and coffins and so on but the bulk of the admin has already been done and they are so grateful.As I mentioned previously my oldest son and his wife flew out for the weekend. My youngest couldn't as he had just started a new job but Phil was ok with that. Then, quite unexpectedly, my niece showed up from Dorset, driving a total of 15 hours in one day to come up and see him with her family. You see, he really was loved!Actually, Phil was a big kid who never seemed to grow up. Or at least, he always loved kids and was the \"favourite uncle\" who ended up playing water pistols and so on with the little ones - they all loved him. The little grandson from next door used to knock on his door and ask if he wanted to play football and the neighbours also have a video of him playing squirt guns with their granddaughters!My niece's children made him a \"get well soon\" card which showed him playing water pistols with them in the garden.I have a picture of him somewhere \"teaching my two year old to smoke a pipe\". Well he had Jordan toddling around Annecy with Phil's pork pie hat on his head and (unlit) pipe in his mouth. I'm not sure everyone would have approved but that photo is hilarious (and - no thanks to Phil - Jordan has never smoked!). I just hope that photo shows up some day!Stuffing grass down my oldest's back!Once we got our tears out the way we all started telling the stupid stories of \"do you remember when ….\". His son said he remembered one day walking through a muddy field with his mom and dad and Phil was going to show the boys how to jump over a muddy puddle. Which he did. Only thing is, his shoe got stuck in the mud on take off and he landed in the mud on the other side in his bare feet, with them giggling so hard his mom almost peed herself. And another time when they had been travelling by car and Phil had wound the window down because it was too hot. Then he turned to his wife and they got chatting away while driving along and he decided he was done with his coffee so pitched the dregs out the window - only he forgot he had just wound the window back up and he ended up with coffee dregs all over him. Cue more subdued giggling from the back of the car!So I pitched in how my family had all driven down to the west coast of France and we drove over from the east of France to spend a 10 day camping holiday together. One day we decided to walk into town to get some groceries, but it was scorching hot and we had to wade through the sand to get to the supermarket. It was bloody hard going I can tell you, so we were all aghast when dingbat (Phil) showed up at the check-out with the most enormous watermelon which he insisted we had to have - so we made him carry that thing all across the sand dunes back to the camp site. Turns out he sank so much into the sand that he burned his ankles. My niece, Rachel, actually posted the following in-joke on Facebook!A photo of Rachel and Phil on that holiday!Phil was naturally devastated when his wife died suddenly three years ago. We all were, but none more so than him of course, but weirdly he was desperate not to die on 18 January - the anniversary of her death. Hopefully he didn't realize that he did indeed die on that day!Phil with his wife, BrendaSo meeting Margaret 18 months after her death was, as he put it, an added bonus that he never expected. And they made each other so happy. Margaret has been an absolute rock since he became ill, moving into his house to take care of him and visiting him every day while he was in hospital. Yesterday she drove Darren into Llandudno to show him where he will have to register the death and then, I believe, she will finally go back to her own home 150 km away to try to get some rest.Phil and MargaretAs I was waiting for my train to Manchester in order to fly home on Thursday a seagull came wandering brazenly up to me. I tell you, those buggers are massive. So massive in fact that, as Lee Evans said, they've even got bloody tattoos on their legs! So I took a picture of him - Phil would have liked that!We both believe in the after life and he promised me he would be sending out white feathers, the symbol of your guardian angel, when he was strong enough to do so. But he made it quite clear that we wouldn't find them outside - he would be putting them inside so we could be sure it was from him!I'm so glad I got to say my goodbyes Phil. You were brave to the end. I love you and miss you as one should miss a brother of course, but what I will really miss is our conversations because you were such an interesting, well-read man. Oh and I will miss your lousy jokes too. Love you so much. Until we meet again on the other side! Love from your little sis!"},

{"title": "Family!", "date": "Wednesday 16 January 2019", "text": "Isn't it great when family all pull together! I know we have our differences but geez when it works it's great! I've been schlepping round with my brother's partner trying to sort as much as possible for my nephews ahead of my brother's death. Got the funeral sorted according to his wishes, paid for, sorted out the bank accounts (what needs to be done as and when), including phone numbers, got all the info for the solicitor who will handle the will, the estate agent who will sell the house. Can't do much more to be honest. Then my kids flew out from Switzerland for an uncle they barely know really and we are all \"family\" again. On top of that my brother's youngest son in the Midlands called my sister in Dorset who called my aunt in Wales who called her son down the road - who will be picking up my brother's oldest son at the train station in about 30 minutes and taking him direct to the hospital! I hadn't seen this cousin of mine (the \"pick-up guy) for probably 35 years until my sister-in-law died three years ago and here he is picking up my brother's son to take him to the hospital. It's a circuitous family circle but isn't it lovely when everyone pulls together! I know I would do it for anyone but to have it reciprocated is so very comforting isn't it!I've been in North Wales (Conwy specifically) since last Tuesday when I flew out to see my brother, who has been hospitalized since around 27 December. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach so I knew I had to get here quickly. What a shock that was as he only fell ill about six weeks ago! Anyway, I have been to see him and will (possibly) post more about him in another post, but I wanted to write a little about my stay in North Wales apart from as it pertains to my brother's health, because it has brought back so many memories!My mom was from Betws-y-Coed (the chapel in the woods in Welsh) so I spent most of my summers staying in Betws as a little girl, and then working in my aunt's café on the quayside in Conwy after that. The first thing that strikes me is how pretty and green it is (all that rain you see), how many sheep there are (they are everywhere), and how lovely I find the Welsh language, which is now compulsory in Welsh schools. Truth be told it is probably closer to French than English and I just love that lilt!I have been staying at my brother's house in Conwy. My brother's partner, Margaret, has been staying here since he became ill and for the first few days his oldest son, D, was also here. For D it is the ultimate struggle that we all have when we are still working, trying to get over to Conwy from Manchester (he doesn't drive), be there for his dad and also keep up with his work. To say it is stressful for him would be an understatement! Anyway, I arrived in Conwy by train and yet again it never ceases to amaze me how beautiful North Wales is.This photo could have been taken from the back of my aunt's café (now a fish and chip shop)!Conwy CastleMy sister, her husband and my other brother drove up from Dorset and after heading out to the hospital to see my brother we all ended up meeting up in Llandudno, where they were staying, to have dinner. Llandudno is also very beautiful with very gentile properties lining the long promenade. It was here that Lewis Carroll made his home for a time, I believe, and there are many, many statues throughout Llandudno paying tribute to his Alice in Wonderland characters!The Grand Hotel - where my family stayedThe Mad HatterThe promenade at LlandudnoMy oldest son and his wife flew out for the weekend to see my brother (which he really appreciated) and took a trip up the Great Orme after their hospital visit - they told me it was beautiful! And to think in all the years I have visited Llandudno I have never been up there!Great OrmeAnother day after visiting my brother (he couldn't take too many visitors or for too long) we took a trip out to Betws-y-Coed as I wanted my son to see my grandmother's B&B (they loved it)!My gran's place - Bod HyfrydBetws train stationPont-y-Pair bridgeWhen the salmon are spawning they leap over the huge rocks at Pont-y-Pair bridge to try to get upstream. It is fascinating! Another time after the hospital we decided to eat in Conwy and ended up taking a walk on a very windy quayside to visit the \"smallest house in Great Britain\". My daughter-in-law, Lily, who is Swiss, just loved it and they have both decided that they are going to take a road trip round Wales at the earliest opportunity.The smallest house in Great BritainI apologize for not being so up-to-date on my blog reading/commenting but this week has been a bit intense, to be honest. It felt sad to be seeing all these lovely things without my brother, who is indeed terminal, but he could only take so much \"visiting\" at any one time. But we at least had time to create some good memories with him, I got to tell him how much I loved him, and he has promised to \"come back and visit\" from the other side as we both believe in the after life! I will write more about him in my next post."},
{"title": "Friends!", "date": "Monday 7 January 2019", "text": "Isn't it funny how kind people can be! I don't know but I never expect anything and then when people show how kind they can be it always surprises me. Not making much sense am I! I'm not sure I know how to explain this but I am a bit of a loner. I don't even know if I have always been this way or if my god-awful marriage made me that way. I mean, if you keep people out they can't hurt you can they! For me being divorced I'm adamant that I will never live with someone again and I will definitely never get married again and that, in a way, makes me sad as there are so many good people out there. I just don't think I can take that constant, chaotic, brain-destroying crap again. Anyway that's my choice and I at least have the possibility to make that decision.  I know you should never say \"never again\" but I'm pretty sure that's it for me. That being said, it's been kind of weird this past week or so how friends just seem to have appeared out of nowhere!When I went to Sicily in September I palled up with a lady called Carol. On these \"solos\" holidays you always seem to hit it off with someone (in my case usually the first person at the bar I guess) but Carol has called me a couple of times and I have enjoyed chatting with her. I told her to let me get my Sri Lanka trip out of the way and my son's civil wedding in March and then she was more than welcome to come out here and stay with me. Now she lives near Gatwick airport and has told me I am more than welcome at her place any time. So another thing on my bucket list!Then yesterday I got a message from Karon who I had met in St. Lucia two years ago. We hit it off like nobody's business but of course when you don't live in the same country and don't see each other regularly things tend to fade. She asked me if I had ever done a solo trip but not through a solos organization. Well I'm not sure what she meant exactly but I told her I had done one totally solo trip to Morocco but that I didn't enjoy it that much as I like company. I was in Marrakech, which I loved but also travelled to the Atlas mountains, where those two young Scandinavian girls had recently been murdered!!! So, for myself, while I love my trips, I enjoy them more when I have company. I don't have to know anyone ahead of time - I just want to be sure that I won't be alone. In fact Costa Rica this year was with a travel group that wasn't solos-oriented but there were only six of us on the trip and it was a blast! Anyway, Karon and I decided that we should get together.  I invited her out here and she said if I wanted to come \"her way\" I would be  more than welcome and maybe we could invite Mo. It was weird really because after that trip I know six of them went off to Spain together and I told her that while I liked everyone on that trip it was only her and Mo that I would like to keep in touch with. So you know what, I hope she does come out here and I will definitely make the effort to spend more time in the UK and catch up with her and Mo.Then back in 2010, after my husband had buggered off, I met Brian on my first solos trip and we have stayed in touch ever since 2010. Actually he has been out here twice and never, ever forgets my birthday and always sends me a Christmas card. He is an absolute gent. There was nothing \"untoward\" in that relationship, just another good friendship! Then I met Steve on my trip to Peru and we have stayed friends ever since. He, also, has been out here twice and I stayed with him in August of 2018. Maybe there is something wrong with me - why do I have to go finding friends so far away? Well actually I'm not totally anti-social to be honest but I guess, over time, I do crave the Brit sense of humour and so tend to look that way for friendship, although I have dear, dear friends here in France of course! I guess the problem is (a) the language, although I am fluent in French of course, but (b) I really, really love the British sense of humour. It is so totally different to the French (or any other sense of humour I guess)! Not better or worse, just different! Anyway, on our first night in Lima an ambulance went past and somebody cracked the \"Eric Morecambe\" joke and we all roared laughing!Then yesterday I got a message from Marilyn, a dear friend from ages ago. We met when my ex and I moved into France in 1990. Marilyn is American and her husband was French so we instantly hit it off. Our kids were about the same age so we used to go skiing together and socialize. About 20 years ago they moved down to Chambéry and from there on to the US where her husband had been head-hunted. Only problem was, the day the moving company showed up to pack their stuff, Philippe was told that his job offer was rescinded! It was a cut-throat business and par for the course I guess. So that left her with a French husband already installed in the US without a green card but relying on his job to get one. She was a stay-at-home mom so not much use in that direction. So no green card, no medical insurance and what the hell do you do next!!!! In the end Philippe got another job, Marilyn also, and they made it but the stress must have been horrendous. Sadly Philippe got sick, ended up having a liver transplant, had a heart attack, I believe, and died about five years ago. In the meantime, her daughter married and moved to London and her son was transferred to Cork in Ireland so, as a newly-minted French national, she followed her son out to Ireland. She's not particularly happy there. \"If you like baked beans you're well set\" as while the people are lovely it's not exactly Dublin is it! Anyway she got in touch with me yesterday and we are going to meet up. Either I will go to Ireland or she will come here. So I guess I do make friends really, just not exactly \"pop next door type\"!And finally, my friend and I finally got to see Bohemian Rhapsody yesterday. I wanted to wait a few weeks (four I think) after it came out so it wouldn't be so crowded but yet again the cinema was virtually full! To say we loved it would be an understatement! At one point I became aware of C blubbing and had to go fishing for paper hankies in my bag as he was starting to drip. But by gosh that was a lovely film. I really hope Rami Malek wins an oscar for his performance (the buck teeth not withstanding) as he was brilliant. Actually I can't believe he is 37 - he looks about 17 - but I saw him interviewed on the Graham Norton show and what a lovely young man he is! Good luck Rami!"},
{"title": "Have to dash to North Wales!", "date": "Saturday 5 January 2019", "text": "Well I guess it was the news we were all dreading but my brother has been confirmed as having terminal cancer, with maybe between one and three months to live! I spoke to my nephew yesterday and he said one month would be generous in his opinion. My brother has lost so much weight that his legs can no longer support his weight to go to the bathroom, and there wasn't much of him to begin with. So I have booked a flight to Liverpool on Tuesday where my nephew will meet me and we will catch the train to Conwy. At the moment Phil is in Bangor Hospital but they are hoping to move him shortly to St. David's Hospice in Llandudno. My sister, her husband and my other brother are driving up there on Tuesday also so hopefully Phil will hang on. He's not in pain, which is a blessing. I guess they have him so drugged up. He is still lucid but \"drifts\" a little now. Oh my gosh, I'm in such shock. I know people get old, people get sick and even young people get sick and die and life isn't fair. But it's just the shock of how fast this has happened that has knocked me for six. He has never been ill and never been to hospital. He used to work in the fish market as a young man in Birmingham's Bull Ring market when it was still outdoors and I guess that made him pretty sturdy - working outside in all weathers with his hands in the freezing ice! Who knows! My daughter-in-law said that it's sad that so many - men in particular - never go for a check-up, but while women kinda have to go for various check-ups, Phil had never been ill so had no reason to go for one I guess. Either way it's too late now. As I said, my shock stems from the fact that he only got sick mid-December so we're looking at about five weeks now!My youngest son and gf can't go because they have both started new jobs (well Jen starts a new job on Monday in fact). That's ok by all of us as we believe what counts is how you treat people when they are alive and not when they are dying. My oldest son and his wife are hoping to fly in next weekend to see him so that will be nice for most of the family to be together. I contacted Steve to let him know yesterday and he said after my initial visit with my brother to let him know and he will drive down from Southport to meet up. It's only about an hour away and I was hoping to go and see Steve before he goes in for his bone marrow transplant. That is planned for mid-February, I think, and since he is off the chemo I don't feel nervous about being around him so much since I know he has to steer clear of crowds and their germs!My brother's lady friend, Margaret, has been an absolute rock and is staying at his place in order to visit him every day. She lives about 120 miles away so that is the best solution for everyone. I will stay at my brother's place since I am on my own and there is a spare bed there, but I will happily sleep on the floor if necessary or get a B&B. It doesn't matter to me either way, but my nephew thought it would be a good idea for me to keep Margaret company. We have never met in person as yet - kind of a sad way to meet up for the first time isn't it! Phil and Margaret had booked a holiday to Cyprus for February and were planning on coming out to me after that for a long week-end. She will still be welcome of couse but …. All I can say is I have never seen my brother as happy as he has been these last two years with her and for that we can never thank her enough!The only saving grace in all this is as I am retired I don't have to worry about work! Thank God! My nephew is flitting back and forth between his work in Manchester and his dad in Conwy. His work have been very good, apparently, but it is always a worry. I have only booked a one-way ticket at this point but will take the lie of the land after I see my brother.I felt a bit weepy yesterday, although, as always, I don't seem able to cry. So in the end I put my big girl's knickers on and took myself off for a walk. Felt much better for it afterwards of course. I took the route I took previously through the grounds of the Eglise de la Bénite Fontaine (the Church of the Blessed Fountain) so I thought I would stop and fill my water bottle with holy water. Now I don't know what good me drinking holy water would do for my brother but it was strangely comforting.  I don't know if I will be able to post much for a while but I aim on taking my laptop with me as I still have a ton of stuff to sort out from my retirement and I suspect there will be a few quiet hours too.  So for the time being, I will sign off.The view of the Mont Blanc from my walk - so comforting and peaceful!Phil and me at les Confins, May 2017"},
{"title": "Sod's law!", "date": "Wednesday 2 January 2019", "text": "If I had been returning to work, today would have been my first day back. Just as well I wasn't then eh because when I went out this morning to get into my car the battery didn't even attempt a splutter. It was so stone cold dead I think rigor mortis had already set in! Bloody hell, can you imagine, first day back and I have to call my boss and say \"you'll never believe what's happened now\"! I was routinely late most days due to traffic, and no, you could never get ahead of it by leaving 30 minutes earlier and 30 minutes earlier again - the traffic was always bloody atrocious! We had flexible-ish hours, thank God, but I just never made it in at the time I was aiming for. Don't get me wrong, I never minded staying later if necessary either because it's swings and round abouts isn't it, but when my bloody car wouldn't start this morning I could have cried. It had only been one day where I hadn't driven it so as far as I was concerned it should have been ok but there was nothing doing. My neighbour saw me getting out my charger and hooking it up to the electric but two hours later it hadn't moved. In the meantime he went and got his charger to see if that made any difference but no doing! Then he managed to drive up on my front garden to get level with my car and we tried jumping it but nope, still no doing!Thankfully I am a member of the Touring Club Suisse (like the British RAC or the American AAA) and always have been. Thankfully, also, I always keep my subscription up-to-date and had recently renewed it effective 1 January - only to need to use it on 2 January! So I called the TCS and explained to the lady that I would need a tow truck but not necessarily this evening as my car was in my driveway and I wasn't going anywhere. She said somebody would call me within 10 minutes so I waited and waited and at about 30 minutes I wondered what was happening - when just then there was a knock at the door and there was my knight in shining armour with his trusty tow truck! It took him all of about 10 minutes to jump my battery with his powerful truck-grade battery - phew, that was a relief. You know how your mind immediately goes \"oh bugger, I'm going to need a new car and I've just left a good job\" (or is that just me?) but once I get my thoughts together I know I can sort everything out - I just didn't particularly want to sort it out tonight in the freezing cold. In the meantime, I had been calling Ford repeatedly and their answering machine kept telling me that all their lines were busy. In the end, knowing their small garage well, I figured they were still on Christmas vacation and hadn't gotten round to changing their answering machine message, which turned out to be correct, as later confirmed by the tow truck driver. That being the case, I then called a local franchise garage, Norauto, who were open and dashed down there with just one hour to spare before closing time. They were brilliant, got my car in and the battery changed all within the space of 40 minutes and with a smile too - that's not something you get every day! But credit where credit is due, I posted my thanks on the FB page of both the TCS and Norauto giving credit for their efficiency!I did have plans to drop in at work today to exchange my badge for a retiree badge, pay for next year's subscription to the work's gym and then head off out to the computer shop to buy a cable I needed before meeting my friend to go and see Bohemian Rhapsody! As you can imagine that all went tits up (forgive my French) but at least my car is sorted!And then this evening on my FB feed someone had posted the following photo of an accident on the motorway where I would have needed to pass on my way home. So first day back and I would have been stuck in another accident! Damn, the relief that I am retired is tangible!"},
{"title": "Health!", "date": "Monday 31 December 2018", "text": "I suspect most of us take it for granted … that is, until we lose it don't we! I know I certainly do. But sometimes life has a way of giving you a kick in the butt to make you sit up and take note! My eldest brother was taken violently ill about three weeks ago, totally out of the blue, with horrendous stomach pains and severe vomiting. He couldn't even make it up the stairs! His lady friend drove up from her home about 120 miles away to be with him and he was in hospital last week having a camera put down his throat. They were talking cancer but also the possibility of an ulcer and were awaiting the results later this week. I spoke to him last week and he looked pretty good, but then yesterday when I called he had been unwell again and didn't look too great, having lost 20 lbs in three weeks - and there wasn't much of him to begin with! Well this afternoon I got a message from my sister to say that he had been taken to hospital, in incredible pain and vomiting \"black stuff\". Ever since his lady friend, M, had arrived she has been taking care of him, picking up his prescriptions and trying to get him to eat but he was up constantly every night vomiting and she made the decision to call the ambulance today. They have confirmed that it is indeed cancer but are not sure whether they have caught it early or whether it has spread! They will know more later when all the test results are in! Bloody hell, what a shock. Whatever happens, he is in the best place he can be both for himself and for poor M who has been through the wringer for him! I just sent her a message to thank her for everything she has done for my brother and she was really moved. You see, they got together about two years after my brother's wife died and while the oldest son is perfectly fine with their relationship the younger one (who is 50) is, to be blunt, being an absolute twat! He has been rude to M from the beginning and it is now getting worse. He should be ashamed of himself after all that woman has done for his dad! And to be honest, I have never seen my brother as happy as he has been these past two years. She is a good woman and son number two needs to grow up! Anyway, we are keeping our fingers and toes crossed that the outcome will be treatable!On a slightly happier note, I spoke to Steve yesterday for the first time in 10 days and he looks really good. He has had his last round of chemo (for the time being) and is slowly getting his strength back. He was already bald so the chemo didn't affect that but he shaved his beard off and so far it hasn't come back and those hairy Polish arms of his are somewhat less hairy but otherwise he is doing well. He has been to the hospital and they are looking at a bone marrow transplant in February followed by four to five weeks in isolation. But he's getting there and very positive! It did get me thinking, though, that thank God they live in the UK. When I hear people from other countries worrying about medical insurance and co-pays I can only thank God for the NHS. Neither of them will get any kind of bill for their treatment - I know this \"free\" treatment is paid for out of taxes but I, for one, think that that is the way it should be everywhere. Not living in the UK, I'm very lucky that I have excellent, worldwide medical coverage through my employer (even in retirement) as prices for medical treatment in Switzerland are horrendously high. But again, thank God for the NHS and the foresight of Aneurin Bevan who founded it in 1948!And just tonight I hear that \"little\" Jimmy Osmond has just had a stroke at the age of 55. His second, apparently. He was appearing in theatre at the Birmingham Hippodrome and felt unwell, but being the supreme professional that he obviously is he finished his performance, signed some autographs and was then taken to hospital. God speed Jimmy!And talking of \"health\" I thought my own puny efforts at getting fit/losing some weight had fallen at the first hurdle today as I made the mistake of plonking myself down to read and I don't remember getting up again. Despite the beautiful weather I talked myself out of going for a walk (I know, I know) buuuuuut around 4 o'clock I metaphorically gave myself a kick in the butt and decided to do Jane Fonda's workout. Yep, I still have the tapes. Tapes, can you believe it! I used to do her workouts many moons ago and eventually found even the advanced tape easy, but now!!!! Well let's just say a few years and a few (ok, many) pounds heavier I knew it wouldn't be pretty. And it wasn't! But I did it. The beginner's tape is about 35 minutes long but I knew I would feel so much better afterwards (I had been getting back and neck ache from lack of exercise). But by golly, the shoulder stand at the end! If you really want to see how much blubber you have on your belly try to get yourself into a shoulder stand! I tell you the weight of my boobs and my belly almost suffocated me! Like I say, it wasn't pretty but I did it. And I hope hearing about other people's health problems will be the catalyst to make me get serious about getting fit this time. You can't take your health for granted forever!I definitely didn't look like this!"},
{"title": "Two for two!", "date": "Sunday 30 December 2018", "text": "I guess I shouldn't be bragging but I actually went out walking again today so that's 2 for 2!!!! Only another 363 times and I will  have a complete year of exercising! Ha! But seriously, the weather is so glorious at the moment - like early spring in fact - that I decided to set out once again around noon to do another short walk near my home. This time it took me an hour and I clocked up 5,300 steps so an improvement over yesterday. There is another, similar, walk to this one that I might venture out on tomorrow called the Bois de Fournet and that will certainly clock up a few more steps. I was a bit apprehensive as these walks go through some local woods where in previous years there have been tents and so on - obviously either a homeless camp or (more likely, according to the neighbours) a druggie set up, but either way it was broad daylight and there was nothing there when I went through. It's kinda sad though isn't it that, particularly as a woman, you have to be aware of your surroundings like that!Anyway, I set off around noon and decided to take a few pictures as I went. I mentioned in a previous post my Nigerian friend, Stan, who used to have a little bar near the railway lines. That is now over as Stan has retired but he hasn't gotten around to getting rid of the \"portacafé\" yet. Stan's place has been sorely missed though as there is only one restaurant in the village which, while very good, is not open all that often and it doesn't have the same feel as Stan's place. Apparently they are going to build a café/bar in the village \"sometime\" but when that will be who knows!A (perfectly legal) eau de vie still!As I got near to Stan's place I saw that they had set up the \"roving still\" to make \"alcohol de noix\" or walnut alcohol (eau de vie I guess). They come around just once a year, collect the walnuts and then produce and sell their eau de vie locally. I believe, sadly, it's a dying tradition because, if I remember right, this tradition can no longer be passed on from father to son so will die out soon enough. I hope I'm wrong as it would be a shame to lose this skill (and the booze)!\"Chez Stan\"As I walked on further past Stan's I turned around as the clouds parted and (hopefully) got a really pretty view of our village!From there I walked on through the woods to the Bénite Fontaine church (the church of the blessed fountain) where there is a spring water fountain where people come and fill up their bottles with \"holy\" water (a bit like Lourdes I guess, or at the very least like Evian which, while not holy, is renowned spring water). Actually the little area where I live is called \"Les Champs de Chant\" or fields of song in English. Originally I thought it must be because of the bird song but in fact it is because there are so many underground mountain springs that they \"sing\" as they run through the fields! Either way, our tap water is untreated, which means we can't sell it on to the local town when we have an excess, but which also means that we have beautifully sweet, untreated tap water!The spring where people fill up their bottlesThe church of la Bénite FontaineAfter that I headed back towards home. I think the entrance to our village is really pretty but have never been able to get a decent picture of it because I can't exactly slam my brakes on and stop the car in the middle of the road. This time, however, I was on foot so decided to take a few pictures as the weather was perfect. They were only taken on my phone but they're not bad are they!A view of the church. The spire on the right is the chateau where my son is getting married in July.So yep, that's two for two so far in the exercise campaign! But we'll see how the rest of the year goes though won't we!In other news, I don't think the book I read was called \"Eat the Frog\" but the principle of \"eating the frog\" was enshrined in there somewhere. Basically it means if the worst thing you have to do at any given time is eat a live frog (not a dead one - that would be too easy here in France) then do that first and everything after that will seem easy. And it's true! How many of us keep putting off the \"hard\" stuff because we can't be bothered with the hassle!  Well that was true for me so I determined that today's frog would be to get my bloody visa for my trip to Sri Lanka in March! I had already tried numerous times and their damn site kept crashing so I thought rather than get riled up, leave it a few days and make that the frog for today. And guess what, it's done! I have no idea why it went through this time but I seem to have learned that it's better to walk away when I get frustrated and come back to it another day! I also sent off an email to the travel agents asking them to book my transfers to and from Colombo airport since I will be making my own way to Sri Lanka direct from Switzerland rather than flying back to the UK in order to fly out again.And finally, sometimes I think if I had half a brain I would be dangerous! Frog number two for today was \"get the bloody dead light bulbs changed\"! In my TV area I have eight inset lights, two of which had blown and then a third went last week! But changing these light bulbs meant dragging heavy stepladders up and fiddling about with inset lighting. So I decided I would do just one today. That's all! So I hauled the stepladders upstairs and set about pulling the light fitting down (after turning off the electricity of course) and within five minutes it was changed! No sweating, no swearing, no hassle! But then, when I looked at the other two \"dead\" light bulbs it occurred to me that they weren't dead at all, they were just on another switch! Hence the expression \"if I had half a brain I would be dangerous\"! You live and learn I guess!"},
{"title": "Yikes!", "date": "Saturday 29 December 2018", "text": "At the moment I'm not getting up as early as I would like yet (early days, early days) as I just don't seem able to go to bed much before 1 or 2 a.m. so I'm getting up around 9 a.m. - I'll have to get that sorted soon as I don't want to be getting up so late as a general rule, even if I am a night owl by nature! On a normal weekend I get up and have breakfast while sitting and reading the news but I know I'm going to have to make sure I don't start blog-hopping immediately after as that is death to any possibility of being productive. So this morning I determined that at least one trip to the tip/recycling centre was in order if I'm going to get a handle on this decluttering malarkey. With that in mind, I loaded up the garden clippings from yesterday's foray into trying to put my garden to bed then, in a fit of inspiration, dashed downstairs and dragged two very old suitcases up and threw them in the car to take to the tip also. There was nothing wrong with them but they are at least 30 years old and have seen better days. I hate throwing things away but I hate them cluttering up my home even more. The good thing, though, is that I always see people going round the tip looking to see what they can take so if anything is even halfway decent I leave it next to the bin rather than throw it in. For the first time in all the years I have lived here I noticed they also had a clothes recycling bin there, which is good because when I took a bag down to our local clothes bin a couple of days ago it was so full I couldn't get my bag into it. I suspect the bin at the recycling centre will be emptied more frequently. One of my foibles is that when I decide something has to go, it has to go now, so that I have no chance of changing my mind, so if I can get stuff down to the tip the same day it will be very positive! I also have a bag of 5-6 winter coats to get rid of but I will be taking them down to the food bank when it opens in a few days' time. They are only open to clients on a Tuesday evening and, unfortunately, this year, both Christmas and New Year's day fall on a Tuesday so I'm not sure they will be open before the week of 7 January. It's a strange feeling getting rid of even just one bag don't you think, as there is an immediate feeling of \"lightness\" just to get one thing out of the door. Well there is for me at least. It doesn't last that long but a good feeling nonetheless.After my trip to the tip and the post office  I tootled off to my little local market for a few things then headed back home. It was about noon when I got home and I suddenly had this flash of inspiration. Why wait until 1 January to start exercising again. Why not just start now! I know, inspired right! But these past couple of months I haven't been exercising at all, whether it be walking or going to the gym, and I have really missed it. Well my body has! I guess the excuses were pretty good - too busy with meetings, too much to do with getting ready to retire, too many parties to go to, and so on, but in the end they were all still excuses weren't they!So I decided that as it was dry and still light, now would be as good a time as any to go for a walk. It's cold of course (a couple of degrees above freezing) but actually mild for the time of year. And for me at least, cold is the best time to go out walking as I hate walking in the heat. So I put my fitbit on and headed off up hill round the back of our housing plan. It turned into a 45 minute walk and clocked up 3,500 steps. I don't listen to music or anything like that as I like to just daydream and, exactly as I knew I would, I felt sooooo good when I got back. It really is great therapy isn't it!But the whole point of this post is that I already know that if I sit down and start blog-hopping early on I won't get anything done that day. So I will have to limit myself to reading just the news first thing in the morning, get some work/exercise in during the day and only start reading/watching TV later in the day. The scary thing though is that even with adding the 3,500 steps on my walk, I only got in 6,000 steps today! That is really sedentary! On a routine day at work I would get in 6,000-7,000 steps without any additional exerice, I guess with getting to the bus, maybe walking from the bridge and then just walking back and forth to the photocopier, but to have a \"normal\" retired day tally of only 2,000-3,000 steps is scary. I'm going to have to do some re-thinking of this whole set up I can see! If not, given that I love to cook and now have the time, I hate to think what kind of nightmare it will be looking for something to wear to the wedding!"},
{"title": "The square root of bugger all ...", "date": "Friday 28 December 2018", "text": "… is what I did on Boxing Day. I think I literally sat on the sofa all day flicking between books, the computer, and the TV. It was so bad I think my backside is now square and flat!! But you know what, it was very nice! It's not something I would want to do often but very occasionally I suspect that might be a real treat. Actually, I'm just sitting here with an old, unused 2018 diary making lists of all the things that need to be done or that I want to do. The nice thing is I can tick a few things off each day from here on in and they will all get done - although not necessarily any time soon.One thing I did do though was cancel my automatic toll contract. Since I was using a toll road every day, twice a day to go to work and back, I had a contract with the toll company to the tune of €55-€60 a month (I can't remember exactly) which got me a reduced rate on the toll that I used the most and then standard rate on any other tolls. I had a badge on my windscreen and could just go through without stopping (as long as it was only around 30 km an hour) and the monthly bill was debited automatically. Well this was one of the first things I wanted to cancel since I don't want to be paying €60 a month for something I don't need any more. So yesterday a friend and I went out there to cancel our contracts and set up a pay-as-you-go contract, which only costs €1.90/month for the automatic badge if you use it, plus standard toll fees, and nothing at all if you don't use it. The \"telebadge\" is very convenient so I wanted to keep it if possible but, as I say, not at the cost of €60/month. No problem, everything was sorted in about 10 minutes and I will now be that much better off each month.  My poor friend retired in August 2016 and hadn't given it any thought so she has indeed been paying €60/month since then while using probably only about €10/month in tolls so she, at last, cancelled that too. Kids today!!! Whatever can you do with them!On the way back I wanted to stop in the next little town from us to check out their swimming pool (or nautical centre as they call it). Our local town only has an outdoor pool (unless they've built an indoor one since I was last there 20 years ago) so I have this vague idea (very vague actually) that I might start going swimming once a week. When I say \"vague\" the thought of me in a swim suit and swimming hat is probably enough to kill that idea before it even gets off the ground but we'll see. Again, as I say, my idea is to try to do some kind of activity, if not every day, but most days, so I'm trying to gear myself up to that. I already have a 90 minute yoga class to check out on a Tuesday afternoon in the next little village to me as that is one of the things I want to take up again, and a hiking group, but I also don't want to commit to too many activities until I get a feel for how this \"retirement thingy\" actually feels. Right now, all I can say is that it feels like I have a huuuuuggggeee weight of traffic jams lifted off my shoulders already!In other news Christmas day was very nice, spent with my kids and their partners and a friend. I actually didn't stress about this one - it's probably psychological because I know in the future I won't have to get everything done in one mad rush at the end of the work year. I cooked pork this year and actually set it off in the slow cooker at 1 a.m. since I was up anyway and it worked out perfectly. I made a gratin since I love it (to hell with the others) and other stuff and at the last minute thought I would have a shot at making yorkshire pudding for my youngest as he loves it. I do too but I have never been able to get the timings right since they need to be in a really hot oven and then trying to keep everything else hot is what always throws me. They didn't turn out too bad this time (well they all went) and my eldest basically took a second entire Christmas dinner home with him as leftovers. For once I didn't make desert as my friend always brings cookies or mini pies and they went down really well too.I think I mentioned in a previous post that I had bought morph piggyback suits for my sons for Christmas, well they loved them, and since I already had one for myself we did a fashion parade. The photos didn't come out very well but they were really funny, particularly on my sons because they are taller and the suits looked better!Since my youngest and his fiancée already play in our board game evenings I invited my oldest and his wife to our next evening, which is on 12 January at my house and they said they are going to come. So with that in mind, we got out a game called \"Time's Up\" and played that for a while, as well as \"guess who I am\" (not sure what the real name for that game is) and it was good fun.A little later the daughter from next door came round with her (relatively) new English boyfriend. He was a good sport and joined in easily so I wonder if they will join our group. It's always nice to have new blood, although to be honest there are sometimes difficulties with the different cultures/languages. Obviously most of these games are French and sometimes I will have no clue what I am supposed to be \"guessing\" since I don't even have French television. OK if you have to guess \"Harrison Ford\" that might be easier but some of the French celebrities just go straight over my head. Lily is Swiss so I had her guessing the name of a local Swiss politician who would seem to be as \"morally bankrupt\" as it is possible to be. Some very, very dubious expense accounting going on there and the local Geneva population are trying to get him out. He, like most of them, is clinging on by his finger nails. None of the others had a clue who I was talking about but as soon as I gave Lily a few clues she got it. So like I say it isn't always easy given the different nationalities involved but it is fun, although I wonder if next time, if we are about 14 or so, maybe we should split into a couple of groups and play cards. With that evening in mind, I have beef braising in my slow cooker at the moment as I want to try out a \"French dip sandwich\" idea which, if I like it (we used to like this kind of thing before but made slightly differently), I will make a bunch of them as my contribution to \"dinner\".So on that note, I'm looking forward to a quiet New Year's eve. I don't particularly like to go out on NYE and I certainly don't want to be on the roads so I will snuggle up on the sofa and try to stay awake till 1 a.m. here to watch the fireworks in the UK. I don't always make it but ….And finally, thank you to those ladies who sent me Christmas cards in the Christmas card swap organized by Anne (New Happenings). Seeing your cards, though, does make me realize how appalling my handwriting is as yours was so lovely. Now in my defence I left this till the last minute and was trying to get all my Christmas cards mailed from work on my last day so there was a tequila-sodden \"leaving party\" going on behind me in my office. Not that I think my handwriting would have improved much without it but that's my excuse and I'm sticking with it.Cheers to you all and have a happy new year's if you are celebrating!"},
{"title": "And so one chapter closes ...", "date": "Monday 24 December 2018", "text": "The week before Christmas my two friends and I went to see the Geneva Amateur Operatic Society's production of the annual panto, The Little Mermaid. Well to be honest they talked me into it because since my kids grew out of it I have drifted away from the panto scene. It is a peculiarly British thing and I have to say that despite my misgivings I thoroughly enjoyed it. You know, all that \"booooo, hissss, he's behind you\" and in this case \"no Queen Hypochondria, don't drink the coolaid\"! It was lovely to see all the little kids dressed up in their sparkles and to recognize a few familiar faces from work with their children/grandchildren. A very good production so maybe next year will be a repeat!Courtesy of GAOSCourtesy of GAOSAs I have mentioned previously, although technically my retirement date is 31 December, Friday was my last day of work as my company closes until the new year. There was quite a bit of stress trying to get my meetings/related work finished up as well as all my administrative stuff done before I leave, plus removing personal stuff off my computer - not to mention the bloody traffic - so at the end it may have occasionally felt a little like the shower scene from the Mel Brooks' film, High Anxiety. He is a doctor in a psychiatric hospital and to say this patient \"was having a bad day\" might be an understatement. It certainly felt a little like that on occasion at work towards the end!I was adamant that I didn't want a party, mainly because of the reason why I resigned, but also because it's just not my scene. So what did my colleagues do - they decided to totally ignore my wishes and bring the party to me! The buggers! They started streaming into my rather small office with booze, ice and glasses and off they went! Then they presented me with the most beautiful gifts (they had had a collection for me despite my wishes). At this point, the one-who-should not be named (OK it was Ali) decided to put some rather loud music on and the dancing and singing started! All the while I'm trying to clean up my computer and finish up! But you know what, it was lovely and I'm so touched that they did this for me. As the booze started going down someone went and got pizzas, then someone else got the G & Ts flowing and off it went! And, again, it was exactly my kind of thing. They couldn't have done anything nicer for me. Now I suspect there were some sore heads the next morning (not me - two glasses of wine and I was done as I was driving a few hours later and, as I suspected, the police were all over the borders). So it was water for me after that, but it is quite funny to see your colleagues getting tipsy. Gawd I will miss them.When I pulled into my driveway I bumped into my neighbour who was just coming back from walking his dog in the local woods and who had the most beautiful bouquet of holly in his hand. When I explained to him that I had just retired he handed it to me and said \"happy retirement\". They are Jehovah's Witnesses so don't celebrate Christmas, but I thought it was a lovely gesture on his part.I've only been \"done\" two days so technically it is just like a long weekend so far, but you know what, just knowing I will never again have to do that God-awful commute has drained so much tension out of me it is unbelievable. I feel I cope easily with work stress, and as I say I didn't mind my work and liked my colleagues but I really am already starting to realize just how stressful that commute was! So in the space of a couple of days I've gone from this ...… to this …… and this …Anyway, I have no plans for this evening as my kids spend Christmas Eve with their in-laws or friends. That doesn't bother me at all as I enjoy snuggling up with a good read. In a minute I'm going to head down to the kitchen to prepare a few things for tomorrow when I will have my kids, their partners and one friend coming over (plus there is a standing invitation for my friend but I don't know if he will show). Other than that there's not much to do (for the first time in my life I have \"not much to do\" - and that feels great). So after watching the semi-annual spectacle that is my neighbours trying to load up their car to leave on holiday (next year I think I'll sell tickets and get the popcorn out), I wish you all a lovely day tomorrow. Merry Christmas and \"health, wealth and happiness\" in 2019!"},
{"title": "A little (true) Brexit trivia!", "date": "Thursday 20 December 2018", "text": "Well I haven't been posting lately because I have just been so darn busy trying to get everything caught up before I leave - both from a work point of view and from an administrative point of view. I had two smaller meetings at the beginning of December which, although easy because the economists I worked with are just so on the ball, still entailed follow-up and deadlines. Then I had my second \"big\" meeting (I have two a year) on 11 December which has meant working flat out preparing for that. The meetings themselves aren't so bad but there is a lot of frantic prep beforehand. This last meeting involved two huge reports (I would say 500 pages total) to be put together and translated (into French and Spanish) and published beforehand, so flat out doesn't even cover it! Don't get me wrong, I'm just the dogsbody in all this. We have economists, lawyers, statisticians, translators and so on doing all the hard work but some idiot (me) has to put them all together in a coherent form without getting the graphs upside down (for instance). There are always mistakes, usually no big deal, but you have to work with it. Also we have just started using Windows 10 and it is not without it's \"particularities\", to say the least. There certainly are bugs to be ironed out! One of these reports goes to the G20 meeting of trade ministers so I, personally, really would rather not get my graphs upside down! Anyway, that has kept me flat out but I actually enjoy it and get a lot of satisfaction when it all comes together. We have our moments as a team but I have to say I love the team I work with, despite the fact that occasionally the men seem to have more \"hormones\" than I do! Oh, and did I mention, it took me three hours to get to work that morning thanks to a four-car pile-up on the motorway! Can you see why I'm leaving!!!!Anyway, even though all that is now over there were then all the administrative \"thingies\" to get out of the way for my retirement. Since I dealt with this stuff when I worked in HR I knew exactly what I had to do but you still have to actually do it! This morning I ran up to HR and handed in my permit to work in Switzerland and with lovely Brexit on the horizon I have to start thinking about what the future holds for me and my one son who lives in France! Nobody can tell us anything. We had drinks with the British Ambassador two weeks ago and they can't tell us any more. As it stands, my oldest son is married to a Swiss girl and lives in Switzerland so can easily get Swiss nationality in the future if he wants to (in addition to being anglo-american). Boy would I love to see my lovely, hypochondriac son do Swiss military service! Yodelayhedee! Anyway, he has a permit for Switzerland through his work so that isn't actually a problem.  My youngest (the plumber) lives in France and always has since birth, except that my doctor was in Switzerland so he was born in Switzerland. Hence although he was born there he was not entitled to Swiss citizenship (they don't have \"droit de sol\") and as he wasn't born in France he wasn't automatically French either. It's like trying to nail jelly to a wall isn't it! As soon as I came out of the maternity hospital he was back \"at home\" in France. I did enquire about French citizenship for them when they were little but was told that they needn't \"bother\" since they were both British! Sooooo, since he and his French fiancée are going to get married next year in any case, they have brought the civil ceremony (the legal one) forward to 16 March (I think that's the date) so that he will already be married to a French citizen when the Brexit freight trains steamrolls its juggernaut way through!As for me, I will meet all the requirements for residency as they stand at the moment in that I will earn over €27,000 a year even in retirement, I own my own home and have private medical insurance. If my younger son had to meet those requirements he wouldn't make it on the income requirement, being a lowly plumber. So what are they going to do? Ship him \"back\" to the UK to claim unemployment and a council house in a country where he has never lived! What a fiasco this whole bloody thing is. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the three of us Brits were not entitled to vote on Brexit - you know this \"little\" thing that only \"slightly\" affects us. I get so mad that I sometimes just think go ahead and pay the stupid costs of the vote that no-one had a clue what they were voting on except \"let's control immigration\"! That's a fair point and I agree with it, but the consequences are going to be so far reaching if they can't come to an agreement. \"Piss up\" and \"brewery\" come to mind!  In the end, I know we will be ok but we now have to start the laborious business of applying for French citizenship (which takes about two years, but I'm already taking evening classes on how to complain constantly! Don't get me wrong, I love France and I love the French but if there were a complainypants Olympics they would win hands down!). But what about the poor Brits in countries that don't allow duel citizenship? My sister was married to a Dane and has lived in Denmark for nigh on 40 years, has four Danish kids but the Danes don't allow duel citizenship. What a bloody mess. And doesn't the hypocrisy of the likes of the former Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who was a staunch pro-Brexiteer but who is now taking up legal residence in France, stick in your gullet! In the end, I think they will cobble through some kind of bastardized agreement because neither side can afford such a balls up, despite the chest beating from Juncker! I mean, nobody wants to see 800,000 job losses in the UK car industry and its subsidiaries alone do they! And again, despite all the above-mentioned chest beating, the EU would be in some serious financial schtuck too if they tried to screw one of their major trading partners (and net financial contributor)!Anyway, the whole point of my post (and I have quite a few lined up since I am almost retired - yaaaay tomorrow!) is this. The EU has just issued a civil aviation directive whereby only EU majority-owned airlines will be allowed to fly intra-EU! Buuuuuut Iberia (Spanish airlines) is majority owned by British Airways, which means that come 30 March 2019, with no alternative agreement, if you want to fly, say, from Madrid to Barcelona or from Malaga to Seville you will not be able to take Iberia!  Ha, bloody ha! However, if you want to fly from Madrid to Gibraltar you're quids in. No problems. Don't all jump at once!"},

{"title": "What a lovely family!", "date": "Thursday 29 November 2018", "text": "The other night I watched the first episode of  \"Our Yorkshire Farm\" on TV - a glimpse into the lives of the Yorkshire Shepherdess (Amanda Owen), her husband Clive and their nine children. What a treat that programme was! It was really, really refreshing to see such down-to-earth people living their physically hard but happy lives raising their \"free-range\" kids in such a happy home. They came over as so, so refreshing. This episode was filmed during the winter of the \"Beast from the East\" and you could only imagine how tough it must have been taking care of their animals in such physically demanding conditions. The Yorkshire Dales aren't easy to live in by anybody's standards but by golly, this was just incredible. What was so nice, though, was how they are raising such seemingly \"salt of the earth\" children. They all pitch in and all have their jobs but seeing them at Christmas opening what, to most of us, would appear rather small presents and enjoying them was a real treat. I also loved how Ruben (I think), the teenage mechanic in the family, showed his \"shadow\" (six year old brother, Sid), how to fix and mend and really took the time to look after and involve his little brother! I had read Amanda's book \"The Yorkshire Shepherdess\" and, to be honest, while it was an interesting read she really isn't a writer so it wasn't that great a book (in my opinion), but seeing them as a family in this documentary really was a treat and I look forward to seeing the rest of the series.In other news, the protests of the \"gilets jaunes\" have now ended here in France, and not before time. \"Gilets jaunes\", or yellow jackets in English, was the name given to the nationwide protests throughout France against the increase in the price of diesel. Their first protest in my area was Opération Escargot (Operation Snail), where trucks went on a go-slow on the major arterial roads to bring traffic to a standstill. We always get clobbered as our little town is mid-way between the major cities of Geneva and Annecy so that was one day that I worked from home regardless of my director's opinion! Since then they have been blocking access to supermarkets, petrol stations and so on and while they blocked my local toll road \"open\" - i.e. nobody paid - they closed six of the eight toll booths so traffic was drip fed into those two (admittedly free) booths! Well not free for me actually, since I have a monthly contract and it will be debited from my account anyway. I have mixed feelings about these kinds of protests (and the French are very quick to strike/protest). On the one hand I understand the plight, particularly of the truckers, who will be having to pay more and more just to be able to work. On the other hand, as I said previously, it seems to me that they are always protesting/going on strike over something or other. Even if you gave me free tickets there is no way I would fly into or out of Paris over Easter - you just know someone will be on strike and your trip will be buggered!And moving on, since I am now working 50% up until my retirement date I took a trip down to Cluses yesterday afternoon as I wanted to pop into the Yves Rocher shop (I love their stuff) and also to stop by my patchwork teacher for some tips about finishing a project. I wasn't going to sign up for more lessons this year as I knew I would miss the first few because of work, but it turns out that the lessons are late starting and will begin only on Tuesday 4 December so I have signed back up again. After that I will be retired anyway. We will be making a Kaffe Fassett mystery quilt, and since quilts are my favourite projects to work on, here I go again. It was sunny when I pulled into Cluses so I stopped to take a picture of the mountain ahead of me. Not that the photo does it any justice but it really did look so pretty.On another note, and not related to anything, as I was waiting for some rice to boil last night I decided to use those few minutes to start pulling stuff out of the fridge in order to clean it. Hey, have they discovered penicillin yet? They have! Damn, I thought I was on to a good thing. I tell you, some of the stuff at the back of my fridge should be in the British Museum! Yuck!Oh, and remember my trip to Sicily? Well while I was there I kinda palled up with a lady called Carol. Anyway, we ended up Facetiming each other the other night for a gossip, and all being well she will be coming out to visit me sometime after I retire. Nice eh!And finally, jumping from one topic to another, I was talking to my son, the plumber, on Saturday night at our board game evening and he was telling me he really doesn't like his new job much. He said all he does is takes the front off boilers, checks them over and repairs anything that needs repairing, and puts it all back together again. On occasion he has noticed small plumbing jobs which he could easily do for the client but he is not allowed to! And even if he decided to break the rules and do them anyway, his firm have him on such short turnaround times that he wouldn't have the time in any case. So he has started looking at jobs which would get him back into real plumbing. I was telling him it would be good to think about trying to get the tools so he could go out on his own at the weekends - but as tools are really expensive that will have to wait for a while. If and when he does decide to work for himself, I told him he should get a van like this one - it is just my sense of humour (and his to be honest) and it would definitely get him noticed!"},

I genuinely don't mind because I know when it's coming and there really is quite a feeling of satisfaction when these big reports are published. That being said, it is nice to slow down a little - and get this - as from now I'll be working 50% until I retire and it's bliss! Actually having a life outside work is heaven - who wudda thunk! Oddly enough my boss called me a couple of minutes ago panicking slightly as they have just issued the vacancy for my post and he is worrying about who will (or won't) apply - will they get the right fit work-wise and personality-wise (as there are some \"tricky\" personalities here too. In all truth I only seem to be able to handle that aspect of it because office politics just goes straight over my head. I seem to be able to just tune it all out - which mostly is a good thing but not always). Oh well, not my problem now.So where was I? Oh yes, well a lot has been going on too since I last posted. My friend and I finally got round to going to see A Star is Born last week and both thoroughly enjoyed it. We are no longer a couple but still friends and I really enjoy his company. I asked him if he wanted to sit at the back of the cinema and snog but he turned me down! Damn, I can't even get lucky with a 73 year old! But, like I say, we both thoroughly enjoyed the film and I was just amazed a what a lovely voice Lady Gaga has. I had never heard her sing before but it was a real pleasure to listen to her. Moreover, although she doesn't have a conventionally pretty face, I do think she is very attractive - probably more to do with talent and personality - but then, isn't that what it's all about!Then this last Friday a couple of friends and I went to see the Geneva Amateur Operatic Society's production of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" and sadly, for once, we were disappointed. My two friends just found the play weird. I didn't mind the \"weirdness\" but was totally transfixed by a colleague of ours who was appearing in it and who was, frankly, totally crap, and it took away the enjoyment as I kept concentrating on her. So, by mutual consent, we left during the interval (we had a one hour drive home in the pouring rain anyway). Still, we regularly support this association and they are usually very good - but not this time sadly!Then the following night we had our monthly board game evening at my former neighbour's. She lives at 1,200 metres so we had to play it by ear whether or not we would get up there in the snow but it turned so mild (still is) that all the snow had melted and it was easy going. In a fit of inspiration (to my weird little mind at any rate) I had seen some \"piggy back morph suits\" and ordered two for my sons for Christmas, plus one for myself just for the hell of it. They don't read my blog so I'm not giving anything away here. So I thought \"what the heck\" and decided to go to the board game evening wearing mine, and very fetching it was too (errr not!)!My boobs aren't actually that big but it's not very flattering is it!Towards the end of the evening I happened to mention that I was playing \"Words with friends\" on FB with a gent in New York so my son decided we should all send him a \"hi from France\" message (we'd had a few at this point). He was delighted!And moving seamlessly on, earlier this week I had my \"exit medical\" at work with a charming, older, replacement doctor. There wasn't really much for him to do as I had already seen the doctors I was most interested in seeing privately and had any reports he might need. I did ask him to put the exchange of correspondence with my Director on my file, explaining that his intransigence on my (and all of our) requests for occasional telecommuting arrangements was the reason I had resigned in the first place. It is too late for me but maybe it will help someone else! When I asked the nurse for a copy of my vaccination records she realized that I hadn't had a DTP shot in 20 years so offered to give me one there and then to bring me up-to-date! Why not - free vaccines! Buuut it's amazing how soon you realize just how many people actually thump you on the arm when they say hallo or goodbye! Damn that bugger hurt - but I was very brave, you'll be glad to know - stiff upper lip and all that!Then, a \"funny\" during the week. I was targeted by a hacker on my work email. Someone who said \"Treaders - email ......., password Thierry\" you have been hacked. They have obviously somehow got hold of a partial password at some point because I tend to use Thierry-something as my password. Anyway, unless I wanted them to \"out\" me as having surfed pornographic web sites using my work's computer (ha ha!!!!) I had to pay $900 in bitcoins into their account or else! And it was no use trying to change my password as they would intercept each and any change from now on! I must have received about 15 of these emails in the last 10 days, so I just forwarded them to our Informatics people and wrote back to \"superhacker\" and told him to stick his demands where the sun don't shine!And finally, all the Brits working in our organization have been invited for drinks next week with the British Ambassador. I don't suppose for one minute we will get any updates on Brexit so in which case I really hope it's gin and tonic time and not cucumber sandwiches and a cup of tea!"},
{"title": "Why bother paying for \"professional\" advice!", "date": "Thursday 15 November 2018", "text": "And so, the ongoing saga of how much tax I will be liable for on my lump sum continues! I mentioned previously that I was expecting to pay 7.5% tax on my lump sum and then the guy I consulted on tax matters (before handing in my notice) dropped the bomb shell on me that there was another tax - called \"CSG\" - payable on top. First it was an additional 8.8%, then it was an additional 17.2%, then it was .... Lord alone knows!!! Eventually, based on what he had told me, I was expecting to pay 7.5% tax and an additional 8.8% CSG! Even with that \"clarified\" I still couldn't figure out the figures he sent me after our meeting. So I went back and forth with him, and a colleague - who is soon to be in the same situation as me - went back and forth with our local tax authorities, who basically told her my guy didn't know his a$$ from a hole in the ground! Anyway, I was supposed to be attending a pre-retirement course up at the International Labour Organizition (which I have now missed due to workload) and wanted to put this question directly to their expert so it would be sorted once and for all. With that in mind, last night I sent my guy an email basically saying, \"I understand the €22,000 tax on the lump sum - no problem. I get the €8,000 tax on the pension - no problem. But can you please explain to me exactly where the additional €9,000 comes in!\" And then, this morning, I get an email from him to the effect \"well maybe the 17.2% isn't correct - you should check with the tax authorities when it comes time to do your taxes\"!!!! What the flip! That is why I paid him isn't it - to get \"expert\"advice!Anyway, in the meantime my colleague forwarded my exchange of email with this guy to the tax authorities who said that he had totally got his knickers in a twist and was quoting figures based on such things as tax charged on rental property income and so on - which is not my case!!!! The tax lady again confirmed that the only tax to which I would be liable on the lump sum would be 7.5%!!! So my tax liability went from €37,000, down to €24,450 and then down (finally?) to €11,250 (which was the figure I was expecting to pay from the very beginning) and all that in the space of about four emails!!! So, like a €25,000 difference from one email to the next!  This lady said she would be more than happy to speak to me but I don't have the time at the moment. I am working late every night and need time to get my thoughts together, so maybe I will stop in and see her after I retire, since the tax will only be payable in 2020!  What a bloody mess, and can anyone tell me why one pays for \"expert advice\" only to find out that he is no expert! I sincerely hope this lady is right (I think she is - she works for the tax office after all and it would seem to confirm what other people have told me) but really!!!!!!In other news, I thought the ceremonies to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 were beautiful. Moreover it was sunny in London so it was more moving than usual, especially seeing the \"old soldiers\" marching by!  I don't usually like to bring politics up on my blog but I didn't believe even Trump could sink any lower - and then he exceeded all expectations by refusing to attend the ceremony in honour of the US marines who had died \"because of the rain\". Oh FFS!!!! Even assuming his helicopter couldn't make the trip, it was a one hour trip by car!!! I really, really didn't think he could sink any lower but .... he continues to surprise and disgust!And talking of \"idiots\", my ex recently posted on FB a photo of two female military personnel in uniform with a caption underneath saying \"can I get a thumbs up, a share and an ooooorrraaaaah for the good ole U S of A\"!!!! Which was fine until somebody pointed out that they were Israeli solders! I mean, even I had spotted that but hey, if I ever go into stand-up comedy he would be comedy gold!On a more positive note, a few months ago I bought four tickets to see the Glen Miller Orchestra at Geneva's Hotel Kempinski and what a fabulous evening that turned out to be. We are usually three friends who go to these kinds of event but I bought an extra ticket as a treat for my neighbour, since she had said ages ago how much she likes that kind of music. So on the Thursday night I went round to tell her that I had bought a ticket as a treat for her but she told me she couldn't go as she wasn't well!  Frankly she is (genuinely) never well and it is so sad to see. I love her to bits but I find her to be a very, very sad woman! She is (in her own words) an unhappily married woman, married to a domineering man. Now I believe you can only be \"dominated\" if you allow yourself to be dominated but after so many years married I feel she has had all the spunk worn out of her! Don't get me wrong, I don't live in that house and I don't know \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth\" but for various reasons I am inclined to believe her. Truth, of course, is subjective and that may be the truth as she sees/experiences it, but while her husband is lovely to me and always popping in to do favours and so on, I really do believe he treats her with complete contempt and disdain. He has had affairs in the past as a younger man and I think that marriage died a death then but I like them both. They are good neighbours to me but she is my friend.  The poor thing has spent her entire life living on cigarettes and coffee so she doesn't get fat because \"M doesn't like fat women\"!!! He doesn't??? Hey I've got a pair of knockers on me and they don't seem to bother him. My feeling is if my body offends you then don't bloody look! I won't go into detail but I have had occasion to put him firmly back in his place before and after he apologized for being out of line we are now back on a good footing. Anyway, as I said, the long and short of it is that she is a sad woman and a nervous wreck and I honestly think all those years of consuming cigarettes and coffee in a bid to stay slim are catching up with her. She is always ill with some ailment or other and a permanent hacking cough. As I say, I love her to bits but I honestly don't think she will make old bones!The upshot is that she genuinely couldn't go to the concert so since her husband also liked Glen Miller he asked if he could use the ticket - no problem! So the three of us had an evening out with her husband (with her blessing) at a fabulous concert, after which we were literally \"buzzing\", they were that good. So, if you ever get a chance to see them and you like that kind of music - go for it, you won't regret it!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Friday 9 November 2018", "text": "It's been a little while since I posted (well apart from the farting video) but I have been frantically busy, this week in particular, getting home anywhere between 9-10 p.m. I honestly don't mind because I know this is my busy period in any case and there is a feeling of satisfaction when things start falling into place! That being said, I'm pretty tired right now so I haven't been online much lately.Even though I have been working late and you would expect traffic to be easier by virtue of missing the rush hour, traffic is still just as awful as ever. In fact on Tuesday night I must have left here around 8 p.m. and it still took me 90 minutes to get home because, yet again, there was an accident in the run up to the toll booth. There were only two cars involved from what I could see but one was pranged and had ended up across the right-hand lane - very dangerous. They had it signaled and the emergency services were just making their way there but it would have been very, very easy indeed for another car to plough into them. I tell you, I won't miss that madness at all!And talking of \"that madness\", I have just - about 10 minutes ago - sent another mail to HR asking where the heck my paperwork is, noting that my resignation letter was dated 1 October so we are looking at six weeks and counting! When I was in HR I could have all the paperwork prepared in one afternoon and even if we were busy nobody waited more than a couple of days. I am just itching to get my resignation/retirement signed, sealed and delivered.Oh, and did you like yesterday's video post - that made me giggle so bad! Just my schoolboy-ish sense of humour I guess. I was watching TV the other night and that's what made me think of that video. Well let's back up a bit here shall we. I seem to have phases where I tend to watch certain types of TV programmes. For the longest time it was cookery programmes (because I was obviously going to become a world-famous cook), then there were the \"Place in the Sun\" type programmes where I was obviously going to up-sticks and move somewhere sunny. Oops, been there, done that - got the T-shirt. Then there would be the \"renovate an old farmhouse\" kind of programmes because I was obviously going to do that too. Then I moved on to \"Snapped/Killer Women\" because I was obviously going to .... oooooops, better not even go there I suppose, but suffice it to say I am very happily divorced! Anyway, at the moment it is all about emergency services, be it air ambulance, regular ambulance or ER kinds of programmes. Well, the other night I was watching an ambulance-type programme which was based in the West Midlands, so it was all the more interesting to me because I knew the places involved. What these programmes do for me is highlight the excellent emergency services that we have in the U.K. and this despite the fact that the NHS is slowly being crippled and these people are seriously underpaid. I mean, seriously! But what leaps out of the TV is the compassion that they have for their charges. The highlight of this one particular episode was when two lady paramedics were called out to an elderly gent complaining of pain which had moved up from his knee to his chest. He lived alone and had pancreatic cancer so they were aware that he was already on morphine but ran various tests on him and determined that his pain did not come from his heart. To the camera one of the ladies said that in many cases these people are frightened and lonely and don't always necessarily need much more than medical reassurance but sometimes maybe just a smile and a chat. So they went into the kitchen and made him a cup of tea (the solution to all ills!) and sat and chatted with him for 20 minutes, making sure that he understood that he had to go and see his GP on the Monday morning. By the end of their visit he was visibly improved even though they had not actually administered any medical treatment. As they headed towards the door he got up to accompany them out and to lock the door behind them, when all of a sudden he let out a prolonged, high-pitched (\"alto\" I think) fart that I swear lasted five seconds. They all burst out laughing, to which one of the paramedics said \"problem solved\" then! Ah, bless his heart!In other news, this Sunday is Armistice Day of course, and the 100th year anniversary of the end of WWI. Traditionally in the UK for around 10 days prior we wear poppies in remembrance, the sale of  which allows the amazing British Legion to collect millions of pounds in aid of war veterans (from all conflicts) and their families. I am usually able to buy a poppy through a colleague who gets them from the British Consulate here in Geneva but this year I thought I would like something prettier and longer-lasting. So I decided to buy a poppy broach through the British Legion that I could wear every year and simply donate money at collection time. Anyway, I went onto their site and I don't know if it was just submerged by enquiries (hopefully for them) or whether my geriatric computer was about to give up the ghost, but every time I tried to put my selected broach \"into the basket\" it wouldn't let me. So after about 10 minutes of this I decided to give them a call - which of course took around 15 minutes to be answered. So much the better as far as I'm concerned because that hopefully meant they were selling-out! Anyway, in the end I got through to a very nice lady and placed my order for one broach at £15 with an additional £15 for postage! That's a lot of money for postage but, again, if it's for the British Legion, I have no problem with that. Buuuuuuuttt, just as we were finishing up I happened to glance at my computer and every \"click to put in basket\" seemed to have gone through all at once, leaving me with a total of 15 poppies at £15 each plus (I imagine) £15 each for postage! Yikes, while I'm more than happy to support the British Legion I hadn't planned on spending £450!!!! Not to worry, of course, because in the end I was able to empty that basket and hopefully will get my one-and-only poppy in time for the ceremony here in France on Sunday.This is the broach I chose!"},

{"title": "Ouch! Brrrrr! And I wish they'd make up their bloody minds!", "date": "Friday 26 October 2018", "text": "Ouch! Well first of all, as in the past three years, two days ago I was able to pay a further 10% extra off my mortgage. I think I've explained before that the only time I can pay extra off my mortgage is if I pay 10% of the initial sum (obviously they don't want people to do this), so in my case it means I have somehow to cobble together 33,000 Swiss francs. This will be the fourth year in a row that I have been able to make this extra payment on top of my regular mortgage payments and I thank God I have been able to do it because that is what is going to allow me to retire at Christmas!I always keep a copy of my original mortgage amortization schedule in my diary on the date the mortgage falls due (I pay every three months) and from that I can see that by doing this I have knocked an extra 114,000 Swiss francs (£89,000 or $114,000) off where my mortgage would have stood had I not made these extra payments! Yay me! I realize, of course, that I have been very fortunate to be able to do that but I'm just so, so glad that I knuckled down and threw (almost) everything I had at it! Not everything of course because I have still travelled but as I mentioned in a recent post, I cut everything else back as far to the bone as possible in order to be able to sock that money away!On the \"brrrrrr\" side, we have been having glorious weather here still - no rain, and you can still easily go outside in the sunshine without your coats on (well the Brits can - everyone else seems to think it's \"cold\" enough to wear coats. What a bunch off wimps!!!!) Buuuuuttttt, apparently as from Saturday we are heading for fairly constant rain for a few days so I imagine the snow won't be too far behind. I'm just so glad that when I got my car serviced the other week I had them put my winter tyres on because as soon as the first snow flurries come the garages are swamped with people rushing to do the same, so again \"yay me\"!And on the \"I wish they'd make up their bloody minds\" part, I had spoken to a colleague who lives near me (in France) and was telling her about the horrendous tax I was going to pay on the lump sum. In any case, I have resigned myself to paying it but the thought of it is more than a little painful, I can tell you. Anyway, since she will also be retiring shortly she contacted our local tax office and they basically said the info my tax guy had given me was baloney, and that the tax on the lump sum would work out at about 15% instead of the 22% he was talking about. So I forwarded to my colleague the explanations my guy had given me and she then \"played tax ping-pong\" with the tax authorities, which eventually led to the lady there basically saying that my guy \"doesn't know his a$$ from a hole in the ground\" (only she put it more politely) and offering to bring him up to speed!!!!! Sooooo, I have the name of another tax person that I intend to talk to and I will shortly be going on a pre-retirement course to be held in one of the large international organizations here where they bring in tax people from both Switzerland and France to talk about these issues (amongst other things), so I intend to put my case to them (in front of about 500 people I guess). Crikey! In any case, I have/had resigned myself to paying around 22% of my lump sum in tax so if I can get that down to around 15% I will be well pleased, but don't you think everyone should be \"singing from the same song sheet on this matter\"!!!!And finally, on Wednesday night I went with Thérèse, the \"Présidente\" of our sewing club for the last 22 years, to the annual meeting of the local community centre groups. I was surprised to find out that there are about 14 groups in total who use the facilities donated by this particular commune for free (and who also receive a small subsidy from the commune) and we are, therefore, obliged to have a yearly meeting where each club must submit its accounts! That's a bit of a joke to me at least because I am the treasurer of the second-hand bookshop that we run in aid of various charities and for me that just means tracking spending/receipts and keeping any remaining cash in a tin under my bed! Still, this has to be done properly and it was pretty nice to find out more of what kinds of groups it is possible to join (you know, when you're not putting in 12-hour days working/commuting). Anyway, the big joke is that I am now the \"Présidente\" (so a little respect is in order don't you think) of our sewing club (despite not being able to sew!!!! - I do a bit of patchwork when I go, but can't sew) but then they only need someone to do the administrative work in any case! After the meeting everyone crashed out of the meeting room for drinks and snacks, but as it was nearly 10 p.m. and I hadn't even been home yet I bowed out (this time). So there you, go - another feather to add to my hat (and CV) when I finally get round to asking for French citizenship! I hope they are impressed!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 22 October 2018", "text": "There's not a lot going on here at the moment. Well I am actually pretty busy at work but it's all routine stuff. There's not a lot of interesting stuff going on, is what I suppose I mean. I had another bloody awful few days' commute though. On Friday (12 October) I again took three hours to get to work. There was an accident on the motorway (turns out it was a four-car accident) which I saw ahead of time so decided to take the back road. Problem was, everyone and his dog decided to do the same thing so I ended up crawling to work yet again, getting in at 10 a.m. after leaving home at 7 a.m.!!! Aaargh! What is especially frustrating though is that although there were four cars involved in the accident, it was (seemingly) just a prang and no-one was hurt (thankfully) and so it was cleared pretty quickly. Had I stayed on the motorway I probably would have been in at least an hour earlier but who can know that in advance eh! Then on the following Monday and Tuesday central Geneva was blocked by a construction workers' strike, yet again causing me (and thousands of others this time) to be late for work. Double aaaarrggghhh!! Now I actually have some sympathy for them because the gist of what I can understand of their complaints is that when they get to 55 on a regular contract they then acquire the right (assuming certain conditions are met) to retire at 60, so what happens is that many, many construction companies effectively fire them at age 55 and take them back on as temporary staff, thus screwing them out of their guaranteed retirement rights. It isn't right or fair of course and I understand their frustration because goodness knows any long-time construction worker who makes it to 60 in that kind of hard, physical job, in my opinion, deserves to retire. That being said, this constant drip, drip, drip of commuting delays is doing my head in. Yet again, I am sooooo grateful to have put my notice in you wouldn't believe it, as I don't really see the traffic situation improving any time soon!On another note, I got my latest electric bill plan for the upcoming year and it has gone down by €10 per month so that can't be bad given that EDF (the French electric company) have just put their prices up! Which got me to thinking, when my ex was still living with me, our electricity bill was €344 per month!!!! Yes, you read that right! About $400 or £300 per month!!!! I found out after he had gone that he had fixed the water heater to be on 24/7 and routinely left heaters running all day and night even when we were not home (and despite the fact that we have oil central heating)!!!! So my new bill works out at €80/month! Not bad really for this area and given the size of my house. Then there was the home telephone bill. €266/month ($300/£236/month)!!!! Yep great! I think I mentioned before that when I called the telephone company they explained to me that he had set up a contract for unlimited calls to the U.S. for €150/month plus €70/month to Canal+ (the French cable TV company) \"just in case there were any good concerts on\"!!! For Pete' sake, we could have afforded to fly all over the world to different concerts for that amount of money, and in any case he only called his parents about once every two months to the tune of about €30! I now have my house phone bill (plus Wifi) down to about €25/month so just by cutting those two bills down I was saving around €500/month! Of course, that's without his mobile phone bills, his car insurance (drink drivers pay horrendous insurance bills - that's if they can even get insurance afterwards). Yep, one time after we had separated our finances he had a mobile phone bill of €1,200/month and a home phone bill of about €800/month (in the same month). Add in the car insurance of €500/month as a \"high risk\" driver and I'm sure you can imagine how much I saved just by having him leave me!!!!Actually, I called his mom last night as it was her birthday last week and I wanted to wish her a happy birthday. I was pretty fond of my in-laws and I occasionally call her just for a chat. Well we were on the phone for about 1 1/2 hours but I don't mind that at all (and in any case it doesn't cost €266 does it!). I never ask about him but I do get to hear how the rest of the family is doing, and occasionally to hear about him as she tells me some stuff - like the fact that he just bought himself a new, top of the range phone (so nothing's changed there then) and was pissed off when she didn't want his old one. She was then talking about her other son who is on invalidity and how she gets him to come up and help her with her garden (for which she pays him!!!!! - she is 83!!!!) but she has to be very careful what she says to him because \"his eyes go black and he explodes into a fury\"! So just like his brother then! The brother hasn't worked for years, lives with a woman who has had three kids by three different men and whose 25 year old daughter also lives with them and doesn't work either. In fact, they all live with her granddad (who is 94) and basically sponge off him, although what will happen to them when he pops off this mortal coil God only knows. So no-one works, no-one cooks, no-one cleans and the washing machine is broken and there's no replacement in sight because granddad won't buy a new one. What a lovely picture that paints. To be honest though, my ex is retired and why he can't go up and take care of his mother's lawn (they have a riding lawn mower) is beyond me, but then why would he treat her any better than he treated me. He never cut our lawn either - my neighbour always did it - and I did everything else!!!!! Uuuuurggghhh, I'm so glad I'm divorced. She was also telling me about a cousin of his who (seemingly) had a good marriage but then the husband took to drinking, lost his job and was rolling in at all hours of the night drunk, and (I'm guessing) aggressive since the cousin has now left and moved in with her mother!!! So I just said, \"yeah, I know that feeling too, dreading the sound of that key in the lock\". Now I don't really mean to pile it on but I think she deserves to know what kind of sons she produced. I have no idea how, actually, since my in-laws were decent, hard-working, church-going people and definitely did not raise their boys to be like that. Buuuuut, they all had those stinking tempers and I guess alcohol never did any of them any favours in that department as the sons are both evil drunks (even though mom didn't drink and dad only rarely)!So eventually I got around to telling her about my decision to retire at Christmas, despite losing quite a bit of money by taking a lump sum to pay off my mortgage. So she asked \"what mortgage - didn't P give you the house in the divorce?\" HA! So that's what he's been telling them all Stateside then - what an evil, money-grabbing bitch I am I suppose. Oh man, oh man! Anyway, like I say, I was very fond of my in-laws and am happy to chat with her occasionally, but some of the stuff she comes out with never ceases to surprise me!Other than that, the weather is glorious here, warm and not a spot of rain. We actually have a hosepipe ban in place - not that anybody would be watering their plants I guess, but no washing of cars and so on. Since I have come back from Sicily it has rained briefly one time and other than that I would say it hasn't rained for about three months! It's not good for the crops and our water levels are running really low, but for the moment I am enjoying this glorious Indian summer!And finally, yesterday a friend and I went to town for the now-annual \"Creative Hobbies Fair\". We walked there and back, thereby getting in a good 90 minutes of walking, and yet again it was lovely, although I resisted the urge to spend on all  the beautiful items they had for crafting, particularly since I haven't even started the embroidery projects I bought there last year!!! They had put the entrance price up to €7.50, which I thought was a bit expensive for a small, small-town fair, but luckily I had received two free tickets so I was well pleased. They had also increased the parking to €2.50 from €2 (although, like I said, we walked) and the drinks and refreshments prices were also pretty steep, but all in all it was a pleasant way to kill a few hours, and the quilt display at the entrance was, as always, pretty impressive. That'll be me some day!"},
{"title": "Our latest board game evening - and just too much partying for this old bird!", "date": "Monday 15 October 2018", "text": "On Saturday night we had our latest, monthly board game evening at my neighbours' house. There were only eight of us there this time as quite a few of our group already had plans and I did wonder if it would be as much fun as usual - but it was every bit as much fun, probably because we could all easily play the same game. Yet again there was way too much food, although I found that we were very reasonable in the wine department, thankfully. We spent most of the evening playing a game called \"Time's Up\" where we split into four teams of two and each had to get our team mate to say certain words or phrases, either by giving clues or by miming, all the while being up against the clock! It wasn't easy as many of the answers were very \"French-specific\" - by which I mean French culture, TV, expressions and so on. I don't even have French TV so a lot of it went straight over my head but on occasion we stumbled across a few anglophone answers which tended to make up for all the \"Frenchie\" stuff. For instance, what is the name of the main character in The Big Bang Theory (answer: Sheldon Cooper - hope you got that one!).Anyway, at one point I had to get D, my English friend, to say \"Harrison Ford\". Easy right! Well bugger me but do you think I could think of the name \"Indiana Jones\". It went straight out my mind. I seriously couldn't be on a programme like \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" because even if I knew the answers (unlikely, I admit) my brain just doesn't fire properly when I'm under pressure! So my solution to getting her to say \"Ford\" was to start singing \"climb every mountain, FORD every stream\"!!! Seriously! The French just looked at me like I was mad!! So Jen, my daughter-in-law (to be) suggested she say the word \"hedgehog\" in French - i.e. \"hérisson\" - which, for some reason, to Jen, sounded like \"Harrison\". OK, I can go with that I suppose, but I can't say we were on the same wavelength really. Then she asked D what make of car I drive - to which somebody yelled out \"Toyota\" (I drive a Ford). So in the end, \"Harrison Ford\" ended up coming out like \"Hedgehog Toyota\"! I guess you had to be there but I was doubled up, it was so funny! I also had to get her to say \"Claude Monnet\", so just said \"how do you say \"argent\" in English?\" and she stared at me and said \"money\"! I took that one as a win even if D had no idea what I was talking about!We finally finished that game around 1 a.m. when Isabelle, our hostess, suggested another game - \"Six qui prend\" - a rather good card game which was new to me but good fun anyway. I ended up trudging home exhausted (all 20 metres of it) at around 2.30 a.m.!!!! Goodness, I'm too old for this partying malarky, I was so out of it the next day that I had to have a three hour siesta! The sooner I retire the better, I must say, if I'm going to keep partying like this!Isabelle - miming God alone knows what!A \"smaller\" mime obviously!Jen - either with her swag bag or being Father Christmas!Not sure what Philippe was miming with such gay abandon!Jordan all smiley-faced!Isabelle - looks like she's singing opera!"},

{"title": "Sicily - la fin!", "date": "Wednesday 10 October 2018", "text": "Our last couple of days in Sicily were spent visiting the ancient Greek town of Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples. The remains here were quite spectacular with the Temple of Concord and the Temple of Zeus being incredibly intact - the Temple of Zeus is also the largest temple built by the Greeks. As we were being given the background at the Temple of Zeus there was a modern day section of the \"Oracles\" - basically screaming women who predicted the future. I (and many others) didn't like it at all (call it art, call it what you want but it was still just a bunch of screaming women to this pleb) but our guide was saying that they believe there had been sulphur and other gas emissions in the area and it is quite possible that the \"Oracles\" were driven crazy and given to screaming as a result of being subjected to these gasses. Now that is interesting.I loved this olive tree - many hundreds of years old.Our last day was spent in the beautiful town of Cefalú, a lovely fishing port dominated by one of Sicily's finest Norman cathedrals. Now this town I really loved. I don't know why, but it had so much character and was just so pretty.CefalúThere were small, pretty beaches - uncrowded - and loads of interesting back streets to explore. All in all a lovely way to end our stay.As for our group, they were pretty nice. Well, I have usually found my travelling companions to be pleasant, to be honest. Of course there are always a couple that everyone tends to avoid like the plague but all in all they were a nice bunch. There was an 80 year old lady who was not a widow but who was the carer for her husband who suffered from both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The poor thing occasionally took a short break in order to get away from the constant strain of being a never-ending care giver. She did it willingly, of course, but 24/7 that has got to be so hard. Her name was Marion. Now I have a sister called Marion and a sister called Brenda, and I'm pretty sure I called her Brenda right up to the last day - but she didn't bat an eyelid! She was quite bent over and just a diddy little thing to begin with but she and I boogied on my birthday like there was no tomorrow. When it came time to doing The Twist and we had to go \"round and round and up and down\" she laughed and said she had a head start because she was already that much nearer the floor! What a lovely lady she was! There was also a very distinguished older chappie who was a former RAF fighter pilot. It was his first trip since losing his wife and he was quite quiet to begin with - very reserved - but even he came out of his shell a little by the end of the week. As you can see, I love my trips and I tend to really enjoy these people's company so maybe our Tour Manager was right - I might like to consider applying to become a Tour Manager myself at some point. The area I live in is a big draw for these kinds of tours - be it in the summer for the lakes or the winter for the skiing. Since I know the area and speak the language I would obviously have an advantage, although the Tour Manager is not the local guide, he just makes sure everyone gets on the right bus and nobody leaves their false teeth in a glass by the bed! Moreover, I like people (well most of them and can usually fake it till I make it with the others), so I am seriously giving it some thought - maybe next year after the wedding. Who knows, the world is your oyster isn't it!"},
{"title": "Sicily part deux!", "date": "Tuesday 9 October 2018", "text": "Before I post about the next part of my trip to Sicily, this morning I had my last \"MOT\" physical before retiring. I think I had mentioned before that I was getting pain in my jaw, down my neck and into my chest and since this can be symptomatic of a heart attack I decided to get it checked out. I came back with a clean bill of health from the cardiologist/hospital and also from the gynae, who nevertheless decided to send me for another mammogram just to be sure since I take HRT. Well for the second time in a row I got a male technician (which I found weird last time) but at least this one was taller as the last guy's eye line was just level with my nipple as he was trying to get my boob squashed between two transparent discuses! Sweet (or not). It is weird though staring down to see your boob looking like a pitta bread with a nipple isn't it! Still, at least that's over and done with. I had this done in the clinic where I had my second son and yet again I marvel at how spotlessly clean (and luxurious) this clinic is. Ok, it comes at the price of very expensive medical treatment in Switzerland but it really is spot on! I'm glad to say all is well, so I can only think the chest pain was coming from stress caused by grinding my teeth and my interminable commute - but that too will soon be sorted so what's not to love!After a short wait the lady radiologist came in to do more tests and give me my results. I had had her before and recognized her South African accent so when she asked me about a couple of red blotches on my chest I told her I had been bitten by mosquitoes in Sicily and cured the occasional spot of boredom by scratching them! She just laughed and started asking me about Sicily and became more and more interested when I told her it was a \"solos\" holiday - one of many! So then she started asking me about all my other \"solos\" trips and seemed very impressed. She told me that she was also divorced and her dream was to give up her job, get herself a camper van with wifi and become a \"mobile radiologist\"! Wow, that sounds pretty impressive doesn't it! She had been looking into a convoy trip across the desert in Morocco where campers are provided for you. You don't have to travel in convoy in actual fact, but the guide is always the last one to head through and she was really excited about the prospect, although she said she would be renting a van solo as she didn't want to share with anyone (I can understand that. I'm pretty sociable but need my own space also). So I told her that we had had a camper for 15 years when we were married and that the ex had got the camper in the divorce while I got the kids! She just roared laughing, but when I told her I had bought myself a camper after the divorce she became more interested. To be honest, I think my camping days are over as not having anyone to travel with at the time it wasn't so much fun, but we just yacked on and on and I swear my appointment overran by about 30 minutes! The upshot of all this is I walked away with her phone number and gave her mine. I told them at work that I had been for a mammogram and had come away with the doctor's phone number - haven't told 'em she was a \"she\", not a \"he\"! Let them assume what they want!Anyway, back to Sicily! After three nights in our first hotel we started making our way to the resort of Campfelice di Roccella, further north towards Palermo, where we would be staying for the rest of our trip. On the way there we stopped at another UNESCO World Heritage Site - the 4th century Roman Villa del Casale - a fascinating and complex collection of Roman mosaics. To be honest, we were unlucky in that it was a bit crowded (and pretty hot) but it was definitely worth it - such amazing mosaics and of course having a guide explain them was really worth it. You get so much more out of it with a local guide.The first bikinis - worn for sports!On the way there we visited Montreale and its stunning cathedral square. Some places, though, just had me start humming the theme from the Godfather in my head! You could really feel the atmosphere. We never did get to visit Corleone (Marlon Brando's namesake in the Godfather) but there was definitely an \"ambiance\"! To be fair though, our guide was saying that while the mafia still exists, of course, (as it does everywhere sadly) it is nowhere near as pervasive as it was in the 1980s and 90s, as a result of the murderous attacks on the likes of Judge Giovanni Falcone, the anti-mafia crusader who was blown up in his vehicle in 1992.The cathedral in MontrealeCorleoneI tell you, there was just so much to see that we were on the go constantly, so I suspect the rest will have to wait until another day! But would I recommend Sicily for a visit? Absolutely!"},
{"title": "Sicily!", "date": "Monday 8 October 2018", "text": "Well it's taken me a few days to get round to writing a bit about Sicily but things have been a bit \"hectic\" here trying to dodge the hit squad about my having handed in my resignation!I flew to London on the Friday to spend the night at the airport because our flight out to Sicily the next day was at some God awful time - 06.40 a.m. I think. Nothing like getting up at 3 a.m. to stand waiting for a bus back to the terminal at 4 a.m. but I made it. Knowing Gatwick Airport a bit better though, next time I will simply stay at the hotel in North Terminal as it is about 100 metres from the airport and it only takes maybe three minutes on the shuttle train to get to South Terminal so one less thing to worry about. On a slightly related note I have already got back to the travel company to say that it is ridiculous to have to fly to the UK in order to fly back east - it seems I'm not the only one because they have now \"seen the light\" and will be allowing people to make their own travel arrangements in future. Score then!We were met at the airport in Catania by our Turkish guide, Ayrtan, (yes Turkish, to show us round Sicily) and what a treasure he turned out to be. I have always had good guides on my trips to be fair, but some are more fun than others and I think he got it just right. He paced himself well and was very good with everyone but, as I later found out, he also loved to boogie!We checked into our hotel about an hour from the airport - a very large room in my case with a lovely view. Very nice too. I like a bit of luxury! And very sweetly, on my birthday, Ayrtan arranged for a bottle of plonk to be placed in my room! Now that's the way I like to celebrate!The view from my windowNext day it was up early (well, every day it was \"up early and off\" to be honest) to visit Mount Etna. Mounta Etna is a volcano and part of UNESCO World Heritage. It stands at 3,329m so we had to take a cable car up and then a 4x4 up to the top after that. To be honest (and I know I'm going to sound like a peasant) but it just seemed to be a lot of black sand to me! At the top there was a very small burst of steam but other than that it was very quiet, thankfully, because when those babies wake up you really hope they wake up in a good mood!Mount EtnaThen later that afternoon we set off to visit Taormina - a beautiful old town with a Greco-Roman theatre. A new friend and I set off to find the theatre but somehow managed to get lost in the back streets. I reckon we came within about 100 metres of it in the end but had to hot foot it back to the bus. Not to worry of course, because Sicily isn't exactly lacking in ancient relics (most were on our bus - in which group I now include myself of course)!The next day it was up early (again) and off to visit Syracuse and the old town of Ortigia with its Greek theatre carved into the hillside (see, I told you there were plenty of \"old relics\" to see)!Il Duomo - Syracuse CathedralI love looking at old buildings and ancient theatres, but I must admit I don't take too much in regarding dates etc. I mean, there's just too much to take in unless you want to make it a full-time job or have a burning interest in it. Suffice it to say Syracuse was just stunning but .... and this is where my interest really does get peaked ... inside this lovely Cathedral is buried the body of Father \"Pino\" Puglisi, a brave Catholic priest who set up schemes to try to get the young people of Sicily to pull away from the mafia and take another road. He knew the mafia would come for him eventually, and that they did. He was shot on his 57th birthday in 1993 but apparently the young man who killed him could not live with what he had done and so handed himself in to the authorities. He is now serving life in prison!  More to follow tomorrow.Father Giuseppe \"Pino\" Puglisi"},
{"title": "A message from Ian!", "date": "Friday 5 October 2018", "text": "Continuing with the seemingly never-ending saga of my resignation, my director called me in on Wednesday to say that he was \"worried\" about my resignation letter. When I asked him why he said because I had used the word \"resignation\" rather than \"early retirement\". So I asked what difference that made to the end result and he said that he thought that in the private sector \"resigning\" meant you lost all you repatriation benefits (I have expat benefits) and also your pension!  What a crock of BS! I just looked at him and said \"I wouldn't know what happens with people's repat benefits in the private sector but I find it hard to believe that someone would lose their pension rights because they resigned rather than retired. I mean, even the Swiss courts can't touch your pension fund. But in any case, aren't we lucky we work in the public sector\"!So I'm starting to smell a rat at this point but bloody hell, don't try to intimidate me - or baffle me with bullshit as we say - in an area that I spent the past 20 years working in!  The upshot is that he wanted me to change the word \"resign\" to \"retire\", but \"of course if you resign, the big boss can't refuse you - but you know, you might lose your repatriation benefits and your pension, whereas if you retire you maintain your rights to your repat benefits and your pension but here the big boss could refuse your request to take early retirement\"!!!! WTF. Is that the best crap you can come up with!When I pointed out that our chief economist took early retirement and even the last Pope got to \"retire\" early, I couldn't see why a little old secretary like me leaving would pose a problem. In reply to that I got \"work exigencies\"!!!! Oh for Pete's sake. So I pointed out that I had verbally forewarned him in July that I wanted to leave, that I had given them the requisite three months' notice and that by Christmas my heavy workload would be over and done with until it started picking up again in March/April. Now in April I do have a piddly little meeting but I told him that just working with S - the main economist for this meeting - was enough to make me want to leave as he is a bully and a twat. Moreover I told him that it was inadmissible that S could make girls cry and have them refuse to work with him in future. He doesn't bother me because I will tell him where to shove it, but did he realize that S was harassing people, to which my director replied \"I know\". So bloody hell - eye roll here please - I said \"you know he is harassing people and you do nothing about it! What does that make you look like\"! At this point he nearly slid under the desk, but when he got up he asked me if I would \"speak to S about it\"!!!!! What the flip! To which I replied \"you're the director, that's not my job\"! Bloody hell, will someone please stop me from banging my head against the wall or even just shoot me to put me out of my misery!Anyway, the moral of the above is don't try to intimidate someone who knows more about the subject than you do and especially don't try to BS a menopausal woman! I was fit to explode when I left his office so I told my supervisor that even if he came in and offered me full-time working from home he could shove it where the sun don't shine - intimidate me. That'll be the day!On an only slightly related noted, remember my friend Ian who died suddenly in April - well I got the thumbs up from him on Wednesday night too! Seriously. I'm seemingly at the unfortunate stage in my life where I pretty much have to get up once a night to go to the loo. Well on Wednesday night (or more correctly, Thursday morning I suppose) I woke up around 3 a.m. because I needed to use the bathroom. So I leaned over and tapped my phone to see what time it was and saw that there was a message there.  A FB message of some kind but I needed my glasses to see who it was from. So I put the light on, dashed off to the bathroom, put my glasses on and picked up my phone - and it was a message from Ian!  I kid you not! I have no idea how that happened but I remember writing a message to him on FB which got \"zapped\" somehow. So I wrote him again and said \"sorry, my message disappeared into cyberspace somehow\" or words to that effect and Ian's thumb's up/smiley face emoji came back as the response AT 3 A.M. LAST THURSDAY MORNING. He was buried on 4 May!  Good grief. I suppose it somehow got caught up in some kind of time warp as I don't think anyone would be in his FB account so many months later or if so, why at 3 in the morning? But you know what, it was actually a real pleasure to get that message from him - weird of course - but a pleasure. I wasn't dreaming/drunk/drugged at all - I was wide awake and that message stayed on my phone for about a minute before it disappeared. Wow, I can't find it on FB messenger but I know I sent the incoming message to him. Anyway, my take on that is he was giving me the thumbs up for resigning (or should that be \"retiring\") because he took that leap of faith and left England with just his van and his tools in 2011 in order to escape the rat race. He loved his life in Bulgaria and had no intention of moving back to England. I'm sorry he didn't get to live that life longer but I'm so glad that he did indeed get to \"live that life\". So if you're \"reading\" this Ian, thanks for the encouragement mate!"},

He's not in today (but reads his emails) so I might be going up to bat tomorrow. Oh well, we'll see!I know I shouldn't look on FB but sometimes I just do (and then usually wish I hadn't). My delusional/insane/demented ex just posted words to the effect of \"crying a few tears while slagging a man off and ruining his reputation - she should be subject to the same grilling as him\" (in respect of the Kavanaugh/Ford drama), and then getting to see all the \"hoorah\" comments from his half-wit \"friends\" makes my blood boil. I don't know who is telling the truth as I wasn't there but she comes over very well and I have personally been on the receiving end of men like that who think with their dicks. You know what they say about some men - \"there's only enough blood in the male body to support one head, and the one above the shoulders rarely wins\"! Kinda like the guy who once said to me as a young girl that if I wanted my contract renewed I should \"know what to do\"! Even then I had the presence of mind to say \"yeah, go straight to Personnel\" and his \"little member\" shriveled before my eyes! Yay me!The most tempting thing to me was to scan a copy of the domestic violence judgement I have against my ex and post it on his timeline, but of course it's best not to rise to the bait! I don't know if he is delusional or is still telling himself that \"it never happened\" (it did, frequently, and I had the bruises and the court judgement to prove it). God help us all, is all I can say!On a slightly more pleasant note, I finally got my new balcony railings and side gate put in while I was away. Sylvain, the young genius who did it for me, had warned me in advance that it would take ages as he had so much work (good for him). I'd say it's slightly OTT but I love it anyway, especially as I back on to a dairy farm, and if I do find it a bit \"too much\" I can actually unscrew and remove some of the animals. I sent a photo to my friend, \"minimalist Steve\", in England and asked if it was OTT, to which he responded \"just a tad\"! So now I know I got it right then!More on Sicily tomorrow (I've just got to get my resignation letter in)!"},

{"title": "Well that went well - errr not!!!!", "date": "Thursday 20 September 2018", "text": "To say my request to telecommute went down like a lead balloon would be an understatement!!! Man oh man, the French have got to give me French citizenship now as I have them all manning the barricades. I made a written request asking for a partial telecommuting arrangement because of my commute from hell, its negative effect on my health and quoting the relevant organization policy. You could hear the very loud intake of breath from the director when he received it as he hates these arrangements with a vengeance. Trouble is, I had been asked by my supervisor what would it take to make me stay on rather than retire so I asked for a 50% telecommuting arrangement with the obvious proviso that I would be available in work when necessary - that goes without saying. Well I not only got a very resounding \"no\" but now colleagues who had been benefiting from such arrangements are being told they now have to come back 100% and work from the office. There is uproar. I feel bad to have been the catalyst for this but in the end I was not prepared to potentially be accorded this right but have to hide it from the others. As far as I'm concerned it has to be up front or not at all. And in any case, I am ready to retire so I have nothing to lose!I think my director doesn't know what has hit him. Some very, very unhappy people are coming up to me complaining so I guess somebody had to \"pierce that boil\" as the French say. My supervisor just asked me 10 minutes ago to go away on holiday and come back with the minimum arrangement I could accept and he will run with it. In the meantime, some very ballsy women colleagues have also gone up to bat against the director. Lordy, lordy, that was never my intention but .... there are obviously some very unhappy people in this division!Anyway, I can't go into more detail as I have work to finish before I head off for my flight to Sicily (yay me). I don't know what the outcome will be but in the end I'm not unhappy that it has happened. There was obviously festering resentment that has now been bought out into the open. We'll see I guess. I may or may not be able to post from Sicily as I will be on my ipad, but until then, man the barricades and vive la révolution!"},
{"title": "Oh cripes!", "date": "Friday 14 September 2018", "text": "Oh sometimes I hate being a Libran! Really, seriously! Whenever I have major decisions to make I go over and over them endlessly until I am comfortable with my decision and then go for it. Buuuuutttt, to put a spanner in my future plans I know my immediate supervisor is very very upset about my wanting to retire and two days ago he called me in to his office and said for me to tell him exactly what it would take for me to stay a little longer and he will go up to bat against the Director to get it for me!!! Crikey! And oh bugger! After so many years working together my supervisor, P, trusts me and my colleague totally when it comes to getting the work done. Additionally P is going through a rough patch right now so if ever there was poor timing for me to go (from his point of view) it is now!  A couple of years ago I asked W, the Director, if I could work 80% or telecommute because my 3+ hour daily commute (on a good day) is killing me. He said no. He is totally, totally against either and said that while some people already work part-time or telecommute that was accorded to them during the time of the previous director and he didn't want to \"go there\". Don't get me wrong, W is a very nice person but you can tell that he has never had to dash off to the day-care by 6 p.m., never had to race around grocery shopping in his lunch hour and never had to worry about feeding and bathing the kids in the evening so I think it is totally unfair (not to mention archaic) of him to be so dogmatic. Anyway, P told me to name what I wanted and he was prepared to go see W and throw a hissy fit (he will too) to get me what I ask for. Oh bloody hell!I told P that I had already had my appointment with the tax guy and that on Saturday I have an appointment with the bank and that I would let him know on Monday what I wanted to do, if anything. So I gave it a lot of thought and initially thought maybe working from home on Mondays and Tuesdays, but then thought no, if I am going to telecommute it would make my life much easier to work from home five mornings a week then come in to work from lunchtime onwards. Yesterday I had a cardiologist's appointment so left home later and instead of the usual 45 minutes to one hour to get to the border it took me 20 minutes!  All that stress for the sake of trying to get in to work on time!But then I got to thinking that it wasn't up to P to go in to the Director and start banging the table, it was for me to ask for what I wanted and take it from there. So yesterday I drafted a very good (in my opinion) memo to the Director requesting 50% telecommuting, quoting the relevant company policy which very strongly encourages this and asking for equivalent treatment to my colleagues who already benefit from this arrangement. I haven't sent it yet as I want to wait until Monday, but I wanted to put it in writing (as I write better than I speak) and so that he has to answer me in writing and then I (and P) can take it further if need be. The fact that probably 30% of the staff in HR telecommute just adds fuel to my fire. I honestly don't know what the director will say as I think I may be boxing him in to a corner but we'll see.  I know for a fact that there will shortly be a directors' meeting where the \"big boss\" will be making it quite clear that this is the way he wishes to go forward. I also know that our medical service have been questioning our staff about directors' attitudes to these requests so who knows.  As I say, W is a nice guy but in this respect I believe he is totally in the wrong. Just my opinion though! Watch out for the fireworks next week!I think I mentioned previously that I have been scheduling various medical check-ups in the run up to retirement as I have been putting a few of them off for too long. In the past month or so I had been feeling discomfort in my chest and jaw and know that this can be a symptom of heart problems as my dad had many heart attacks. I am convinced it is stress-related linked to my commute but made an appointment to see a cardiologist yesterday and oh the shame! Said cardiologist is drop-dead gorgeous as far as I am concerned so picture me topless, with wires attached all over my torso pedaling away on a stress-test bicycle with my boobs resting on my knees and Dr. Gorgeous standing next to me talking about Brexit! Oh la honte as they say over here (oh the shame). Now I know he is used to this but me .... what we women have to go through eh. On top of that I have the gynae on Monday so more of the same I expect. Anyway, Dr. Gorgeous told me that my heart was fine but since my dad had his first heart attack at the age of 48 I was classed as \"at risk\" for hereditary heart disease so I have to go for a scan next Wednesday when the results of my blood tests are in. This will be to test for cholesterol and related blockages in the arteries, just in case. I'm happy to be doing it anyway and I can only thank the powers that be that I have wonderful medical insurance and it is all covered!And finally, I wanted to make a \"get well soon\" card for Steve, in view of his recent shock diagnosis, so I printed off the picture below and sent it to him in the form of a card. Thankfully he has the same sense of humour as I do so took it in good part. So far he is doing well and says he is feeling \"normal\" - I told him to dash off to the doctor's quick as he wasn't \"normal\" beforehand! Long may it last in any case. Fingers crossed!"},

And wouldn't you know, Thursday being the official holiday, it decided to rain - after days and days of glorious sunshine. That's not to say it stopped what seemed to be the entire population of Geneva from getting out and about though - Thursday seems to be the day that all of Geneva says \"hey, it's a holiday and the French are still working so how about we pop down to Annecy and enjoy the lake\" - so that's how you end up meeting half your colleagues in Annecy on the Thursday of Jeûne Genevois! Not that I'm complaining though, as I decided I wasn't going to do anything that day, or more to the point, I had an appointment with the French tax accountant to see how my calculations matched up against his figures with a view to retiring at Christmas. Well I have to say my figures were spot on with one major exception!!! Pension - check, tax calculation - check, but oh the lump sum!!!! Now I had calculated a 7.5% tax on the lump sum - which is correct - but in addition there is an obscure, newish tax that I was afraid of - the CGS - which is applicable in addition to the 7.5% tax that I had calculated and bugger me if it doesn't bring my tax bill on the lump sum to almost 21%!!!! That was a shock I can tell you. I had wanted to take €132,000 to pay off my house, put in a new heating system and re-do the bathrooms and so on and have a little left over just in case. Well out of that €132,000 the French tax man wants to take just over €30,000 so I have to admit I went a bit weak and wobbly at the knees. The very nice tax accountant said it would be madness to pay that and suggested instead that I refinance the remainder of the outstanding mortgage back to its original expiry date of 10 years from now, take a full pension and continue to pay the mortgage. Ooooooorrrrr, why not do another 15 months at work, pay the mortgage off totally and live like a queen! I could have cried - I really have my heart set on going at Christmas so once I had picked myself up off the floor I started running through my options. In any case I have an appointment at the bank this Saturday and will see what she suggests but if it can't be sorted to my satisfaction I think I might just bite the bullet, pay the (daylight robbery) tax and live relatively well on what's left. We'll see by next week I guess but yikes, really yikes!!Theeeeeennnnn on Saturday I had a call from Steve in the U.K. In a previous post I mentioned how we had planned to go out one day but ended up not being able to as he had an appointment come through for a scan at Liverpool hospital, so I ended up spending the afternoon at the hospital reading while waiting about four hours for him to get done with his scan. Anyway, the last time I spoke to him he hadn't had his results but by this Saturday he had already been on chemo for a week!!!! Yep, without going into too much personal detail he is being treated for cancer and will continue to do so probably up until Christmas!!! I had thought he wasn't his usual madcap self when I was there in August so I guess having that niggle on his mind was what was behind it! From what I have heard it is a very treatable cancer assuming they caught it in time - a bit like prostate cancer, I guess, although it's not that. But to say he was shell-shocked is an understatement. And to my mind this is another reason to go ahead and retire at Christmas rather than wait until \"things get better\". What with Ian dying in May and then my friend Penny dying in July (both unexpected) I'm thinking \"oh for God's sake go, what are you waiting for\". Now don't get me wrong, I have every belief, sincerely, that Steve will be fine, but it's not me facing the treatment it's him, so I just wish I could transfuse some of my positivity and ship it over to him. Not to say he isn't positive - he is - but it was a hard blow to assume out of the blue! Fingers and toes (and anything else you can think of) crossed!I didn't do much for the rest of the weekend - which annoyed me in the end because after Thursday we had such glorious weather, so on Sunday I decided that I would trot up to my son's place as I had some paperwork for him and find out how his first week had gone at his new job! It looks to be great! He is working for a fairly large company (indeed they are looking to recruit even more plumbers) and he already has his works' van, his works' mobile phone, credit card and iPad which he just \"taps\" and it sets out his next job and what the potential diagnostic is. He is being shadowed for his second week by a senior guy and then next week there will be two rookies together to see how they get on. It is only 10 minutes from home and is already waaaaayyy less physically demanding than his previous job for about the same money! The biggest thing that seemed to excite him was his daily lunch allowance of up to €18 per lunch whereby he pays for his lunch, takes a photo of the bill and sends it by iPad to the main office who will reimburse him! Pretty cool eh! I genuinely didn't think he would be unemployed for long (one month in total but he managed to get some temporary work in there) and there really is no such thing as an unemployed plumber is there, but I have to say I think we were all relieved when he signed his new contract!Anyway, as we were leaving I asked if he could suggest any local spots where D and I might get up the mountains for a bit of sun (not that it's not sunny \"down here\"). We have all the usual beauty spots where we routinely take visitors of course but given what a stunning area we live in I wanted to try somewhere else - and boy did we strike it lucky again. About 30 minutes from home is a place called Agy where there is great hiking in the summer and cross-country and Nordic skiing in the winter. There was loads of parking at the little restaurant so D and I decided to treat ourselves to lunch before hiking the short distance to the top for what is apparently a panoramic view of the Mont Blanc.  Exceeeeept, dingbat here had put her hiking shoes by the front door, loaded up the rest of her stuff and promptly set off to her son's in her flip-flops, completely forgetting about the hiking boots by the front door. So I ended up looking like the proverbial tourist trotting off up the mountains in my flip-flops! And true to form, about 10 minutes from the top, my flip-flops broke and I couldn't go any further!!!!! D went on ahead for a while but decided to turn back and watch me hobble back to the parking lot like the Hunchback of Notre Dame!!  Oh well, maybe this Sunday.Flip-flops - what the best dressed hikers are wearing these days! And finally, just before lunch today I bumped into V - a lovely German colleague. She had had her hair cut and coloured and I remarked how much it suited her. She said that she had had it cut at the hairdresser's but that she had coloured it herself. Trouble was, when she was shaking the bottle of colour with the setting solution to get it properly mixed she had been a bit too \"enthusiastic\", did a weird movement and had hurt her back - said back having been hurting all over the long weekend! Now frankly, (a) she is German so I guess you have to expect that kind of \"enthusiasm\" but (b) I told her if it had been me I would have said it happened while I was in training for my next extreme sports event! I mean, how do you hurt your back colouring your hair? Beats me!"},
{"title": "MIA again!", "date": "Wednesday 5 September 2018", "text": "I've been missing in action for a little while as I'm frantically busy at work and I think my computer is also on the blink as it has been pretty painful trying to log on here.So what's been happening? Well the other Saturday night two friends and I went to see Simply Theatre's \"The Best\". This is the theatre group made up of youngsters studying the performing arts. They are aged 18 and under and do a wonderful job. I have no idea where they get their confidence from  because I could never do what they do even assuming I had half the talent - which I don't! While it wasn't my favourite (that accolade still goes to their performance of the Addams Family) it was still very good. It was a show which incorporated some of the best songs from hit shows but I think where it fell a little flat for me was that they weren't my favourites! Talk about picky! But I mean, if you talk about the Rocky Horror Show it's got to be the Time Warp Dance hasn't it. Still, as I say, they were excellent and the young girls that sang Evita's \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" and \"Memory\" from Cats really pulled it off. A couple of the young men had incredibly good voices too, although I did find the one \"sexy\" performance by two young lads a bit uncomfortable - I mean, you really can't do \"sexy\" when you haven't even hit puberty can you! Still that's not a criticism of their performances, they were great, it's just maybe the choice of song that I thought odd!Then last Saturday we had our \"monthly\" board game evening, which was again at my place. Since I was the first person to host this we have obviously come full circle already! We ended up being only 10 as a few people were still away but gosh what a noise we made. Jen had bought along a new game where you picked two cards and had to mime the \"afflictions\" that were indicated on them - for instance every time Valerie spoke she had to do it like she was speaking to her lover, stroking his cheek with a squishy voice and all that. Trouble was she was doing that to Isabelle's husband, Philippe. Philippe had to be Valerie's \"imaginary friend\" who she had to get to say a certain word. Difficult to describe I suppose but it was hilarious, particularly the more wine we drank (I wonder why that was?)!!!! Our next evening will be held at Valerie's because she lives at over 1,000 metres altitude and we wanted to make it to her place before the snows hit. Our group does seem to be growing in popularity somewhat as Jen asked if she could bring a friend (obviously not a problem as it was at my place) but then on the Sunday I dropped in at my oldest son's place to give him his birthday presents and they asked if they could join! Little buggers, they had been included in the initial invite over a year ago and never responded. Still, if they want to come I'm hardly going to say no am I and it is a great way to see my kids! At that point we might be 18 which I think is pretty much the limit to entertain in someone's house but we'll see how it goes.Talking of André and Lily they came back from Sicily (which is where I'm going in two weeks' time for my birthday) and in a couple of weeks are heading back out to the American \"west\". Not quite sure what their itinerary is but they are going to be covering a helluva lot of miles, but then they both love it. All I know is that Lily is organizing it all and that they will be landing in Denver, heading for their \"main attraction\" of Utah and leaving from San Francisco. She has all the places they want to visit mapped out (which in their case includes hiking up to eight hours a day) but they do indeed have some wonderful photos from their last visit in March. Do it while you can afford it and before the little 'uns come along is all I can say!And talking of my birthday (we were weren't we), I have decided to line up a few doctors' appointments to get a complete check-up before I retire. When I called the cardiologist's I explained to the receptionist that I was already a patient but had changed my name. When she asked me to confirm my date of birth I said 24 September 1958 and she said \"oh, so the big one's coming up isn't it\"! I told her not to remind me but she assured me that it would have been fine (for her) if the following week she hadn't received advertising for funeral expenses and incontinence pads! Ain't that the truth! When I hit 50 all of a sudden the advertising coming my way was no longer for push-up bras and stockings but support socks and adult diapers!!! So I asked her if she had received any magazines giving out free 1950s knitting patterns yet but when she said not I told her I would bring her some on the day of my appointment! The \"sad\" thing is, I wouldn't mind taking up knitting when I retire! Still she was a very friendly receptionist and she kinda made my day!And yet again talking of being an \"old fogie\", yesterday I bumped into a lovely colleague who I hadn't seen for quite some time. He was the lovely guy who took me out dancing after my husband left me. It was a Thursday night, I couldn't dance for toffee but we danced until four in the morning. When I told him I was on my knees but that I would seem him later at work he just said \"oh, I took the day off\"!!! So 30 years after the last time I pulled such a stunt I ended up pulling an all-nighter! I can't believe I ever used to do that on a regular basis. Anyway, I hadn't been able to catch a coffee with Jean (he is French/Lebanese) in ages as someone always ended up cancelling - so he asked if I wanted to have a \"quickie\" next week, \"you know about 30 minutes\". I burst out laughing and said \"hey in my book that would be more of a marathon than a quickie but why not. Anything has got to be better than three pumps and a slump! His English is excellent but I'm not sure he actually knew what a \"quickie\" was! I guess I'll have to meet him for coffee next week and explain, just in case. Oh dear, what a let down. He only meant coffee!Anyway, Thursday and Friday are public holidays here in Geneva so I will enjoy my last long weekend before the Christmas break. Yikes, fancy talking about Christmas already - how depressing!"},
{"title": "Back in the saddle!", "date": "Monday 20 August 2018", "text": "I got back from England on Saturday afternoon after just a week away to see family and Steve, my friend \"up north\". It was a pretty quiet week actually but I don't mind as, to be honest, I don't go to England for the scenery or the weather (which is just as well eh)!Before I left home I made sure to empty the bins, turn the water heater off and so on and finally got round to throwing away a loaf of sliced bread that I had had for ages! I know that sounds an odd thing to say but I rarely eat sliced bread and must have bought this loaf, oh, about five months ago. I noticed that it didn't seem to be going off so decided that I was going to keep it until ... well until it just walked out the door of its own accord I suppose. You see, I don't know if you have heard stories about how \"dead bodies are now so full of preservatives that they are no longer decaying\"! Well I was intrigued by this idea, but given the amount of chemical preservatives in our food I wouldn't be at all surprised. So I decided to keep the bread and just keep checking it out from time to time. I swear, five months later that sucker was just beginning to get a few \"mites\" inside the packaging (I kept it well wrapped up of course)! But seriously, how on earth can you keep \"fresh\" bread for five months without it going off. It makes you think doesn't it!Anyway, back to the plot. I flew into London on Saturday then caught the bus up to Dorset to spend a couple of days with my sister and her family. It was nice and relaxing, we did a bit of shopping (oh my God the prices!!!) and also got together with her daughter and grandchildren. Talking of prices, I hadn't had my eyes checked for three years and knew that I needed new glasses but didn't think I would have enough time to get that done in the two full days I was in Dorset - but not a bit of it! My neighbour told me that she had just paid €750 for one pair of glasses!!!!! and while I have insurance I really didn't feel like paying those kinds of ridiculous prices when I could get them so much cheaper in the U.K. The good news (for me at least) was that I was able to make an appointment for the Sunday after I got there - try that over here in France! Ha, what a joke - and then pick them up 24 hours later! The eye exam cost me just £25 (as compared to about £200 equivalent the last time I went to the optician in Switzerland) and two pairs of glasses took me about seven minutes to select (as I really don't care that much) and cost me just £89!!! Wow. On top of that I will get 90% back through my medical insurance anyway, so as my sister said, it was worth flying to England for that alone!!!!  Let's hope Brexit doesn't knock the stuffing out of those prices, but sadly I fear it probably will!On the Tuesday I caught the train to Southampton and then flew up to Manchester to spend a few days with Steve, and you know what, we didn't do an awful lot but it was very nice. Just chilling, lazing around reading and then going out for dinner and so on. We had been invited to a friend of his for dinner the one night but Steve finally got a hospital appointment at Liverpool Hospital the same day so we had to cancel, fearing that we would be late getting back. So while he was in for his scan I spent a few hours in and around Liverpool, but mainly just sitting in the hospital waiting room reading another hilarious book by John O'Farrell - Things Can Only Get Better - or eighteen miserable years in the life of a labour supporter! It is great. It's a factual book about  his younger years in the Labour Party but since John is a comedy writer it is also very, very funny. I think I'm going to send it to my nephew as he is a \"rampant\" Labour Party supporter and actually works in the Labour Party archives in Manchester! A good read if you are a Brit!Anyway, we did manage to get up off the sofa long enough to go to the Southport Flower Show, and very good it was too. Just my kind of thing, in fact, as I loved the flowers, the garden ornaments and so on, but especially the displays of hydroponics (or is that \"aquaponics\" - I think that may be French). Absolutely fascinating stuff (to me). The flowers were stunningly beautiful of course, and it was quite moving to see the rose developed in honour of Saffie Roussos, the youngest victim of the Manchester Ariana Grande concert!Photo - Manchester Evening NewsAfter a while we drifted over to a small \"arena\" to watch a display of sheepdog training. I have a soft spot for border collies as we had a \"border collie mutt\" when I was growing up, and boy are they intelligent. Anyway, with Cornish pastie in one hand and a beer in the other we made our way over to the \"arena\" to stand and watch in the rain - boy we know how to live it up don't we! We were just looking for somewhere to sit (there were plenty of spaces actually) when I felt a whack in my back and turned round to see an old biddy in a wheelchair waving her walking stick at me and mumbling black magic!!! Seriously, we hadn't even stood still for oh, what, five seconds and I got whacked in the back. The woman I took to be her daughter was mortified, Steve was furious but I just burst out laughing. I figure we'll all be old crones one day and in any case it must suck to be her!Photo - ShutterstockSince the weather wasn't great, we also decided to visit some show homes on the latest housing development just behind Steve's place. Actually they weren't bad at all. We made out I was retiring at Christmas (true) and moving back to England (not true) and so we got to look around a 2-bedroomed apartment and a 3-bedroomed house. They were small - particularly compared to the amount of space I have here in France - but they were nice! Big enough for one person certainly, and after the prices down in Dorset I just could not believe how cheap they were! I don't really know the north of England (well not much north of the Lake District anyway) but by golly you get more bang for your buck up north! I'm not sure Steve would like me moving quite so close (I assured him I wasn't even considering it) but even he enjoyed looking around as his daughter is trying (and as yet, failing) to sell her apartment in order to buy something with her partner, so it was interesting for him to see what was available.Anyway, all good things must come to an end and I had a seamless journey back to a very warm and beautiful Switzerland/France. Got caught up on all the washing and grocery shopping and am \"hot to trot\" as they say and hoping to get caught up with my blog reading. But oh, I must finish with the joke that won the top spot at the Edinburgh Fringe:\"Working in a job centre must be so stressful. I mean, if you get fired for whatever reason you still have to go back the next day\"!  Subtle right!"},
{"title": "Mickey Flanagan Peeping (or Neighbours part deux)!", "date": "Friday 10 August 2018", "text": "So thinking the other day about our relationships with our neighbours (we were weren't we?), I decided to post Mickey Flanagan's \"peeping\" solution to the eternally British problem of how many times a day do you have to say \"good morning\" to your neighbours?  I apologize in advance for any non-Brits who find him hard to understand - he does get a little easier as it goes on! But this is brilliant.Anyway, the reason all this came up was because I was chatting to Steve on Wednesday night, discussing my trip to the UK next week where I will be flying \"up North\" to see him. He was saying how funny he found it that my neighbours just pop in and out of my house (some have keys) and how we seem to be so much more friendly over here (in France) than in Britain - less reserved - who knows. He said he has lived in his place for 18 years and while he says \"good morning\" à la Mickey Flanagan, he doesn't know most of his neighbours' names and has never been in any of their homes!!! I just find that stunning since we routinely get together for drinks/apéros on our little island and, as I have mentioned before, a group of 16 of us hold board game evenings in each other's homes roughly once a month - it's my turn next, on 1 September!My theory has always been that in hot countries people sit outside more and chat, whereas in colder countries (and let's face it, England is usually cold and wet) people don't have that option. Well, that's my theory anyway, but for those of you who are of a somewhat more reserved nature, I give you Mickey F's solution!I stumbled across this youtube video the other day and thought it was hilarious. I have taken the liberty of typing in sub-titles, not because I mean to belittle this woman's accent (I happen to like it - Geordie (Newcastle) I think, but I may be losing my touch) but because I think for some non-Brits she may be hard to understand! I apologize in advance for the swear words - hers not mine - but I still think she's funny!*****Hallo, I bring to you, the weirdest thing. I've lived, like, in the same house for 14 years and my neighbours next door, Mavis and George, so I thought ... well recently George died. Bless him, he was 80-odd, and, like, I was talking to Mavis and that and I gave her a vodka and orange over the fence [seems that's how you offer condolences up North] and, like, I've got on with them for 14 years. And then I was talking to another lady over the road and I goes \"how's Mavis doing?\" She goes over to visit her in number 3.She said \"who's Mavis?\"I said \"you what?\" I said \"Mavis, my neighbour\".She went \"you haven't got a neighbour called Mavis\".I said \"I have. Mavis. George's wife who just died\".She said, she goes, \"oh do you mean Sylvia?\"I said \"who's Sylvia?\"She said \"George's wife\".Well you could have blew me over with a bloody thingy, something light. I said \"is that her name?\"She said \"yeah\".I said \"eeeeyyy, I've called her Mavis for 14 years\".Shirley, the other f....r, she goes \"well when you've called her Mavis doesn't she say anything? Has she not said nowt?\"I said \"no\". And the more I thought about it ... because I'm, like, \"all right Mavis\". \"All right Steph yeah\". Every year I've sent Christmas cards and ... yeah well most years ... I was busy in 2014, [f.... off Lucy - must be talking to the dog] I've sent Christmas cards \"Merry Christmas Mavis and George\" and I've had them back off her saying \"lots of love to Steph and Ian from Mavis and George\". And her f.....ing name's Sylvia. I never knew. So what do I do now? Do I just keep calling her Mavis? What do I do? I daren't go out the house in case I bump into her. The weirdest thing ever!!  Love you, bye."},
{"title": "Another amazing find!", "date": "Monday 30 July 2018", "text": "I think I mentioned a couple of months ago that I wanted to start getting out and about rediscovering my local area because there really is so much around here as yet undiscovered (by me). I did a previous post on our trip to Chanaz and how lovely that was. Well last weekend I thought vaguely about going down to les Jardins Secrets (the Secret Gardens) about 40 minutes from here, but to be honest it was just waaay too hot and I kind of flaked out! Anyway, a friend asked me if I fancied a trip out there this Sunday, so seeing as it wasn't that far (about 40 minutes away) and it wouldn't be an \"all day event\" in the current scorching temperatures, we set off at 11 a.m. for a small village called Vaulx, just the other side of Annecy. And my oh my what a(nother) treasure we found! I really wasn't expecting much but I have to say it beat all expectations. Not just ours of course, but everyone we passed seemed to be stunned. It all started out in the early '80s when N (a French lady who was born in Morocco) and A (a French gent who was born in Tunisia) got married and bought what I understand was a derelict farm in this area (the Haute Savoie region of France). Veeeerrrrryyyy slowly they renovated the farm into a home for themselves and their three daughters and, given their innate love of North Africa, slowly renovated various barns and out-buildings into meadows/gardens, or \"riyads\", by their Arabic name. Painstakingly over the years A built the different structures while his wife, N, added the ornate Arab-style decorations. It was all done by hand and as their daughters grew older they also pitched in (as do the eight grandchildren who were all working there yesterday). It was a scorching hot day but there were bench seats, tables, water fountains, and the most beautiful flowers and decorations imaginable. (As an aside, we discovered that there were eight water features, each with the name of one of the grandchildren engraved on it). People were invited to sit and shelter wherever they wanted, open up doors into all the nooks and crannies behind which were inevitably family photos and other treasures. It was a real gem - sadly I don't think the photos do it justice, but here are just a few that I took!  There were little rooms off all the pathways where you were free to roam and open doors and cupboards to your heart's content!I think my favourite spots though were the \"lounging\" rooms, all decorated in Arab style where you were invited to just sit down out of the sun and take it all in. I walked into one room, though, and my jaw just dropped! They had the typical beds and cushions for people to lie on but had also put a swimming pool right in the middle of it, with ornate water features constantly drizzling water back into the pool. Of course running water is a very relaxing sound and frankly I think I could have just lay down and spent the rest of the afternoon there!This pretty table had just been a simple, white garden table before they repainted it in all these glorious colours. Actually, I wish I had been quick enough to catch my friend, Karyn's face, as she walked into the pool room! That jaw drop would have been great to catch on camera - we all did it though - it was just stunning!They have also (apparently only recently) started doing light lunches, which are proving a roaring success too. I had salad with local dried meats and cheeses plus a wonderful cocktail of apple juice, blackcurrant juice and lemonade. Karyn had the same but with a very simple dessert thrown in and lovely Moroccan mint tea! The grandkids seemed to be in charge of the cooking and washing up, and they were all extremely friendly and helpful. We were also lucky enough to see the grandparents (the original founders) helping out as the crowds were coming at them thick and fast! The thing is though, you never felt \"crowded\" as there were so many little nooks and crannies where you could take shelter from the sun in peace and relative quiet! It was truly brilliant!You know, I admire people like this for their creativity but also for their guts in \"going for it\". I think if I tried to do something like this it would end up as one big colourful, splotchy mess, but here it just works! Ok they have been developing it for over 30 years but it truly is a fabulous site!  I don't have this kind of space or creativity but some of the flowers there have given me pause for thought. First on the list has got to be \"hibiscus des marais\"! I'm not sure what they are called in English. \"Hibiscus\" to be sure, but \"des marais\" (from the swampland? swamp rose mallow?). Who knows, but these hibiscus grow to about 1.5 metres tall with the flowers measuring approximately 12 inches across (how about that for a mix of metric and imperial!)That's not me, by the way, but at least it shows the size of these flowers!And finally, I think I know why I was a bit nostalgic/melancholy in my last post! I have been cleaning off a couple of bookshelves and wiping down old photo albums that were a bit dusty. So of course the first thing you do with an old photo album is look through it isn't it. Anyway, it got to me a bit in the end - I was feeling a bit sad - all that \"wasted/lost\" time I guess. Now it's not like me to be down but it really seemed to hit me the other day. Well that is until we had our fabulous day out at the Secret Gardens and then Steve called me later that evening and had me roaring laughing again, so all's well that ends well!"},
{"title": "A blast from the past!", "date": "Friday 27 July 2018", "text": "Or isn't fate wonderful sometimes! I mentioned in a previous post that in 2010 I happened to spot my best childhood buddy, Ian, on the now defunct \"Friends Reunited\", reconnected with him and flew out to spend time with him after he upped sticks and moved to Bulgaria. We remained in admittedly sporadic contact after that and then I learned of his tragic death in May of this year. I'm just so, so glad that he got to spend the last years of his life enjoying Bulgaria and that we had re-connected in the meantime! Fate huh!Before I got married I had had two long-term boyfriends - Mark, in England and Karim in Switzerland. Mark had lost his dad when he was just a teenager and my dad took to him and took him under his wing somewhat. When I went to Switzerland for a \"five-month contract\" in 1980 (40 years later I'm still here) Mark and I split, obviously, because I knew I wasn't going back to England and he didn't see a future for himself in Switzerland. If that \"minor\" issue could have been resolved I'm sure we would have ended up married actually. Oddly enough, fate again played a hand because in 2005, out of the blue, I received an email from Mark. When my dad retired he gave Mark all his tools and Mark said he had been using dad's tools one day and thinking how good my dad had been to him, so he decided to track me down and to find out how he was. I had to explain to him that sadly dad had died a few months previously but it was really weird that Mark had chosen that particular time to get in touch again, 25 years later. He wrote a lovely email about how much he appreciated my dad so I sent it on to my mom - who was very, very touched! Now Mark being a plumber and not exactly the Poet Laureate the emails fizzled out not long after that and I don't have any further news from him, but I'm sure if we did get in touch again we'd still be friends and have plenty to say to each other. I'm sure also that that very decent young man turned into a lovely husband for one lucky woman!A few months after I moved to Switzerland in 1980 I met Karim, an Algerian medical student, and we quickly became an item. We were together five years, with him graduating after about three years and going on to become a surgeon. Karim had actually been born in France and therefore had French citizenship, but since his dad had fought in the Algerian resistance against the French during the war of independence in 1963 he was, understandably, very anti-French, so gave up Karim's French citizenship in order for him to be solely Algerian! I understand that of course, but when you are living in Europe it is a helluva lot easier to have a European passport than a North African one I can tell you! Anyway, the years rolled by and I got the feeling that I wasn't as much of a priority for Karim as he was for me, and then his dad dropped the bombshell on him. He was going to send him back to Algeria to do two years' national service (something which Karim could very easily have gotten out of)! As Karim later explained, it was a total, total waste of time, but more importantly the years he had been accruing towards acquiring Swiss citizenship now got screwed over, and the job he had lined up also passed under his nose because of his prospective two-year absence.  I had been getting more and more frustrated in our relationship and actually resigned in 1983 in order to spend six months in Australia so I could decide what I wanted to do about him. I mean, how can you \"complain\" when someone is so nice but it just isn't working for you! Technically we \"split\" when I came back as he had met someone else, but when I explained that that was fair enough with me because I had too, he changed his mind instantly and wanted to get back together again - waiting outside my house every morning with flowers and giving me a lift to work before I got my car back on the road - something he hadn't done in the five years we had been together! Eventually he wore me down and we did indeed get back together but my heart still wasn't in it - I mean, after five years we still weren't even living together, so I told him that if we weren't living together by the time he had to go off to Algeria to do his waste-of-time national service then not to expect me to wait for him! And sure enough, we weren't living together when he had to leave but he did ask me to marry him the night before he left - I said no, but with tears rolling down my cheeks.  I was very, very fond of him but honestly didn't feel that I had a future with him. He was (and still is) a very, very decent man and our different religions made no difference to us at all, but I actually thought I would get bored if I married him! A year later when he heard I was going to marry my (now) ex, he called me on my wedding day and begged me to reconsider! Man, if only I had listened, I could have saved myself 26 years of misery with the ex but you live and learn I guess.Anyway, when I was offered a job back in Switzerland in 1989 a girlfriend called me one day and asked me what Karim's last name was. You see, her son had developed peritonitis on Easter Sunday and they had called an emergency surgeon in to operate. When her husband read the surgeon's name he commented that \"that was Anna's Karim\" - and sure enough it was! So egged on by my friend I put in a call to his office and left my number with his receptionist. He called back and we have become friends again after so many years. I'm fatter and he's balder but other than that nothing much has changed!Then on Wednesday when I got home there was a \"missed call\" light flashing on my phone. Normally I just delete these calls because I get two to three telemarketing calls a day, but for some reason I looked at this number and decided to call back - and ended up talking for an hour with my old friend  from back in 1989, Patricia! You see, when we moved back to Switzerland I found us an apartment in a lovely village called Mont-sur-Rolle. There were only two apartments on our landing and Patricia and Manuel had a little girl just one month younger than our son, André. So we used to leave our apartment doors open and André and Nena (two terrible two-year-olds) would run back and forth and play happily for hours and hours. Patricia is Colombian (now also Swiss) and her husband was Spanish so it was extremely good for my Spanish! After a year I realized that while I loved our apartment and our little set-up, the ridiculous rent we were paying would pay a mortgage in France so my husband and I bought a house and moved across the lake into Haute Savoie in France. It was sad leaving Patricia but as she didn't drive and as a Colombian needed a visa for France, inevitably we lost contact over the years. Her marriage, as it turned out, ended up being pretty much like mine and we both ended up getting divorced, although her ex has since remarried and divorced two more times!!! Yikes, she was well shot of him, I can tell you. Anyway, the upshot of that phone call is that I'm going over to her place next Sunday for lunch, where I can meet up again with \"little\" Nena (Ainhoa), who is now 30 and the mother of a three-year old, and Patricia and I can make up for 30 years of lost chin-wagging!And finally, (gosh this post turned out much longer than I intended), the real reason for this post is another very, very lovely \"blast from the past\" moment that happened yesterday. My best friend at work is Tunisian (can you see a pattern here) and I was telling him one time about my first \"true love\" which happened when I was a young student at Montpellier University in southern France. I was on the beach one day, under a sun umbrella with a towel over my shoulders when a young man walked past and asked if I was \"warm enough\"! I explained to him that if I sat in the sun it wouldn't be too long before you would smell the bacon and he just laughed and said that as a Muslim that would be a real turn-off but would I mind if he sat down with me! Yes, it was that corny. Anyway, his name was Nacer, he was Tunisian, and we hit it off like nobody's business. He and his brother were at Montpellier Uni studying to be pharmacists but as this was the summer break they were pretty much free of courses. Like I say, we instantly clicked and while I enrolled in many French courses at the Uni I spent most of my time down at the beach with Nacer! I learned a helluva lot of French I can tell you, but probably not the kind of French I use now at work! At the end of the summer I had to go back to England but he kept in touch, writing to me and so on, and one time even coming to visit me when I got my job in Geneva.  Have you ever reminisced/wondered what that first wonderful romantic summer felt like - well I lived it! And it really was wonderful! Anyway, as time moved on Nacer went back to Tunisia as a pharmacist, I met and married my ex and we moved to the States. Eventually I had to ask my mom not to forward Nacer's letters any more as I was now married but he still wrote for quite some time!!!Fast forward 40 years and I was having coffee with my Tunisian buddy, Imed, before he set off for a month's vacation in Tunisia. I was explaining to him about Nacer and he said, you know, if you know his last name and that he is a pharmacist and originally from Sfax, he will have moved back to Sfax because that's what we Tunisians do - we go home. So why don't you search for him on FB! Well I tried a couple of times but I always spelt his name as \"Nasser\" and he wasn't showing up anywhere.  For some reason, last night I thought I would take a shot at finding his brother, Hachemi, and almost instantly up he popped, with Nacer as one of his friends! I couldn't believe it. He has barely changed. Well I guess that's not strictly true. We are both 40 years older and 40 years fatter but we both seem to have our own hair and teeth ...... So being a nosy bugger I scrolled through his FB page and he seems to be just as nice as I remember him. He posted something on one post about the atrocities in Syria and someone wrote back saying \"what about the b***tard Israelis and what they are doing in Palestine!\" Nacer's response was that when innocent civilians - in particular children - are hurt in these atrocities it doesn't really matter whether they are muslim or jewish does it! They are still unforgivable atrocities. Now as an Arab and a Muslim I doubt Nacer has any particular love for Israel but I thought that was a lovely comment. On another post they had a picture of a young girl removing her veil, and his comment was \"religion isn't about covering your face with a piece of cloth - that's not what Islam teaches!\" When you have someone who thinks and talks so reasonably it is just so refreshing in this world of hate and lies, and that is exactly how I remember him!So, taking my courage in both hands I sent him a friend request on FB. I asked if he had studied pharmacy at Montpellier around 1979 because if so I had a couple of pictures of him and his brother. But, if I had got the wrong person, I apologized for the intrusion. I knew it was him of course - he really hadn't changed, so you can imagine my amazement when I got a \"friend acceptance\" five minutes later with a \"Hallo Anna, how are you doing? Of course I remember you, that was an amazing summer we spent together wasn't it\"! Oh my goodness, I haven't felt my heart flutter like that for years! I know of course that time and life has moved on but just getting a response from him really made my day. We sent a couple of messages back and forth and then he had to get off FB but said he would contact me again. Wow, I feel like I've just stepped out of my time machine and flown back to 1979 (but I'd better not look in the mirror had I). Of course we are older now and our lives have moved on, but if he is like my other \"blasts from the past\", it would be lovely to keep in touch occasionally!Not a very good photo but ...  my first love, Nacer!"},
{"title": "In my next life I'm gonna come back as a ferret!", "date": "Wednesday 25 July 2018", "text": "Not very glamorous I know but it seems to be my nature to be able to \"ferret\" things/solutions out! I don't know if you know her, but Nadiya Hussain won the Great British Bake-Off (in 2015 I think). Now I don't watch it because it doesn't interest me but I really like Nadiya. She's a Bangladeshi/Brit who seems very down to earth and I really like her style. Well the other day I was watching her cookery programme and she made prawn biryana - which looked wonderful. She happened to mention an Indian/Bangladeshi 5-spice mix that \"is to die for\" and guess who managed to find it out in the boonies in little old Geneva! The ferret here! Now if you live in the UK that's probably no big deal but despite being an international city I feel that Geneva is only relatively recently moving into the modern world as far as foreign ingredients are concerned. When I first came here in 1980 the only ingredients in the shops seemed to be those required to make fondue! Well I might be exaggerating slightly but not an awful lot. It has taken years to be able to get my hands on basic British stuff like tea-bags (I know, the horrors!) but they finally seem to be getting there. Truth be told, you can now get almost anything if you know where to look because, as I say, it is such an international community. When I first started looking for this spice mix everyone wanted to sell me Chinese 5-spice powder but that isn't it. However, thanks to the magic of the internet I found a little Bangladeshi supermarket and was able to navigate my way round Geneva's public transport system just like a big girl and get there and back in 30 minutes with my precious Bangladeshi spice mix. I ended up making her recipe this weekend and while the flavouring was lovely I don't think I did it any favours by using the frozen prawns in my freezer - better to get the real mccoy next time I think, but I have eaten it every day this week (I made waaaay too much as you can see).  Still, on the strength of that and Monday night's programme I have ordered her latest cook book - Nadiya's Family Favourites! We'll see how that pans out but it does look delicious!Nadiya HussainThe other Sunday I fancied a trip out to a local market about 30 minutes from me. I go to a very small local market on Saturdays but this one is quite a bit bigger. However, when I got there someone had \"stolen it\" - gone! Just like that! So I stopped and asked a man carrying his market goodies and he directed me to another location as the original location is being improved/black-topped with more parking spaces. Phew - I really like this market and love just wandering around even if I don't buy anything. Interestingly, when I stopped at the fish stall, right next to it were a few tables and bar stools where people were trying seasonal mussels but - this being France - they also had various wines for sale by the glass to try with the mussels! I didn't try any as I was driving but I must admit I do like their style!Actually yesterday I was able to pick some of my own home-grown tomatoes and I must say you can't beat the home-grown stuff. Add that to feta cheese, cucumbers and olives and you have lunch made in heaven!And of course the Tour de France is ongoing at the moment. We have had two Sunday's where our village road has been blocked off for bike races recently. This wasn't for the Tour de France but for a complementary race that they always have around the same time. However, on Tuesday the \"real\" Tour de France was in our area so once again our road was blocked off, but since I was in work I didn't mind so much. They always go over the Alpes de l'Huez and Grand Bornand before coming down to our local town, so I watched a little just to see if I could pick out various places. Far be it from me to stand out in the blazing heat though to watch that stuff - just not my cup of tea (even though I can now get the tea-bags)!Coming down towards home from Grand BornandI think I have mentioned before that every week when I shop I pick up a few items for the local food bank, and when I have a crate full I take it down on the Tuesday night when they open. I have been quite remiss in taking my stuff down there lately so determined I was going to do it last night. When I got there one of the ladies insisted on introducing me to the Chairman of the local Red Cross group that runs this particular food bank and she was telling him how our little charity book store had also made a financial donation. Honestly it was no big deal but it really brought home to me just how grateful they are - particularly the closer they get to October/November when their supplies start to run out. As I was about to leave she stopped me and asked me about our little book shop at work, and then proceeded to drag out a huge bag of books in English to donate. She said she had been given them by an acquaintance who reads in English and boy did I drool!!! Whoever this acquaintance is has wonderful taste in books - I saw Aldus Huxley, among others - and a book that I shall probably buy myself by John O'Farrell, who I find hilariously funny! So I got to leave the food bank with more than I arrived with. My ferret nose working again I suppose!And finally, I have my big meeting this afternoon. We have two big meetings a year for which we produce four extremely large reports. I have other meetings, of course, but these are the big ones. We just found out we will have TV cameras both inside and outside the meeting room so I guess I'd better not fall asleep for this one (they do drone on sometimes)! But talking of falling asleep, when I got on the bus at the terminus this morning there was a young man fast asleep at the back. When I got off the bus at the opposing terminus 45 minutes later he was still snoring away. Apparently, according to the bus driver, these young men go on the razzle in the evenings and sleep it off the next day by going round and round on the local buses until they wake up! My boss was saying just this morning how tired he is - he has young children who don't seem to sleep well and also final responsibility for this afternoon's meeting, so I told him if he wanted to get on the number 25 bus afterwards and get some sleep, I would wake him up when I got off at the border! Sounds like a deal to me! Well that and the bottle of wine he has got in the fridge for after our baptism of fire! I'll drink to that!"},
{"title": "More this and that!", "date": "Tuesday 17 July 2018", "text": "Or odds and sods really. Not a lot going on this end. Saturday, of course, was Bastille Day in France so people let off fireworks on the Friday night in anticipation of having the day off on Saturday, which was just as well really as Saturday evening was wet so the fireworks displays would have been spoiled. Then Sunday was the World Cup final which, in my opinion, France deservedly won. To say my local town erupted would be an understatement. I actually had the sound turned off on the TV but knew when France had scored because of the roars from my local town 3 km away! Good for them, anyway. I was sad to see England go out but like most people I thought this young team did us proud. They are young and have plenty of room to develop and improve so I'm looking forward to the next round of Euro matches. Well done the three lions!  Onwards and upwards!Then of course we had the visit of the Donald to the UK (and other parts). Beerrrkkkk is the only way I can describe how I felt, and most others seemed to have felt the same way too. At first I had misgivings about \"Baby Trump\" as I didn't feel it was respectful to the office but then as one of the organizers put it \"we didn't put a US flag on it - we have every respect for the office, but we are just showing him the same respect as he shows others, i.e. none!\" Fair enough in the end I suppose.Thank God Melania is classy though, I mean, if she behaved the same way he did it would be a real old bun fight wouldn't it.  Then to have the Queen invite him to inspect the guard of honour and him walk right in front of her!!! Good god man, have you no manners. She is this diddy little lady (whatever her rank) and he just plops his ruddy great bulk down in front of her while she is inspecting her own guard! She is used to handling this kind of thing of course after so many years, but I really wish she had just taken his legs out from behind with her handbag!And I really feel for the people in Scotland - apparently the costs for security while he was there for two days ran to £5 million - and as they so rightly put it, why should we pay for his security when he is coming to play golf on his own private golf course? Thank God it was such a short visit, is all I can say. I hear the reception was no better after that but as for the meeting with Putin!!!! Wow, just wow! You only have to look at the caricatures in the world's press to see what people think. I tell you, I wouldn't want to be part of that world for all the tea in china!In other matters, 10 days ago I was fast asleep when I woke up with a start at 4 a.m. thinking there was someone in the house. I got up, turned all the lights on and went downstairs. Nothing! So I went back to bed but when I got up in the morning to go to work I looked at my phone and there at 4.08 a.m. was a text message from my ex asking about a recipe for \"pâté campagnard\" - a pâté made from pork!   What the f.......!!!! It's not as if I ever made this pâté and there was an ancient family recipe, but to send a text asking about something he could easily google and at 4 a.m. knowing that I have to get up for work!!! I was furious, but decided the best response was no response. You just don't engage in those cases. I mean we've been divorced almost seven years so why contact me about such rubbish!! Then on the Monday evening he sent me another text asking if I had got his previous message, so I just said \"oh the one you sent at 4 a.m. knowing full well I had to get up at 6 a.m? Oh that one? Yeah I got that one. Thanks for that\"! Geez, will he ever leave me alone!In other matters, my car started playing up last week. I had difficulty getting it to start and thought it was a flat battery but no. I managed to hobble to Ford and they thought it was the ignition button so I had to wait a couple of day until they had ordered a new one. I managed to crawl to work for three days but on the last day before I was to drop it off every bloody light on that thing was going nuts - flashing indicators and so on as I went down the motorway. Honestly, you would have thought it was a presidential motorcade (see above) - but no, it was just me! In the end they kept it for two days (they lent me something that looked like a can of beans on wheels in the meantime) and they were telling me that they pulled loads of stuff apart and put it back together again but couldn't really say what it was. There was, however, evidence of a \"fouine\" attack inside. Now a \"fouine\" literally translated is a \"weasel\" but I think \"fouine\" is a local animal, something like a weasel but probably only about three inches or so long. The little buggers get inside your engine and nibble away at anything they can find, although in my case not the wiring thankfully. In the end Ford got my car working again but they have no idea how!!! Still, all's well that ends well - while I was waiting they were having their end-of-day apéritif so I got invited into the back office with a couple of other clients and we all had an apéritif together - vive la France, as they say!And finally, I got round to telling my immediate boss last Wednesday of my plans to retire - he was stunned and asked what they could do to make me stay! Then on the Friday I told my director who was also stunned. I apologized for springing it on them but explained that it had nothing to do with work but everything to do with my dreadful commute. The director asked me yesterday to change my mind but I told him I would think about it until October, when I have to give three months' notice. I have an appointment with a tax advisor at the beginning of September to make sure my calculations are correct. I'm pretty sure they are but there is one tax called \"contribution sociale généralisee\" that I'm not sure is already counted in my tax calculations. If not, that is another 8% tax to think about and may put the spanner in the whole works as I just can't afford an additional 8% tax on top of the 22% I have already calculated. As I say, I'm pretty sure it's already included in the 22% but will have to wait until September to find out. In the meantime, I am still waiting to hear back from the French bank about the final pay-off for my house. I understand that they really won't be wanting me to pay off my mortgage 10 years early but really .... as soon as I get those two figures I can go ahead and hand my notice in. But gosh it's hard sitting around waiting isn't it!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 9 July 2018", "text": "Isn't it absolutely wonderful that they are finally bringing those young Thai boys out of that cave after such a horrific ordeal! As I am writing right now they have brought eight out - I keep flicking back to Sky News live for updates. And what absolute heroes the rescue teams are, in particular the divers, for going to hell and back themselves in order to save a group of what must be obviously terrified young boys. The sheer danger of it must surely be brought home by the fact that a brave Thai Navy Seal died of lack of oxygen before even the first boy was brought out. A brave and selfless man - as are they all!  Let's hope they get the remaining five out and quickly!Brave Saman KunanIn other news, it's cycling season here (actually it's cycling season pretty much all year round in France!) and you can't move on our small back roads for gaggles of cyclists heading, usually, towards Grand Bornand (that's where John Kerry fell of his bike and broke his arm). Hat's off to them for wanting to do that - I don't think I could even make it down to the bakery in the next village in this heat even with the promise of a pain au chocolat at the end. What I do wish, though, is that they would bloody well cycle in single file on these small roads, rather than drivers having to queue up behind them to get past! I can see why there is often animosity between drivers and cyclists to be honest, particularly in cities, but I'm not sure it's a case of the cyclists always being wrong or the drivers always being wrong - I'm sure there is selfish behaviour on both sides. That being said, when we made an earlier than usual start the other Sunday to go exploring Chanaz it was because they were blocking the road through our village from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for a cycle race. As I said above, our village is the scenic route that leads up to Grand Bornand so that's why they schedule races through here. Fair enough I suppose, but then yesterday (Sunday) our village road was closed from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. for a bike race expected to number 17,000 cyclists!!!! Once that road is blocked off we can't get out. I gave up in the end and just decided to have a day at home pottering in the garden - and very nice it was too. I hope that's the last of the bloody things round here for this year though!In other news, I've mentioned before that I'm not a particularly big football fan (much preferring rugby) but since England was playing on Saturday I thought I would take advantage of my enforced immobility to watch the match and it was great - well I say that because England won of course, but I really did enjoy it.  What gets me though, is that when Sweden did something amazing (which wasn't very often to be honest) they panned in to some beautiful Swedish fan cheering.But when England did something wonderful (which was much more often) we got this lot:Oh well, maybe that's a fair reflection of the state of play off the pitch but really!  Come on England!While I was flicking back and forth watching TV last night waiting to hear if any more boys had been brought out of the cave, I started watching a programme called \"Rich Kid to Skint\" - poverty porn I suppose - where they took some rich little princess and had her stay overnight with a single mother of two on benefits in her one-bedroomed flat. My God!!!! What crap TV. Now I don't know why the young mother was single but she came over as pretty decent but Princess Twinkletoes!!!! If she was mine I would be ashamed! But then again, it's obviously mommy and daddy that made her like that, isn't it! OK, they have money and spend it on their kid. That's their privilege, but she was such a vacuous, monosyllabic amoeba it was embarrasing. Massive hair extensions, one inch long false eyelashes, one inch claws attached to the end of her fingers. Again, her choice, but she could barely string two words together, flailing her claws all over the place, playing with her hair, taking selfie after selfie, it didn't seem that even a single brain cell was firing in that tiny mind. What happened to having a personality? What happened to hard work? Why do they all end up looking like something from TOWIE or Keeping Up With The Kardashians? It beats me, and I really do fear for the future of these characterless individuals.  My goodness, now I know why I shouldn't have been channel hopping! It makes me so mad!And finally, I have definitely made up my mind to retire at the end of the year. My boss was in Japan last week so I wanted to wait until I had a chance to speak to him before I spoke to my director. Trouble is, the boss is \"a bit stressed at the moment\" (it's a permanent state so I don't worry too much! My mind is  99% made up, even though I have an occasional wobble and run the figures (yet again) through the number-crunching machine and I know I can do it, buuut just this weekend I discovered a lovely blog called Miss Mazuma - a young woman aiming for early financial independence and how she is going about it. Is it ironic then that as I was having yet another wobble about retiring I came across this quote from her blog:\"But,seriously.  Coming up against “the norm” in life is difficult.  Imean, who doesn’t want to commute an hour to work [I WISH], put in 40+ hours a week at aboring job, drive home in traffic, eat a shitty meal in front of the TV, thenhead to bed before doing it all over again every weekday (minus 2 weeksvacation!) for the next 40 years.  Who? Sounds exhilarating!! Why would anyone want to stray from that path?\"Thanks for the kick up the butt Ms Mazuma!"},

It's not unexpected at this time of the year and I don't mind at all - but hence the reason I haven't posted much lately. I know when my busy periods are and can work around them but it does mean that sometimes I am just too tired to blog!So what's new? Oh yes, the Fête de la Musique is over and my goodness what an event that was. There are music events all over - here in Geneva and in France too of course. It's pretty much constant for a few days - one solid, jam packed session, if you will. What I think is a nice touch is that in Geneva they put out pianos on the pavements for people to play if and when they feel like it, and there was a lovely video in the local newspaper recently of a Swiss police officer playing (rather well, I thought) at Geneva train station.I read in today's newspaper that there were 550 events in 28 different locations attended by approximately 200,000 people. Not bad eh!Talking of the local newspaper, this morning when I got on the bus I just made it ahead of a gaggle of school kids - about 30 of them I would say, around 10 years old. Oh the noise - it sounded like a fishing trawler coming back to harbour! Not that I mind as I like kids really. Anyway, I was flicking through the local \"20 Minutes\" freebie newspaper on the bus to check out the weather when I realized two young lads were surreptitiously trying to read over my shoulder! In the end I just handed them the newspaper and said \"here you go\". Well the one started complaining that \"why couldn't he read the newspaper\" so I fished my book out of my bag and handed it to him. (The Last Tudor, by Philippa Gregory). It took him about five minutes to realize that it wasn't in French - though I'm not sure quite why it took so long to figure that out. Then the other young man asked if he could read it, so I handed it to him and he could seemingly read a little English. He ended up keeping my book for the entire length of my journey. The teachers were laughing because they were absolutely silent trying to figure my book out. The funny thing is that the ticket inspectors got on and I had since picked up the 20 Minutes again and was doing that little puzzle - you know the one where there are two seemingly identical cartoons and you have to spot the seven differences. So here's me struggling with the \"spot the difference\" cartoon and Little Billy next to me reading \"The Last Tudor\". Irony at its best!In other matters, some time ago a colleague had given me the names of various beauty spots that were worth visiting in the local area. I always write down the names of these places but recently decided it was time to get back into exploration mode. I decided on a place called Chanaz, which is about 75 km from here. So on Sunday two friends and I set off down the motorway towards Annecy to try to find it. Now I didn't want to follow my GPS which was trying to take me through a place called Rumilly, so decided to take another route which seemed to be more direct! Ha, it was more direct all right - it took us over a mountain pass called Col de la Chambotte, and while I don't mind mountain driving I swear if there had been another coat of paint on my left side the cars coming up the pass would have taken the side off my car!  Talk about tight!  But, buuuuuut, oh my goodness, when we got to the top we had a view over Lac de Bourget which just took your breath away! I mean, I have been here over 35 years and this place is still capable of taking my breath away!Col de la ChambotteEventually we made it down the other side and in about 20 minutes we found Chanaz, and again it was absolutely stunning. I can see why my colleague had been telling me to visit.  It is located on the Canal de Savières, which leads directly into the Lac de Bourget, which is (apparently) France's biggest natural lake!ChanazWe had actually planned to visit Chanaz last Sunday but for some reason didn't get around to it - which turned out to be a great piece of procrastination in the end because, unbeknownst to us this Sunday was the day they were holding their annual Venetian Carnaval parade - and we arrived right in the middle of it!  Of course we didn't have a snowflake's chance in hell of being able to eat on the waterfront since it was \"by reservation only\" so we scrambled up hill to what turned out to be a delightful little outdoor restaurant serving a very limited menu but of wonderful food.By the time we had finished eating the Carnaval procession was just setting off so we were again in the right place at the right time! Aren't they fabulous!They all looked wonderful but goodness knows they must have been so hot in those costumes as it was scorching. After that we decided to have a little \"shufty\" in one of the local gift shops which was beautifully presented on a stationary barge. I bought a couple of things as Christmas presents (I like to pick up Christmas presents all year round), and a lovely bag of hand-made chocolate for work.The Sale Gosse gift shop!After that we took a 90 minute boat trip along the canal up to the lake - again very pretty! And finally, on the way back to the car, we got to see the lock being used to raise and lower boats in and out of the lake and onto the canal. No matter how many times I see it I am still in awe of the engineering!Our boat coming back from the lake to the canal.What a beautiful day that was - like I say, some days really are just diamonds!In other news, I am still looking into the figures for possibly retiring early - that is to say at Christmas this year. It is coming as quite a shock to me even as I have always had it in my mind that I will go at end 2020 and now here I am (potentially) just six months away from retirement!  Our pension fund has confirmed my calculations and I keep running the figures through the French tax system to see if there will be any nasty surprises but so far nothing. The last thing I am waiting for is confirmation from the French bank of the total amount payable in Swiss francs in order to pay off my mortgage in January 2019. Depending on that figure (and I have pretty much calculated the worst case scenario), then it is up to me, but I am very much leaning towards leaving! It's a bit of a shock actually as I really hadn't given any thought to it until about two weeks ago. I will lose around €1,000 a month, which is enormous of course, but I will still have a reasonable pension. So many people have said \"just do it\" so I really am inclined to go for it. I can take the stress at work as it really doesn't bother me but having not been well the other week and then with my friend dying suddenly I really think it would be good to go in order to get away from this awful commute, which is currently at three hours a day and rising!  More to follow!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Friday 15 June 2018", "text": "Oh it's been a really busy couple of weeks here so I haven't had time to blog or even read my favourites blogs - still got a lot of catching up to do!So where to start? Oh yes, last Saturday we had our latest board game evening at my neighbour's house. Although it threatened rain all day (all spring frankly!!!) we really lucked out and had a lovely afternoon and evening. We ended up simply splitting into two groups this time and playing card games all evening, which made a nice change. D has loads (and I mean loads) of plants, pots, decorations, ornaments and so on in her garden and it all takes an awful lot of work, but like I commented to her, just occasionally all that hard work comes together and you get a snapshot of just what a stunning garden she has created!Jordan and M playing rummy!Then the next day we had our annual \"clean up the neighbourhood\" get together, where our small group of (around) 24 houses all spend an hour cleaning up the area around our homes - to be followed by the annual  \"let's all get together to eat and chinwag for the next eight hours\" - so that's what we did! I must admit, for the little bit of effort that we all put in our little neighbourhood really does look lovely afterwards.   Jumping on to totally different news, there seems to be some kind of \"push\" from the powers-that-be in the UK at the moment to promote weight loss in a bid to cut levels of diabetes II - or at least, that's what it seems like to me as there have been a few, very interesting documentaries on lately promoting pretty harsh calorie-restricted diets in a bid to achieve rapid weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. The one programme, which I think was called The Fast Fix, took a group of volunteers who showed a higher risk of developing type II, and relocated them for four weeks in a test programme on a strict diet of 800 calories a day in a bid to lower their risk factors. Now a couple of them weren't even fat, which just goes to show that heredity can also be a big risk factor. It was a tough diet to follow but they all succeeded in significantly lowering their blood markers (I can't remember the \"proper\" names for half this stuff) in addition to dropping weight. One thing though, that kind of diet might be feasible in a control situation like they were in but I, personally, couldn't see me sticking to it if I had also to be looking after kids and a family and going to work. However, the guinea pigs were then asked to follow the same diet once they left the control centre. It was difficult, of course, but they all did it and the results, from a diabetes standpoint alone, were amazing. It was a diet along the lines of the eight-week blood sugar diet or indeed the \"Fixing Dad\" diet I mentioned in a previous post. All very interesting, to me at least. They mentioned that if you wanted to find out what your own markers/risk factor looked like you should measure your waist at its narrowest point (just above the belly button) then divide that measurement by your hip measurement. Guess who did it! For a woman your result should be below 0.85 (mine was 0.97) in order to be out of the \"risk\" category, particularly if you have a BMI of 30 or more (I just come under that but \"yikes\" all the same!)I can understand why the government would want to push this as the UK is now, justifiably in my opinion, the fat man of Europe and type II diabetes treatment is apparently costing the National Health Service millions! Makes sense doesn't it!  So with that in mind, I have been browsing through pinterest looking at different fitness regimes (well that and the cake recipes and patchwork patterns!!!) and I stumbled across some amazing pictures of older women bodybuilders. Just wow.  Take a look at this lady!The lady on the left is the amazing Ernestine Shepherd - now 82 years old!Ernestine in her younger days!Quite the inspiration, isn't she!Since I have been really busy (I don't mind at all) I didn't exercise last week and you know what, I missed it. I only managed to walk the last 30 minutes to work three times this week but hope to get back to the gym also next week. Oh, and did I mention that in a bid to get rid of my bingo wings I have been lifting a few (rather puny) weights!  Nothing to write home about but you've got to start somewhere haven't you.  Image by ShutterstockAnyway, last weekend I went to the local sports shop to buy some weights. The nearest weights to the ones I wanted were 5 kg each so I bought a box of two - and almost fell over when I picked the bloody box up! I see there is work to do then!  Ernestine can rest on her laurels just a little longer!Only slightly linked to the above, I wrote a recent blog post on the sudden death of my friend, Ian, and what a shock it was, so with the uncertainty of the future brought home so abruptly to me I started taking a look at the maths and have come up with the notion that I could, if I wanted to, actually retire at Christmas! That's quite an amazing thought after 40 years of work, I can tell you! It would mean I would have to take a lump sum from my pension in order to pay my house off and thus have a smaller pension but it certainly is feasible. In all honesty I am looking at going in two years time at the age of 62 because although my house will be paid off it does need work doing and I want to save up for that first (complete replacement of the heating system to start with). So knowing that I could leave the rat race at Christmas if I wanted to is a very nice feeling. As I said, I'm pretty sure I won't go then but .... Add to that that I want to help out with my son's wedding next year (we booked the château in the village last night - it is beautiful) and that his contract as an apprentice expires end July I will be staying on for a bit, although in reality an unemployed plumber has got to be an oxymoron hasn't it!\"Kick me\" (to leave the rat race) - image by Jonathan MarshThat being said, my sister-in-law's sudden death two years ago knocked my brother for a six and I think brought home to him that life is moving inexorably on. He now has a very dynamic lady friend, also a widow, who seems to be a little ball of energy dragging him (well he's going along willingly) here, there and everywhere! There is such a change in my brother it is amazing. And it's no disrespect to my sister-in-law - she was the dynamo/the doer in that relationship - but, like I say, I think losing her brought home to Phil that life was for living now because you never know!ShutterstockPhil and M at Rockley Park"},
{"title": "A different kind of happy memory!", "date": "Wednesday 6 June 2018", "text": "Thank you all for your lovely comments in reply to my last post. I have to admit learning of Ian's death knocked the stuffing out of me but it has also brought home to me the urgency of living life in the \"now\" rather than for one day in the future. Of course, all that has to be within reason, but if Ian hadn't taken the plunge and gone to Bulgaria in 2011 he might still have been waiting for \"the day when\" .... which of course, in his case, never came!I remember years ago at college our shorthand teacher gave us all a round disk with the word \"TUIT\" on it. When someone asked what it was she said it was to be used on those occasions when you were putting things off until you got a \"round tuit\"! Clever huh! So with that in mind, I went ahead and booked my 60th birthday trip for September. I do not want to be at work for my 60th if only because I can't stand the fuss so had planned to book a holiday in Spain that week. Unfortunately, as I hadn't got a \"round TUIT\", when I came to booking it that particular trip was fully booked so I had to \"settle\" for Sicily, although going to Sicily doesn't actually involve \"settling\" at all does it. It is another one of my solos trips and does therefore mean having to fly back to the UK and then back out to Sicily but I don't mind spending the night before in London. Then for my next winter break I finally cracked and have booked a trip to Sri Lanka at the beginning of March. This trip is with the company I went to Costa Rica with and since I can book my own flights and do not have to go via London I managed to get a pretty good deal with Edelweiss Air from Zurich. Oh how I love my trips! That being said, I can't wait to have more time (i.e. retirement, God willing) so that I can spend more time rediscovering the UK and maybe more locally in France, but all in good time I guess.And on the basis of \"don't wait until you get a round tuit\" I booked myself on another vegan cookery course for next Tuesday. Hopefully it will be better than the last one, but I reckon it should be as it is with an up-and-coming vegan restaurant here in Geneva. I am neither vegetarian nor vegan but am interested in both, so last night I thought I would try out a vegan recipe from Deliciously Ella. It wasn't bad but I certainly hope the whole vegan experience is worth all that washing up! Crikey, I don't think I have made such a mess in the kitchen in a long while! Anyway, while I was crashing around in the kitchen I missed a call from U, an old friend who retired back to England five years ago. When I had finished cleaning up Armaggedon (a.k.a. the kitchen) I called her back for a natter, as we hadn't had a good chinwag in ages!I worked for HR for 20 years and many of those years overlapped with U being the Chief of Personnel's secretary and man did we have a laugh. I obviously can't go into too much detail here but some of things we saw had us in stitches.  Such as:-  we had a Norwegian chappie who applied repeatedly but unsuccessfully for various vacancies. He was obviously a keen fisherman because every time he applied to us he attached a photo of himself, and in it he was holding a fish he had just caught! Only thing was, with every fresh application the fish got bigger and bigger! Sadly we never recruited him but we both liked his style!-  then there was the guy who attached a photo (which was pretty usual in those days) but obviously didn't have time to get a professional head shot done. When we looked at his photo he had obviously just taken an old photo of himself at a party or somewhere or other and had cropped the other people out of it - all, that is, except for the hand of whoever was standing next to him with his arm draped mysteriously over his shoulder like something out of the Addams family!- in \"the good old days\" every single application got a reply - a \"no, sorry\", a \"let's give this one some further thought\" or a \"let's take this one a step further\". It was a tremendous amount of work and eventually we had to put a disclaimer on vacancy announcements just saying \"if you don't hear from us .... sorry\"! Anyway, one time U's boss was sifting through the mountains of applications and had put one guy on the \"no, sorry\" file. Now looking at his photo U decided that he was pretty cute, so she put his application back on the \"maybe\" file. After which the boss put it back on the \"no\" file. Rinse and repeat a few times and eventually the boss just had to tell her \"nice try, but it's still a no\"! Oh well, you can't say she didn't try! Sorry mate!Now in our company we work in English (mainly), French and Spanish so applicants can apply in any of those three languages. Sometimes, though, you would get letters in purporting to be in English but which had obviously been run through some kind of  \"google translate\" (had it existed at the time - it didn't) and which was completely undecipherable in any language, so U would put on her best \"foreign\" accent and read it out to us. Politically correct? Probably not but you have to laugh sometimes don't you!  And then there was the guy who \"desperately wanted to work for your organization because he had always wanted to work with mentally disabled people\"!!!! Say what! I mean, if this were Doctors Without Borders or something just maybe but really!!! In the end, looking at some colleagues who were around at the time maybe that wasn't so far fetched. Another time we had a lady apply who had no relevant qualifications whatsoever - in fact she had a long-term career as a midwife. Very laudable career of course but not something that would have been particularly relevant to a United Nations-type organization (we're not the UN, but you get the idea).I remember one time I took a call from a lady in France who worked for XXXX Mairie in France. She spoke so quickly that I didn't really get the gist of what she was saying, but assuming it was a staff member who needed some administrative paper for France I let her continue. Turns out she had a son who \"wanted to go on mission\". So I asked what kind of qualifications he had - \"he just wants to go on mission\"! \"So is he an economist?\" \"No, he just wants to go on mission!\" \"Is he a lawyer specialized in X?\" \"No he just wants to go on mission!\" \"Well could he work as a translator?\" \"No he just wants to go on mission!\" In the end, I had to tell her I didn't hold out much hope for her son but he should fill out an online application and we would see. Oh, and by the way lady, assuming your son is over 13 years old, it doesn't really look that good to have mommy phoning trying to get him a job (I didn't say that last bit but I was very tempted! Ever polite me!)!And finally, at one point I shared an office with an Australian colleague who handled the main input for applications for various vacancies. We would always have a laugh and a joke but she would never tell me anything about who had applied for what - and for that I respect her. It was confidential after all! Buuuut one time she burst out laughing and said \"oh the poor sod\". When I asked her what she was on about she said that this same person had applied for two vacancies in our company - one as Chief Economist and the other as a delivery driver!!! You know, a bit like \"can I apply for the position of Governor of the Bank of England, but failing that are there any openings in the mailing room?\"Happy days indeed. I didn't know until last night but U told me that she reads my blog so in case you're there \"hallo matey, good to chat again\"!"},
{"title": "RIP my partner in crime!", "date": "Wednesday 30 May 2018", "text": "I had my patchwork lesson last night and (seemingly as usual nowadays) there was an accident on the way there so it took me 2 1/2 hours instead of one to get there and then the heavens opened on the way back so I didn't get home till 11.30 p.m. When you leave home at 7 in the morning and don't get home until 11.30 it takes its toll I can tell you, and as I can never go straight to sleep (I guess patchwork is just that exciting - adrenaline rush and all that), I decided to play a couple of games of Words With Friends on Facebook. So you can imagine the shock I got when I happened to click on an old friend's page to learn that he had died suddenly on 7 May at the young age of 58!!! He hadn't been on FB very much lately but since he had mentioned that he was going to give it a rest for a while I didn't think anything of it, but there in front of my eyes were pages and pages of posts from friends sending their condolences to the family!Ian and I grew up on the same council estate in Birmingham, about 100 yards away from each other. Right from really little we hit it off and by the time we went to infants school we had become \"best buddies\". I guess he really liked \"older women\" because I was a whole, oh I don't know, 10 months older than him so we used to walk to school together and then play together after school.One time, I remember, we decided we were going to set up a snail hospital \"to help all these poor snails that we kept finding in my back garden\". So we gathered as many snails as we could, lined them all up on our back fence and then dipped them all in a washing up bowl full of soapy water to \"get rid of all that gunky stuff\". We never could figure out why they all kept dying!!His dad died when he was 40 leaving his mom a young widow with five young children to feed. Times were tough for everyone but particularly for her, as I'm sure you can imagine. I found out many years later that she worked four jobs just trying to keep those children fed! She later found happiness with a Polish man who I understand was very good to her and the kids, but for many years it was tough going indeed! I remember Ian told me one time you always knew what you were getting for Christmas because his mom would be knitting away and all of a sudden she would say \"stand up and put your arm out\"! Many years later he also told me the story of how she must have bought a second hand scout's outfit from some old dear so that he could go to scouts - problem was the legs were waaaaay too wide for his scrawny legs and he ended up looking like Eric Morecambe!The outfit was also the wrong shade of green so when time came for a general inspection all the other scouts closed ranks around him! Another time I happened to mention that one of the older ladies in our local area had a beard (I was a little kid and I was fascinated) and had he ever spotted her, when he said \"oh that would be Mrs. Skull who lived in the flats opposite us\". I almost fell off my chair laughing and asked if her late husband had been Mr. Crossbones, but Ian said he thought she must have liked her beers somewhat as he used to go round to her house to collect the empties in order to get the 1p back on each bottle and give it to his mom!As I say, Ian and I were great buddies up until the end of junior school (so from ages 3 to 10) when it was no longer \"cool\" to be friends with a girl - or at least not until a few years later when being \"best buddies\" with a girl was probably all you could think about! I left school at 16 and went to college, eventually emigrating to Switzerland at age 21 and Ian joined the army, absolutely hated it (said it was worse than school) so went into the construction industry as a labourer and worked his way up. We lost touch until one day, 36 years later, I spotted his name on Friends Reunited and contacted him. It was great to get back in touch again after so long!  He told me that he was sick to death of England, the rat race and chasing after the eternal ££££££ so taking his courage in both hands he rented his house out, bought himself a Postman Pat van and headed off to Bulgaria with a couple of mattresses in the back and his tool box, for no better reason than \"because he heard it was cheap\". He wasn't interested in chasing money out there either - he wanted to make just enough to \"live\" so that's what he did. As a builder it would have been pretty easy and he could have had more work than he could handle had he so wished. But he didn't want that - he wanted to live a little!Anyway, we chatted back and forth for a while and in 2011 he asked what I was doing that summer. When I said \"nothing\" he said \"why don't you come out to Bulgaria so we can catch up\"! My husband had not long left me so taking my own courage in both hands I thought \"what the hell\" - and that's what I did! Now my elderly mom rightly said \"you knew the boy but you don't know the man\" so I booked myself into a hotel on Sunny Beach and flew out to join him. But oh my goodness, you wouldn't know it had been 36 years since we had last seen each other! We laughed so much I thought I was going to get lockjaw!!!!Anyway, we got along so well that we decided to set off and explore Bulgaria in his Postman Pat van for a couple of weeks, and it was a blast! You know when you have grown up with someone and you know all the people in their past - well we had so much catching up to do! We had both learned Russian at school so could decipher some Bulgarian words - and on that basis we decided we had to go to \"Cозопол\" because we loved the sound of it - that's Sozopol to you and me! You see even then we both had the same sense of humour!Out and about in the Postman Pat van!Now we both have strong personalities and just as when we were young we clashed a couple of times, but I have to say that while nothing further came out of our travels we remained friends until the end.Not politically correct now but Ian is 4th from right at the back and I'm 2nd from the right at the back!Both members of future Team GB! - 1969I knew Ian had always liked me and one night he told me that under the wallpaper back in their old house was written \"Ian C loves Anna T\"! I told him \"I know, I saw it\"! And that makes me want to cry! I'm so glad that your final years were happy ones. RIP my old mate!"},
{"title": "Another lovely (but exhausting) weekend!", "date": "Monday 28 May 2018", "text": "Just as I was getting into town on  Friday night my friend sent me a message to say that one of our neighbours was organizing an impromptu get together in support of the neighbours' fête. Now this is an artificial fête (of course) but I happen to think it's a great invention as it gives people an opportunity/excuse to get outside and meet up with their neighbours. It may sound silly but I do believe from what people have told me that many people don't actually even know their neighbours or rarely - if ever - speak to them, and I think that is so sad. I remember my friend Steve telling me that he always says good morning to a couple of his neighbours when he is out and about but that's about the extent of it - and Steve is about as sociable an animal as you could ever wish to meet! I think that's a sad state of affairs really. OK no-one wants to get that involved with their neighbours and end up living in each other's pockets, but it's nice when people are friendly and look out for each other. Goodness knows, that was the way it was in my neighbourhood when I was growing up. My mom pretty much never had to take us kids grocery shopping with her because there was always another mom around to keep an eye on us!Anyway, C very kindly set up a table on our little island and bought out drinks and snacks, with about 10 of us quickly following suit. I only found out about it 10 minutes before arriving home so I had to take along whatever I had in the house - which turned out to be a few beers and some peanuts. Still, we stayed outside and chatted for a couple of hours and had what turned out to be a rather nice time. In a few days we have our annual \"clean up the neighbourhood\" Sunday in any case, where we all spend an hour or so cutting grass, weeding and so on and then all eat together, but hats off to C for going that one step further.I had intended to get so much done that evening too, but that went by the way. I had to be up at 4 a.m. as my friend and I were going on our (now annual) trip to the market in Turin, and while I hate getting up at the crack of dawn we both agree we really do enjoy this trip! We made it to Turin around 10.30 a.m. and had until 3.30 p.m. to wander around and fill our little wheelie bags with lots of goodies. Since it is Jordan's birthday on Thursday I was able to pick up a few extras for him too, in addition to the wonderful fruit and veg. Just perfect. It was very hot - up to about 30° - but thankfully it remained relatively overcast so we didn't feel the full power of the sun. Around mid-day we headed off to a little restaurant we had spotted and had the most excellent lunch of (fresh) tuna salad in my case and grilled salmon in D's case. It was stuff to drool over, I can tell you. Looking at the prices I actually commented to D how rich we would be if we took our pensions and moved to Italy as it is so much cheaper than the region of France where we live - which is expensive because of it's proximity to Geneva!All in all it was a lovely (if very tiring day) - well that is until we neared the French border on the way back. Just before the Mont Blanc tunnel we stopped at the lovely ski resort of Courmayeur but the heavens opened and it absolutely pelted down - but just for about 15 minutes and \"poof\" it was gone! Really weird but it does go to show how you can't trust the weather in the mountains.From this ......to this in the space of about 10 minutes!The Mont Blanc tunnel is quite the piece of engineering, I tell you. 11.5 km long cut through the Mont Blanc it took us 16 minutes to drive from one end to the other - so you enter in France and exit in Italy!The next day we were up and at it again - this time down to our local little town where for the first time they were hosting the \"foire aux tissus\" - a fabric fair! This was a pretty big fair with such a choice of materials I just couldn't make my mind up. The traders come down from Holland and Belgium to sell their goods and it was just eye watering for me! You could easily spend a small fortune in that place! I think the powers that be have realized that our little town is the perfect venue for something like this given the exhibition facilities and its proximity to Geneva and all the money there!After that it was back up to our little village, which was hosting its annual vide-grenier. They changed the date from September to May in order to take advantage of the marquee that had been set up for the village fête the other week. Very often we get bad weather in September so I think changing the date might well be a plus. Apparently it wasn't such a roaring success though because Sunday was also Mother's Day here in France and I guess a lot of families were eating together rather than going out.And finally, I saw a rather lovely video this morning of a young man risking life and limb to save a little boy who had managed to get himself hanging over a fourth floor balcony in Paris!! The young man is a recently arrived immigrant from Mali who was hoping to make a better life for himself in France. Judging from his heroism he is just the kind of immigrant that France needs don't you think!Anyway, President Macron was so impressed with his bravery that he had him over to the Elysée Palace to meet him, and I believe his request for French citizenship will be expedited. And it turns out he has been offered a job in the fire department! It's nice to see something good coming about for such a brave young man isn't it!"},
{"title": "Busy weekend!", "date": "Wednesday 23 May 2018", "text": "Well that was a busy (long) weekend and for once the weather actually cooperated. It doesn't always in May but this one was lovely. We had Whit Monday off, which is always nice because my little village always has it's village fête on Whit Sunday, so you get to recuperate a little the next day. As I had plenty of plans for the long weekend I tend to look up all the vide-greniers (car boots/garage sales) that I might be interested in, plus anything else that's going on, and write it all down in my diary. I don't use my phone as a diary as I still prefer to use a paper one but it does get pretty messy! When I looked at Whit Monday I had written down \"nosewing\" and I thought what the hell is that. Any which way I looked at it it still read \"nosewing\", until I realized it actually said \"no sewing\". Ha! And here's me thinking I'm going mad!Over the past couple of weeks my friend and I got to fit in a few vide-greniers, what with the season being in full swing. It's quite a nice way to spend an afternoon pottering and even though I am trying to declutter (and am succeeding believe it or not) I have picked up a few treasures too.The pretty green flowery plates plus the serving dish were a total of €2 (I couldn't believe it but she really wanted to get rid of them) and then there were 11 of those red glass ice cream dishes for €3 - not bad huh! I can use them all at the next board game evening at my place (well that's my excuse anyway)!  I also picked up the pretty tulip picture for €2 and if nothing else I can use the frame for one of my \"Peru\" pictures that I still haven't gotten round to putting up.It's also a good excuse to get out in the fresh air (and snaffle a bag of chips from the concession stand)!It was just as well we ran up the mountain to the one vide-grenier on the Saturday because on Sunday that particular mountain pass was blocked by a landslide! Yikes, well I guess it is the season!On Satuday, of course, I watched the royal wedding. Not all of it though - that's like watching paint dry - but I made sure to come in from gardening in time to watch the actual service and I have to say it was lovely. Very inclusive, wonderful music and for once the weather cooperated! And weren't they handsome!And talking of handsome, just take a look at the photographer! Alexi Lubomirski - just wow! Or \"down girl, down\" as my sister would say!!!Being the classy kind of person that I am, I thought sitting there for an hour watching the ceremony would be a good opportunity to give myself a pedicure. Well after soaking my feet in the \"mouthwash\" mixture again, look at the bloody results!  We were going out later so I had to spend a good 10 minutes scrubbing the red stuff off my feet. Oh well, at least it wasn't green this time!Then on Sunday, after a couple more vide-greniers, we decided to take a trip out to check out some of the local landmarks. I stopped exploring many years ago and it really is a shame as there is so much to see round this area. We decided to take a scenic route back rather than the motorway and check out a small waterfall which you routinely see from the motorway but I had never stopped there before.This was the upper part of the waterfallAnd the lower part - I couldn't get it all in the picture at once because of the trees!There were a couple of families picnicking near the waterfall but to be honest, only five minutes drive away were a couple of lakes which I think might have been nicer but then who am I to judge.After that we stopped in at our village fête. I always love our fête because it really is rural - kinda back of beyond-ish. I was lucky enough to bump into Jordan and Jen who had come over for a drink, as well as my neighbours - heck the whole village shows up at some point during the day. I have a great video of the accordion players and people dancing but I'll be buggered if I can get the thing to post here!Dancing the conga - although in French you dance the \"caterpillar\"!On the weight front I'm all over the shop. At one point I was down 10 lbs but now I think it is only about 6! So it's back in the saddle for me. I managed to walk in to work this morning and went to the gym at lunchtime and I always feel so good afterwards I wonder why I ever stop! Then yesterday I went for my annual check-up with the dermatologist - I usually get a few bits and bobs burned off as I am fair skinned. He looked at my arms and asked where I got that burn from (I'm not burned, I'm just red) so I told him it was from gardening the day before, at which point he told me to stay out of the sun because \"you can't take it\"! Fat chance - we're off to Turin for the day on Saturday to \"do\" the market, and they've forecast 30° and glorious sunshine! Can't wait. I've got my granny bag/wheelie bag all ready! Turin here I come!"},
{"title": "A different post to the one I had planned!", "date": "Tuesday 22 May 2018", "text": "I had a really busy but lovely weekend. Our local village always holds its village fête on Whit Sunday, but very often it rains, which tends to put a damper on all that hard work. Not so this weekend - it was glorious and the weekend turned out to be superb. I meant to write about our adventures but that will have to wait for another day. You see, I have just read of the death of a lovely lady called Barbara Wragg, who recently passed away at the age of 77. You probably don't know her name (neither did I) but for some reason her story has always stuck with me. You see, in 2000, she and her husband Ray won £7.6 million on the UK lottery - and that same evening decided to give most of it away! They simply decided that they had little need for that amount of money in their 50s and 60s so decided to give most of it away!Of course they treated themselves to a nicer home and so on but they decided that their pleasure was going to be in donating most of it to good (local) causes. The reason their story rang a bell from years ago was I remember them hiring a coach to take deprived inner city kids to the annual panto in Sheffield, but not only did they hire the coach they went along with the kids to watch the show!Anyway, of the £7.6 million they gave away a staggering £5.5 million to (amongst others) family and friends of course, 17 local charities. a local hospital to buy a bladder scanner, they bought 30 television sets for a local hospice so that all the children could watch their own TV, they gave money to a local breast cancer unit, they paid for a group of veterans to go on a trip to honour fallen heroes, they paid for 50 war heroes to go to Italy for the 60th anniversary of the battle of Monte Cassino, and so on and so on! To my mind that is how lottery money should be spent! I'm pretty sure we've all had dreams about winning the lottery (I know I have) but I feel the same way these people did and while I would obviously take care of my family, my greatest pleasure would be in giving most of it away. In fact, I already know the names of the first five charities that would benefit! Now all I have to do is win! Still, I suppose you can dream can't you. Anyway, RIP Barbara Wragg - you and your husband did a wonderful thing!Barbara and Ray Wragg"},
{"title": "It could be a strange wedding!", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2018", "text": "As I mentioned the other day, Jordan and Jen announced that they are now engaged and are planning to get married in July 2019. Jordan and his brother, André, have very different characters and styles so while André and Lily's wedding was indeed beautiful, Jordan and Jen will be wanting something different. At the restaurant the other night Jen was saying that they wanted a \"dandy-like\" theme. I didn't hear her properly and thought she said a \"Ghandi-like\" theme - I have to admit I was a bit shocked!  Can you imagine me showing up something like this:GhandiAnyway, Jen started laughing and said \"no, dandy!\" Actually I can see that quite suiting Jordan. He has very long hair which he ties back in a \"man bun\" for work and when he is all dolled out in braces (suspenders in the US) and a dickie bow I think he looks rather good. I'll be intrigued to see what he will actually look like on the day!\"Dandy\"Anyway, this morning I bumped into K on the bus going into work and was telling her about the engagement and the theme they were hoping for for the wedding. Trouble is, K understood me to say \"candy\"! Lordy, lordy, with this severe case of Chinese whispers the potential for screwing up is pretty high don't you think!On a slightly different note, as I have mentioned before I am an avid reader and since I have at least a 90 minute daily bus commute I do get a lot of reading done. A colleague just lent me Jodi Picoult's book \"Small Great Things\" and I loved it! It is a book about racism and loosely based on a true incident in Michigan some time ago. Again, I just loved it! I like Jodi Picoult anyway, although she is the kind of writer I cannot read one book after another continuously. But she builds such wonderful suspense into her writing and has written what I think is a a very soul-searching story about the iniquities of racism. I plan to buy it in French for my neighbour as she also loved the last Jodi Picoult book I got for her. Isn't it great when you find a writer whose work you adore!"},
{"title": "They've done it again!", "date": "Wednesday 16 May 2018", "text": "As I was on the bus heading home yesterday evening I got a text message from Jordan's girlfriend, Jen, asking if I would be home later. I told her \"yep in about 30 minutes\", so she asked if I wanted to go out to eat with them in (the one and only restaurant) in my village. Sounds good to me as the food is very good there. They had just gotten back from Cinque Terre on Sunday night so I was looking forward to seeing their photos - and how lovely that place is! I really have to go there! It was a six hour bus ride (they went on an organized trip with Jen's work), so it meant getting up at 4 a.m. but apparently they lucked out all the way with the weather (whereas we had dreadful weather) and they said the place was fabulous - as was the food! Everything was included and for the two of them, including two nights in a hotel, it came to about €240! Now that is a deal! Anyway, while we were waiting to be served I was looking through Jordan's photos and, like I said, it is such a stunning place. We hadn't had time to go through them all when our food arrived so we chatted about the trip with them rhapsodizing about the food in Italy until we had finished eating.  Afterwards, Jen said \"oh you must look at the rest of the photos\", so we started up again and somewhere around photo number 41 was a photo of Jordan down on one knee in front of Jen. When I asked what that was they said \"that's when Jordan proposed\" (and Jen said yes)!I've said before I'm not a particularly emotional person but I will admit to a little tear at that. I really wasn't expecting it for some reason - well not just now, I suppose. He said he only bought the ring last week and since they've been together for seven years he thought \"what the heck\"! Wow! Everybody on the boat cheered when he got down on one knee! Anyway, they will have to get married in their local Mairie but I'm not sure when that will be. They don't plan on having a church service since neither of them are religious so they are planning/hoping to have a non-religious service like my elder son and his wife in the château in my little village on July 4th next year!They have already looked into it and every weekend is taken in 2019 so they are plumping for July 4th as (I think) it is a Thursday. I told them I will take care of hiring the château (and probably the food) as they don't have the kind of money that my other son and his wife have but they seem pretty reasonable in their aims so hopefully won't be doing anything budget-busting! They told me I was allowed to tell my sister in England but nobody else as they haven't told Jen's mom yet, nor my other son, nor my ex! I guess I had better get back on that diet then - you know, the one that didn't work last time!Still, I'm delighted for them as they seem to have good heads on their shoulders and to be very happy together!  Jen said she will be taking Jordan's last name as she does not want to keep her own surname - you know the one she inherited from the father who abandoned her and her mother when Jen was two! Can't say I blame her either! Needless to say he won't be invited, even assuming they were able to track him down - you know, non-payment of child support all these years and so on!  One thing that I thought though was that since both Jordan and I have to make up our minds about either becoming French or requesting residents' permits after Brexit, at least as the spouse of a French citizen he will get facilitated procedure whichever he chooses to do!And finally, starting this week and through next week he has his final exams for his diploma as a plumber specialized in ..... I'll be buggered if I can ever remember what it is! But he will be staying on another year to take yet another specialization so things are going well for him on that score. But get this, for his first exam he had to drive down to Annecy for an English exam! Ha! That's great! He said the lady examiner didn't seem to register when he handed over his passport as proof of ID, and then she clocked that it was a  British passport and said \"is there really any point doing this since your English is obviously going to be better than mine?\" Anyway, they went ahead and did his aural and written comprehension and then what was supposed to be a 10 minute chat about plumbing! Well I guess that's a few easy points on the scoreboard since not only did we speak English at home but he also went to an international school where the curriculum was bilingual. Ah, if only the whole exam were that easy! Anyway, it's onwards and upwards I guess, and time to start up the exercise routine (yet again) in time for the next wedding!"},
{"title": "The end of an era!", "date": "Tuesday 15 May 2018", "text": "I have mentioned before that I live in a very small village. There is one restaurant, no shop, no public transport - you get the idea. When we moved in the population was around 500 (so I'm told by the Mairie) of which we were among the 12 foreigners. Now, 29 years later, I would guess the population is around 1,000 but the village is spread over the mountain side so it really isn't \"crowded\" at all. About 20 years ago a Franco-Nigerian family moved in - mom is French and white and dad is Nigerian and black and our kids quickly became great friends with their three kids - more so with the two boys of course, but also with the daughter. Martine and Stan have three very handsome and supremely likable/polite kids - probably because they are strict! Whichever way you look at it, it has paid off as they are a pleasure to be around.  Since the kids are mixed race their parents pushed them into sports as a way to combat any potential racism and all three kids are superb athletes, with D being a professional rugby player and already having played for France several times.Anyway, all that was to say that we have known each other for a long time. Stan, being what I call \"a professional shopkeeper\" by nature, saw an opening in the village for a little shop/bar and so the Mairie allowed him to use a small tract of land (with a stunning view) to set up his little bar. It is basically just three or four portacabins glued together where he sells a small amount of groceries and runs a small bar/sandwich/french fry shop.  Believe me, it was really a godsend! You probably didn't want to look too closely into the corners/cobwebs but nobody cared. Farmers would drive up on their tractors and park up and my ex OH used to love to come over and spend the evening up at Stan's, usually discussing politics or rugby over a glass of wine. In fact when Steve came over the other Christmas he loved it too, as did my family when they came over for the wedding. That place just has so much character. Sadly (for us) Stan is now ready to retire and once he has closed up shop the Mairie want to get rid of the \"building\" and build something more \"esthetic\" (i.e. less grubby) just round the corner. I can't say I blame them because it is a bit of an eyesore but gosh we're going to miss \"chez Stan\". Strange thing is, he was just as strict with the youngsters who stopped by as he was with his own kids and those young people showed him nothing but respect.  He is off to Nigeria for a few months so I won't see him for a while but they will certainly be different times when he comes back.  Thanks for everything Stan!The outside of \"Chez Stan\" was painted by one of the kids' friends!My mate Stan!In other news, it was Mother's Day in Switzerland on Sunday but in France it is always the last Sunday of May, so Sunday 27th for us.  Which puts me in mind of a funny story! When my second son was born my neighbour took care of him when I went back to work. She had two kids aged 10 and 12 who called her \"maman\" - French for \"mommy\". So of course Jordan also called her \"maman\". I didn't care because she was \"maman\" and I was \"mommy\". Anyway, one Mother's Day when he was in the local infants' school, they took a wooden mixing spoon, painted it pink and tied a bow on it. When he bought it home I was gushing praise about what a lovely present he had made me, when he said, all indignant \"it's not for you, the teacher said I had to give it to 'maman'\"! So that's what he did! She was mortified but I just roared laughing - that'll teach me not to count my chickens!"},
{"title": "In other news!", "date": "Wednesday 9 May 2018", "text": "As I was saying in my previous post, this week has been one helluvan expensive week, but I am more than cognizant of the fact that I am lucky enough to work in Switzerland and can afford to replace/repair stuff. This was brought home to me by a programme I was watching on Channel 4 the other night called \"Britain's Benefits Crisis\"! This was a serious programme, not one of your usual \"all benefits claimants are scroungers\" programmes that - while these people certainly exist - is really only rabble-rousing TV. No, this programme took a serious look into the effects of the new Universal Credit that has begun rolling out in the UK. It is supposed to be an easier system to use, rolling various benefits into one, but whose aim, admittedly, is to cut the UK benefits bill and get more people back into work. I don't live in the UK and don't claim any benefits (obviously) so I would be the last person to really understand how the UC is supposed to work but this programme interviewed claimants as well as people working within the system to administer this programme and the overwhelming majority of those people said that the roll out should be suspended until it could be better implemented!They then proceeded to highlight several cases of people who had been hit really hard by the UC. I really can't remember all the details but one single father, who had been invalided out of his previous job, had been working as a taxi driver but switching to UC meant he had less money coming in and was in very grave danger of having to put his children into foster care. He was told by the Department of Employment that he would be better off not working if he wanted to gain back the money lost under UC - so that is what he did in order to be able to keep his children with him. Another single mother had serious health issues which prevented her from working. She wanted to work, however, and managed to find herself a job but her health problems eventually meant that she had to quit. At this point she was no longer eligible for her previous benefits but was switched to UC, which meant losing money and worrying herself into a state of eventually attempting (but failing) to commit suicide! These were not \"scroungers\" (so beloved of the Daily Mail) but seemed to be decent people who were having a very hard time. It was a very sobering programme for me. I know where I came from and am so very, very grateful that I don't have those kinds of worries, but feel so much for those caught in the benefits trap!On a slightly less depressing note, a couple of friends and I had tickets to see \"The Magic of Motown\" in Geneva on Saturday night and it was fantastic! I would say you don't even have to be a fan of Motown (I am) as the songs just seem to take you straight back to your youth regardless. It was two and a half hours or solid dancing and singing and they were just great. I have been to many concerts in Geneva and this was the first time I had seen the arena full - with ages ranging from about 10 to 75, I would say. People were on their feet dancing the whole way through (again another first for me) and I have to say that even though I loved the tribute to Pavarotti, this one takes the biscuit!  They only sang a couple of slow songs but when the young woman went to sing \"Ben\" (Michael Jackson) they asked everyone to use the torch function on their phones and wave them about. Well, my phone is pretty new and I'll be buggered if I could find the torch function. I know you have to \"swipe up\" but every time I did that it asked me if I \"really wanted to call the emergency services\"! Yikes. Stuff the phone down. Try again - again with the \"emergency services\" business! In the end I had to give up but could you imagine the Swiss police storming in and yelling \"what was your emergency?\" \"Well you see officer, they asked us to use the torch function and the song was almost over\"!  There was an older chappie standing on the stairs near me dancing and he danced just like Mr. Bean! I wanted to go over and dance with him as I was having so much fun but I had visions of the two of us falling down the stairs at some point so I held back, but to say I boogied like I haven't boogied in ages would be an understatement!As I mentioned in a previous post, these last few days seem to have had everything collapsing around my ears. Earlier in the year I posted about my water heater conking out. To be honest, it didn't owe me anything as it had to be about 20 years old, but I do wonder sometimes why these things can't conk out in the summer when I don't care so much about hot water, rather than in January when it is -12°! Oh well, not my decision I suppose. As luck would have it my son was off the day it died so was able to run out, buy a new one and install it before I even got home from work (one of the advantages of having a plumber for a son)!  I think I had also mentioned that I am getting my external balcony completely re-done and a side gate to block access to my back garden. Well the young man who will be doing the metal work had told me he couldn't do it before spring 2018 (not a problem for me) but he took the railings off last last year so I have been without railings on that balcony for about six months now. Again not a problem as long I didn't have too much to drink over Christmas (I didn't). Having those railings removed allowed the mason to come in and remove about one third of the balcony and re-build it as it was pretty rotten (ha, and to think I had bought a bucket and chisel and was going to \"do it myself\" - it was the full scaffolding, support, week-long job). All well and good so far, except that about six weeks ago my son noticed a small crack in the balcony. I did my usual \"let's ignore it and see if it goes away\" business but it didn't. Then another crack appeared - blinkers on again, but still it didn't go away. Until last weekend when it didn't stop peeing down and I ended up being virtually able to take a shower underneath my balcony. I was worried that the water could have been channeled into one of three bedrooms on the first floor or into my kitchen, so I called the mason and he came right back out. He spent another three days working on it (trying to work around the rain) but although he repaired the cracks he wasn't too happy about it. Now I trust this young man and he has done great work for me before, but he called me two days ago to say that he was having exactly the same problem with my neighbour's balcony and the only solution he could find was to repair it, put down a rubberized, waterproof layer and then tile it!At this point I'm thinking \"oh to hell with it, if it has to be done\".... Only thing is, that's going to cost me another €1,000 for the work on top of the initial €1,800, then I have about €300 to fork out for the tiles themselves. Oh well! Easy come, easy go, I suppose!  On top of that, my microwave died last week - again not a major problem is it to buy a new microwave, so that was planned for this weekend.  Except on Sunday I felt like cooking so while the oven was heating up I prepared some stuffed chicken breasts. It struck me as odd that the oven seemed to have reached \"cruising altitude\" in about three minutes, as opposed to the usual ten, but ... Anyway, I took my kitchen timer and popped round to drop something off to my neighbour's. I was only gone 10 minutes (according to the timer) but when I got in the house there was smoke streaming out of the oven! \"Chicken's cooked\" sez I! Turns out the chicken was more than cooked, it had been turned into two pieces of charcoal. Thankfully I hadn't hung around at my neighbours as I am pretty sure the oven was on the point of bursting into flames!  Again, the oven didn't owe me anything but bloody hell, that could so easily have burned the house down! Looking at the \"fault\" indicated, the block that should have prevented the oven from going past 180° seemed to have failed so the oven just kept getting hotter and hotter. I managed to get it turned off but three hours later the fan had still not been able to cool the oven so not wanting to go to bed with that risk hanging over my head I found the corresponding fuse and took it out of the fuse box. Problem solved right? Except that was the fuse that also ran my fridge!!! At that point (it was around 11 p.m.) I thought \"sod it\" and left the fuse out and fridge defrosting gaily!! As soon as I put the fuse back in the oven started up again so I had no choice really did I!They say it never rains but it pours does it. Still, I am more than aware that I am lucky enough to have a good job and can afford to repair/replace these things, so while it is a pain in the butt it is nothing more serious than that. The next day I was able to order a new oven and Thursday and Friday being a holiday here I am having it delivered on Friday!  On top of that, the friend of my son who is going to be doing the metalwork for the balcony and the side gate finally has the time to do it, so he will be coming out to take measurements (and pick up a down payment) in order to start work on that. Seems like I'm going to be having a party at my house on Friday then - the oven people, the mason and the metalworker!Oh, and did I mention that every week I give myself a pedicure? Probably not eh! Anyway, I had seen a \"recipe\" which called for soaking your feet in two parts hot water to one part vinegar and one part mouthwash (it works - I love it). Only thing is, I had run out of mouthwash so picked up a \"stronger\" version when I was in town. It was bright green - and that's probably ok when you are only rinsing your mouth with it briefly. However, when you have soaked your feet in it for 20 minutes guess what happens?  Yep, I ended up having to wear boots on Monday and Tuesday until \"lime green trench foot\" wore off!The hole where my oven should be!I'm hoping somebody steals it!I wasn't an avid Top Gear fan but this just happened to be on TV the other night. I watched it (for a second time as I had already seen it) as it was filmed near where my sister lives - a couple of miles down the road. I think the three old ladies were wonderful sports for going along with this!"},
{"title": "Missing in action!", "date": "Monday 7 May 2018", "text": "I've been MIA for a little while because everything seems to be blowing up around here - although thankfully it is just stuff and not me or my family! I will write more on the ongoing saga of \"oh bloody hell not another one\" soon. Needless to say I have been extremely busy at work (it's that time of year where everything is getting frantic) and then \"stuff\" keeps happening, but to put things in their proper perspective we are all healthy and happy and I have a good enough job to be able to repair the \"stuff\".My office colleague and I were chatting away this morning catching up on each other's weekends and I mentioned something about the latest episode in the \"Trump/Stormy\" saga. She doesn't read the papers nor watch the news as she finds it too depressing (I did ask if she knew that Princess Diana was dead) so I started to explain a little behind the ongoing drama of Trump and Stormy - \"no I didn't\", \"well yes I did reimburse my lawyer, but no I didn't have an affair with her\", \"so yeah I did give her the money but not as hush money, rather just to make her go away\"! We were laughing and I said if a man like Trump had nothing to hide he would not pay her to go away, he has the resources to \"sue her for blasphemy ... err, I mean, slander\". We both roared laughing and she said, I think you may have been right the first time! Freudian or what!"},
{"title": "I'll be damned if I can understand it!", "date": "Tuesday 24 April 2018", "text": "I was almost excited to weigh myself this weekend as I had been so good last week, both watching the calories and exercising every day so you can imagine how I felt when the scales told me I had put 3 lbs back on!!!! I was down 7 lbs and now down only 4 so I give up. Well not really because the odd thing is a colleague saw me at the bus stop last week and mentioned \"how much weight I had lost\" and then yesterday, my office colleague who had been away in Paris for the week said she was \"stunned at how much weight I had lost\"! Seemingly the first thing that deflates for me is my belly (which isn't a bad thing) so I actually had two colleagues pointing out my \"weight loss\". I know they say muscle weighs more than fat but I know in all honesty I'm not at the point of developing muscle yet with my puny little regime but I'll take the compliments even if I still can't get my head around this weight loss malarky!On Saturday night we had our fourth (or fifth - I can't remember) board game evening at my neighbours and since we felt we were spending too much time eating lately and not enough time \"board-gaming\" we decided that those of us who could make it would go round to Isa's for 4 o'clock for an apéro and then we would eat a little later and play games after that. Since she only lives on the other side of the hedge from me I was one of the first to arrive so while we waited for the others to show up we played the game of \"guess who I am\" or \"guess what I do\" - or something like that. For the first game we each had a post-it stuck to our foreheads and we had to guess who we were by asking \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. Sometimes it can be slightly more difficult given that we had two different nationalities and each country's \"celebrities\" might mean nothing to the others. For instance, I remember my ex banging on at me one time about how I must remember The Honeymooners, but nope, I'm pretty sure that wasn't on TV in England when I was growing up.Anyway, I had myself figured out to be male/deceased/English and a writer. So I said \"was I born in Stratford?\" My English friend said \"yes\". \"Was I married to Anne Hathaway?\" My English friend said \"yes\". \"Did I write Romeo and Juliet?\" - again yep! So then I said \"I have no idea\" and they all burst out laughing. (For what it's worth I was Shakespeare!). After that we had to guess what activity the others were miming. I was a rotten bugger and put \"giving birth\" as one activity and that was picked up by poor old Michel, who was a good enough sport to give it a shot, although judging from his efforts I'm pretty sure he had already had an epidural!Isabelle playing quiditchAt this point I will be decent and not put up the picture of Valérie who had to be \"constipated\". She was bloody good sport though and gave it her best!This is Isabelle's land as far as the tree in the centre. My house is off to the rightThe pictures taken inside the house were blurry - gotta find my digital camera for next time!In other news, I finally got a small \"Snapfish\" album completed for my son's birthday next month. This is only the second time I have used it and it is quite fiddly, plus some of the photos were photos of photos so not optimal but either way, since both my kids are forever looking through my photo albums I think he will really appreciate it.I realized after I had taken a photo of the cover page of the album that it looks wonky. That must be the sun because it really wasn't. I hope he likes it.And finally, as I made it to Geneva in good time this morning I was able to hop off the bus and walk the last 30 minutes into work, in absolutely perfect walking weather. As I was tootling along the lake I passed one of the stately homes that I pass most days and decided to take a photo of it. I think this one is the Villa Barton and most of the parkland around here was bequeathed to the City of Geneva by the owner, Lady Barton, upon her death. Can you imagine what it would have been like to live in such a beautiful house which, if the truth be told, is nothing special in the grand scheme of beautiful houses, but I think it's lovely - and what a view! Just stunning!"},
{"title": "Finally spring is here!", "date": "Friday 20 April 2018", "text": "And about time too! Honestly I would say it only really \"arrived\" 10 days ago. It feels like it has rained and snowed non-stop since the day after Christmas but at least it is finally here - thank goodness!  I have been so good this week, watching my calories and exercising every lunchtime and walking the last 30 minutes to work three days this week. Weigh-in time soon and I really hope I have lost even a little something, although to be honest I don't feel like I have. Who knows. I guess if not you just have to keep working at it don't you!In the meantime, walking along the lake or in the botanical gardens is just heavenly this time of year. The flowers are starting to bloom and the temperature is just perfect (for me at least - I don't like the heat). I wish someone could bottle spring and sell it as I would buy shares!I have three \"circuits\" that I do at lunchtime - one down to the sauna/turkish baths on the lake and back, three times round the botanical gardens and a slog uphill to the American Mission.  I am almost on my knees by the time I get up to the US Mission but it is very slowly getting a little easier! I use the excuse of taking photos to try to catch my breath and not cough up a lung!A 24-hour \"egg timer\" in the grounds of a local restaurant!I love this tree - which I guess must have been hit by lightning!Château de Penthes - at the top of the hill!Pink flamingos in the botanical gardensI love this kiddies' merry-go-round!To be honest, when you are surrounded by such lovely scenery you have to be a bit pathetic to talk yourself out of at least going walking don't you.A little lakeside bar being set up for the summer!On another note, I see that in England at least there is a plan to ban the use of single use plastic straws and cotton buds with plastic handles (amongst other things). It has yet to be adopted but there seems to be somewhat of a groundswell against plastic and single use products starting up. \"Great\" is all I can say. Recycling and zero waste is something I am very interested in and hope to get more involved in once I retire. At least once a year there is a mass clean up at the Geneva end of Lake Geneva and it is just amazing what is dragged out of this end of the lake alone. The far end of the lake is just past Montreux (think \"Jazz Festival\"), with the north shore being 95 km long and the south shore around 72 km. I don't know what goes on further up the lake but I hope there are groups doing the same thing.And finally, this morning I was looking up laws/regulations and so on dealing with \"importation of llamas and alpacas\". I said to my colleague \"you know you are working in an international environment don't you when you are looking up stuff on llamas and alpacas\"! Which bought to mind a funny story told by a wonderful English comedian called Hugh Dennis. Many years ago he was being interviewed at the BBC studios at Pebblemill in Birmingham. I come from Birmingham and to say that the Brummie accent is atrocious is an understatement. Anyway, apparently, the Dalai Lama was also there being interviewed in another studio. As Hugh was waiting for a taxi to pick him up a young receptionist with a thick Brummie accent called over the tannoy \"taxi for Mr. Lama\"! I guess you had to have been there but Hugh had me in stitches!  So on that note, I'll see you on Monday probably. Have a lovely week-end everyone!Dalai Lama"},
{"title": "The hormonal hula!", "date": "Monday 16 April 2018", "text": "Up and down like a bloody yo-yo, that's me. I mentioned before that I had lost four lbs over the Easter week when I was sick and knew full well that I would put them back on because it was obviously just water loss. Of course I did put weight back on - three lbs to be exact but that still left me five lbs down on my starting weight so I was happy with that. Then at the end of last week I had lost two more lbs, then weighed myself the next day and had put three back on, and then the next day five down!!! Crikey - are you following because I'm having a hard time of it! In the end I weighed myself Saturday and I was down two lbs, for a total of seven lbs over my starting weight. I was really hoping for some weight loss as I had been really good all week with trying to stick to 1,200 calories a day and having exercised in some form or another every day last week. I think the moral of that story is don't weigh yourself more than once a week isn't it!  So, onwards and upwards (or downwards, hopefully)!On the decluttering side I did pretty well last week too. I took two bags of clothes to the local consignment store where they took seven dresses (four with the labels still on them - what was I thinking) and they said to come back with the coats/suits later in the year. I also put three woolen winter dresses in the charity bin near home - I quite liked the dresses but hadn't worn them all winter and with my ever-growing belly they tended to make me look like a mobile sock so out they went. I also took jewelry - most of which I had bought at the market in Turin last year - down to the charity shop in Geneva one lunchtime, which was a good excuse to get in some walking. It's weird isn't it though that no matter how much stuff I seem to be throwing out some little gremlin sneaks out in the middle of the night and fills those gaps back up. Huh! I have set gremlin traps but haven't managed to catch any so I will just have to continue to keep an eye out for them I guess!And it finally feels like spring is sprung (at last), with the tulips and daffs in particular bursting out of the ground and the pollen seeming to settle endlessly in my eyes and nose. It's not as bad as it was but it still affects me, sadly. Funnily enough I didn't really start suffering from hay fever until I hit around 40 and then it was miserable for about five years, after which it calmed right back down. Now I seem to get the occasional \"red eye\" and itchy nose but it's much better than it was. I have a friend who used to suffer terribly from allergies, the whole permanent red eye and runny nose, the lot. Now I know a little of how she felt!This weekend a friend and I trotted up to a place called Châtillon-sur-Cluses for a vide-grenier. She picked up a lovely painted metal watering can and I got these lovely serving dishes for €3 the pair! Lovely aren't they? I know, I know, I'm supposed to be decluttering but I couldn't resist these!Actually there is a lot of this kind of china about - particularly blue and pink floral - and I love it, but I have to be reasonable, even though I know I could go nuts for it!The \"vide-grenier\" at ChâtillonAfter that we went down the mountain to a place called Marnaz where a local craft exhibition was on. It was only small but there was some beautiful stuff there. Not all of it was for sale - my friend was particularly interested in a beautiful quilt and a painted wooden scene, but unfortunately neither were for sale.These pearly king and queen's outfits were entirely made out of coffee capsules!Decorative mail boxesOutfits for carnaval!Lace-makingAfter that we headed down to a local garden centre to pick up some plants. I tell you, I could spend a fortune in these places as the stuff was just so lovely. I bought a few plants to replace the dying plants I had rescued from my ex's place a couple of years ago, plus decorative outdoor plants, some strawberry and fennel plants, and a couple more tomato plants. Local lore has it that you don't plant delicate plants out round here until after the Saints de Glace (which is around 15 May). You may as well listen to the locals because I have ended up throwing so many young plants away when I thought I knew better! So I put the delicate plants outside during the day and will keep bringing them into the house at night for another couple of weeks.A solar lamp picked up at the garden centreI actually got all my planting/repotting done yesterday evening!It's weird actually because I have been reading so many blogs lately where the ladies are on the run up to retirement. All being well I am planning to go myself in 2020. The big sticking point for me is getting my mortgage paid off because without that I can't retire, my mortgage being too large a chunk of my prospective pension. Still I reckon I can have that paid off nine years early in spring 2020 and after that, \"Bob's your uncle\" as we say in England. I can't wait because although I am not unhappy at work and do indeed have nice colleagues I feel it is time to move on to other things, and seeing all the wonderful crafts produced in these exhibitions I suspect I will wonder how on earth I managed to fit everything in when I was working! Fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "Weighty matters!", "date": "Tuesday 10 April 2018", "text": "I think I may have mentioned before that my house is getting me down. Don't get me wrong, it's not dirty or anything (well not that bad anyway) but there is just too much stuff! On top of my own capacity to collect \"stuff\", I inherited all my ex' junk when he just abandoned his three-bedroom farmhouse nearly three years ago. I mentioned at the time that my youngest and his gf were able to take quite a bit of it when they moved into their own place and over the space of the two months' notice period he had to give after he had gone back to the States I went up every weekend and sorted and pitched what I could, but I still have a load of his crap in the basement. On top of that, of course, since the basement is very large, I also have anything the kids didn't want to take with them when they moved out - don't we all!Anyway, it has been getting me down so as I was beginning to feel better towards the weekend I decided to have a shot at getting rid of 10 things a day. Not saying that will always be easy but I was willing to give it a go. Of course the first 10 were easy - magazines and things that I was \"going to read\" sometime. They went straight to the tip - don't know anyone that would want 20 year old copies of The Good Food Guide in English around here anyway. And of course \"old me\" says there are probably some good recipes in there but newly-minted me just said \"ah bite me\" - so in the recycling they went. I was easily able to throw out more odds and ends, plus things like - oh you know suntan lotion that is way out of date and that I don't use anyway because I don't sit in the sun at all! So easy peasy again. But next came the slightly more difficult issue of rather nice dresses that fitted me at the time I bought them but that I had never worn - and now I no longer could if I wanted to! You know, those kinds of things! That stuff was a little trickier because there are some lovely things in amongst them but hell, if they didn't fit me 18 months ago they sure as heck don't fit me now. Nope, not even that Karen Millen dress with the label still on it!!!! So I just took a deep breath and ploughed in until I had gotten 10 items on my bed, photographed them and put in a bag to take to the second-hand shop on Saturday. This shop is a new consignment store and I wouldn't mind getting a little \"pin money\" for some of it. I'm sure it will sell - what with the labels still on but we will see. I have also taken another large bag of stuff down to the charity shop and am planning more sorting tonight. Three books to donate to our second-hand book shop here at work meant I had to go over and sort out the cash kept there as I am the group's treasurer. So I took the bull by the horns and trotted my little petty cash tin with its millions of small coins in it to the bank here in work where the lovely lady with a fixed grin and gritted teeth counted it all out for me and guess what - just short of 1,000 Swiss francs - so over $1,000 that we can decide which charity to donate to shortly. Yikes, small change really does add up doesn't it!At the weekend I fished out three rather large bilingual dictionaries I had - English/French, English/Spanish and English/German, photographed them and put an ad up here at work and also on Freecycle just on the off chance anyone was jurassic enough to still use proper dictionaries and guess what - they went within the hour! It would have been a tough thing for me to actually throw them out as I love books so I am so glad they have gone to a good home!Oddly enough, even just getting rid of one or two small things seems to lift a small weight off your shoulders doesn't it, so by my reckoning, at this rate, lifting constant small weights \"off my shoulders\" I should weigh around 120 lb before Christmas! Ha! Like I said yesterday, \"I don't want to talk about my weight\" because having lost 4 lbs in one week when I was sick I knew it would go right back on immediately I got better but, even though three of those pounds did indeed go right back on I am still down one pound on last week, making a total of five \"real\" pounds in two weeks, so I'll go with that!Oh and remember yesterday I mentioned about the two kids that had been arrested for blowing up the gas bottles at the local supermarket - turns out they were 14 and 15! Bloody hell. Not sure if they were feral kids or just idiots. More to follow I guess.And finally, since my commute can be hellish at times I am signed up to a FB \"motorway alert\" for accidents called in in the local area. Mostly I get these alerts in French but just occasionally Mr. Google decides to translate them into English. A traffic jam/bottleneck in French is called a \"bouchon\" - which is also the same word for a cork in a bottle. Anyway, yesterday for some reason Mr. Google decided to send me an alert in English, which came out as \"beware large cork on the road near the junction of .....\"! Well it tickled me anyway!"},
{"title": "A better weekend!", "date": "Monday 9 April 2018", "text": "Well this weekend was a vast improvement over last weekend both in terms of the weather (which was great - finally) and in that I felt so much better. I had to drag myself through work on Thursday and Friday and on Friday night I slept over 11 hours - I'm surprised my bladder didn't explode!!! But man did it do some good! So on Saturday I was up and fresh as a daisy.Buuuuuuttttt late on Friday night I initially couldn't sleep so was still up at 11.30 reading when I heard \"boom, boom, boom\" - absolutely roaring bangs! My first thought was \"fireworks\" but then I realized you don't let fireworks off at 11.30 at night - you start when the sun goes down. Then I thought, \"oh they're triggering avalanches\" as this is the season to be wary of them. But again, you don't do that at 11.30 at night. I couldn't figure it out but eventually went to bed and slept with the fairies (see above). Found out next day that two \"individuals\" had been filmed on security cameras at the petrol station/gas bottle station of the local supermarket setting light to the gas bottles!!!! How stupid do you have to be!!!!! They had their faces covered but were obviously a bit thick as it only took 12 hours to pick up the two of them. There was some gossip about \"terrorism\" but honestly, if you want to hurt people you don't do it at midnight. Then \"maybe it is someone with a grudge against the supermarket\". Turns out two 16-year olds have been taken into custody and placed with social services pending appearance in court. Apparently about 20 gas bottles went up, with one landing really close to the petrol pumps, but thankfully no-one was hurt - although how those two idiots weren't killed is beyond me!Anyway, after all the excitement on Saturday morning I had to run down to a local village as I wanted to book my friend and I on another day trip to Turin market. The company we have been with twice already never replied to my email about dates but this company seems to be much bigger and much more professional, so we are booked in like two little old ladies with our granny bags for the trip on 26 May (departure 6 a.m. - yikes). I know we've been a few times but it really is a nice day out and you can get some good bargains too, as well as the wonderful fruit and veg!  I was talking to the young woman who did my reservation and asking about bus trips to Cinq Terres (Italy), which isn't too far from here but she said that they hadn't made any plans so far this year but that they certainly would be doing so because there is so much interest in it. It would be a four/five day trip so I will definitely look forward to that. In fact, Jordan and Jen are going for four days in May at a wonderful price through Jen's work - lucky buggers, but I'm glad for them as even though they are not the international jet setters André and Lily are they definitely do some good trips too (Rome was the last one).Since I am still working I am more interested in day trips at the moment to be honest so I might try their day trip to Lyon. Lyon is only 90 minutes away but I don't know if I have the nerve to drive round there any more as they drive like lunatics. Plus of course on the bus the driving/parking is not your problem. We used to joke when I was young about the old biddies on their day trips to Weston-Super-Mare - guess who seems to have become one of the old biddies now!After doing my usual Saturday morning run around I decided to take another trip to the new local organic shop. Finally it seems to be taking off around here so we actually have some choice. It is of course hellish expensive but I realize I am still wasting food so maybe if I bought less, but better quality, even it it is more expensive, it might be a positive. For me the test of \"is it worth it?\" is the taste, and the ultimate taste test has got to be strawberries and tomatoes. I had already bought strawberries at the market so I picked up some tomatoes at the organic store and yes it definitely was worth it! The plastic, tasteless stuff we get in the shops is so disgusting that I generally don't bother anymore until my own, homegrown toms come in. I'll see how it goes but I think buy less but better might be the way to go, for me. A first world luxury I realize but I am on my own!Talking of \"growing your own\" I was chatting in the back garden with my neighbour while he was cutting back branches, so I asked him to save a few for me as stakes for my tomato plants. I think he must have supreme confidence in my tomato-growing ability don't you - those suckers are almost two metres long!!!Then on Sunday I ended up going all round the reekin to find one of the first vide-greniers (car boot/garage sales) of the season in a lovely little village called Arbusigny. It's not far from here but I kept getting diverted because of roadworks. Not much there of interest but at least it was a trip out. After that it was on to a very well organized garden/plant/local skills themed fair in another local village. While the weather was overcast it held out which was great as there was quite a bit to see.These metal poppies were about two metres tall and I would have loved them, but at €110 a pop I couldn't justify it, so I came away with three tomato plants and three broccoli plants - who says I don't know how to throw my money around!  Still, it was a pleasant way to spend the weekend after all this rain and it finally feels like spring has sprung. Oh and my weight? I don't want to talk about it!!!!!"},
{"title": "Been absent for a few days!", "date": "Thursday 5 April 2018", "text": "Not that I had done anything fantastic for Easter but my neighbour, her daughter and I headed off to the hot springs at Lavey on Good Friday. It should only take about 90 minutes to get there but due to an accident it took three hours! Still, you know women - we yacked for three solid hours, sorting out world peace and all that! Then just when I had a chance to get off the motorway and \"go around the accident\", the traffic started moving again only about 100 metres further along! Still, we had a lovely few hours together in the springs. I knew it would do M good as she suffers from arthritis and seemed to love the pummeling from the stronger jets. That would have been a great day out I guess but for some reason I felt really cold when I got out. Probably didn't dry my hair properly and that was a definite mistake in this crappy weather. Honestly, it seems like we have had non-stop rain since Christmas - interspersed with the occasional snow fall. Like so many others I'm totally fed up of it now and spring can show up anytime it wants!I didn't do much over Easter but to add to my stupidity I decided, like always, to pressure spray my back terrace to clean up some of the grime from the winter. Only problem was, by this time most years the weather is starting to warm up but this time the rain started when I was about 30 minutes into it - then followed by a little snow - and stubborn old me decided I wasn't giving up and I was getting the damn thing finished one way or another. Which, in the end meant getting soaking wet and sick as a dog for the next two days. I really should get it in my head that I'm not 25 anymore and I just can't go on pretending like I am.  Anyway, the good news (if you can call it that) is that I didn't feel like eating for about three days and when I weighed myself this morning I am down a total of 8 lbs. Of course I'm pretty sure some of that will go back on when I get back to normal but .... I'll take what I can get at the moment.So sorry not to have been commenting on your blogs lately but I intend to get back to it when I feel a bit better."},
{"title": "4 lbs down! Yay me!", "date": "Tuesday 27 March 2018", "text": "I know I said I was starting my diet (yet again) last Monday but in fact I only started on the Wednesday. Either way I am thrilled to announce that I am 4 lbs down this morning. While that sounds great of course, I was actually 6 lbs down on Sunday morning but back up again on Monday so as you can see, I really am up and down like a yo yo - which I put down to water retention of course. Still, I'm more than happy with that and I was very good about eating and exercising too last week so yay me! Sunday I kind of went off the rails as I was hungry for something but didn't seem to be able to figure out just what but never mind, back on track now. It's easier to get back in the swing of things when I am at work in any case because there is a discipline about the routine but we'll see what this week holds. In order to feel like I have achieved anything I need to lose about 7 lbs and keep it off so the next couple of weeks will be telling!Yesterday I had the first day of one of my large meetings (the second day is Wednesday) and it was quite amazing how many steps I clock up on my fitbit when I have these meetings. No worries there about getting in my 10,000 steps a day! Just goes to show how a sedentary lifestyle can really mess with you doesn't it!Anyway, I'm a bit rushed this week so just in case I don't check in again with you, I hope you all have a lovely Easter and here's to spring being just around the corner!"},
{"title": "All quiet on the western front (again)!", "date": "Tuesday 20 March 2018", "text": "There's not much new to report here really but I thought I should just check in. Last week was a bit of a disaster workout/weight-wise. The weather was cruddy all week and while I don't mind the cold I don't particularly want to go out in the rain. Not that that's much of an excuse really because we actually have a gym here at work but I just couldn't be arsed to use it last week. Anyway, I weighed myself on Monday and there was no change from the previous week, but then why should there be? Still, even though it was actually snowing when I left home yesterday morning I managed to get in a one hour walk along the lake at lunchtime yesterday, but boy was it cold. Then again, that's nothing compared to the weather today! The \"bise\" wind is blowing and while it makes everything stunningly beautiful the wind chill factor makes it pretty unbearable to be outside in. So this lunchtime I decided to actually use our gym and - as always - I feel wonderful afterwards. Now if someone could just bottle this feeling (either that or bottle willpower) they would make a mint wouldn't they!Anyway, we'll see how this week goes weight-wise. I went to my sewing club last night and only three of us turned up. Not a problem as I had stuff to do in preparation for my patchwork lesson tonight (we're starting a new project). But just as we were wondering where everyone was in walked one of our younger ladies who had just had her first baby and she (and dad) bought the babe in to show us. What a little cutie she was, tons of dark hair and all smiley faced but the end result was that in two hours we didn't even get our sewing machines out so I have to somehow catch up on all the stuff I should have prepared for tonight's lesson! However, just before we left I started showing the other two ladies the beautiful fabric that I had bought on Saturday for my next patchwork project and then somehow (as you do) we got on to moaning about our commutes/aches and pains/weight and so on, and I decided to bite the bullet and tell them that I was starting a new diet this week and that they could hold me accountable!!!! So there you go, I've done it now!I had commented on Sam's blog (A New Frame of Reference) that I would go alone with her and try to lose 6 lb by the end of March. So far it isn't looking great (I think I must have lost 10 grams the day I shaved my legs but not much else since). Like her I am tired of lugging this weight around. Oddly enough, when I went to Costa Rica my case weighed in at bang on 18 kg - which was quite a sobering thought when I realized that that is about the amount of weight I would (ideally) like to lose. My case was heavy! Of course I'm not carrying those extra 18 kg in my right hand am I (unless my knuckles are really heavy) but still, it's not comfortable. I'm not grossly obese by any means but certainly overweight. I think what gets to me more though is the clothes - or the \"granny grunt\" clothes as I call them. Like most of us, I suppose, I liked clothes shopping when I was slimmer. Now - nah, not so much! It isn't helped by living in France of course where obesity is far from the norm and the woman are, for the most part, still slim and fashionable. Not all of course but .... So anyway I have signed up for the 12-week NHS (UK National Health Service) weight loss programme. It's open to anyone of course (as long as you realize 14 lb is 1 stone you'll fly through it) and is basically just good, solid, no nonsense advice. So I reckon that gives me till mid-June to knock some of this weight off. There, I've put it out there now.In other news, on Saturday we held our fourth board game evening at my immediate neighbours. There were 12 of us this time and again it was great fun but - get this - we have now decided that we will have to start our evenings earlier because we are are all bringing in so much food that we seem to be eating a very good three course meal before we even start playing!!! Lordy, lordy, we've started something now haven't we! So we've decided that next time we will begin at 4 p.m. in order to have an aperitif/eat before we get into the games evening. Sounds good to me - and it is nice to spend time not only with my neighbours but also with my youngest and his girlfriend, who both seem to enjoy it as much as I do.Saturday was also my oldest son and his wife's first wedding anniversary! I can't believe it, it has simply flown by! So I sent them a message wishing them a happy anniversary - but got no reply, which I thought was odd. Anyway, on Sunday evening I got a reply from my son, who said they were stuck at Zurich airport having missed their flight back from San Francisco! I didn't even know the little buggers were going away but they had just spent a whirlwind 10 days going round some of the bigger tourist spots of the American west. He was texting me so it wasn't very detailed but they said that just as they arrived at one of the lodges they spotted a mountain lion! They weren't quick enough to get a photo but when they spoke to one of the rangers he said that he hadn't seen a mountain lion in 10 years! André said they were actually scared to get out of the car to go into reception (I told him he should have sent Lily in - she can be scary!) but they had a wonderful time. I don't doubt it one bit. Can't wait to see their pictures though. I'm glad both my kids have the travel bug and are adventurous. I mean, you have plenty of time to settle down once the family comes along don't you so I say go for it while you can. My youngest and his gf were telling me that the previous weekend they had gone up the mountains near here for a fondue and afterwards, using head lamps, they luged all the way back down to the car park from the restaurant in the dark. Sounds like heaven eh!And finally, I seem to be stumbling upon some pretty good books at the moment so my miserable commute is not always quite as miserable as it might be as I get to read for two 45 minute bus rides to and from work every day. It seems like the goods book reads keep rolling in at the moment so I am a happy bunny. But more on that in another post!"},
{"title": "Feel the burn!", "date": "Tuesday 13 March 2018", "text": "After leaving Costa Rica our first stopover was in Toronto and as soon as my phone picked up the airport's wifi I got a \"pinged\" message from British Airways - trouble was, it was in German! Really helpful that, when you've been up since 4 a.m! Still, I learned German many moons ago (forgot most of it) but I was able to decipher words to the effect that one way or another I was not going to be on my 15h flight from London to Geneva the next day. I couldn't tell if it was just me that was being kicked off or if the whole flight was being cancelled but what I could figure out was \"we have, therefore, put you on the 18h flight. Click here to accept!\" I thought bugger that, I get in at 06.30h and I am not hanging around for 12 hours in London (although better London than Toronto frankly, from my point of view) for my next flight with no guarantee of even leaving then. I knew Swiss Air fly from Heathrow so I decided that come what may I was getting out of there one way or another - and however much it cost!Anyway, we landed on time so I trudged myself over to terminal 5 and thankfully made it to the BA desk before anyone else was awake. When I showed the nice BA chappie my phone message he said \"but it's in German\" so I said \"wow, I didn't notice that, but from what I can decipher I'm not getting on my next flight am I?\" He then went checked his computer and went on to explain that with the expected storm due to hit the southeast shortly, BA would be cancelling quite a few flights out of Heathrow that day, not because they couldn't  handle the volume of flights but because they didn't have the de-icing equipment necessary to keep up with that number of flights. Apparently you have 20 minutes after a plane is de-iced to get it off the ground or you have to start all over again. He then proceeded to tell me that they had booked me on the 18h flight but I said that I hadn't \"clicked here\" to accept it and was going to try my luck with Swiss Air, when the wonderful young man sitting next to him said they could get me on the 9.40h and would that suit me? I could have kissed him. It was already better than my original flight time and again in business. I have to say, considering they were probably going to be in for a helluva lot of complaining that day they handled the whole thing very professionally and with humour, although I'm sure that at the end of the day the perma-smile might have begun to wear a bit thin!So I made it back early and seemingly one step ahead of the storm all the way along. I was well pleased. Until the next day, that is, where I went from +40°C to -11°C in one fell swoop - or from this:to this:and this:Obviously if you travel in \"your\" winter to someone else's summer you  have to expect this kind of thing but even though I am used to the cold and don't actually mind it, this big of a change was quite a shock to the system.And then of course there were the infernal traffic jams. Second day back I got stuck on the motorway behind this:which managed to make my already hellish commute even more hellish, although thankfully no-one was hurt in this pile-up. But this morning some lunatic was racing down the motorway in the wrong direction (beats me how you can even do that) so my morning commute was again almost three hours! Ah the joys of the daily commute.Still, I do love it here whatever the season, and last Thursday three of us went out for lunch to celebrate two birthdays in a yurt restaurant which is only available during the winter and which was shortly about to be dismantled. I actually got married in this little village and my husband and I went for a drink after our town hall wedding - just the two of us - in this same restaurant (although not in the yurt). And for once I was able to get a good shot of the alps - even if it was only with my phone. Usually they are in a \"haze\" but the heavy snowfall had briefly cleared all the haze away.Of course I weighed myself when I came back (beerrrrkkkkk) and since I was as heavy as I had ever been I decided that I had better get back in the weight loss saddle. I was very good last week about exercising and even (seriously) got out the old Jane Fonda original workout and did those (nearly suffocated myself doing the shoulder stand), but this week it has gone to pot a bit so I have to get back at it. It's tough, though, when the weather is crap as it makes getting outside harder and we seem to have had non-stop rain since last week. So yet again, it's onwards and upwards for me.In my dreams!My reality! (Picture by Design Studio)Although seriously where tonight's Chinese cookery class fits in with my weight loss goals is eluding me for the moment!"},
{"title": "And finally!", "date": "Monday 12 March 2018", "text": "Our last day in Costa Rica was to be spent - I thought - travelling from Manual Antonio National Park direct to San Jose where we would spend our last night before flying out the following morning. What I hadn't realized was that Ron, our guide, had other plans. We drove straight from the hotel to the local marina where we were booked on a boat trip which included snorkeling, sight-seeing with lunch and a cocktail thrown in! What a lovely way to finish our vacation!  The trip lasted about three hours and while I chose not to snorkel as I wanted to stay out of the sun, it was a very relaxing way to \"seal the deal\", so to speak.After that it was all back in the van and San Jose bound. On the way we stopped at a souvenir shop but again, it was very pricey. Sorry but while everything was beautiful there was no way I was going to pay those kinds of prices - until - I saw the prettiest photo albums whereupon my willpower cracked. I didn't spend a fortune and I was thinking of making an album up for my son, who will be 26 in May, since every time my boys come over they end up pulling out the photo albums. In fact, I am at this moment trying to set up snapfish albums for both of them, but not being very technically minded and finding snapfish a bit fiddly anyway I think it would be best if I aimed to make these albums for Christmas presents rather than birthday presents. The Costa Rican photo albums, though, are quite small and I'm pretty sure I can fill them with childhood photos for both of them.As we were leaving the gift shop the heavens opened and my goodness did it rain. It make me quite nostalgic for England actually!!! But seriously, that was some downpour, even if it only lasted about 20 minutes. Then of course as we got nearer to San Jose we also hit rush-hour traffic - again a reminder that it would shortly be back to the grindstone for me!That evening the six of us in our group all decided to eat together in the hotel, and what a laugh we had! Sally (one of the older ladies) was quite the character and she was telling us that since she retired at the age of 66 she has been constantly busy taking courses with U3A (University of the Third Age). Her latest foray has been to take piano lessons, given that the clarinet lessons weren't much of a success! She took up clarinet for the simple reason that they had one at home from when her son used to play. The only thing was, she started learning in September and she found out that they were supposed to play a concert in December!!! She was like \"what the flip, I can barely even read music\" and then she did an impression of her desperately trying to read the music during the concert, spotting a note that must have been \"one of hers\" and \"giving a toot\" about every 30 seconds! I guess you had to be there but we were crying laughing at the visual. So then we all pitched in telling the stupid stuff we had done. I don't know why this came to mind really but I told the story of when I was still in primary school (so under 11 years of age), and my friend, Dawn, came to see me because she was supposed to be in a swimming gala in Tuesday but her mom had been rushed to hospital and she didn't want to compete. I didn't know what to say so in the end I told her not to worry, that I would go and see Miss Moore and tell her that I would replace her in the gala - the only trouble was that I couldn't swim!!! I somehow pictured myself going off to the swimming baths on Saturday, learning to swim that afternoon, and competing in a race on Tuesday night! Bloody hell! I could just imagine the looks on my parents' faces as I threw myself in that pool - and most likely promptly drowned! Luckily (for me) Miss Moore had other ideas about Dawn's replacement!We didn't stay up too late that night as four of us had a 5.20 a.m. taxi ride to the airport, so we all bade each other farewell and promised to swap photos (which we have). I have to say, though, that Costa Rica is beautiful and I was lucky enough to have joined a very small and very friendly group - so success all round, I would say. The journey home was quite another story - but there's time for that another day I think!"},
{"title": "La suite!", "date": "Friday 9 March 2018", "text": "After two nights spent in Monteverde we made our way back down to the lower altitudes and on to our next stop, which was Manuel Antonio National Park. On the way there we stopped to pick up picnic lunches as we were going to visit another park beforehand and right there, at the bridge over the Rio Tarcoles, we got to photograph heaving masses of crocodiles. There were 100s of the bloody things (ok maybe a slight exaggeration but definitely tens of the bloody things). Wouldn't want to be down there trying to swim.After that a short stop to Carara National Park for our picnic lunch and a quick shufty, but apart from these rather weird looking iguanas we honestly didn't see much, to be honest. I guess it is hit and miss isn't it, but I'm not complaining as we had already seen so much.After that short stop it was on to our most lovely destination - Manuel Antonio National Park! We stayed about 500 metres from the entrance and while the guide was giving us the basic rundown on how the next couple of days would pan out I saw a troop of about 10 monkeys running along the telephone wires! I was so excited. I guess when you don't live in a place where monkeys roam freely it is just so exciting - well at least it was to me. Could it get better? Well yes it did actually!The next day we set off on foot for the park for about 45 minutes of bird/animal watching/hunting. This is in fact where I saw the next sloth but even through the microscope he didn't come out great in the photo. After about 45 very hot and humid minutes we arrived at the beach, only to be met by the largest and most beautiful butterfly I have ever seen. I think this one is called the Blue Morpho (but don't take my word for it). He was all over the place and looked to be about six inches across with the most stunning, shiny blue wings. Of course, every time he landed he closed his wings so I wasn't able to catch a photo of him but oh my, how beautiful!Courtesy of Hilary PThe beach was absolutely stunning and hardly anyone there. If that had been England it would have been standing room only and then people sitting on your shoulders!Our guide did warn us, however, to watch out for the raccoons who seemingly had no fear of humans and would come rummaging through your bags looking for food if you weren't careful. And they did! Little groups of two or four, coming right up to the sleeping beachgoers and trying to get into their bags!  He also told us that around mid-day the monkeys would come bounding down, also looking for food - and you guessed it, bingo, at mid-day they came swooping down! In fact, my colleague was telling me that when she and her husband were in Costa Rica a monkey stole a banana off a beachgoer, tucked it under his arm and charged off, with the \"rightful owner\" of the banana racing after him. Her husband just happened to be in the right place at the right time to point his camera and starting clicking - she said it is the most amazing picture!There was what appeared to be a mother with between three and five babies in amongst the troop of monkeys. Her face was all scratched up so I don't know if she had been fighting with other adults or whether it was scratches from the babies, but I wouldn't have liked to get too close to her (naturally). It really was a lovely way to begin winding down our trip. We had two nights in Manuel Antonio before we had to head off back to San Jose, but talk about saving the best for last!"},
{"title": "And on we went!", "date": "Wednesday 7 March 2018", "text": "After our two night stay in La Fortuna we headed out for the Cloud Forest National Park at Monteverde. Monteverde is situated at 1,500 metres above sea level and I was sooooo glad I had taken my ski jacket as it was howling wind, pouring rain and bloody freezing! It was so weird to go from 25°C to God-only-knows how cold in one day but that's what we did in the space of about four hours, I guess. On the way there we stopped at a lovely little restaurant for lunch, overlooking a reservoir and as always the food was very good but the souvenirs pretty pricey!About 10 minutes after we left the restaurant the driver pulled over as there was a whole colony (?) of coatis crossing the road. It was really weird - they took no notice of us and didn't seem to be bothered by the traffic either. Such funny looking little beasts (thought the coati to himself ....)!We made it to our hotel around 6 pm, if I remember right, and my goodness, you should have seen the size of our rooms! Ruth was the only one who didn't  have the massive bedroom that we others had (I think they were probably studios for families) but she had an enclosed veranda so she could sit outside, even though the wind was ferocious!That is actually a triple bed with the bath/jacuzzi in the background and the shower room to the left, but there are stairs to a mezzanine to the left out of picture and that also has two double beds! Crikey, all that room for little old me!  When we were checking in one of the receptionists told our guide that a security guard had seen a puma in the grounds the night before! Now I know (being cynical) that they could be saying that for the benefit of the tourists but our guide seemed so thrilled I'm sure it was true! On the way down to dinner that night we did see an agouti crossing our path (saw quite a few of them in fact) but no pumas!My picture as crap so this is a stock image!Our guide offered to take those that were interested on a pre-dawn walk through the forest to see if they could catch any interesting wildlife. I begged off as I was tired and in any case wanted a few hours to have a massage (yeah, I know, first world priorities right) but apparently they didn't see much, just a few exotic birds, much to the delight of the avid bird watchers amongst us!Picture courtesy of Hilary PTwo of our ladies took a trip to a local park where you could go over the suspension bridges but they got absolutely soaked to the skin, so I was glad I had had the massage instead. I certainly didn't want to be getting sick for the remainder of my trip through sloshing around in wet clothes.And then finally, on the last afternoon, we went to the Cloud Forest National Park, where to be honest we didn't see much more than we had already seen but at least we did avoid getting soaked - although just by the skin of our teeth.We were only there a couple of hours and trekked up to a little waterfall, which was very pretty, but I think we were all glad to get out of the cold and wet the following morning. We had to get up at 4.30 a.m. in order to be on the road by 6.00 a.m. as in order to allow workers to maintain the access road, the local authorities closed it to traffic for \"X\" number of hours per day in order to allow the work to progress. So we, therefore, had to be through \"Checkpoint Charlie\" before lockdown.  Which we did. I am not a morning person but it's amazing how you can adapt to early mornings when you have to, isn't it!"},
{"title": "Costa Rica Part Deux!", "date": "Tuesday 6 March 2018", "text": "After our short stay around Danaus, we spent the following two nights in La Fortuna, near the Arenal volcano. I have to say the hotels were pretty basic but clean enough but a hair dryer would have been a treat and (if I am thinking of the right hotel here) somewhere to hang my clothes other than two coat hangers. Still, at this point we weren't really thinking of unpacking and as I'm not difficult I could work with that. I had actually packed a travel hair dryer which turned out kinda like trying to dry your hair by having a sleeping baby breathe on it but hey, by the end of the trip I was definitely going for the \"bird's nest soup\" look anyway so I pretty much gave up.Our first trip that morning was to the Arenal volcano. It wasn't such a long walk up to the volcano but it was very hot and humid. Thankfully, our guide turned out to be quite a bird enthusiast and kept stopping every 50 metres or so to point out unusual birds. I don't have much problem at all with walking/hiking but I have real problems with the heat so I was pretty glad when he pointed out what felt like every native bird in Costa Rica!  The volcano was impressive (and thankfully still sleeping) but the humidity did me in, I have to admit.Our guide made the misery up to us later by taking us to spend the evening at one of the many hot springs in the Arenal region, followed by dinner.I thought our local hot springs at Lavey-les-Bain were impressive (which of course they are) but these were just bliss with plenty of room for everyone and gorgeous temperatures both in and out of the springs.The next day Ron had us out at La Fortuna waterfall. I have a lovely video taken from mid-way down these falls but I'll be damned if I can get it to upload to blogger. Facebook no problem, but not blogger. Anyway, Ron warned us that it was 500 steps down to the water hole/swimming hole so obviously \"500 steps back up\", although in reality it felt like 10,000!!! On the way back up I was counting the bloody steps out loud to myself in Spanish and at one point sat next to a Costa Rican lady to catch my breath and told her we were on step 249! She laughed so we slogged our way back up the remaining 251 together. I think she thought I was going to have a heart attack as I was puce in the face but again it's not the climbing that does me in, but the heat. Anyway, we both made it and went and had a drink together at the top - where we spotted the prettiest praying mantis, and for once I was able to get a close up that didn't come out too badly!"},
{"title": "Trundling along!", "date": "Monday 5 March 2018", "text": "Well after a sharp jolt back down to earth last week, what with going back to work and getting clobbered with the snow (not to mention an approximate 50°C difference in temperature!), here I am back at work and eagerly looking forward to spring.  Strangely enough I don't seem to have suffered from jet lag but I have to admit a temperature of -11°C on getting into my car for work on Wednesday was a bit of a shock to the system. Luckily, as I have said before, I have never minded the cold, but getting hammered with snow on Thursday and Friday was another thing altogether. Looking at my garden I would say we got about 10 inches of snow over the two days, with Friday morning bringing really heavy snow and then all of a sudden at lunchtime - pouff - it stopped and I was able to get home pretty easily! It's just weird. Now today the temperature has \"soared\" up to about 7°C so of course the snow is melting faster than you can put your moon boots away, but that's fine too. As I always say, snow is great in the mountains, but on the roads - nah, not so much.On the bus this morning I picked up the free local paper (20 Minutes) and noticed a beautiful photo of people skating on the Lac de Joux in the Jura mountains near here. We used to go up there quite a bit when we lived in the Canton of Vaud (in Switzerland). It is a much smaller, shallower lake than Lake Geneva but very peaceful and very beautiful and this photo just leaped off the page at me - reminded me of a Breugel painting really - even if fewer people were skating than might have been expected because of the snow cover on the frozen lake.  As I say, I saw these pictures in the newspaper but couldn't find who to accredit them to so sorry about that.Anyway, back to Costa Rica (I wish). We arrived in San Jose quite late on the Saturday evening so were basically shown to our rooms and we all just jumped into bed to try to catch up with the time zone. There were only six of us in our group and we all ended up getting along famously. There was a younger couple who put us all to shame with their energy levels and enthusiasm, another single lady of a similar age to me, and two older lady friends who had known each other for over 40 years since their children were at school together and who had routinely travelled all over the world together (husbands notwithstanding) for the past however many years - and very nice they all were too.On the first day we met our guide, Ron, who was great, and Gustavo, who was going to be our minibus driver for the duration - and again a really nice chap. Since we were setting off for our next hotel immediately, we stopped en route at the Doka Coffee Estate for a guided tour of the plantation. Now I know these things can get old but since I had never been to a coffee plantation it was interesting, for me at least. And guess what, they take some of their fabulous coffee beans and coat them in either white, milk or dark chocolate and they are sublime! Really good - but - and this would be a feature of CR - pretty expensive. I think US$16 for a small packet of chocolate-covered beans. I had been warned by my Costa Rican colleague that it is not cheap but I was a little shocked at the price of the souvenirs and to some extent the cost of the food. While the food was invariably very good everywhere we ate (in the little sodas - not big fancy restaurants), I found them to be only a little cheaper than Geneva prices, while the others - all living in Britain - found it to be more expensive than the UK).On the way we stopped briefly in a couple of villages for the usual \"church visits\" and so on which included the little town of Sarchi, which is home to the world's biggest ox cart, a symbol of the traditional Costa Rican way of farming.After that we were supposed to be visiting the Poas Volcano but since it had been \"exhibiting all the signs of a stomach upset\" rather recently we couldn't make it, so instead headed off to the Danaus Ecocentre - which is where I got to see my first sloth! Yipee! They put plantains out for the wildlife right at the entrance and the birds were just so magical, but me with my stupid ipad - I couldn't get much in the way of pictures as they were just too fast. Which makes me think, I don't like my big expensive camera because it is too heavy but many moons ago, on a flight back from the UK, I bought a small digital camera in the duty free so I must look that out for my next trip - as well as invest in a small pair of binoculars. You live and learn I guess. I shall be a real seasoned veteran by the time I'm 100!We came quite close to a croc at Danaus (well it was just over the other side of a small lake) but I could only get a half-way decent photo of it through the telescope. I'm still trying to sort my photos out and am hoping my travelling companions will send me some of their photos because I am a little disappointed in mine.  Still, for what it^s worth:This is the best I could do with the sloth - he is lying on the branch on the lower left hand side looking away from us, but bugger me if a couple of our party didn't actually film a sloth crawling along the phone lines while we were out eating one evening. I mean, that really isn't fair is it. He was just doodling along the phone lines, reached up for a piece of fruit and doodled back off - to the thrill of everyone present. And to think I was only just round the corner!!!! (Can you hear the gnashing of teeth here?)I will post about the rest of our trip in the next couple of days as I don't want to make this too long. Of course when I got back my weight was right up where it started sometime in January so now I am back on the old treadmill again. In fact, having recently discovered the blog \"100 Healthy Days\", I might try setting up a separate, private (for the moment) blog to try to do something similar in an effort to finally do something about my shape! Sitting on a beach in Costa Rica in a swimsuit really brought home to me that I need to do something about this (or risk being harpooned) and while for most other things in my life I am/have been pretty determined, for some reason so far I haven't been able to get to grips with my weight gain. Of course Sophie over at 100 HD is 30 years younger than me and gorgeous but hey, if I can make it past day three, who knows!  Will give it some thought. Oh and Wendy, have a lovely time. Can't wait to hear all about your stay in Costa Rica when you get back (you lucky devil)!"},

{"title": "And so it's back to the grindstone for me!", "date": "Wednesday 28 February 2018", "text": "I got back from Costa Rica on Monday and so on Tuesday it was back to work for me. I had a wonderful time, with a great guide and travelling companions, wonderful weather and of course it's a beautiful country anyway, so what's not to like. I'll have to get my photos sorted before I post them here but suffice it to say I just fell in love with the wonderful animals and vegetation as well as the beautiful country, so I will post more next time.I flew into London the night before my departure just in case an upcoming snow storm might stop me from leaving Geneva the next day. Before I made my way to the hotel I stopped over at the Air Canada desk in Heathrow to ask about the possibility of upgrading my flights. The lady was very helpful and told me that there looked to be quite a few empty upgrade seats but that she would advise me to do it the next day (the day of travel) as the seat upgrades would then be much cheaper. \"Oh, and you do have your ETA visa don't you?\" Say what! She was talking about the entry visa into Canada. I explained that my travel company hadn't mentioned that and I hadn't thought to look as I was only transiting Toronto Airport. I had checked visa requirements for Costa Rica of course but not for Canada as I assumed that since I wasn't leaving the airport I wouldn't need one. Wrong!!! But she gave me the link to the site and within about 10 minutes I had my visa ....... buuuuuuuttttt the visa was sent to my email and I couldn't access it! I tried over and over again but no luck. Bloody hell, fancy falling at the first gate. However, once I had made my way to my hotel I mentioned my problem to the lovely young (Polish) girl on the desk who then spent ages with me trying to get into my email via my phone and her phone and so on. In the end she had me do the visa request again but send it to the hotel's email and she was able to print it for me. Thank goodness. In fact, as I found out afterwards, Canadian immigration can check your visa status by your passport number so it would have been all right in any case but I didn't know that at the time. I was so relieved that later that night I logged on to the Premier Inn's web site and thanked the young woman by name for spending so much time with me and told management that she was a credit it to them. I know I've said it before but I say it again, these institutions wouldn't be able to function without the hard-working Eastern Europeans in their employ in addition to the hard-working Brits, hence my referencing her nationality. Well done and thank you Nikky.So the next day I went back to the Air Canada desk and was able to upgrade the first leg of my journey - from London to Toronto. I was dead chuffed with myself as I hate flying and having a little more comfort has got to help. On a whim I decided to make my way up to the Maple Leaf Air Canada lounge and in the lift on the way up there I chatted briefly to a Canadian lady heading the same way. She went into the lounge first and afterwards I asked if my upgrade entitled me to use the lounge too but the receptionist said unfortunately not. Well the Canadian lady overheard this (not that it bothered me one way or the other) and she came back and said that she thought that she was entitled to bring a guest in and so I became a \"guest\" and went off to treat myself to a lovely free breakfast. So thank you again kind Canadian lady! You see, there are nice people in the world.Not that I was \"gifted\" with a \"nice\" person sat in front of me on the flight though! An older man and what turned out to be his 35-ish year-old son sat in front of me in the bulkhead - you know, where the extra leg room is. Fair enough, they had already reserved their seats. The son looked like Shaggy in Scooby Doo, and immediately after take off he jammed his seat straight back into my face. Now, I don't like reclining my seat into the face of the person behind me as I don't think it's fair, but I didn't say anything as he is entitled to do what he wants. When they came round with the meal, though, I asked the flight attendant to ask him to put his seat up while we ate - which he did. However, \"Shaggy\" literally inhaled his food, stood up, looked over at me and said \"coming back\", at which point he rammed his seat back knocking my tray all over me. So I tapped him on the shoulder and asked if he would mind putting his seat upright just until I had finished my meal. But get this, his answer was \"if you wanted more space you should be in business\"! I was stunned. Luckily for once I thought fast and said I didn't want more space I just wanted the space I had paid for but he obviously didn't give a sh*t. So I just said \"I've got two words for you and the second one is off - figure the other one out if you can!\" Then I looked at his dad and said \"you must be so proud\", after which I got up and moved to a vacant seat to avoid the asshole completely. But the poor chap who had been sitting next to me got to put up with \"Shaggy\" bouncing around in his seat to the beat of his very loud music, banging into the seat back constantly. I told the guy to move but he decided to go to sleep instead.  When \"Shaggy\" and his dad got off I saw him going through business class, pick something up off one of the seats (a blanket I think) and stuff it in his rucksack. Way to go Shaggy - I hope you get everything you deserve in life!I don't like confrontation but this guy's behaviour was totally out of line.  Still, the world was put to right again once in Canada by a lovely old Sikh security officer at Toronto airport. One of my lady travelling companions set off the alarm going through the scanner on the way home so he pulled her over. She explained to him that she had had a hip replacement that had some metal in it so he called a lady over to check her out. Then I set it off because of the metal in my shoe lace eyes so he made me sit down and take my shoes off to go through again. As I was doing that two of our travelling companions waved goodbye to us so I ran over and gave them both a kiss, as did Ruth, the \"hip\" lady. So the elderly Sikh started complaining that how come he never got to get any kisses and life just wasn't fair and so on - really good naturedly. After we were found to be no longer a \"security threat\" he called us both back and handed us a candy! At which point Ruth said \"take a look at his feet, he's got odd socks on (he had). How would you fancy trusting your security to a guy that can't even match his socks?\" It was really funny but I don't really think anyone's security was compromised by the state of his footwear in the end. Still, a little harmless banter certainly makes the miserable business of travelling so much easier, don't you think.And finally, as we were just a small group of six Brits on this tour, one night we were discussing our favourite comedy shows and someone mentioned The Vicar of Dibley (I loved that programme).I was therefore so sad to learn that Dawn French's half-witted sidekick verger (the lovely Emma Chambers) had died of a heart attack. She was only 53 and from what I understand was severely allergic to animals and also severely asthmatic which (I believe) triggered the heart attack. Rest in peace Emma Chambers and thank you for the laughs!"},
{"title": "Screaming kids!", "date": "Thursday 15 February 2018", "text": "That bastion of truth in journalism, the Daily Fail, had this video posted on its website yesterday. I sometimes check out the site just for a laugh at Kim K and the likes but more and more I just find it irritating so I don't bother with it. This video, however, was taken by a passenger on a flight from Germany to New Jersey and apparently this kid screamed for the whole eight hour flight.Now I don't know if he possibly had health problems (autism?) that made him act like this but I can't help feeling that if that were the case I just wouldn't fly with him, or at least get his doctor to give him something to calm him down. I happen to love kids (even those that aren't my own!!) but I have to admit putting up with this for an entire flight would test my metal, I can tell you. Judgmental? Maybe, but eight hours of that would test the patience of a saint - and surely that of his mother!If on the other hand there is nothing wrong with the kid, how the hell is this mother (those parents?) raising their kid. Sorry but in my house I was always the boss and while I loved my kids to bits there is no way they would have got away with it.Since we were an anglo-american couple working in Switzerland my kids have flown from day one and they never behaved like that. It was bloody hard work on me though as I would spend the entire flight making sure that they were amused/happy/fed - whatever it took to keep them from disturbing others. Other people seem to manage to do it too. I know it's hard work but that's the price you pay for travelling with kids I'm afraid. I don't think anyone would ever blame a very young child for crying on take off and landing because the change in cabin pressure can obviously hurt their ears, but I am talking about babies here, and this was obviously not caused by cabin pressure!And talking of hard work, I remember one time many years ago flying to England with my kids. The little one was probably about six or seven so the oldest would have been about 10 or 11. That day there was a problem with the entire civil aviation radar covering the south of England so our flight, which should have landed at Gatwick, was diverted to Stansted Airport. And we sat on that bloody tarmac for about four hours, if I remember right. Now if we had been allowed I would have left the plane there, rented a car and driven the rest of the journey, but of course we weren't allowed to do that. So I set about getting games and papers and pencils out and played with my kids for the entire four hours.For about an hour we played hangman. Jordan being only little his spelling wasn't that great so he would look around for a word somewhere in the plane and use that. It became a bit obvious when we gotS E A T B E L ?don't you think. So just to wind him up I would suggest the last letter was \"O\"! He would go \"Mommy, SEATBEL-OOOOOO! Don't be so silly\". And on and on it went. Eventually we were able to re-route back to Gatwick Airport, very tired but glad to have made it. As I was travelling with kids I waited until everyone else got off and one man - businessman type - stopped by our seats as he was leaving, leaned over and said \"I think your children have been marvelous. So absolutely perfectly behaved!\" I could have cried as I was exhausted but thank you Mr. Businessman, you made my day!I'm off on my trip to Costa Rica tomorrow (well, first spending tomorrow night in London then on to CR on Saturday) so I may be \"incomunicada\" for a while. Let's hope that kid isn't on my flight!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 12 February 2018", "text": "It was a pretty quiet weekend \"chez moi\", which was rather nice. No real plans and since the weather was crappy I like it \"quiet\". After running to the market I made the mistake of thinking I would \"just pop in\" to a local store as I wanted to replace both bedside tables in my bedroom. They were originally from IKEA and while I have nothing against IKEA stuff these had seen better days. So I decided to hop on the motorway and go to a store near the Swiss border. Big mistake! You see, the Swiss schools are out this week for spring break so the bloody motorway was chocabloc in both directions with people heading up into the mountains to ski. It was made all the more chaotic since there is a large toll point on this particular stretch of motorway (about 18 toll booths) which would slow the traffic down anyway, but this traffic was just such a royal pain in the butt! Had I given it any thought I would have realized it would have been better to take the back roads but you live and learn I guess. I did buy a couple of cheap and cheerful bedside tables and two new rugs to go with them and they are a vast improvement over the previous look so all was not lost.Later on Saturday I got to watch England play Wales in the rugby six nations! Lovely! It was a pretty good match which England won (yay) although against anyone else I support Wales as my mom was Welsh. After that I managed to catch British chef Nigel Slater on his culinary travels through Turkey. He was invited into various Turkish homes, many of them peasant farmers, but the food they cooked looked out of this world. I am no expert on Turkey as I have only been there twice but it is a country I would definitely take great pleasure in going back to. The next evening he was travelling throughout Lebanon and again, although I didn't catch much of that programme, the food looked fabulous. I have to say though, that while the ingredients in these countries are usually first class, there is a reason it takes so many women to make such fabulous feasts. The workload involved serving up meals like these would probably be beyond most modern day Western families where both partners work outside the home. Shame really as the act of sitting down together with family and friends to such wonderful food is something that I feel we have lost out on.And talking of wonderful food, I found the time to type up the Pad Thai recipe from my course last month. Again I have to stress that the seasonings/sauces are all very personal so I think you can \"wing it\" an awful lot once you have the basic ideas. I hope you give it a shot.Pad Thai(for 4 people)For the sauce-           1 litre of water-           300 cl tamarind juice (we just put acouple of good dollops/tablespoons if I remember right)-           4 tablespoons fish sauce-           200g palm sugar-           5 tablespoons sugar (I would probablyput less as I find it a bit sweet)-           4 shallot onions finely chopped-           soy sauce (to taste)-           saltBoil it up and simmerall together for about 20 minutes.PadThai-        800grice noodles. This teacher soaked the raw noodles in cold water for about two hours.Another teacher that I had covered them with boiling water for about 20minutes, then rinsed them out in cold water before cooking with them. Your choice!-        3or 4 tablespoons of the above Pad Thai sauce-        32shrimp (about 8 per person). We de-veined them and butterflied them but leftthe tails on.-        60gbeansprouts-        40gfried tofu, cut into cubes. This wasn't easy to find so I guess you could justuse regular, firm tofu (not silken)-        4tablespoons roasted and crushed peanuts-        smallquantity of chives-        3garlic cloves, crushed-        2eggs-        2tablespoons vegetable oil-        3-4tablespoons oyster sauce-        4tablespoons sugar (again I would probably reduce this slightly, but that isjust my taste)-        2limes sliced (for decorating) and a little chili powederAdd oilto pan and cook the garlic gently. Don't let it burn. Add the Pad Thai sauce(as above) and the shrimp plus a drizzle of water. Then add the tofu.  Cook for a little while. Add the beaten eggs,a handful of noodles and a little water, if needed.Add theoyster sauce, the sugar, the chives and the beansprouts. Mix thoroughly.Sprinkle with the peanuts and the chili pepper and serve with lime wedges. Enjoy!Back to the weekend, later on Saturday evening I had a binge watch of season 2 of \"Desperate Housewives\" (I know, which planet have I been on these last 10 years). When it first came out I saw about 20 minutes of the first episode and thought \"yuck\" - just a bunch of too pretty women with too pretty homes running around being vacuous. Which probably just about sums it up really but when my friend offered to lend me the series I kinda became hooked. Of course that has nothing to do with the fact that I find \"Carlos\" absolutely gorgeous. Nothing at all!\"Carlos Solis\"Strangely enough I did the same thing with \"Downton Abbey\". Couldn't be bothered to watch it and then when someone lent me the box set I got hooked. It doesn't always work out that way though as another colleague lent me \"Dexter\" and I tried valiantly to get through two DVDs but it was just way too weird and waaaay too violent for me so I gave it back unwatched.I was slightly more productive on Sunday mind, and made a madeira cake (I have had a craving for one of those for ages - reminds me of my childhood), a lentil soup and a potato dish that my former boyfriend's (Algerian) mother gave me the recipe for. Delicious!Then a friend and I decided to brave the cold and catch the last day of a patchwork exhibition by a small club in Geneva. And again, as always, it never ceases to amaze me how talented these ladies are. I can only hope to be half that good sometime in the distant future (and that's pushing my luck, to be honest).The lady that made this patchwork is 93 years old!I've seriously got to retire. I mean all this \"working\" baloney is seriously eating into my interests! Just another couple of years to wait!"},
{"title": "A recipe for Sam (I think)!", "date": "Friday 9 February 2018", "text": "Sam mentioned in one of her comments would it be possible for me to write up some of the recipes from my Thai cookery course. While the course was very good the lady's written recipe sheets were a bit \"hit and miss\", to say the least. While she indicated that the recipe was for four people when it came time to add in the sauces I suspect the amounts indicated were for one person since she wanted us each to cook our own individual meal. So this is what I made of her missive. Will try to type up the others when I get the chance!Beef with Thai basilFor 1 person-        2tablespoons vegetable oil-        400 g good qualityfilet steak (about 14 oz), finely sliced (I suspect this is for 4 people so for one person youprobably need less. I guess you would have to \"wing it\" as far as quantity goes)-        2tablespoons oyster sauce-        1tablespoon soy sauce-        2teaspoons sugar-        oneor two tablespoons water-        1tablespoon fish sauce-        ½pepper (red or yellow look prettiest) sliced into strips-        ½onion cut quite chunky-        2garlic cloves, finely minced-        1birds eye chili-         afew Thai basil leaves-         groundpepper to taste*        Heat the oil in a pan(it doesn't have to be a wok). Add crushed garlic and chilli pepper and cookgently.*        Add onion and slicedpepper and cook slightly. Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce and 1or 2 tablespoons of water.*        Cook for a few minutesbefore adding the beef and the Thai basil. Do not overcook the beef.Serve with jasmine rice which has been rinsed in cold water beforecooking.Note:          The quantitiesfor the sauces are very personal – they are what was written on my recipe sheetand I think they are for 1 person, but I suspect the 400g of beef is for 4 peoplenot 1 person. I like my food quite salty so I would probably add more fishsauce/soy sauce. Our lady teacher was rather vague about quantities as it isvery personal."},
{"title": "Votes for women!", "date": "Thursday 8 February 2018", "text": "I was pleased to see many articles/programmes this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the \"Representation of the People Act 1918\" wherein some women in Great Britain and Ireland were finally granted the right to vote under certain circumstances. Under this Act, all men over 21 were granted the right to vote but only certain women over the age of 30 who held £5 of property or whose husbands did were granted that right. There is much debate about the tactics used by the militant suffragettes as opposed to the lobbying of the moderates but whichever way you look at it, 100 years later we women owe a debt of gratitude to those ladies, many of whom suffered indignities, force feeding, imprisonment and torture in order to obtain what I consider a basic human right.Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughtersIn the same vein, I very much enjoyed the film Made in Dagenham which was based on the 1968 strike of machinists at the Ford factory in Dagenham, Essex, to lobby for equal pay with the men. Those brave women took their case to the then Secretary of State, Barbara Castle, and when Ford threatened to pull out of England if they continued to push for equal pay, the wonderful Barbara Castle stood with the women and went head-to-head against Ford. Amazingly Ford eventually backed down and went on to become, apparently, a \"model employer as a result\". The actions of these women became the catalyst for the 1970 Equal Pay Act. It's a funny and moving film but I don't think we women today realize just how brave those wonderful ladies were going up against such a patriarchal society.The original ladies - Barbara Castle is 4th from the right.Made in Dagenham - the movie!When we were talking about this on the bus the other day my colleague was telling me that she had just watched the latest episode of The Secret Life of Kids and in tribute to the suffragette movement they had, for the first time ever, filmed a programme entirely with little girls. In this episode, the girls were asked what game they wanted to play buuuuuttt not all of the girls were given the vote. After that, they were invited to choose what they wanted to have for desert - ice cream or a cupcake - and again they weren't all allowed to choose. Finally, a little later they were all given the vote on a third subject and my colleague was saying how quickly these little kids realized that only some people getting to \"choose\" was totally unfair!On another note, we had our third boardgame evening last Saturday at our former neighbours' new home. Crikey that was quite the \"drive from hell\" getting up to their place, it being at 1,200 metres with narrow roads slick with ice, but we got there (and back) all right and had a lovely evening. This time round there were 12 of us (one new gent - a friend of our hosts - joined us). At one point poor Alexandre, our other neighbours' 15 year old son, had to mime a striptease artist playing golf. Poor kid. He is pretty shy at the best of times so for him to get that one really tested him but showed what a good sport he was by giving it his all. We spent the last hour or so of the evening playing (or, re-learning how to play, I should say) a card game called belote. I had played it many, many years ago, before I was married, and I remember it being the kind of game that you could start playing at 9 p.m. and keep on going until you keeled over at around 5 a.m. so I'm kinda hoping we keep this game as one of our mainstays. My youngest son and his gf also came along again and I have to say it is really nice to have the \"youngsters\" joining in with us old fogies by their own choice!  Jordan had to mime being a thief climbing onto an elephant (or something like that) and it proved to be a simple but fun game. There was waaaay too much food of course, although I was rather pleased with the way my Victoria sponge turned out. I haven't made one of them in donkey's years so it was  real treat.My son being \"a thief\"!It was slightly awkward at the end of the evening as one of our group had been \"collared\" at the mail box by another neighbour (who is not known for her friendly disposition) and having heard about our little group somehow she was basically fishing for an invite to join! What to do? In the end we decided that the group was already snowballing and 12 seemed to be a reasonable enough sized group to accommodate in one person's home. Since this particular neighbour and her husband wouldn't be anyone's first choice on the Christmas list we decided to limit our group size for the moment. I think when my friend mentioned that if we let the Bs join our group then Mrs. Tupperware (so-called because she was a Tupperware rep) would probably want to join, and with the best will in the world she can (and does) talk the hind leg off a donkey so I think our decision became a no-brainer at that point. We'll see how it evolves I guess, as it might be easier to accommodate a bigger group in the summer when we can play outside. Until then it will sadly have to be by invitation only!"},
{"title": "Blue moon!", "date": "Thursday 1 February 2018", "text": "I hope you all got to see what a pretty moon we had last night. It was apparently a magical combination of three different factors that made this \"blue moon\" such an exceptional one, that combination being so rare that these moons really do only occur \"once in a blue moon\" - hence the expression. We had glorious weather the past couple of days so I was able to appreciate it over the mountains as I drove home but by about 8 p.m. the clouds had moved in ready to wreak havoc and the moon was hidden. Still it was just beautiful, and judging by some of the photos I saw today some people got even better views than we did.Photo by Islandvisions - Isle of WhitePhoto by Peter Mcdiarmid - LondonAnd I couldn't resist Raul Malo singing this:In other matters, not a lot going on here. We finally had a couple of days of good weather so I have been able to get out and walk at lunchtime and I have also been to the gym here at work when it has been wet. Trouble is, when it is wet, of course, everyone else seems to decide to go to the gym too instead of running outside so it can get a bit crowded. Still, at least I get a bit of exercise in. After I came back from slogging my way round the Botanical Gardens yesterday I saw an article in the news about Angelina Jolie visiting the French President's wife, Brigitte Macron, and taking in a trip to the Louvre. Crikey, beautiful outfit but look at those heels!!! I mean, who among us trudges round the Louvre in those killers!As I trotted out of our building into the park along the lake for my walk, I noticed that flowers had been left next to a sculpture that I had seen before but never taken the time to really look at, assuming it was some Viking hero.Turns out it was a sculpture of Georges Kastrioti Skanderberg, an Albanian nobleman. The story (part truth, part myth I suspect) surrounding Skanderbeg is \"built in part of the antemurale myth complex which portrays Albanians united by Skanderbeg as protectors of the nation and Christendom against \"invading Turks\" (taken from Wikipedia so who knows). Anyway, his statue being strewn with flowers, I guess by local Albanians, at least it drew my attention enough to actually go up and read the attendant plaque after all these years.And moving seamlessly on, on Monday night I went to my usual sewing club for a good natter and to try to catch up on some household/patchwork sewing which I can't be arsed to do during the week. I caught up with a bit of homework from my last patchwork course in December, shortened a pair of trousers and was working on cutting down a couple of pillowcases that were just too big for my pillows. One lady there had made a beautiful, totally reversible polka dot jacket, so she kinda made my pillow case repair look slightly sad but to be honest I enjoy the yacking as much as I appreciate getting some things repaired that I am just too tired to attack that on a regular work night!Then on Tuesday I had my once-a-month patchwork lesson in Cluses. We were having a go at free motion quilting and to be honest I didn't really enjoy it. Lydie, our teacher, was quite honest about how difficult it can be and how uninspiring until you get the hang of it, but at this early stage I think I would rather quilt by hand than have that thing run away with me! Add to that the fact that the machine foot required to free motion quilt on my machine costs over €100 and the rulers/stencils being pretty darn expensive too, I think for the moment I will give it a miss.  Next lesson we are going to start making a rather pretty storage bag so we will see how that turns out.  Because I had missed the last lesson as I had to work late Lydie very kindly stayed late to help me catch up with the others. She never makes an issue of staying late anyway as long as someone needs help but it meant I didn't leave till 11 pm so a long day all in all. I go straight from work and since I leave for work at 7 a.m. I am pretty much on my knees after these lessons.  Still, I am still enjoying it so I guess I shouldn't complain too much.And finally, Steve called me last night, just back from his trip to Antarctica. He said it was just wonderful and neither words nor pictures can do it justice. It's a pretty expensive trip but one I guess I might consider once I'm retired as he waxed lyrical about it. It's great to see he's just as enthusiastic as ever. Good for him is all I can say!"},
{"title": "I think I'm getting old!", "date": "Tuesday 30 January 2018", "text": "Well aren't we all really, but just lately I have realized that while my eyesight is still pretty good (I just use glasses to read), when people are some distance away from me I can't always recognize them. At lunchtime I decided to walk into town to pick up a few groceries and a colleague was almost level with me before I recognized her. When I apologized she just laughed and said \"you're not the only one\"! I'm sure I'm not either but I do wonder if it has been going on rather longer than I realize. About 10 years ago my son and I were just setting out from home for work/school. It was dark and there are no streetlights in the village. As we past an oncoming car my son started laughing and said \"that was Stan and he was waving to you\", to which I replied that he could well have been my mother but I still wouldn't have recognized him. So he just said \"mom, he's the only black man in the village\" - and it was true. I live in a very small village and at one time Stan, who is Nigerian, really was the only black man in the village. It wouldn't have made any difference though 'cos I still wouldn't have recognized him. Told him to honk his horn next time!Another sign of the times is that just yesterday I received my tickets for my trip to Costa Rica in my inbox. I read through them and looked online to check that I didn't need a visa (I don't) and if they recommended any vaccinations (again, they don't). But think back to not all that long ago when all this would have had to be done in person at a travel agent's. While there are obviously some negatives to the internet and the worldwide web, I would say 99% of it is so positive. Let's face it, I wouldn't be sitting here writing this (or have any of you reading it) if it wasn't for the internet would I!Which brought to mind a rather funny story from when I first came out to work in Geneva in 1980. Of course in those days we still used typewriters (and quills and ink and parchment paper and abacuses - ok I'm joking about the last two). The unit I was working for at the time was drawing up a lot of statistical data for use by a French-speaking country on tariff lines/imports, etc. Incredibly boring stuff. You know, \"tariff line 1098.00.10 - leather goods not further worked than ....\". You get the idea. BORING! But our job was to type up around 100 A3 tables of tariff lines which had been produced by our statisticians in English. These would then be sent to translation so we would have to leave a big gap after each English text in order for the French typing pool to type in the French equivalent. It was a hit and miss affair (with lots of tippex). Since these were A3 tables we had to use the big typewriters with the extra-wide platens (the roller bit where the paper is fed through) and every time I did a carriage return my colleague had to duck or she would get pushed off her seat. But one day one of the statisticians came in in quite a temper and asked who had prepared this batch of tables \"because they were rubbish and he wasn't going to waste his time checking any more\". I took a look at them and we realized they had been typed by L, who was a sloppy worker at the best of times. So he said to ask her to go through and check and correct all her work and oh, just as an example \"everywhere I had written furskins, not further prepared or worked than ..... she had typed foreskins! Now this statistician was French so I don't think he realized what a foreskin was but J and I nearly bust a blood vessel trying not to pee ourselves laughing. Oh Lordy did we have some fun. And to top it all, we were plowing our way through the next batch of tables when leaving time rolled around, so J took those that had been finished (which was the majority of them) and sat them on her trash can while she cleared her desk. The next day we couldn't find them anywhere - figured the cleaners must have thrown them away when they emptied the trash!"},
{"title": "A rather nice weekend!", "date": "Monday 29 January 2018", "text": "Well we finally got some nice weather this weekend after what seemed like forever and a day of rain. I noticed that the crocuses and daffs are starting to come up (they come up later here than in Geneva because of the altitude) so while I know spring is a while off it really feels like it's on its way. My favourite season!I spoke to my ex OH (the friend I was seeing for six years after my divorce) and he mentioned that he wanted to go see the new Gary Oldman film, The Darkest Hour, so I suggested we go together. And you know what, it was really nice to spend some time with him again after splitting up over two years ago. I know it will never work out between us in the long run but it is nice to have remained friends. What's more we both enjoyed the film. I think Oldman is a wonderful actor (loved him in Dracula) and he managed to portray a moody and grumpy Churchill with a real twinkle in his eye. Loved it. And the make-up/prosthetics!!!! Wow, just wow. What talented artists those people are to be able to transform Oldman into an absolute replica of Churchill!Gary Oldman as Winston ChurchillI saw an interview with Oldman recently and he was saying how ill he became after filming due to having to wear the prosthetics and the fat suit day in and day out. Said it took about four hours to get him kitted up as Churchill but it was definitely a success. Then he said having to smoke all those cigars while filming made him as sick as a dog as he had given up smoking years ago, so while everyone was toasting the new year in he ended up spending a couple of days in hospital getting a colonoscopy and getting himself sorted out. Still, the end result was definitely worth it as it was a great movie.Then on Sunday my friend and I decided to walk into town to the 1940s-1980s vintage fair. To be honest it was a bit small and not really what I was expecting but there was quite a bit of 1950s paraphenalia, a few bikers, loads of 1950s cinched waist dresses (I wish) and some rather nice jewellery but not the kind of stuff that suits me, unfortunately. I did buy myself a nice red polka dotted head band (I wear them when working in the garden) - oh the expense!! and bumped into my kids on the way out just as they were arriving.  I took a picture of them at the entrance then put the headband on my oldest son (but promised him I wouldn't put that photo on Facebook). Still he did look rather cute! So while the fair wasn't that great at least my friend and I got out into the sunshine and managed to fit in two 45-minute walks to boot. Not bad considering (apparently) Geneva was shrouded in cloud all day. Happy days!"},
{"title": "Justice finally!", "date": "Friday 26 January 2018", "text": "I was so glad to see that narcissistic, shriveled excuse for a man, Larry Nassar, sentenced this week to 175 years for his crimes against his young victims. What brave young women they were to stand up and face that pig to demand justice. I was also glad that the judge in this case was a female judge, Judge Aquilina. I think she was eloquent and civil but she also let that POS know exactly what she thought of him. That toerag finally got his comeuppance and it was a woman that handed it to him! These narcs think they are all powerful and that the rules don't apply to them. They can turn on the tears when it suits them but in the end it really always has been and always will be \"all about them\" in their minds. So finally some justice. Well done Judge Aquilina and well done the US.Compare that to the case of serial rapist John Worboys who is up for parole in the UK anytime now (if he hasn't already been released). This pervert taxi driver offered young women a drink in his cab after flashing money at them claiming he had just won the lottery. Problem was, the drinks were drugged and the young women raped. He was convicted in 2009 of the rape of 12 women I believe - who knows how many there were in reality - and was given an \"indeterminate\" sentence. That pervert is due to be released anytime now. I don't always agree with all things America but it seems to me they are getting an awful lot right when it comes to sentencing these sickos. Shame on the British justice system.And finally, I have been having problems with my French bank for the last 2-3 months. Every month I transfer €2,000 to my current account with them from my Swiss, salary account, and also 2,000 Swiss francs to my Swiss account with them to cover my mortgage. In November the €2,000 took forever to be credited to my French account and when I chased it up they said there were \"new regulations whereby the bank had to check the origin of my funds (or something like that) and ensure that I was legally resident in France\". I have lived in this house for 28 years and they have my French tax declaration information so .... Anyway, I chased it up with my French banker and eventually it was transferred but very late. Then along comes December payroll. My bank transfer left Switzerland on 22 December and 10 days later it still had not been credited to my French account (normally this would go through on the same day). After about 11 days the transfer was refused and the money was returned to my Swiss bank account. In the meantime I'm running up overdraft fees for a transfer that has been refused by the French bank. When I asked the Swiss bank to chase this up they explained that they had been having endless problems with this bank lately with many customers for this very reason. It likely stems from new French banking regulations but I had never been informed of them and, as I said to my French banker, \"what more do you want from me. I'm at a loss to know what else I can provide to prove that I am legit\". I mean, it's not like as if it even looks like drugs money or anything. I'm sure the drug mafiosi are not into piddling amounts like €2,000 and this transfer has been going on for the last 28 years, for pete's sake! I think it is more a worldwide case of proving that people are really living where they claim to be living and not evading taxes (this is a big issue for US citizens in particular but I am not American). So eventually I decided to block my automatic transfer and have now moved on to the thoroughly modern means of withdrawing cash from the Swiss bank and carrying in my purse to the French bank to deposit it. As I said to the French lady \"it sure ain't progress is it\". I'm not sure when this will get resolved but in the meantime I shall continue to deposit cash only on pay day. The really stupid thing is, though, that the Swiss franc transfer to pay my mortgage continues to go through uninterrupted. I can't figure it out, I tell you. But I did write to the French bank and have them recredit me all charges incurred as a result of the \"irregularities\" (their term) on my account.But, that brings me back to the issue of my mortgage. I pay my mortgage to the French bank but in Swiss francs every three months, and about a week before the due date of each payment I put a copy of the original loan amortization agreement in my diary to make sure that I am aware that it is about to be debited. Anyway, I happened to glance at the outstanding amount that would have been pending as at end January 2018 if I had not started to overpay three years ago. I was stunned to see that in the last three years I have overpaid my mortgage to the tune of 88,000 Swiss francs! Or almost $100,000! I knew I was doing well but really! So on that basis, by my calculations I can have the darned mortgage paid off exactly two years from now. Yippee. That being the case I will be free to retire any time I want after that. Wow - has it ever been so worth it!"},
{"title": "It's all or nothing isn't it!", "date": "Thursday 25 January 2018", "text": "I mean, there was me saying just the other week that it was \"all quiet on the western front\" and now this week it seems to be non-stop. Not that I'm complaining but for some strange reason it's starting to feel like I used to feel when I was young and single in Geneva many, many moons ago. You know, footloose and fancy free and going out all the time and having a blast. It's a great feeling, I have to admit.Monday I had my sewing club (yeah, exciting I know), Tuesday I was at a retirement party and then Wednesday back in Geneva for my Thai cookery course. Then this Saturday I am going to the cinema with my former OH (we're still friends) to see the Darkest Hour, then off to the retro-fair on Sunday with my kids. I was like this when I was single but I'm not sure my energy levels will be the same this time around somehow!Last week I felt like I was permanently hungry (I get like that occasionally - it kinda reminds me of when I was pregnant - but I'm not, obviously!!!). Some days I felt like \"just hook a conveyor belt up to my mouth and shovel the food along why don't you\". Of course you can't keep going on like that so I figured it was time to get the gym clothes back out, and guess what? I've been pretty darn good this week and I feel great. I must have walked either 30 or 60 minutes at least five times this week (I can't remember exactly) and have been to the gym twice already and have actually been adding moves to my work out. Great eh. Actually I'm a pretty lazy bugger when it comes to the gym and I can't stand fitness classes so I dawdle along doing my own thing until, I guess, I start to get just a tiny bit fitter so decide to add in a few extra moves. Long may it last, is all I can say, as I feel great. I trudged up to the US mission Tuesday lunchtime (and then slithered back down in the mud after all the rain last week) so yesterday I decided that instead of risking the mud again I would walk into town at lunch time to get my walk in and pick up a few groceries at the same time. It was a beautiful sunny day and as I walked along the lake I heard people yelling and looked over the wall to see seven young people diving into the lake!!! In swimsuits - no wet suits! I mean, yes it was a beautiful day but it was still January in Switzerland! I swear I would have a coronary if I did that! Which reminds me, about 10 years ago my ex and I had tickets to see Lionel Richie at Geneva's Arena concert hall (great concert, very professional). It was in March and when Lionel took the mike to introduce his band he said how he lived in LA and he couldn't believe that it was March in Switzerland and we were all in shorts! It was true too, it was that warm. Very strange times we live in right!I think I mentioned sometime ago that we had set up a board game evening between a group of neighbours and Valérie - our next hostess - sent round an email today asking for a head count for next Saturday when we will all be up at her new home in the mountains. Jordan and Jen will both be coming again this time so it seems each time we meet the numbers are going up. I'm really glad we started doing it too as between neighbours who are already friends it is a great way to have fun and have the kids join in (one couple have 11 and 14 year old kids).  When I sent Jordan and Jen a text message to ask them to let me know if they were coming so that I could let Valérie know, Jen confirmed that they would both go (Jordan wasn't a definite to begin with) and oh by the way, both my kids and their partners plus another mate would be going to the 1940s-80s retro fair in town on Sunday and should we meet up? Weather-permitting I will be walking down with my friend.It will be great to get together with my kids as a group again!And then last night I had my second (and final) Thai cookery course in central Geneva. We made Pad Thai and a chicken-chili soup which were both delicious. It was a very nice group too (they aren't always) and the tiny Thai teacher was a doll. In addition to trying to up my exercise I have been (vaguely) trying to follow Weight Watchers online - yeah, I know - taking a Thai cookery class doesn't really fit totally with that - but I have been printing off a few of their recipes as I really want to give it a serious shot this time. This isn't the first time I have signed up but I lose interest very quickly when I can't figure the points system out for homemade dishes. It's a pathetic excuse really but Tania in blog land gave me a tip on how to calculate that using their app, so here I go again.Oh I don't think I mentioned either that just before Christmas I treated myself to a private 3-hour session with the make-up lady who had done Lily and the bridesmaids' make-up for the wedding last year - trying to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse I guess! Anyway, she was lovely and absolutely not trying to push make-up sales at all. I did, however, buy two make-up pencils from her and she told me she would have to send me the bill after Christmas as she couldn't remember how much they cost. So I waited and waited then two days ago I thought sod it, I'm going to remind her. I don't like being dishonest and as it turns out she had indeed forgotten! Which coincidentally puts me in mind of another story from about 15 years ago. Two friends and I had gone out to a Thai restaurant (can you see a theme building here) for lunch one time. We all had the set menu and wine (it's perfectly normal over here to drink at lunchtime). When the bill came Sue said \"Oh, oh, dilemma. They've billed us for the food but not for the drinks, what do we do?\" Well it took about two seconds for each of us to pipe up that we needed to get the bill corrected so we called the waitress over and explained that she had forgotten the wine. So then she said that no she hadn't forgotten the wine but \"that man over there paid for it for you\"! And it was my boss!!! The three of us heaved a sigh of relief when we realized what had happened. But can you imagine if we had \"done a runner\" and said nothing about it! I would have been mortified. I'm just so glad we were honest as you never know when it will come back to haunt you do you!And finally, I was looking through the Geneva newspaper this morning and the local police had posted a video taken by cctv on Saturday night in a parking lot in central Geneva. This drew my attention because I mentioned previously that I was uncomfortable going to the parking lot late at night after my cookery course (it turns out it's not too bad as the parking lot is right next to a sports centre and a fitness club so there have always been loads of people around when I get there). But this video was not of a woman being robbed, it was, seemingly, a video of a couple arguing and then the guy lit into this young woman and started beating the hell out of her. He grabbed her by her hair, by her wrist, kicked her feet out from under her and was seriously beating the crap out of her. The cctv operator called the police and the affair was sorted with \"no charges being brought\"!! I guess she was too scared to press charges even if it was all there on tape. As I said to my colleague, if that's what goes on in \"public\" can you imagine what that poor young woman goes through in private. I can only hope that the police override her and press charges against him and that she gets away from that pig!"},

Well we have had maybe two days where it didn't rain but other than that, I think I'm developing webbed feet it's rained that much. Still, growing up in England you do kinda get used to it so I don't find it depresses me as much as some of my colleagues. In any case I'll take rain over snow in town any day. They have forecast slightly better weather during the week - up to 13 degrees on Wednesday and bright sunshine so I guess there is that to look forward to, if only briefly. Hindsight being 20/20, it's probably a good job we neighbours dug up our back gardens at Easter and laid drainage trenches - 'cos they're certainly being tested at the moment.Since I need to get back to the \"I have to lose weight malarky\" I actually trudged up to the gym at lunchtime.  Trouble is, when it rains the gym is packed as people don't want to go out running. But I made it and I have to say I always feel so much better afterwards, even though I only do a namby pamby little stretching routine. It does my back and neck the world of good! Just gotta keep it up now I suppose.So what else is new. Not a lot really. I saw on the UK news last week that somewhere in the south of England (I forget where) they have opened a \"menopause cafe\", where women can get together to commiserate with each other over the trials and tribulations of the menopause. Not sure I would go to it but even so menopause did come as a bit of a surprise all the same. The biggest thing I guess was the weight gain (around 16 kg - about 35 lbs, I would guess) and at one point I felt like I wanted to cry all the time. When I spoke to our work's doctor I told her this and she just laughed and said \"if I was married to your husband I would want to cry all the time too\" (she knew all the horror stories of my marriage, as you can see). Strangely enough, that was very reassuring as I obviously wasn't really going mad! In the end though as I was occasionally finding it difficult to hold it together at work I went to my gynae and he put me on HRT and it was wonderful! It changed my life and - between you and me - it made me as horny as hell! But don't tell my kids! Seriously, he put me on quite a strong dose at first to stop my periods and all of a sudden I felt how young boys must feel when they hit puberty! Perpetually horny! Damn, it was that good! You know it's working when you get on a Swiss bus, look the short, fat hairy driver over and think \"hallo baaaabbby\"! Not that I was complaining! Oddly enough it was right about this time that my husband left me but hey, not to worry. In my books that was just an added bonus (if you know what I mean). Anyway, after about a year my doctor put me on a weaker dose (shame!!!) and off my own bat I decided eventually to lower it again by taking just two tablets a week, which seems to work for me. As my doctor said, at this point it's really just therapeutic for you isn't it and he was right. I know some people are totally against HRT but for me it was a life saver, I can tell you. Which puts me in mind of an old Victoria Wood joke:Betty to Maggie: I hear they're bringing out a new magazine called \"All you ever needed to know about the menopause\".Maggie to Betty: Does it come monthly?Betty: No, why would it?It tickled me at the time!And what about the situation with the US government closing down eh!  I think 2013 was the last time where certain services were closed for two weeks - which got me to thinking - I wonder what state many people would be in if all of a sudden they were short two weeks' salary? It's a sobering thought and Dave Ramsey's exhortations to save 3-6 months expenses is indeed a very good one. Since I am saving up hard to try to pay off my mortgage early I do indeed probably have 4-6 months of expenses in the bank, but that wasn't always the case, and certainly not when I was married. In fact, by slamming as much as I can down on my mortgage I think I can have my 17-year mortgage paid off in just over eight years - so in about two years from now it will be gone and I can retire. But, back to my original point, it must be a nerve-wracking time for some US government employees and even if it is only a two-week closure like the last time I'm sure it will hit some people hard. Very disturbing times indeed. Let's hope they can get it sorted out, if only for the sake of all those employees whose livelihood is being affected through no fault of their own. Of course in their case it is only temporary - Carillon anyone! What a bloody nightmare!And finally, my local town has a big exhibition centre (called a \"foire\" over here) where they host many fairs all year round. This weekend they are hosting a retro-fair covering the period 1940-1980 and all the fashions and furniture styles from those decades. Jordan's girlfriend wants to go with me and I don't know yet whether my DIL wants to go although I did mention it to her because I know she loves 1960s furniture. I hate that stuff because I grew up with it, but I do love the 1960s fashions, which, now that Call the Midwife is back on TV, I am getting to appreciate all over again. Another good reason to lose this weight I think - I would love to get back into some fashionable clothes as opposed to the \"practical\" beauties that I have been wearing of late. Onwards and upwards, as they say!"},
{"title": "Delicious Thai food!", "date": "Thursday 18 January 2018", "text": "Well my cookery course last night was just wonderful. Probably the best course so far (they aren't all good). Since I finish work at 17.30h and the course started at 18.30h I decided to walk across town, figuring it would take me about 40 minutes and I would have time to grab a coffee beforehand. What I hadn't banked on was how cold it was walking along the lake front. Crikey, it was freeeeezing! I made it in 35 minutes but I'm sure having icicles dangling off the end of your nose will never be a good look on anybody!The group was made up of the lady instructor and nine pupils - six women and three men. In fact, one (presumably married) couple came along with their 25-ish-something daughter, which I thought was a lovely way to spend an evening together. The first dish we made was a starter of Thai ravioli stuffed with chicken and shrimp. The teacher had us all doing the cutting and smushing and so on and then all rolling our own ravioli parcels. I think she overestimated a bit as we ended up making 64, but served with sweet chili sauce they were absolutely delicious!After that she had us cutting up rump steak and all kinds of other delicious ingredients to make Thai beef with basil, and again it was fabulous. She was very good in that she had us all doing the preparation and then we all  had to make our own beef dish in the wok, while she stood by giving instructions and/or encouragement. Just as a \"by the way\", it was the first time I had ever used coriander (cilantro) root on its own - not the leaves, just the roots. You live and learn I guess. At the end of the class we all sat down to eat our culinary creations and this being Switzerland there were a couple of bottles of wine on the table too! So we got to enjoy a lovely home-made dinner and then take the leftovers home too.  What's not to like!As part of this same course we have another class next week where I think we will be making Pad Thai and - if I remember correctly - chicken soup with coconut milk. Lovely! I generally find that I am too tired to want to commit to an ongoing course but doing these one or two-off courses is just perfect for me.Since I was on my own I didn't want to hang about too long before leaving for my bus because, sadly, as a sign of the times I am a little nervous making my way back to a pretty empty parking lot at 10 in the evening. But, everything was fine, and since the parking lot is right  next to a sports centre there are generally quite a few people about. So marks out of 10 - a definite 10 for this course.On a totally different note, I see that the UK has just named it's first ever \"Minister for Loneliness\", and while it has a rather comic ring to it I'm glad to hear that some attempt is being made to address this dreadful problem. Of course, it was an issue dear to the late MP Jo Cox (who was murdered by a lunatic with \"mental health issues\"). I hope they really do achieve great things with this initiative because it seems to me a problem that shouldn't really be that difficult to solve. I wish I could be named \"Minister for Loneliness\" - my ideal job I think, but until then I guess I will just have to keep chattering on obliviously to all and sundry."},
{"title": "All quiet on the western front!", "date": "Wednesday 17 January 2018", "text": "It's been pretty quiet here since Christmas, hence the lack of posts! After Christmas we had what seemed like enough prolonged rain to start thinking about getting the arc ready. I mean, seriously, about 10 days of non-stop rain, which of course meant that it was snowing in the mountains. All good for the resorts of course, as opposed to last year when there was nothing over the Christmas period. Then of course the wind picked up and some of the ski resorts had to suspend skiing as it was just too dangerous, and finally some (lucky) devils got snowed in at Zermatt. Frankly I can think of worse places to be snowed in than Zermatt, although you would probably need pretty deep pockets as Zermatt's prices are pretty prohibitive at the best of times. After record snowfalls which completely blocked the access lines, some people were helicoptered off the mountain but within three days the train access was back up and running. All exciting stuff I suppose.For we lesser mortals it was back to work and having the snow stay up in the mountains was great as I really hate driving on the blooming stuff. That being said, we have had some pretty windy days and nights and when I went to leave for work this morning I had to get the broom out of my garage and push the snow off my car before I left. The odd thing is, though, that just five minutes down the road in my little local town it was pretty much all clear.  I guess maybe just that 100 metres difference in altitude makes all the difference!Things at work have been just ticking over. I have another couple of meetings coming up in March but they are fairly routine so I can get most of the work done ahead of time. My big meetings are in July and December and they take about 3-4 months each to prepare so that keeps me out of trouble for a while, I suppose.On the exercise front I was pretty good last week. Managed to walk four times, either into work in the morning or at lunchtime and then went to the gym one time but I have to admit I couldn't be faffed so far this week. One of my Monday evening sewing clubs has decided not to meet in the evenings this term as some of the older ladies don't want to go out in the evenings when the weather is yucky - pretty understandable I suppose, so I have been sticking with my other Monday evening club. And guess what, the Présidente and the two assistants have announced that they no longer want those responsibilities any more so the club would effectively be disbanded, after 20 years, next June. Now I was speaking to one of the other ladies and saying it was a shame to lose the use of the room if some people wanted to continue. The local commune lets us use it for free and will even give us a small subsidy if we need to buy supplies, although to be honest with everyone paying €40 for the year we haven't needed that subsidy so far. So to make a long story short, it looks like I may end up becoming the next Présidente! Ha what a joke that is, since I can't sew. Really! I'm taking patchwork lessons but as for sewing itself - forget it. Actually, based on that logic I should probably go into politics too because as far as I can see not many politicians (whatever their persuasion) really know what they are doing either. Still, it seems it would involve just doing the administrative side of it, which I don't mind at all, so if I can get another lady to go along with me and keep the second set of keys for when I can't make it, it looks like I will have a new role shortly!Other than that, what else is new. Oh, this evening I shall be attending a Thai cookery class, which I am quite excited about, although I find going out after work - particularly in the winter - to be very tiring. In Switzerland the big supermarket (the equivalent of Tescos or Wal-Mart) is called Migros and they seem to have a finger in every pie - supermarkets, travel, insurance, banking and evening classes, etc. so I am taking this class (and another again next week) at the Migros evening class centre downtown. When I first arrived in Geneva I lived in central Geneva as a single girl for five years and never stayed in one single evening! God, talk about staying power. I had a boyfriend and saw him regularly, obviously, but I think I did every one of the Migros' evening classes - sailing (loved it), sewing (I was the youngest by about 40 years), tai chi (burrrrk - hated it), cookery. You name it I had a bash at it. Actually looking at my mortgage pay-off figures I could well have my house paid off in two years (at which point I can retire) and like Sam over at a New Frame of Reference I realize I like structure and like to be busy, so I can see myself getting more involved in classes - mainly in France - but also at the Migros, where there is a better (if more expensive) selection, when I am retired. Although I have a couple of years to go, the planning of it all is pretty nice, I can tell you.And finally, in a couple of weeks I will be off on my winter holiday to Costa Rica. I can't wait. I am travelling with a new (to me) group and they don't have the most direct flights for some reason (Geneva/London/Toronto/Costa Rica) but I am really looking forward to it. Having missed out on my winter vacation last year because of the upcoming wedding, I can't wait for this one as it always feels like spring is just around the corner when I get back. I just hope that holds true!"},
{"title": "I blame it on Sam!", "date": "Friday 5 January 2018", "text": "Only a couple of days ago Sam over at a New Frame of Reference was talking about the work projects she and her hubs were hoping to get done around the house, which to prioritize and how to go about saving for it. I pitched in with my ever-growing list of stuff that needs to be done sooner or later and bugger me, wouldn't you know it, my water heater gave up the ghost Wednesday night. I had felt the water not really heating up for a couple of days but on Wednesday morning I ended up having a cold shower! It seems strange to me that these things never seem to blow up in the summer when a cold shower would be welcome, but in January when it's minus whatever .... that was one of the quickest showers I ever had, I can tell you.  Not that I can complain I suppose as that thing must be about 20 years old but .... Anyway, I sent my (plumber) son a message asking what I should do about a replacement. My water heater's capacity is 300 litres which has been plenty for us over the years, but he told me that when it came time to replace it maybe just go with a 150 litre tank, since I am on my own. I wasn't too sure about that thinking that I wouldn't want to run out of hot water if/when I have visitors, so I was more inclined to go with a 200 litre. My house is technically a five-bedroom so I also didn't see the point in one day advertising it for sale as such with only a tea kettle capacity for hot water.As luck would have it (for me - maybe not for them) Jordan and Jen were both off yesterday so he said he would take a trip down to Cluses where his company buys their professional supplies as he thought they were of a superior quality. In the end he agreed with me that the 150 litre tank would be too small so was going for the 200 litre tank when the guy in the shop said that for only €30 more he could get the 300 litre tank, so that's what they did.  The best bit was though, that when the guy asked them where they wanted to load it they pointed to J's little Ford Fiesta and the guy just laughed and said it wouldn't fit!  Not to be outdone, J and Jen laid the back seats down, pulled the passenger seat waaaaay forward and heaved the thing into the back, although with the tail end sticking out! Poor Jen had to ride home with her nose almost touching the windscreen, but since they are both as stubborn as each other she didn't mind.It gave us a giggle though because I'm sure we've all done it. You know, gone to IKEA and bought a shedload of stuff and then wondered how the hell you were going to get a double bed into the back of your mini. Or bought that huuuuuge Christmas tree from the farm, shoved it across the back seat of the car and then had every passing car manage to chop bits off it as they went by, thereby leaving you with a twig by the time you got home!Anyway, by the time I got home from work Jordan and Jen had got that bugger down into my basement and got it all hooked up in 30 minutes.  The real difficulty, of course, was getting the old one back up the spiral staircase. As I walked through the garage, Jordan and all 100 lbs wringing wet of Jen were underneath that bloody thing pushing, with my 70 year old neighbour at the top of the stairs hauling on a rope! Turns out they are all three as stubborn as each other and blow me if they didn't get that bugger out of there.  What can I say, I am just so eternally grateful to the three of them that they got it done so quickly! Oh and as an aside, J was looking at the state of my bathrooms - ok, I admit it - I somehow managed to mention what a mess they are - and he was saying what he could and couldn't do himself. I don't know if or when, but he said he might be willing to take on part of the project when he gets time! God love him. The blessings of having a plumber for a son! Now if only the other one had been a hairdresser, or a car mechanic, or .....And finally ladies, any suggestions please? We will shortly be having our next board game evening between neighbours. At the first one (at my house) we were only six, at the next we were 10, and we may well be 12 at this next one. Since we all take a dish I was looking for an idea as to what to take. I don't mind sweet or savoury (or both), but since it isn't at my house it should probably be something that doesn't need reheating. I'm just not very inspired at the moment so any suggestions gratefully received! And on that note, I wish you all a lovely weekend. And for those of you in the north eastern US - stay safe!"},
{"title": "Out with the old!", "date": "Wednesday 3 January 2018", "text": "First of all, I wish you all a happy new year - full of health, wealth and happiness. I hope your Christmases were good too. My break was lovely with the boys and their wives plus a friend coming over for Christmas dinner. I didn't make turkey but cooked a sublime filet of beef - which was more thanks to the quality of the beef than anything I did to it - but it really was good. Because I love my kids I also tried to make yorkshire puddings but while they were better than usual they were still a bit soggy to my liking. Oh, well, keep on trying I guess.  We exchanged presents, played a few silly games and then just had a really nice time chatting and being together for a few hours. Now that's my idea of a lovely Christmas. I actually also finally showed them my blog so if they want to take a look at it they can. After everyone left I plonked my unwashed self down on the sofa and read for the next seven days as while I had all kinds of wonderful plans for the rest of the week in the end it was just too, too inviting to do bugger all. I kinda looked like Phyllis Diller by the end of the week (how's that for showing my age)!Phyllis DillerAfter that, no plans for New Year's although I did stay up until 1 a.m. French time to watch the fireworks in London and Edinburgh. Lovely, but I'm also glad it's all over too. I think it's all the celebrating/partying you do during the month of December with friends and colleagues and so on that wears me out so like many people I am glad to get back to a routine and slow down, even if it does mean back to work! On New Year's day I actually decided to go through all my \"favourites\" from my blog lists and can you believe it took me over two hours to delete those I was no longer reading (shows you how many I had been following doesn't it)! I found that my favourites list was just so long that I was getting swamped so I went through all of them and just kept hitting delete if I couldn't remember why I was reading them in the first place! It's not that I don't like those blogs any more but sometimes the blog changes and no longer suits, other times my centres of interest have changed and so on, and then of course there are some bloggers who just seemed to have disappeared - I hope they are ok. Sonya Ann over at A Mom, Money and More you are sorely missed my dear. I hope all is well. I also like a blogger who has now disappeared and who had the absolute goofiest style that I loved. Hyperbole and a Half disappeared quite some time ago but I kept her on my favourites as she was such a character. I think, if I remember correctly, she sometimes talked about her struggle with depression so, again, I hope she is ok. On the positive side, by jumping through some of my remaining \"favourites\" and seeing which blogs they are following, I have discovered some lovely new ones. Since I enjoy stories about Britain during WWII I am really enjoying Carolyn's blog over at \"The 1940s Experiment\". Not only does she have some fascinating (to me) insights into the 1940s period but she has very bravely been using the wartime \"rations\" diet to try to lose a substantial amount of weight. It has come off and gone back on again but she is still heading in the right direction and is a real trooper!Browsing through other people's blogs has also, on occasion, led to their book recommendations and as I am an avid reader I am looking forward to trying out some of these books! Win-win, I guess!Oh, and talking of other people's blogs, I would like to thank Anne over at New Happenings for organizing the \"international bloggers Christmas card swap\" and also Jane in Ontario (Crabapple Landing), Kylie in Australia (I'll have to check back for her blog name - but it was really weird for this blogger to get a Christmas card with Santa in a cozzie carrying a surf board!) and Sue in California (not sure if she has a blog) for their lovely cards.Anyway, this morning it was back to work for me in the pouring rain. It wasn't cold (about +5° I think) but the rain was belting down and the wind was howling, but again the wind wasn't cold and the traffic was fabulous as the kids haven't gone back to school yet. Just as I was about to walk through the turnstyle to get into work I spotted a rather large sticker that had been stuck to the ground outside which said \"Bollocks to Brexit\"! Since my company is very involved in things such as Brexit I guess there can be no doubt about the phantom sticker-hound's feelings can there? Short and to the point!On a slightly different note I was reading in the UK press this week that a \"man\" (if you can call him that) has just pleaded guilty to murdering his wife with a claw hammer. This \"man\", as it turns out, had served prison time for murdering his first wife, had then murdered his second companion, and since he was now out of jail he had the opportunity to murder this poor lady! Dear God alive, how many chances do these people get! It seems to me there is something very, very wrong with the British justice system that this piece of scum has been able to kill three women. I don't often envy the way the US does things because I think we are very, very different culturally but just for once I wish this bastard had come up against the US justice system rather than ours.And then this week we had the announcement of the next bunch of \"stars\" who will be appearing in the latest Celebrity Big Brother. Frankly calling most of them \"celebrities\" makes my brain explode. I think this time around \"in honour of women\" all the \"celebrities\" will be women, although I'm not totally sure of that. Most seem to be reality show trash and one who was hinted at as a possible contestant was someone who \"had almost shagged a (total dumb ass) British footballer\"! Some claim to fame eh! Now I admit I have never watched this crap, although I tried really, really hard for about 10 minutes once but I could feel my brain frying so turned it off. The other big joke was that a \"rumoured Kim Kardashian confident\" might be on it! Say what! What the hell has KK ever kept confidential. I give up. But one comment I saw in the British press said \"from suffragettes to this lot. Where did it all go wrong? I couldn't have said it better myself!And finally, because I can see how long-winded I am getting, I have to mention Mrs. Brown's Boys. For those that don't know, Mrs. Brown is supposedly an Irish widow with six stereotypically over-exaggerated kids. You know, a priest, a ne'er-do-well son who has been to prison, a \"sensible\" one, an \"eternal spinster daughter\" and Rory, the gay one. It is all over the top and there is quite a bit bad language but, while I feel it has gone downhill latterly because it just isn't possible to keep up that level of \"funny\", I still like it - for the time being anyway. The writer and actor who plays Mrs. Brown, is a man (Brendan O'Carroll), and when the actor who played the gay son, Rory, said he wanted out of the series Brendan had to come up with a way to re-write \"Rory\" as he was such a popular (if over the top and exaggeratedly camp) character. So they had \"Rory\" getting plastic surgery and coming back with a slightly changed face. Now the new actor does indeed look somewhat like Rory but I found him a bit stiff (nervous maybe) and waaaay too camp in the Christmas Day show. He was instantly slagged off by many in the press saying get rid of him, but I think, give the guy a chance and let him grow into this or a slightly different version of Rory. Anyway, I loved the original Rory because he was such a giggler and in the TV shows they left all the bloopers in. So here, for your greater pleasure, is \"Mamie\" explaining to Rory how \"Dermott and Maria are going to Venice for the week-end\". Enjoy!"},

I told him (as I say so often) maximum another three years but preferably before as though work is fine the bloody commute is killing me, and lo and behold, where man makes plans God just laughs! Though it snowed pretty much all weekend the roads were ok when I got up this morning. I heard the plough come through our little neighbourhood at 7 a.m. just as I was getting ready to leave, and although you had to go carefully, it really was ok driving. Well, that is until I hit the motorway and the tailback was massive. In retrospect, it had nothing to do with the state of the roads but more to do with a couple of accidents in Geneva. I mean, the traffic was backed up the 20-odd kilometres of motorway from the border (that took me two hours to navigate) and then over another hour to cross Geneva, where a couple of accidents had pretty much brought the city to a halt! Still, at this point, I am pretty zen about it, I was on the bus with a good book and figure I'll get there when I get there. But like I say, all it takes is one idiot not to put snow tyres on (and there are loads of them about) and the whole city comes to a standstill!Anyway, I eventually made it and will finish up what work I can do before heading back home, although the snow has now stopped so fingers crossed.I had a lovely weekend though. On Saturday \"Père Noel\" was scheduled to do a practice run to my little village. As my kids are grown it has been ages since I went to meet Santa but decided that this time I would go and it was lovely. I have to say, the Sanfys (the local community group that organizes this kind of thing) does a wonderful job. In fact, I had volunteered to participate in this group (time permitting of course as I am one of the few still working) but I guess they lost my details or something because I never heard from them! Oh well, next year maybe!Anyway, the weather was dry but not sunny when Père Noel showed up on his practice run, only Rudolph and the team must have been having a rest as he showed up in an old red and white Citroen Diane.It was very well done and there were loads of kids and parents from our little village waiting patiently. The Sanfys had organized all the presents plus drinks, chocolates and brioche and an organ grinder (without the monkey) at the drinks stand and were walking round handing out huge glasses of mulled wine to the adults. I tell ya, you daren't have a partially-filled glass because before you knew it it was filled back up again! I have to say though, that not all mulled wine is good but this really was very tasty - or maybe it was just all that standing about in the cold that made it taste good!An added bonus is that just as Père Noel was getting ready to leave, one of the local farmers decided to move his flock of sheep so the whole village road was blocked off while they were herded further down the road! If they had wanted to add a bit of \"reality\" to the event they couldn't have done better.You can make out the sheep in the background on the village roadAnd finally, I ended up chatting to Steve this weekend after a couple of weeks absence. It has been a while as Mr. S is a party animal and has seemingly been busy partying. Anyway, we had a good long chat and he sent me the following video (which from the sounds of it was filmed in either Italy or Spain). It is pure magic. Steve hadn't realized it wasn't three men (new glasses anyone?) until I pointed out that no, it was in fact one man and two dummies - so three dummies then! Enjoy!"},
{"title": "The Armageddon Cupboard!", "date": "Friday 15 December 2017", "text": "Does anyone else have one? Goodness knows why I have one (anymore) but I do and I'm trying to clear/clean that sucker out little by little. I don't think you can blame me though because my parents lived through WWII and the subsequent rationing in the UK, which only ended in 1954. I was born in 1958 so it was still a very real memory for them. In fact, I remember once seeing my mom's old ration card and I so wished I still had it now - for me that would be something to treasure. Anyway, since they had a large family and even if you had tons of money there wasn't, at that point, an awful lot to buy with it, mom and dad always \"stock-piled\" whatever they could, even when rationing was over and money was less tight. So that's what I grew up with and was subliminally absorbed by me, I suppose. So over the years of getting married and having a family I always had \"extras\" in the cupboard by the front door. There was also the fact that being in Geneva/France it wasn't always possible (in the early days at  least) to get all the stuff from the UK that I might want to cook with, so I \"stockpiled\" whenever I went home. Now, of course, it's much easier and I can get pretty much anything I want (though I still have never found peppermint essence but I've got tons of that anyway). So over the years I have been stuffing things into that cupboard on the basis that \"you never know when we might run out\" and also, truthfully, because I like to cook and have got into the bad habit of thinking I have to have everything available no matter what I feel like cooking. The net result is, of course, that foodstuffs get old, pantry moths appear and I can never remember what I have in there anyway. So over the past however long I have been emptying that sucker out, maybe while standing waiting for the kettle to boil, and cleaning, sorting and pitching what I can. Turns out the pantry moths don't come so much from the food storage (which I am pretty meticulous about, although they can't be avoided with certain products) but the little buggers have actually been nesting in the holes where the screws were put in when assembling the cupboard!!! Et voilà! Since I figured that out I have had every draw out and scrubbed and dug into those cupboards like you wouldn't believe. Still, it has taken a long time doing it bit by bit, but I really must get out of the habit of \"stockpiling\" now, especially since I am on my own.Other than that, we had one helluva storm last night. Wind, snow, rain - you name it. I'm just glad I made it home before the worst of it hit as it really sounded like the chimney might come down. Luckily it didn't but crikey, while I love a storm that was a doozie. Then this morning, the traffic simply flew through, I tell you, there is no rhyme nor reason to it. I actually made it early to the parking lot and another lady and I were standing waiting as the bus pulled up, slowed down, and then drove straight past without stopping. We both stood there gawping with our mouths open like venus fly traps. It turns out, since 10 December the Geneva transport authorities have introduced a rule where buses no longer stop unless a passenger on the bus wants to get off (nobody did, apparently), or unless the person waiting for the bus actually flags it down. So we both stood there like lemons and the bus waltzed straight past us! A lesson learned, I can tell you!On a separate note, we had our divisional Christmas party a couple of hours ago, which they have at lunchtime rather than in the evenings. I left after about three hours but understand they are still partying! Oh to be young again.Colleagues from Peru, China and Japan Colleagues from: India, France, Austria, France (x3), Denmark, France ...The view from the terrace  - over there is where the rich people live - think Sophia Loren et al! Secret Santa, with colleagues from: Japan, Ireland, Bolivia, France and Guinée!It is all very pleasant but I must admit I am already tired of eating. You know how you go out to lunch with colleagues so much just before the holidays - and that's without even talking about how much you will eat during the holidays. On Wednesday I was invited out to a Japanese restaurant and while I'm not really a fan of Japanese food, I have to say it was exquisite. I can see why Japanese people are generally not fat. They don't eat huge quantities but what they do eat is beautifully prepared and delicious. Looks like I'll be re-appraising my thoughts on Japanese cuisine!Talking of \"cuisine\" though, since I was cleaning again last night I defrosted some homemade lentil soup I had in the freezer. Crikey, it was so thick you could cement a brick wall with it. Still, you only have to add water right, and it beats having to cook when I have other (exciting) things planned - like cleaning! Oh, what a life I lead.Still, I don't lead a bad life at all, considering that I was reading in the newspaper this morning about the Loneliness Initiative that has been taken up in honour of the late MP (Member of Parliament) Jo Cox, who was tragically shot by a man with \"mental health issues\" (you don't say) a year ago. Jo was very pro the European Union and the lunatic that killed her shouted \"Britain first\" as he shot her. One of her projects was the Loneliness Initiative wherein since she believed that modern society was being killed from within by loneliness - and she wasn't wrong there was she - she was trying to do something to fight it! I hope the Initiative really takes off as loneliness has no place in our society.And finally, years ago when on the west coast of France at a place called Dune de Pilat, I bought a tacky piggy bank made out of a coconut shell. I love that piggy bank so every time I get a five Swiss franc coin (about $6) I throw it in there. When I have 250 Swiss francs I can roll them up and hand them in at the bank. Just two more coins to go then. It's surprising how quickly this \"throw away\" money adds up though isn't it. What you don't have you don't miss I guess. So on that note, have a lovely weekend everyone - or bon weekend, as they say here!Dune de Pilat"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Thursday 14 December 2017", "text": "There's not much going on here at the moment. My big meeting was over at the beginning of the month and now I have time to (leisurely) prepare for my next meeting in March. That basically means getting the five sections of the report ready, edited and off to the translators in plenty of time to allow them to plough through it. Otherwise, it is pretty much winding down with many people already heading off for the holidays.The weather is pretty weird though. Last Saturday we easily got five inches of snow but with glorious sunshine. After that it bucketed down rain for about four days - which is fine by me as it means the snow stays up in the mountains and the roads in the towns lower down stay clear. It has been like this for the last two weekends actually and again forecast the same for this weekend. It really messes with your body temperature gauge though. I mean, yesterday morning it was -3° when I left home. I almost pulled the door handle off my car trying to open it (I did do that once), and when I tried to roll down my window to badge into the parking lot the window blocked solid. Then today, as I left for work it was +7°, so a difference of 10° overnight. No wonder you don't know what to wear!For some obscure reason (I've given up trying to figure it out) traffic into work was again dreadful this morning. As I got to about 2 km from the Swiss border traffic stopped completely so when I actually got through the customs about 30 minutes later there must easily have been a good 10-15 km tail back. Then, while I was sitting waiting to get to the park and ride I saw a truck coming alongside me down the hard should but driving the in the wrong direction - down the motorway! It wasn't a works truck or anything like that, but assuming no-one hit him coming up the hard shoulder (they shouldn't do that but they do), I don't know where he thought he was ever going to be able to turn around. I mean, he could maybe make it to the previous exit but there was no way he was going to be able to get off there!!! I can only hope the motorway cops caught up with him!When I finally made it to the park and ride I thought I had better use the loos there as given my luck goodness only knew how much time it would take to cross Geneva on the bus. As I was trying, without success, to badge myself into the toilets a women came running up to me, hopping about on one leg and almost in tears, she was that desperate to use the bathroom. Well my badge wouldn't work, her badge wouldn't work and another man had no luck either, so she pushed the emergency button and yelled through the intercom for them to \"open the bloody door\". Whereupon she pushed straight past me and charged into the disabled toilets! Poor thing actually, because I suppose we have all been there and just how embarrassing would it be to pee yourself (or worse) in a situation like that!Still, the good weather (when we get it) gives us fabulous views of the mountains on the ride in to work.  Geneva is surrounded by the Jura mountains to the north and the alps to the south, with the lake slap bang in the middle (hence all the traffic problems caused by the local geography). Below is a picture of the Jura mountains (I used to live on the \"Jura side\" when I was single) and the lovely hotel where we spent our one-night honeymoon in 1985. Yep, that was it - one night - and then he had to be back to work the next day.The JuraView from our hotel across to the alps - I live on the  \"alps side\" now!Hotel La MainazThe hotel was lovely, but as you can see it does look like something out of The Shining (I guess I should have known the ex would eventually go mad)!Anyhoo, last night I finally got round to putting my Christmas tree up. I hate putting the bloody thing up but I have to admit it does look very pretty when it is all done. When my youngest and his gf were living with me I used to leave them to do it but no such luck anymore. Oddly enough I have never minded taking it down. I'm sure there's some Freudian significance to that somewhere!Oh, and I just read in the news that the French are going to ban mobile phones for children in primary and middle school as from September. It doesn't concern high school students but for the others they will not be allowed to have their phones on them in class (obviously) but nor will they be allowed to take them out and use them during break/lunch. As they have quite rightly said, kids should be out  playing and running around, not glued to a screen all the time! I think it's absolutely right and good luck to them, but I guess we'll see how that works out won't we.And finally, what can we say about the vote in Alabama except well done Alabama! Finally some people with sense!"},
{"title": "Let it snow!", "date": "Friday 1 December 2017", "text": "I woke up this morning to about five inches of snow. Very pretty indeed, but as I've said before I hate driving on the bloody stuff. That being said, I have had the week from hell traffic-wise this week, but this morning - nada! The roads were almost empty compared to usual and I just flew through until I hit the franco/swiss border! There really is no rhyme or reason to it, although I have to say the French do a very good job of maintaining the roads. Not my little village so much. Oh, the plough was round at about 6 a.m. this morning but because of lack of funds they don't salt or grit the roads so we kinda have to \"slither\" the first couple of hundred metres until we get to the boundary limit with the local town. After that, it's not so bad.I have mentioned before that I use the park and ride for my commute -  I've been doing it for the last four years because the stress of crossing Geneva in rush-hour traffic just wasn't worth it. I drive to the border where I park and catch the bus across town. I'm lucky actually because this bus takes me door-to-door so if I wedge myself in at the back I don't have to move until I get to work, so I get plenty of reading done. It costs me 1,600 Swiss francs per year (that's about $1,800) for the parking and the all-Geneva bus/train/ferry boat pass, but actually just cutting out crossing Geneva, with all the stops and starts, practically halves my petrol bill, which in turn, almost pays for my bus pass. It's a lot less stressful and I get tons of reading done, so while I hate my commute there are some positives to it.One of the negatives happened last night though. A young girl got on at the station and sat next to me. When she saw that I was reading in English she asked if I spoke English! Duuuuuhhhh! No I don't speak a word of it, that's why I'm reading in English.  Anyway, I don't mind chatting to anyone but just carry a book in case to fill the 45 minute cross-town bus trip. She was sweet enough and asked where I was from, so I told her England, and then she said she was from Utah! Alarm bells started ringing at this point because I had already been \"nabbed\" twice before by young Mormon girls and wasn't really in the mood for it. I mean, they have every right to their religion but I also have every right to not be the slightest bit interested. Still I chatted to her but told her straight out I wasn't interested in organized religion and so on, but every time I tried to change the subject she came back to it! From my previous encounters on the bus with young Mormon girls I reckon there must be a \"Mormon missionary training school/handbook\" and in chapter 2 it must say \"give your target, the biggest, widest smile you can muster without ripping your lips\"! Seriously, those smiles are very pretty but a bit weird aimed at someone you have never met before! Then, as I say, every single thing I said was brought back round to the Book of Mormon and her religion! I actually thought of asking her if she had watched the rugby match on Saturday just to see how she would bring that back to religion. I could see the cogs moving in her brain just trying to figure out how to do this!In the 28 years I have lived in France I have never had Mormons knock on my door, but Jehovah's Witnesses yes. It really pisses me off because I figure if I am interested in your religion I know where to find you (one of my neighbour families are JWs and they are lovely so, like I say, I really do know where to find out more if I want it). Thankfully, I have a front door where I can leave the actual door locked and just open the glass centre piece (it's great in the summer because I can leave the door locked but \"open\" to let a breeze through without anyone being able to get in). That was a good purchase I can tell you. I just tell these people I'm not interested and to be fair they go away. I just wish they would stop door-stepping though because I really don't agree with it. I'm never rude but I have learned to be firm in my old age.Years ago, when we lived in D.C., my husband answered the door to two young people who garbled something to him (not sure what) and then (of course) the young girl had trouble holding her files/books so the idiot invited them in. Two hours later they were still there discussing religion with him (no idea which religion they were), but after 10 minutes I left him to it, said \"you invited them in, you deal with it, I have better things to do\"! Anyway, about a month later I saw them walking up to our building again so this time I made a beeline for the door and I was the one who answered it. They said they \"came by to say they were heading back to Texas and wanted to let us know\", so I just said \"have a safe trip\"! And then there was silence. One trick to get someone to do something you want them to do is to leave an awkward silence, but I wasn't falling for that so we just stood there in a \"face off\" until the awkward silence got too much for them. Ha! Anna 1, bible bashers 0!  My ex did have the decency to say \"thank God you answered the door this time\" because he knew he would fall for it again.Anyway, with the young girl on the bus I knew what was coming next. Just as she was about to get off the bus she thrust a card into my hand and told me to call her \"when I felt God calling\". Bloody hell, that'll be a long wait. I had even told her religion isn't a big thing in England for the most part. Basically if you want to see a full church you have to hire rent-a-crowd as people (particularly younger people) are just not into it. As soon as I got off the bus I threw the card in the bin, but I was at least kind enough to rip it up so that no weirdo could get hold of her number and bother her. See, now's that's called being decent!"},
{"title": "Man, do I have the sweetest colleague!", "date": "Thursday 30 November 2017", "text": "I don't know if I mentioned previously, but ever since my ex left (and the kids have moved out) I have taken a vacation during the winter months. It breaks up the winter and is so nice to get away from the cold weather for a bit. It makes the winter all a bit more bearable. Anyway, for 2018 I have decided to go to Costa Rica. I will be travelling with a new (to me) group which comes highly recommended by a friend who has previously travelled with them (Sri Lanka, Iran, China). Anyway, this group flies from London so, having paid the balance on this holiday yesterday and gotten the flight details, today I was looking at flights to London the day before, plus an overnight hotel stay.Typically, I was whinging to my colleague at how bloody expensive the flights were already. I mean I was looking at 350-400 Swiss francs (around $400). I guess it is because of the ski season, as people have already begun booking. Anyway, C must have been tired of my whinging because he said \"let's look at British Airways because I have 10 trillion air miles, some of which I am going to lose anyway, and if it will stop you whinging you can have them\". Well, actually he said nothing of the sort (he loves me really) but offered to give me his air miles so that they wouldn't be wasted.  Anyway, after much huffing and puffing we found a flight for the day before to Gatwick (it means I have to get the bus over to Heathrow) and outwards from Heathrow on the return leg, but we were having trouble booking it online. So C gets on the phone and spends ages booking it with the BA rep, telling  him it's a \"birthday present for my aunt\"!!!!! I should have hit him then! Buuuuut, after he hung up, he said \"you're all booked but you're going business class\"!  Wow. It's not the business class part (nobody needs to fly business class on such a short flight) but it was the fact that he had thought to do it. It ended up costing me just 100 Swiss francs in fees (just over $100) but when I looked at the round trip flight, business class, it would have cost me 740 Swiss francs (around $750)! Somehow I think I have to forgive him for referring to me as his \"aunt\" and I sense a nice bottle of wine winging its way to him don't you?I have my big, semi-annual meeting on Monday. All the work has been done, the reports are out (all 500 pages of them) and I am just praying the French and Spanish versions are issued tomorrow, although to be fair our translation section have never let me down yet. So now, nothing much is going on, nor will there be much after the meeting. I much prefer to be busy but I'm sure I can find stuff to be going on with.Last night it took me two hours to get home! Aaaarrrghhh! Luckily for me, just after I got through the border they had posted a sign to indicate a 6 km tailback (and growing) so I was able to jump off the motorway and take the back roads. Even so, since there is major construction work going on over there, the bloody roads were just one traffic light after another so I pretty much crawled all the way home. And then again this morning, although I have no idea what happened this morning. Last night I could see it was an accident but as for today ... no idea. People say to me why don't you move but (a) the closer you get to Geneva the more expensive it is, (b) I wouldn't get another mortgage at my age anyway, (c) when the CEVA train comes through my local town it will (would - I'll be gone by then) halve the commute time and hence push prices up, and finally (d) my neighbours are great. They really look out for me and being on my own that is priceless, I can tell you. Funnily enough, this morning as I was day-dreaming in the traffic jam, I remembered when we went to the States for Christmas some years ago. When we got back to France, my neighbour had been in and lit a roaring fire to welcome us back. Trouble is, he must have got distracted and left the back veranda door open when he left - the bloody house was actually freezing, although I never told him that. But you see, who would move away from neighbours like that. Then this Saturday night we have our second \"neighbours\" board game evening. It should be a hoot, judging by the last one at my place, so I'll probably have some funny pictures to share next week!So more this and that. I am so sick, sick, sick of wearing the clothes I wear for work. I keep putting off buying new because I am determined to lose weight (yeah, right, you've heard that before haven't you?). Don't get me wrong, I am more than presentable but .... Anyway, last night I was looking on the web for clothes to get me through the next few months until I am again sylph like (?) and it was so depressing when they didn't have half the clothes in my size, well not the ones I like anyway. I mean, if you want to look like a circus marquee no problem, but nice clothes, there weren't too many of them in my size. I'm not ginormous by any standards but have a hard time getting something where I can fit both boobs in at the same time. So onwards and upwards, as they say!And finally, talking of funny pictures, I finally got round to printing wedding pictures for my (ex) mother-in-law. I had promised her them ages ago and had indeed bought photo paper to print the copies on. Trouble is, I buggered up the heavy-duty printer at work doing it - not once, but twice - the printer technicians weren't best pleased I can tell you! I guess I'm off their Christmas card list then. Anyway, as I printed the pictures off finally, I came across this one below. After the meal and as the games started, the two competitors were given instructions to dash out among the guests and come back with, in this case, a tie. Now the young man giving the instructions mumbled a lot and I mis-heard him when it was my turn. My ex, however, has obviously got out of the habit of speaking French so hadn't understood a thing until this rather large, young man ran up to him and \"started trying to strangle him\". The man on the left is the father of the bride, the man \"being strangled\" is my ex-husband, and the lady roaring laughing is Jen's mom (my youngest son's girlfriend's mom). The photo just tickled me though so I thought I would share it with you. Oh, and I finally got the photos, plus a letter plus a Christmas card sent off to my mother-in-law (so that's one more thing ticked off my list)."},
{"title": "So much wasted time!", "date": "Monday 27 November 2017", "text": "I had no plans this weekend so all-in-all it was very quiet and very pleasant. Oh how I love me some weekends like that! Actually, though, I got an awful lot done so I'm feeling pretty pleased right now.  Someone had mentioned to me that one of the local towns had a new shop that had just opened where you could take your own containers rather than having to accept their packaging. I reckon there must be one in Geneva and certainly one in Annecy but I had not heard of anything locally. Of course we have health food shops and organic shops where you can buy some things without packaging but to be able to get everything packaging-free was interesting to me. Admittedly it wasn't very big but it is certainly a start. The lady explained to me that if I wanted to buy, for instance, washing liquid she would need to sell me a specific container (for some reason) but after that I could take it back as many times as I wanted. Everything else was \"bring your own container\". The selection of goods so far is pretty limited but I'm hoping it will take off, although to be honest I don't see how you could shop for a family in this way. Who knows, like I say, let's hope it takes off (I guess we are only about 30 years behind California in this respect then)!Other than that, not much going on really. I got to watch some great rugby internationals on Saturday. England won (yaaaay) - and it seems like the England team are on the way back up again. Obviously as the older, more experienced players have retired it takes time for the youngsters to fill their shoes, but they certainly seem to be heading that way. Then after that, Strictly Come Dancing and all I can say is \"go Debbie McGee\". She is 59 (the same age as me) and it is wonderful to watch her dance (says me who looks like a pregnant heffalump in comparison). I couldn't begin to hazard a guess as to who might win, but to me Debbie certainly stands a good chance. Let's hear it for the older woman!Debbie and GiovanniThen on Sunday I thought I should give my brother a call. As I mentioned before, he now has a lady friend, after being on his own for quite some time after the death of his wife. I'm not sure how long they have been together - maybe nine months - but she seems to be doing him the world of good. Anyway, two weeks ago they took themselves off to Rome for five days, but unfortunately, M fell on the first day and injured her shoulder. They ended up in the emergency room at Rome hospital and to say they were less than impressed would be an understatement. They took an x-ray but with the swelling they weren't really able to tell what was wrong, so they just gave her a crepe bandage and told her to go to the pharmacy to buy a sling. She said the nurse's uniform was filthy and when they asked if they could take the x-ray with them they refused.  M was determined that they stay on and apparently they had a good time, within the limitations imposed by her arm. My brother's son picked them up at Liverpool airport and then they caught the train the next day back to North Wales, whereupon M, who was still in pain, went to the little local hospital. Turns out she had broken her shoulder, so they took her into surgery the next day and all is sorted. Thank God for the NHS is how they put it. Buuuuut, get this, since M can't drive she will now be staying with my brother for some time so that he can take care of her. I guess the true test of a new relationship is how you react in times like this isn't it so to hear my brother say \"I can get her knickers on but the bra got me beat\" says it all don't you think!Later that afternoon I decided it would be good time to put the last of my garden to bed, put the garden furniture away and cover up what couldn't be moved since they are forecasting snow this week (I'm so glad I already got my snow tyres on). My colleague teases me that I must be attracted to the little fat French man at the local tip as I make \"any excuse to go down there on a Saturday\" (hence more garden refuse to go next week). I think it could have something to do with me saying how enticing I found his little belly peaking over the top of his trousers, and how the wind softly whistled around the lone tooth in the middle of his upper jaw when he spoke! So now I have a reputation with my colleague ... oh well, if you can't beat em join em. I told C I had visions of me, you know like in American Beauty, with the blond love interest lying there surrounded by rose petals, only it would be me lying in the tip surrounded by grass clippings and compost! Told you I have a wacky sense of humour!And finally, I was sad to hear of the death of teen idol David Cassidy's last week. Goodness he was only 67 and while he had struggled with drink over the years, the saddest thing was when he admitted he was in the early stages dementia. At 67!!! Good Lord. But even sadder was that on his deathbed, this young man who had it all - the looks, the talent, adulation, money - his daughter said his last words were \"so much wasted time\"! Now that is tragic!David Cassidy"},
{"title": "If not now .... then when?", "date": "Friday 24 November 2017", "text": "I watched a rather funny TED talk by Tim Urban the other day - \"Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator\". I won't post it here as it is easy enough to look up, but as I say, it was funny, if not exactly earth shattering! I can't say I consider myself a procrastinator (I'll give more thought to that later .....) but I know I work better (a) when I have a lot to do and (b) when I am up against it time-wise. That being said, I tend to anticipate things and get stuff done in advance so no, I guess I'm not a procrastinor!Anyway, in the TED talk he starts off by saying that people can be divided into the rational thinkers and the \"instant gratification monkeys\" who procrastinate before getting things done.Instant gratification monkeys let things slide until the \"panic monster\" shows up - at which point they know that they had better get their act into gear and produce whatever it was they were supposed to!Credit to \"waitbutwhy.com\" for all of the aboveNothing earth-shatteringly new there right? Buuuuuut, afterwards Tim flashed up a simple photo of what looked like a white page covered with 4,680 squares. Nothing more. What if there was no deadline? What if the panic monster didn't scare you into doing whatever it is that you were supposed to do? Those 4,680 squares, he explained, were the number of weeks of life available to a human baby, assuming that baby lived to be 90 (and that's already a pretty big assumption). How many of those squares had you already checked off? How many more would you check off before you (a) lost that weight, (b) stopped smoking, (c) got into shape, (d) got your financial house into order? You see where I'm going with this. Now that was a pretty \"ah-ha\" moment for me I can tell you (and I don't get many of them). And he was right. What if there is no deadline - you are just going to do something \"one day\". So with that in mind, I thought I should get my backside back into gear (again) and went to the gym yesterday and have already clocked up 14,000 steps today. If not now, then when (indeed)?"},
{"title": "A sad indictment of Western society!", "date": "Tuesday 21 November 2017", "text": "I happened to catch this video this morning while surfing the internet. I have no idea how old it is and I don't know this guy, but it made me really sad to see so much perfectly edible food going to waste. It's not a dig at America, nor Walmart, because we all know it goes on everywhere. Moreover, I don't blame the poor Walmart employes caught on camera - it's obviously not their decision to throw this stuff away and even they are not allowed to take, or even buy, the food either!A good while ago I mentioned the wonderful Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's documentary called \"Hugh's War on Waste\" in which, among other things, he went dumpster diving around the back of one of the major UK supermarkets (can't remember which one) where he and a volunteer from a local soup kitchen were hauling out whatever they could to take back to the soup kitchen to provide food for people in difficult circumstances. Hugh asked the young man if he had ever been arrested and he said \"no, but I sat in the back of a police car once\", at which point he begged  them to arrest him. The supermarket weren't going for it though, of course, because of all the bad publicity that would engender.I think subsequently supermarkets began pouring bleach over food in order to make it inedible - how sad is that!  In the video above, if I caught it correctly, they were throwing out what seemed to be whole bins of shampoo and other toiletries. It is just so, so shameful, when half the world doesn't have enough to eat, and even in a wealthy country like America there are people who could use a little help. This guy is right - and again, I say, it isn't a dig at America because it goes on everywhere, it's just that this guy happened to be filming at a Walmart in Ohio. Good on him, is all I can say.Last year the French enacted a law whereby any store with a surface area of more than 4,000 square metres (I think - I'm just typing this from memory) had to hook up with a local charity/community group in order that food that they were going to throw away be handed over to them rather than having bleach poured over it or going to landfill. It's not a panacea of course, as I recently posted on how low stocks at my local food bank were, but isn't it about time others followed suit. To be throwing away these huge quantities of food when people are going hungry is just appalling. Well done Gary Joe Ahms!"},
{"title": "Thrilling!", "date": "Monday 6 November 2017", "text": "This weekend was quieter than the last couple of weekends but I don't mind that at all. Sometimes it is good to have a lazy one isn't it. On Friday I resisted the urge to take scissors to my hair, which was sticking out all over the place, and called and got an appointment to get it chopped off on Saturday. I got my usual running around done, plus hair cut and also jammed a good 45 minutes of gardening in (so another trip to the tip this weekend), but otherwise a pretty quiet day.Then on Sunday two friends and I had tickets to see Belcanto - a tribute to the fabulous Luciano Pavarotti - at the Hotel Kempinski in Geneva and it was wonderful. I have seen many shows over the years but I think this has to be my absolute favourite. I always loved Pavarotti's beautiful voice and this touring group - who are funded by the Pavarotti Foundation - were just so amazing it sent shivers up my spine. I am not an emotional person (stiff upper lip and all that) but at the final song, the male singers started singing and then a screen was lowered with Pavarotti singing to end the song. They had such beautiful voices it would be hard for me to chose my favourite, but one young man who was quite small in stature had the most beautiful, powerful voice imaginable, so I guess he might have been my favourite, but they were all just sensational! Quite a few people were crying at the end (even I was close) and they had three curtain calls before they sang their final encore - which was made all the more sweet by the fact that they took a little girl of about eight or nine and hoisted her up on stage with them, whereupon the first male singer got down on one knee and serenaded her, while holding her hand! And hats off to mom and dad for taking such a little one to such a magical event!After such a glorious Sunday afternoon, I was so hyped up I went home and made a caramel-apple cheesecake to take to work. Not bad, although not being a fan of apples I don't think I would put them in it next time. Still, it has gone down very well here all the same.The bise (wind) is blowing today which I kinda love. It makes the lake look like the ocean but of course is bitterly cold, and with the temperatures dropping we should soon have some magnificent (and slippy) sights out my office window, as they are predicting snow this week. Thank goodness I have an appointment to get my snow tyres on on Thurday. Winter draws (drawers?) on, as they say!This is what the lake looks like today!And shortly, it will look like this picture, taken just outside my office last year!"},
{"title": "Acid drops!", "date": "Friday 3 November 2017", "text": "I've been frantically busy these last couple of weeks getting huge documents prepared ready for our next big meeting in December. I don't mind at all as I kinda like the satisfaction I get pulling it all together, but that is the reason I haven't posted much nor commented on other people's blogs this past while.Anyhow, despite that, I did manage to take myself off to a lovely spa here on Lake Geneva last Sunday. For Christmas, my youngest and his girlfriend had given me an entry voucher with \"hammam\" circuit included and when I realized it was about to expire in November I thought I had better get a move on. I had never been to this spa as it is relatively new but what a lovely time I had. The \"public\" part was a bit dark for my taste but after the first hour, when I got on the hammam circuit it was much lighter and less crowded. I did the jacuzzi, friction rub room, steam room and then headed off for a 50-minute massage which I decided to treat myself to. Gosh it's been ages since I had a massage and I felt so good afterwards - all soft and wobbly (well \"wobblier\" really). Not a pretty site in a bikini but ..... And of course, as someone who wasn't brought up in the lap of luxury, a bit of luxury treatment feels like dying and going to heaven.The view from the rooftop pool over Lake GenevaAnd I definitely loved the Moroccan theme inside - the exotic lamps hanging low and the beautiful metal-work tea tables. Think I might look out for something like that for my back terrace in the summer!As I was saying, I am really busy at the moment and have worked late hours most of the past two weeks. The other night, however, I did get to watch a couple of documentaries that I thought were really interesting.  The first was on the  night of Halloween so I never got to watch the whole thing uninterrupted, but it did give food for thought. It was called something like \"Who's spending the UK's billions\", and was an investigative documentary into how much money was being paid to consultancy firms in times of austerity to have them show you how to save money!!! Madness right! The one part I did catch was in a small town in Wales where the local council spent millions on a consultancy company to show them how to cut back. At least the lady Councillor had the balls to appear on TV (before storming off in a huff when the interviewer asked her to justify this spending on consultants when people were being laid off).  Another glaring example was a consultancy firm being paid UK£ 60 million (I think that was the figure - as I say running back and forth handing out Halloween candy didn't help) by the NHS (the UK National Health Service) to show them how to save money!!!! The NHS is stretched incredibly thin and deserve better considering the wonderful work they do. When the interviewer pointed out that the £60 million paid to the consultants would have kept two small hospitals functioning for a year, the interviewee squirmed and tried to waffle his way out of it.Anyway, don't talk to me about \"efficiency\" consultants. Sorry but I think 99% of it is a crock of shit and they just have their noses in the trough. I mean, how many of us have been on \"team building\" days out, tearing through the flip charts, and come away with bugger all at the end of it. One lunatic that we had got our boss to have us set up a kind of \"chat forum\" between us (all 25 of us!!!) so that we could share information we needed for our work. We somehow always managed to share that information at the coffee machine or at the photocopier before - we didn't need to pay some consultant $2,000 a day to come up with that brainwave, all the more since his brainchild lasted about three weeks before we went back to meeting at the coffee machine! And if you remember I talked in a previous post about the psycho boss we had a few years ago - it seems a bit telling that the first consultant we hired after she joined us turned out to be the first referee on said psycho's job application. A case of you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours eh?The second documentary was called \"Saving Lives at Sea\" and follows the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) on their call outs. While the RNLI are a charity they refuse government funding as they want to run their organization as they see fit. So all the staff are volunteers and the RNLI is self-funded. I regularly give to charity but have this daydream of winning a largish amount on the lottery and sending them £1 million, as they would be top of my list (I have a list of about five favourite charities). They do an amazing job and are remarkably non-judgmental when they end up having to save idiots from themselves out at sea.RNLI volunteers!After the \"Mousehole\" tragedy of the Penlee Lifeboat in December 1981, where all eight volunteer crewmen drowned, I have a very soft spot for the RNLI. Here's hoping I get the next big win on the lottery then - I don't need much but would have great pleasure giving it away!And finally, I have just started reading a book by the late comedian Kenneth Williams called Acid Drops. \"Acid drops\" are what you might call put-downs or pithy little retorts, and Williams was known for them. I wasn't a great fan of his and while the book is ok I feel it is a somewhat contrived collection of snide comments, put-downs and so on.  Of course I guess most people have heard of Churchill's put down of Lady Astor.Lady Astor - \"Mr. Churchill, it would seem to me that you are drunk\"!Churchill - \"Madam, I may be drunk but you are ugly and tomorrow I will be sober ....\"!As I said, while it seems somewhat contrived, there are some pretty funny examples in it.  One of the better ones is an incident that happened in 1960 at the United Nations. Apparently the British Prime Minister, Harold McMillan, was talking when Nikita Krushchev erupted in fury at something he had said and started banging his shoe on the table. Without missing a beat, McMillan turned to the interpreters' cabin and said \"interpretation please\"! A gem!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Thursday 26 October 2017", "text": "For the third time since I took out my mortgage at the age of 53, I have just paid back an extra 10% of the initial sum! Ouch indeed. My poor savings account looks very sad, I can tell you!  Under the terms of my mortgage, the only time I can pay an additional amount is if I pay a minimum of 10% of the initial mortgage (they obviously don't want people doing this), so since I took out a mortgage of 321,000 Swiss francs, that means I have to save up around 33,000 Swiss francs - and it's bloody hard going obviously.Even though I live in France (think euros), my mortgage is in Swiss francs, since the French banks want to get their hands on that lovely, stable currency! When I first signed on in order to buy my ex out of the house I couldn't put much extra away since my overheads were pretty high and I didn't know what my new \"solo\" overheads were going to be. Turns out he was one helluva drain (and not only emotionally)! In very short order I was able to knock around 1,000 euros off my monthly bills without noticing any discernible difference in my and my kids standard of living. It's absolutely ridiculous to live the way we (he) lived - I have been so much better off in so many ways since he has been gone. Ha! Anyway, three years ago I was able to pay my first extra 10%, then the following year the same, and now the same again for the third year in a row. I'm a bit miffed in a way because over three years I have \"only\" paid off an extra 99,000 Swiss francs - not that I'm knocking that of course - but an extra 1,000 Swissies would have put me at 100,000, which kinda has a magic ring to it don't you think. Still, I have been working on the assumption that I will be able to pay off my 17-year mortgage in nine years, but looking at it now it may even work out at around eight years, if I have done my sums right! And that sounds pretty darn good to me. So I am on schedule to pay the whole thing off in under three years and then I can retire. And that sounds even better! So in my depleted state, if anyone can throw me some breadcrumbs and a little gruel it would be gratefully received (just kidding - \"let them eat cake\" - said Marie-Antoinette never!). I calculated (haphazardly) once that I reckoned it would save me around 40,000 Swissies in interest. Not sure if that's correct - I will probably have to wait until the end to see how much I have saved - but either way I'll take that!In other news, \"ouch\" was also the way I felt when I came back from Greece. I was down 7 lbs in weight but when I got back had pretty much put it all back on. Aaaarghh!!!! That Steve was a bloody bad influence, I can tell you. So, it's nose back to the grindstone and on to the serious business (yet again) of trying to shift the blubber. Oh dear! How come I can do it with money but not with the weight? Beats me!"},
{"title": "Such fun!", "date": "Monday 23 October 2017", "text": "On Saturday I went for my first ever lesson in cake decorating and thoroughly enjoyed myself, although I have to say it is more difficult than it looks. I have to admit I tend to be a bit \"slap dash\" and kinda think \"oh, I've got this\" and then find out that really I haven't! I ended up with quite a few holes in the icing because I rolled it too thin but for a first attempt it wasn't bad.These are the cakes we six ladies decorated - not bad for first efforts are they (mine's the green hat in the middle)!It was a bit hectic to be honest as I had people coming over on Saturday night so had to dash out and get some shopping in, then race into Geneva for my class, then back and get ready for our \"board game evening\".  A couple of years ago I had joined the local MJC (community centre, if you like) where they had a board game evening once a month. They said it started at 5 pm so I showed up at 5 on the dot, only to be surrounded by little kids playing tiddly-winks! Apparently the adults show up around 8 pm but nobody thought to let me know! I went a couple of times but as there were already established groups it was kind of difficult to integrate, although the people were nice, of course. Then last year, as we were having our annual neighbourhood clean up I got chatting with Valérie and she said how she would like to join too. Well we went a couple of times but again it was difficult to join in a group that was already used to each other, so rather inspiringly Valérie suggested we do it ourselves in our own homes once a month. So Saturday night was our first \"date\" at my place and though a couple couldn't make it we ended up being six in the end and had a great time.I had bought the game \"Big Mouth\" where you put a kind of \"mouth stretcher\" in and then have to read words off a card and get your team mates to say them. It was so much fun. I got a great video of Isabelle trying to get her husband to get the phrase but I'll be buggered if I can get it to post. Still, here are a few pictures anyway! A great game if ever you need to liven things up a bit (but watch out for the drool)!IsabelleValérieDebbie"},
{"title": "The Psychopath Next Door .....", "date": "Thursday 19 October 2017", "text": ".... is the name of a book I read a couple of years ago following the appointment of a new head of HR in the large corporation where I work. I obviously can't go into specifics but to say that she was a ***+***++  ***+***++@@ would probably be an understatement! I am lucky I guess in that I rarely sense office \"tensions\" and \"sensitivities\" so they hardly ever bother me, but in this case - good God alive - even I couldn't miss it! The terms \"sociopath\" and \"psychopath\" are used interchangeably by many, but for me \"psychopath\" seems to be the more \"depraved\", for want of a better word. Of course not all sociopaths are evil nor are they criminal but ....... They say 4% of the population are sociopaths, or 1 in 25, so it seems to me that I must be a bit weird never to have realized I was dealing with one before this \"gem\" came along. As I read this book she lept off the page to me constantly - it was surreal, to put it mildly!This woman was such an extreme case that even I couldn't fail to see it. Sociopaths are supposedly lacking in any empathy or remorse, which is why they often make good business managers - they are willing to do whatever it takes in the name of the almighty dollar, and to hell with anyone that gets hurt (as long as it's not them)! It also seems to me that they would make good surgeons and the like (for instance) because I guess no-one wants an \"emotional\" surgeon operating on them do they? Anyway, the She Devil was totally devoid of any talent or competence but with an opinion of herself that must almost have made her head explode. 10 of us filed a complaint against her whereupon she made our lives very, very difficult while scratching and clawing to save her empty soul. It wasn't just us of course - most people in this corporation hated her and we therefore had tremendous support behind the scenes pushing ahead with our complaint. But the price we paid in terms of our physical and mental health was appalling. It is significant that - as far as we know - she was fired from the last four jobs she held and is more than likely continuing in the same vein given that a leopard never changes its spots!Since coming across so blatant a psychopath that even I couldn't gloss over, I have been absolutely fascinated by them, to the extent that I have just finished another book by M.E. Thomas (a pseudonym) who is apparently a diagnosed sociopath. If you are interested in this, it is quite an eye-opening read! (I suppose I must have looked like a bit of a nutter on the bus reading this too, come to think of it!)The main characteristics (in a very small nutshell) are lack of empathy, lack of remorse, an opinion of themselves and their skills which rarely has any correlation to reality, an enormous sense of entitlement ... and the list goes on and on! Of course, just like autism, there is a spectrum and I suppose we are all on that scale to some degree or another, but if you ever have the misfortune to end up dealing with someone like we did, this book is an absolute revelation!My dad used to call them \"the wise boys\", with their fancy qualifications who used to fly in to a company, throw everything into upheaval, destroy the staff's health and mental stability while wreaking havoc on the company itself, and then fly off leaving a trail of destruction behind them, all the while chalking up another notch on their CV. So if you ever see the mad witch on her broomstick flying over your house with her long blond hair trailing behind her - run for your lives. She is worse than something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe and she just ain't worth it!"},
{"title": "Giggling schoolgirls!", "date": "Wednesday 18 October 2017", "text": "There is a free newspaper available here in Geneva every day called \"20 Minutes\". You can always find a copy on the bus or pick one up at the bus stop. I usually don't bother reading it but this morning I didn't feel like reading my book so I grabbed a copy of the 20 Minutes to read. Ha! In yesterday's post I mentioned that we had visited the local exhibition centre on Sunday for the \"Creative Hobbies\" fair. Well yesterday, they had a practice drill at said exhibition centre to put police, firemen, first responders etc. through their paces in the event of a terrorist event. Apparently it involved over 700 people, and while I'm sure the \"hostages\" were all volunteers one chap said what a really weird feeling it was with people hiding wherever they could and some feeding information on the \"terrorists\" to emergency services on their phones. Uughh, it's the kind of place that wouldn't have many hiding places to be honest, but the thought of getting caught up in something like that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Having watched another episode last night of \"Saving Lives at Sea\" (the fabulous RNLI volunteers in the UK), I can only say how eternally grateful we should all be to our emergency personnel!On another note, and still on the bus this morning, there were two sets of schoolgirls who giggled non-stop from the time they got on until they got off about 20 minutes later! I don't knock 'em because I was one of them many, many moons ago. Oh, how I remember sitting with my friend Vanessa at about age 15 and giggling all the way into town. We must have driven people mad but whadda ya wanna do? That's what schoolgirls do!I remember one time I was going to compete in a swimming gala and Van was coming into town with me to watch. In those days you got a paper ticket before you got on the bus (if I remember right) and occasionally an inspector (we called them \"conductors\") would get on and check that everyone had a ticket. Well Van and I were giggling away and she would fold her ticket, then bite down on it with her teeth, then fold it again, giggle some more and so on. Eventually a conductor got on and asked for our tickets. I had mine of course, but she looked up at him all horrified and just said \"I ate it!\" And I confirmed to him that she had indeed done just that! He must have been so baffled he just let her get away with it and didn't charge her for another ticket!Then another time, I was sitting with Van on the bus coming home from college. We were sitting on the side seats and I had my arm bent at the elbow hanging on to a support pole. Anyway, a man got on and accidentally stood on my foot.  As he leaned over to apologize to me a stream of drool came out of his mouth, went down my sleeve and pooled in the crook of my elbow. I didn't want to say anything in order not to embarrass him but trying not to giggle with her tittering away by my side almost gave me a coronary!Another time we caught the late night bus from town back home around 11 pm on a Saturday night, I guess. Of course in the UK we have the double deckers and this particular route had a nasty left turn over quite a sharp bump which made the bus really keel over to the right (since we drive on the left in England). We always sat up top at the back on this particular route (being connaisseurs of that left turn) and this particular night a man who was a little bit the worse for wear sat in the seat immediately in front of us. Well he must have dozed off because when we went round that bend he fell right off his seat and landed on his backside in the middle of the aisle! On hearing our stifled guffaws behind him he turned round and glared at us and said \"I suppose you think that was bleedin' funny don't you?\" All we could do was say \"Who me? No, not me, I didn't think that was funny at all, did you Van?\" and then try to stifle our giggles for the rest of the way home.And finally, one day as we were on the bus going to college, Van was sitting nearest the window and I was sitting in the aisle seat. It was fairly crowded but there were still some seats further up the bus. Eventually a man got on and stood right next to me, leaning up against my left side. I didn't say anything but Van tried to shuffle over nearer to the window, so I followed suit. She then tried to shuffle a bit more but obviously there is a limit to how much you can \"shuffle over\"! She was again trying to stifle her giggles but I had no idea why, until the man got off and she said \"he does that all the time, stands right next to a young girl and rubs himself up and down on her arm!!!!!!!\" He had already done it to her so she knew what I was feeling (frankly at this point I could almost tell what religion he was). After that we looked out for him and would break into fits of giggles every time he got on the bus. I only hope he knew why we were laughing, is all I can say. Oh happy days ......."},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 17 October 2017", "text": "What a glorious weekend that was. Perfect autumn weather and temperatures with just the right mixture of relaxation and getting out and about thrown in.I have mentioned before that my friends and I frequently go to the theatre to watch what is a very good and very large anglophone drama group. They put on some fabulous stuff and we get to watch plays and musicals that we probably wouldn't otherwise get to see. Simply Theatre is the kids group - ages 18 and under - so when I saw an ad for their latest show - The Magic Toy Shop - my friends and I booked for last Saturday. The show started at 17.30h so we figured it was going to be the younger kids performing, but in fact it turned out to be a simple two-man show, but which was excellent. The main protagonist, \"Charlie\", went to the magic toy shop as he wanted to be come a wizard's apprentice. The wizard - who conveniently enough was looking for an apprentice (how about that for a coincidence) - decided to set Charlie some tasks to see if he was worthy of becoming his apprentice! It took place on the small stage at the Academy itself and as people walked in Charlie and the Wizard greeted everyone and somehow managed to make a running list of the names of all the \"important\" people - i.e. the little kids - as they walked in. They called out to the kids by name asking for their help and put on what turned out to be such a great little show. We were the only ones without a little kid with us but it was so, so worth it. All the more so for me as I had a real little giggler sitting next to me and it was a joy to listen to her!Then on Sunday, our local town held, for the first time, the Foire des Loisirs Créatifs (Creative Hobbies' Fair, I guess). This Fair was usually held in either Lyon or Grenoble but apparently having it in my local town was a roaring success, by all accounts.  Here's hoping it will be repeated. Not exactly a big Fair but good nonetheless. Rather foolishly I bought myself a couple of cross-stitch projects. Goodness knows when I will get time to do those but they were so pretty I just couldn't resist. And, being goody two-shoes, my friend and I decided to walk there and back so got in a 90-minute walk to boot.In fact, the ladies from my patchwork group were exhibiting some of their work there also and it really was very impressive!On a totally different subject, a colleague hopped on the same bus to work as me this morning and we got chatting, as you do. Her mom and dad are over from England for three weeks and she was telling me that the neighbours' kids (aged about 7 or 8 I think) asked if they could \"borrow\" dad to take him to school for show and tell! Dad went along very happily, said there were some \"bright little buttons\" in those classes and was delighted to be prize exhibit no. 1 as the \"funny little foreign man\". I told her she should have sent her mom in too as her mom is German, but they thought  \"one funny little foreigner\" was probably enough for one day. He was really tickled when the kids asked if we had wild animals in England - he should have said yes, lions and tigers and bears, oh my! But I thought it was great that he went along with it all so willingly.Which got me to thinking ..... year ago, my husband's nephew mailed to us here in France a \"flat Stanley\" (only this guy was \"flat Justin\" - for obvious reasons). For those that don't know, flat Justin was a school project that the kids sent wherever they could to friends and family all over to see how far he could travel in the given length of time. In our case flat Justin was about 4 feet tall and folded up nicely into an envelope to make his travel plans easier. We took flat Justin down to our favourite local restaurant and got the owners and kitchen staff to pose, somewhat emabarrasingly, for a photo with flat Justin before he was sent back to his home in Pittsburgh. Aaah, the things you do for kids eh!Flat Justin"},
{"title": "Literally speaking", "date": "Friday 13 October 2017", "text": ".... otherwise known as \"say what you mean\"!As I mentioned in a previous post, I flew out to Greece to meet up with Steve, a friend I met in Peru almost five years ago. We have remained in touch (albeit sporadically) over the years with him coming out to Geneva to visit me for a weekend a couple of years ago, and then again over Christmas 2016. The weather cooperated on that last trip and we had a good laugh together, I guess because we have a similar, very silly sense of humour!I remember one day as we were driving somewhere Steve mentioned that he would shortly be visiting a friend who had a lovely house called The Round House \"because it's round\"! Bearing in mind we really didn't know each other that well I suppose it just isn't done to look at someone and say \"ya don't say\" (meaning \"you pillock\"!). I just laughed and he realized what he had said. Then when we were in Greece last week, he got talking to a couple in the lovely restaurant I mentioned in my previous post. He was telling them about a place we had \"discovered\" (another restaurant I think), and it would be easy for them to find \"because the walls are white\"! Again, I'm thinking \"you pillock\". What I actually said was \"we're in Greece, all the walls are white\"! At which point the lady he was speaking to burst out laughing!I suppose I could be accused of being a bit \"literal\" myself too though, because I remember giving  one of my recipes to a colleague and saying \"first open the packet\"!!!! (If you are interested, I mix raw potato cubes with oil and a packet of dried onion soup mix. In the oven for about 45 minutes and \"bingo\" you have lovely oniony-tasting potatoes). Anyway, I digress, but somehow I don't think it was necessary to tell her to \"first open the packet\"!Listening to Steve and his brother talk in Greece I think I know where he gets his \"literal\" thinking from - it seems it's genetic! Their dad was Polish and had fought in the Free Polish Army during WW2.  After the war he was given the choice of going back to Poland, or emigrating to either Canada or Britain. He chose Britain, where he met his future wife and the rest, as they say, is history!Anyway, they were both laughing at how dad used to make his sandwiches for his lunch - how he would carefully spread whatever he was having on them to all four corners of the perfectly aligned sliced bread leaving nary an inch of bread uncovered.  Well one day, having bought a pair of shoes which were marked \"waterproof\", dad decided to find out if that was really true.  So he took a washing up bowl, filled it with water, put his shoes in and carefully weighted each shoe down with a can of baked beans - and then left them there to see if they really were \"waterproof\"!  I thought this was hilarious and asked if I could put it on my blog - to which the response was \"of course\".  So, in tribute to Marian W - also known as Charlie the Weaver (I guess we Brits couldn't get our heads around the name \"Marian\" for a man), I give you the saga of the waterproof shoes!Marian W ,,,... otherwise known as Charlie the Weaver!"},
{"title": "Now what have I let myself in for!!", "date": "Wednesday 11 October 2017", "text": "I got back off holiday late on Sunday night. Monday was back to work and Monday night was the \"annual general meeting\" of our patchwork club. It's funny really because the other sewing club I go to on Monday nights (I alternate) is pretty much tea and a natter - oh and you can bring a bit of sewing along if you want. But this one is much more serious. The lady president takes her job very seriously and in fairness does an excellent job. Now I had had about five hours sleep in the last 48 hours and really did not want to go but ... I also don't think it's right to just not show up to these things. Anyway, Marie droned on and on (in my exhausted opinion) about the different projects they would tackle during the year, plans for the club's 20th anniversary, the date for the Christmas dinner and so on. Also (and this is where she is so dynamic) she was sounding out the ladies' opinions on which kinds of techniques to develop over the year and any courses they would like to invite guest presenters to give. I am very much a beginner and haven't heard of half of these techniques and since 95% of this stuff takes place during the day when I am at work, as you can imagine I was starting to nod off. Then, towards the end, Marie pulled a rabbit out of her hat and, holding up a leaflet, asked what the ladies thought about maybe attending the annual quilting exhibition at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham, England next year!At that I stopped snoring and just gave a little laugh. When she asked why I laughed I told her that I grew up 20 minutes from the NEC and knew the place like the back of my hand. In fact, I had considered attending this exhibition this August but didn't get my act together in time to book flights. The NEC is a huge exhibition centre built right next to Birmingham airport and the quilting exhibition is apparently the biggest in Europe, hosting (I think) over 300 exhibitors and with 700 quilts being presented in competition last year!So on a very preliminary show of hands around eight people said they might be interested, particularly now that \"we have someone who speaks English going with us and who knows the area\"! My mind immediately went into a mixture of panic and delirium, thinking \"oh we could go to Stratford or Warwick Castle or to the Cotswolds\" and so on and then I was hit with the thought of dragging 10 elderly French ladies round a massive conference centre and on an off the planes etc. (\"Do we have to get pounds? How much is that in 'real' money? Ooooh isn't it scary driving on the left!\" and so on). I tell you, I was so dog tired when I got home but still I couldn't sleep - I was having dreams of being chased round the NEC by elderly French ladies with zimmer frames.  Then of course I was dumb enough to mention that Birmingham had a massive \"rag\" market that was only 30 minutes away by train. Looking it up it has over 350 stalls (not all fabric stalls) but an absolute treasure trove of a market, so again my dreams switched to nightmares of losing an old biddy somewhere in central Birmingham!My mind has calmed down a bit now, probably due to a decent night's sleep, but it could prove an interesting weekend if we manage to pin numbers/flights/hotel rooms down properly.  We'll see!One of the many, many halls at the NECBirmingham rag market - in the BullringOn a totally different subject, Tuesday night is the night our local food bank is open to its customers, so Tuesday is the night I take down my donations whenever I have a full crate of goods to donate. The door opens at 7 pm so I make sure to go around 8.30 pm in order not to embarrass any recipients (I have recognized a few people on occasion). When I got there last night the lady looked at me and said how great it was to see me because \"take a look at our empty shelves\"! I knew from last year that around this period their shelves really empty out as they are only allowed to collect donations outside supermarkets once a year at the end of October. There really was hardly anything left at all! The one older gent explained that they had collected less than expected last year and that there had been more and more demand so they were really hurting at this point to the point that the ladies had had to go out and spend some of the centre's financial donations in order to buy groceries. I was thinking maybe €500 or something like that but no, they spent €100 because they really had to try to eke out their finances!!!! Going down to the food bank always makes me eternally grateful to be in the financial situation that I am, but having just got back off holiday in Greece and to already be thinking about maybe going to Birmingham for what will be an expensive weekend at the NEC, really put into context exactly how lucky I and so many of us are! I make no apologies for my situation, but I sure am grateful for it!"},
{"title": "And so it's back to work I go ......", "date": "Monday 9 October 2017", "text": "Well that went quickly! Crikey! Still, even though time flew by it was a lovely, restful few days - well that is until I spent all those hours flying back! I mean, what kind of idiot flies west to the UK in order to fly back east to Greece? Me I guess. Problem is, in order to get into the same hotel as Steve I had to fly out of the UK so I ended up spending two nights in London before and after my trip. We'll have to re-think that next time, I think.Still, it was lovely. I have always liked Greece but being able to go at the end of the summer season is wonderful. Nowhere near as hot as it can get in July and August and no crowds! What's not to like. The hotel was ok although had I been on my own I would not have chosen self-catering. But in the end, that was fine too and although I had no intention of \"self-catering\" anything, not having meals included in the deal meant that we avoided the breakfast, lunch and dinner crush in a buffet-style hotel.  Steve and I stayed on Pefkos Beach in one hotel and his brother and his wife a little further down the road. They were a lovely couple and while we didn't spend our days with them we went out with them a couple of times for dinner and/or drinks (and while both the men wanted to watch the rugby league final towards the end of our stay since I like rugby too that wasn't a problem). The other thing is his brother and wife were both sun birds and spent most days by the pool, while Steve and I dashed from cover to cover trying to stay out of the sun. I suppose in the end, we just did what they did all day except we did it in the shade.We decided to avoid organized day trips because Rhodes really isn't very big and you can get around on the local buses anyway. I think the organized trip to Lindos was something like €40 and we paid €6 each on the local bus (a 15 minute trip). And oh how lovely Lindos was.It's not very big at all but has streets like rabbit warrens full of lovely touristy shops. Add in some lovely spice smells and you could be in the souk in Marrakech! I bought a few table cloths/runners while I was there to brighten up my house. I'm sure Steve was thrilled being dragged round all the shops but being the good sport that he is he just kept nodding his head diligently and saying \"that's nice\". Aaah, love him!We stumbled across a lovely little restaurant which really drew me because of all the greenery inside and it was a gem. There were only three couples in there (all Brits) and we quickly got chatting to the one couple. They were, I guess, in their 70s and I suspect the man was a widower as he had a ring on his wedding finger.  They explained that they were a couple - with him living in Edinburgh and her living in Brighton and they flew up and down the country regularly to meet up, and then shooting off to (usually) Greece or Spain when the fancy took them. The background music was lovely and at one point the man took her hand and waltzed her gently round the restaurant. It really was sweet to behold!The owner spent much time chatting with all three couples and when we had finished our lovely main course, he came over with complementary cheese cake for us, followed by limoncello, followed by a shot of something else ..... Steve couldn't believe how friendly they were. In fact, we found everyone to be friendly and hard-working, but you certainly got an earful about \"those b\"\"\"stards in government\" if you had the inclination to listen (we did).Our regular waiter at the hotel told us that 64% of the population had voted not to accept the bail out plan proposed by the European Union so \"what did that jerk of a Prime Minister do? He double-crossed us! At least in the UK you had a vote on Brexit and went with it - that's what democracy is all about!\" That was pretty much the sentiment we got from other Greeks too. Our waiter told us that out of season he worked on a small fishing boat with a licence to sell his catch in Lindos twice a week, but the cost of that licence had gone up from €700 last year to €1,800 this year with nothing in return. He worked extremely long days and said that while he was still a young man he could do it, but he was worried about what would happen later. Again, this sentiment was repeated by anyone we spoke to. There was also much resentment that the islands brought in tourist revenue which went straight back to Athens and none of it was reinvested on the islands!Anyway, back to the plot. We spent a couple of days at the hotel reading (or yacking really - we could both yack for England) and then decided to catch another local bus to visit the old town of Rhodes. We spent a couple of very pleasant hours having lunch in the shade of a wonderful old tree before visiting the old town (more shopping for me, more bag-carrying for Steve).Rhodes' old townThen on my final night, dinner with Steve's family (the food was invariably good) and back to dear old Blighty for my flight back to Geneva next day.Dinner on the last nightThe weather in Geneva is glorious, but after the temperatures in Greece I feel like I need my long-johns on! And 6 a.m. sure comes early when you have to get up to go to work ....."},
{"title": "When did England become so efficient?", "date": "Friday 29 September 2017", "text": "I apologize in advance for any fat fingered typing on my iPad but I am ensconced in my room at London airport ahead of my flight tomorrow to Greece.Everything went so smoothly getting to Geneva today for my flight except .... I planned to park at work for free then catch the bus to the airport. I had looked up the bus timetable and planned it with Swiss precision until I was almost at work when the pillock in front of me slammed his brakes on to get a parking place. Thank god I didn't hit him - but then he changed his mind, pulled out and turned up towards our underground staff parking lot. Pulled into the entrance and then obviously realized it was private parking and 10 cars had to reverse back up the ramp to let him out. I know it could happen to anyone but the net result was that I made it out of the parking lot just in time to see the exhaust smoke of my bus as it pulled out and left. I think I said something like \"oh dear\" (or words to that effect) and had to wait in the glaring sun for another 30 minutes for the next bus. I can't stay mad for long thankfully and tend to be so clinically early that it wasn't a problem really and I was at the airport in good time. I guess it has now become one of my holiday treats to have a wonderfully fresh shrimp and salmon salad while waiting for the flight to be called. Wonderfully tasty but by gosh you almost have to sell a kidney to pay for it. Still, like I said, just consider it part of the holiday I say.While we were waiting to board a couple behind me asked their young son - who was, I would guess, about six - where his jacket was. Of course the answer was \"errrr I don't know\"! Long and short of it was the lad had lost two jackets in two days. Dad gave him a \"stern talking to about taking responsibilty\" but mom frankly went ballistic. I know it's frustrating but I had one of those kids and I think at that age you just have to watch 'em like a hawk. I understand her frustration but in the end what can you do except stop at the lost and found on the way back. As I say, I'm laid back but in the end they grow up and either deal with their own lack of responsibilty (it's called growing up) or ya marry em off to someone who'll take over where you left off! That's what I did (just kidding Lily)!Getting through passport control to leave Geneva now takes longer because Schengen states are being more thorough but the flight was perfect and passport control in London just made me realize I was chez moi or \"home\" again. Crowds of people were flooding to the passport controls and there were people there to direct you if you had non-EU passports, non-electronic passports or e-passports. A couple of French people came through the passport lane with just their French ID cards and were very efficiently whisked off to another lane. Then there was the chap guiding people into the correct lanes but admonishing people to \"stop smiling cos your holidays are over and it's back to work on Monday\"! It was, as I say, very efficient and very good natured and I had forgotten how charming that could be when dealing with masses of people.  To top it all  off my bag was first off the carousel so I would guess I was done and dusted in all of 10 minutes!Just a 400 metre walk and I was at my hotel and I would say I was checked in in under five minutes. I've just had a rather good dinner and off to my room to read. But my original point was, I would say 80 per cent of the workers at the hotel are Eastern European and they hustle (as do the Brits here but they are in the minority)! So I just hope the powers that be negotiatiating Brexit realize this (they will) and how much the hotel and agriculture industry rely on them. Of course I'm not a disinterested party either being a Brit living in France - I don't think the egghead negotiators can afford to get this wrong! I pray I'm right.Anyway I'm looking forward to what must be my idea of heaven that is a full English breakfast tomorrow and probably another exorbitant shrimp salad while waiting for my flight out of London! Oh my poor diet - looks like it just got shot to pieces!"},
{"title": "6 lbs down!", "date": "Thursday 28 September 2017", "text": "Of course, if I'd gone with yesterday's reading I would be 7 lbs down, but ..... oh well. Not that I'm complaining of course but I still feel I have a few more pounds to lose before I actually believe it, because of all the fluctuations my body seems to go through. I was so, so good last week and exercised like crazy (wasn't bad with the food either) and while I don't think exercise really makes you lose weight (unless you are really exercising, not just piddling about like I do), every time I exercise my stomach goes down as I just seem to lose the bloat immediately. Oddly enough I am looking forward to getting back to it - how weird is that!Still, that will have to wait until I'm back off holiday on 9th October, 'cos guess which lucky beggar is off to Pefkos (Rhodes)? Yay me! I'll probably not be able to post much while I'm away (you know, fat fingers on a skinny iPad and all that) but I'm sure I'll have plenty of gossip when I get back.Aaaaannnnd the weather is supposed to be good over there too, so what with that and all the lovely food I'm not exactly expecting to come back sylphlike! I have always loved travelling and while I certainly do travel I feel I don't do enough of it, particularly now that I am footloose and fancy free. For example, my (now retired) boss and his wife have invited me to stay with them in Edinburgh! They have a beautiful place and would happily show me around, so why haven't I done it yet? I think I'll take them up on it next spring if I can. I don't care about the weather (being used to the rain) so any good weather I might get would only be a plus.  We'll see.Oh, and I just had to mention a lovely interview I saw with Mel Brooks yesterday. He is currently in London for the opening of his new production of the \"Young Frankenstein\".  It stars (amongst others) Ross Noble who bears an uncanny resemblance to Marty Feldmann and is a comedian I really enjoy. The stars of the show were bantering back and forth with Mel and it was a delight to watch, all the more so since he is 91 and still as funny as ever and sharp as a tack. I have always enjoyed his madcap humour so if the show takes off (which I think it will) maybe I will try to fit in a flying visit to London just to catch it.  Anyway, as I said, things will probably be quiet from me for a short while so until next time ....."},
{"title": "How to stay young", "date": "Thursday 21 September 2017", "text": "..... is the title of a BBC series I came across last week. The second episode was last night and I have to say it was pretty interesting. It had nothing to do with miracle creams and liposuction and so on, but was an interesting experiment aimed at the \"hidden\" dangers within our bodies and courses of action to do something about it.Each programme follows the story of three volunteers, mostly in their 40s and 50s from what I can see, who agree to follow a 12-week programme devised to tackle problems that are causing them to have bodies which are biologically older than their actual age - which I guess could probably include most of us, unless we are ultra-fit and healthy. Well it definitely includes me! They start off putting the volunteers through a series of tests to assess their percentage body fat, their strength, their blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels and so on, and then based on statistics for others the same age, the \"guinea pigs\" were shown the difference between their actual birth ages and their body's biological age. As you can imagine, if they had agreed to participate in this experiment it was because all these people had \"issues\", but to be honest, not obviously so. One lady was 57 and very slim and so was shocked when her percentage body fat showed up as 48% (I think the maximum should be no higher than 25%). She admitted she was lazy - for instance she said she would drive to the nearest shop which was \"minutes away\", and indeed when the presenter asked her to walk with him to the shop and timed it it turned out it was 1 minute and 20 seconds away on foot!  According to the strength tests she was in the 3 percentile for muscle strength - that is to say, weaker than 97 other people her age out of a hundred - and her biological age indicator showed her to have the body of a 75 year old!Another man was 51 and obviously overweight - although again, not excessively so. He was a chef but said that chefs often don't have the time to eat properly so he spent his time picking at fries, eating pies - and also admitted he loved his beer. His biological age worked out to 90 - again another shocker. So the three guinea pigs were put on a 12-week programme to address their various issues - one lady had depression, another had sleep problems - none of it was about losing weight for the sake of it. Many of the techniques used in the programme were of course similar - walking for an hour a day would probably never do anyone any harm would it! And at the end of the 12 weeks they revisted all the tests they had done and in every case, their baseline figures had improved. All that in 12 weeks! It was very motivating, I can tell you, and they all looked to have gotten some \"ooomph\" back. Of course most of them also lost weight but they never announced what their weight loss was because that was not what they were focusing on. If you think a 51 year old with a 90 year old body was shocking, apparently next week they will showcase \"the worst age gap\" they have had on the programme, so that should be interesting.I hate to think where I would be on that scale - it would be interesting to find out though. On that note, I have done well so far this week with exercise (five times since Monday). My fitbit already confirmed that I am pretty sedentary, averaging only around 6,000-7,000 steps a day if I don't do any extra exercise. If I want to make it to the 10,000 recommended steps it means I have to add in at least an hour of walking per day - which in my case means lunchtimes, because I'm not getting up any earlier to fit in extra exercise (and in any case I am not a morning person) and lunchtime is the easiest time for me. Anyway, so far so good, and if nothing else I am already enjoying it.  I'm looking forward to next week's programme in any case.On another note, I have been a busy little bee in the kitchen lately. I made pumpkin soup, ham and split pea soup and Dorset apple cake this weekend. On top of that, since Sunday's vide-grenier was a bit of a wash-out my neighbours brought round some of the rather nice looking sausages that were left over from the BBQ stall. So last night I threw together what I am laughingly calling my version of \"cassoulet\", using the sausages and a few odds and sods I had hanging around. Threw it all into the slow cooker this morning and we will see what it tastes like tonight, 12 hours later. I suspect the person who \"invented\" cassoulet will be spinning in his grave though!"},
{"title": "The Giants are coming ....", "date": "Tuesday 19 September 2017", "text": "..... and I'm gonna miss 'em! Bugger it! In all my time in Geneva I have never seen this display (although I think they did visit once before) and I will be away on vacation when they visit!  Darn and drat!  From what I can tell they are magical visitors who will shortly show up in Geneva \"owing to an incredible alignment of stars and a shower of meteorites rushing to earth.\" Quite coincidentally the city's Mayor had been forewarned that the clock at the Museum of Watchmaking had stopped for a few seconds, as had all Swiss watches. Happily a few seconds later, all was back to normal .... except everyone had lost a few minutes.  Fortunately, the world’s greatest scientists, gathered at the Geneva research center and working on the acceleration of the particles of the Higgs Boson, discovered through ancient writings the possible existence of Giants living behind the Planck wall, before the Big Bang. After intense study of these writings, they have concluded that Geneva will be visited next week by Great Grandma Giant and Little Giant.  While Great Grandma Giant can speak, only her Lilliputian helpers can understand her, so they have to come along for the visit!I believe Great Grandma is 8 metres tall and has been sighted in other cities around the world, but this is the first time she will make an appearance in Geneva. I am sooooo sorry to be missing this as it really is right up my alley - just like Les Flottins at New Years. Oh well, the thought of flying off to Rhodes assuages my angst somewhat but really, I would just love to have seen this. And as I have said before, I am so grateful that there are people around with the enthusiasm, ability and dedication to put these kinds of shows together!In other news, I weighed myself again on Monday and again hadn't lost a single pound. I'm not totally surprised though as last week was hectic with meeting-related stuff and I got out of my routine. It's a good job I lost 3 lbs the first week I guess as that still makes it 3-for-3, but seriously, I have to get moving on this weight-loss business.This weekend was quiet-ish with nothing planned (I love weekends like that). Even though the weather wasn't great I still got outside and hacked back bushes and trees to my heart's content - I told you, I love this cold weather!!! Then on Sunday my village held its annual vide-grenier (car boot, flea market??? - attic emptier in French), which, sadly, was a real disappointment. There were hardly any stalls there, but then they had forecast bad weather so you can't blame people for not wanting to set up stalls in the cold and rain can you. The sad thing is though, in the end the weather was fine and sunny, if cold, so it could have gone so much better, but hats off again to the volunteers who pull these things together.MairieThe view looking at the Mairie in my little village is absolutely spectacular and I had always wanted to try and capture it (you can see way into the alps at the back) but all I managed to get on Sunday was this shot with the clouds blocking out the mountains. Oh well, another time I guess.Very poor turn out for the vide-grenierAfter our short stint at the vide-grenier, I had seen a patchwork/embroidery exhibition in a local château which was on its last day so we decided to give it a shot - and we definitely weren't disappointed (to be honest, we never are)! It was held in what must have been, at one time, a barn belonging to the Château, but the barn was beautifully renovated and of course the needlework was oh so beautiful!Château de Chilly - now a restaurantThe symbol of FranceLes demoisellesBirds of paradiseThere were many more, larger and more traditional patchworks but with the lighting in the barn I wasn't able to do them justice, but I think you can probably get the general idea of just how much work goes into this.  Funnily enough, my patchwork club started up last Monday and my other sewing club started up again last night (I alternate Monday nights), and last night Thérèse, who has been the \"Présidente\" for quite a few years, asked for a volunteer to take over. Now I am one of the few ladies working full-time and I have the commute from hell, plus I have only been going - I think - three years, so I really don't think I would be the best person to take over. She said there's not much to do ..... and I'm not totally clear what all it involves - but nobody else would volunteer. I didn't volunteer either (for the above reasons) but I may have to re-think. She said there are two meetings you have to attend each year (they only last about an hour) and then ..... everyone has a drink afterwards - so guess who might be volunteering after all!!! Anything for a free drink! So from now I should like to be referred to as \"Madame la Présidente\". Yay, get me. How can they possibly turn down my request for French citizenship after this!!!!And finally, I mentioned in a previous post how useless my brother is with technology. Well I had spoken to him on Sunday and he was a bit down (there are days like that I guess) but yesterday at work I got a Whatsapp message from him saying \"had a great night's sleep, feeling better today, miss you and can't wait to see you again\". Oh dear, he screwed up again (obviously thinking he was talking to his lady friend). I just wrote back and said \"glad to hear it but you might want to get your glasses fixed\". Still haven't heard back from him!"},
{"title": "No change!", "date": "Thursday 14 September 2017", "text": "I actually did do my Monday weigh-in on Monday but have been running around like crazy so haven't had time to post for a couple of days. No change in weight sadly - although I'm actually a little surprised it hasn't gone up because we had a four-day weekend last weekend (the last public holiday until Christmas) and I really didn't make much of an effort with the diet, to be honest. I had plans to do this or that and so on but in the end did pretty much bugger all. I had made an appointment to get my car in for a service on the Thursday since that way I wouldn't have to take a day off, so that pretty much put paid to any running around on Thursday. After that I just pottered really, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing but sometimes I do get annoyed with myself for not taking advantage of these days off to go somewhere or do something out of the ordinary. Oh well, I guess my body was trying to tell me something because frankly I could sleep for England at the moment.A funny thing happened on the Wednesday evening though. As I was sitting down reading there was an incoming phone call from the Pittsburgh area - a number I didn't recognize - but I picked it up anyway just in case there were problems in the ex-in-law family. As I picked up my ex started speaking to me in French and prattling away. I tried several times to explain to him that it wasn't necessary to speak to me in French and that I wasn't Jen but ..... So that wrong number meant I got to speak to my ex for about 20 minutes.  And guess what, he's (I guess \"they\") coming back over in November for the Marine Corps Ball to meet up with an old friend!!! Yikes. Not that there is any reason I have to see him anyway, but ..... he must be haemorraghing (sp?) money at the moment. Anyway, we chatted a bit and he mentioned something about our youngest. I told him I helped him out financially since he earns less than the minimum wage, being an apprentice. Well he usually makes around the minimum wage as he does a lot of overtime, but he's not exactly rolling in money. I had told my son I would take care of his car as long as he was an apprentice so recently had to put new tyres on as they had worn, and then on Monday had to spend € 900 to replace what I think is called the cam shaft in English. I know it's expensive but apparently if that screws up you can kiss your car goodbye - and round where we live you really can't get by without a car. On top of that I'm also paying for his schooling and other stuff so ex asked me why he (the ex) wasn't sending money - so I said, I don't know, why aren't you helping your kid out? Sorry, I just couldn't help myself. I know what he makes as a pension and he makes as much as I do in salary so why he can't throw a couple hundred dollars his kid's way is beyond me, all the more so because I am on my own with the same kinds of bills but he and gf both have incomes. We'll see I suppose, but I won't hold my breath!I stayed up as late as I dared on Sunday night watching Hurricane Irma. Gosh, what a frightening thing Mother Nature can be. I have a dear friend in Havana and haven't heard from her but I have no reason to believe she is other than OK. She is Irish and married to a Cuban and they usually go to Ireland for the summer as Cuba is just too hot. Trouble is, they have an elderly dog and the past couple of years she has not wanted to leave the dog, so unless the dog has since died I suspect she will have been in Havana. Those poor people on the islands though, some of whom lost everything. Then I have friends in Fort Myers (which is the reason I stayed up so late Sunday as the hurricane was working its way up from Naples). Mark was posting regular updates on FB and had retained his sense of humour because while they were expecting flooding, being at \"the nose-bleed-inducing height of 21 feet above sea level\" ...... they figured they would be ok! That's funny because they used to live over here in the alps and I, personally, live at over 2,400 feet! Still, I haven't heard word from him/them since so while I'm assuming they are ok I don't know how much damage they might have suffered (if any). Luckily my friend in central Florida reported back about 36 hours later to say they were fine, although there was quite a bit of damage and debris around. But, she had nothing but praise for the front-line workers who restored electricity in about 30 hours and were already removing debris. So while I am on that subject, Nathalie, shout out to you - I hope you and yours are ok!On another depressing note, yesterday was the first day of one of my meetings. The \"big\" meetings for me are July and December but these meetings are also important. I guess the team spends about 18 months preparing the meeting and then a delegation flies in from capital and the meeting takes place. Anyway, I left home at 6.30 a.m. in order to be well in time for any last minute things that might pop up before the meeting. Got stuck about 1 km from the border and then crawled into Switzerland, which was made all the more weird by the fact that traffic on Wednesdays is usually lighter. But not at bit of it yesterday. Eventually I managed to make it to the car park but then found out that the road up ahead was completely blocked by a horrendous accident and even the buses were being re-routed back into France!!! Crikey, so here's me thinking you work for 18 months to get the meeting ready and then show up late!!! But in the end, what can you do about it? It turns out there had been a fatal crash up ahead and I'm not quite sure how a single crash (at 6 a.m. no less) can close such a wide road but ..... Sadly, a young motorcyclist died in a head on collision with a car at exactly the same spot as the young female cyclist died in January. Absolutely tragic. In fact, there were two fatal motorcycle collisions in Geneva at around the same time here in Geneva which tends to put life and \"things\" in perspective, I can tell you. No-one is going to put on your gravestone \"was always on time for meetings\" are they? So in the end I just thought, to hell with it, every possible thing that could be done in advance I had already done so my colleagues would just have to pick up my files and trot on down to the conference centre. Quite by chance, I actually made it there only 10 minutes late (but three-and-a-half hours after I had left home), but again, the world wouldn't have stopped rotating if I hadn't would it. My colleague was telling me this morning that the young man killed was a colleague of her husband's, although he didn't know him very well as he was a relatively new recruit. Only 30 years old and there was talk that the driver of the car was drunk!!! At 6 a.m.!!! I guess we won't know the truth of that for some time!But not wanting to end on such a gloomy note, Sam was recounting her \"prat fall\" in her latest blog post - you know, that time when you went \"arse over tit\" (as my dad would say) in front of everyone. We've all done it I suppose so I was trying to think which one of my prat falls I would consider my most public, though not necessarily the most spectacular. And I came up with a time I was down in Annecy looking for a kind of small deckchair thingy for my garden. As I was wandering round I spotted exactly the thing so decided to try it out. When I sat down I went straight through the fabric of the chair and ended up getting wedged in the wooden frame! I had to call out to someone to help me up (it must have looked pretty funny to him though). But, I actually didn't break the chair - I reckon someone had either broken it and wrapped the fabric back over the wooden support or, more likely, had deliberately cut it through as the cut was very clean. Either way, I wasn't at my most elegant with my backside stuck in this deckchair I can tell you. Which brings to mind another incident which actually made the TV in the UK a few years ago. There was a rather large lady on a beach in the south of England (Brighton I think but can't be sure). Anyway, it was a pebbly beach and with her weight her chair started sinking further and further into the sand, all the while she was stuck in the chair. Unfortunately the tide started coming in so they had to call the emergency services to get her and/or the chair out of there. Now on the face of it, it was your typical fat lady funny with plenty of spectators, but while it indeed had the makings of comedy gold, I can't help feeling how dreadfully humiliated that poor lady must have felt. Urggghhh, life/people can be cruel sometimes can't it!"},
{"title": "3 lbs down!!", "date": "Monday 4 September 2017", "text": "Yipee, I'm down three pounds since my weigh-in last Monday. Although to be honest, I kinda wished I had taken yesterday's figures because I was down 6 lbs then!! Can you believe it! Well I guess it's probably just as well I didn't go with yesterday's reading because that would probably only mean I would be way back up again anyway, but it just goes to show (for me anyway) exactly how \"hormonal\" I am! I was feeling really bloated the other week when I hit my new \"high\" and last week I already felt so much better. I don't know if it was laying off the fruit, more exercise or a combination of the two, but either way I'll take it. I still don't think I'll feel like I'm actually \"losing weightt\" though until I get another 2 lbs or so off - what I would consider \"real weight\" as opposed to hormones. Still, I'll take 3 lbs.What's kinda stupid really, though, is the fact that I just signed up for a cake decorating course in October! I must be nuts, but to be fair, I have always wanted to know how to decorate cakes properly using fondant icing and I finally ferreted out a one-day course right down the road here in Geneva. In any case, I can always bring it in to work and it will go in about 10 minutes flat. Years ago, my dear old mom used to make her Christmas cake well in advance of Christmas and \"feed\" it regularly with whiskey. Then she would try to make a smooth icing topping but always cocked it up, at which point she roughed it all over with a fork and it became a \"snow scene\"! Ha! Not that we cared of course because it tasted good anyway, and it all tastes the same on the way down doesn't it.In a previous post I had talked about how my friend and I got all kitted out to \"go hiking\" when we went down to the Cascade de Seythened and the grotto, only to find that it was a 30-minute stumble through the grotto all told! Oh well, we didn't know did we, but I suspect we were a bit overdressed! My oldest son was four when his brother was born, and I remember when the baby was 11 days old we took a drive down to Sixt, Fer à Cheval. The oldest, André, decided that since he was the big boy now he wanted to go hiking with his dad, while mom stayed at the café with the baby. So we got him all dressed up with his boots and waterproof and his little backpack, and off went the Dynamic Duo - only to return again about 10 minutes later! I had only just had time to change the baby's nappy and get him re-dressed when they were back. Come to think of it, that just about sums up André's attitude to exercise even today I think, although I hear he was swimming every day before the wedding in an effort to lose some weight! The youngest and his girlfriend regularly go off hiking but not so much the oldest. Although it did used to tickle me when the kids would hike up to spend the night on the Plateau de Cenise. They would drive up as far as they could and then hike the last bit in order to camp out in their sleeping bags on top of the Plateau but - get this - Jordan would actually take a heavy wooden garden chair strapped to his back! When I told him at the very least to take a lightweight fold up fishing chair he said no as he preferred the wooden one! Oh to be young again. They go up there at least once a year though to sleep out (they don't even take a tent) but what is nice is that they always take flowers to scatter where the ashes of their friend Hugo were scattered seven years ago after he, and another friend, were killed in a car crash. It's so lovely that they still keep Hugo and Kevin in their hearts!Plateau de Cenise"},
{"title": "Throwing down the gauntlet!", "date": "Friday 1 September 2017", "text": "In my previous post I was talking about my latest gung ho decision to get into some kind of shape and lose weight. I have been thinking for some time that apart from the weight gain that seems to blight most women at menopause, I am pretty sure my love of fruit (and all things fructose-related) might have something to do with my weight gain. I know fruit is good for you but apparently the fructose can really play havoc with \"insulin response\" (I couldn't explain that all technically if I tried). I had been debating leaving the fruit alone to give it a try and this week I have done just that. It was difficult the first couple of day, what with all those beautiful peaches and nectarines at the market, but after seven days I am not craving it quite so much. I then decided to re-watch the Fixing Dad documentary (I have mentioned it before) and on the strength of that documentary I bought the book and re-read it last week. It's a very easy read and combining that information with the very-easy-to use \"Myfitnesspal.com\" it was quite an eye-opener for me to see just how much sugar I was getting through, even when, apparently, the calories were quite low. MFP recommends keeping to under 45g of sugar a day and I was going waaaay over that. So I have had to have a total re-think on that one. My first weigh-in will be on Monday so we'll see how that goes.I had also mentioned previously that I wanted to start getting out and exploring again, so when we had the post-wedding brunch in a small hotel about an hour from home I picked up some of their touristy info available in the reception. I had seen a leaflet on a waterfall called Cascade de Seythenex not too far from here which was located right next to a grotto. So a friend and I set off not really knowing what to expect but all equipped to \"hike a little\" and explore.Thankfully I wasn't expecting too much (and so I wasn't disappointed) but the waterfall was quite small and the grotto -  had we not been held back by the guide having to give explanations in both English and French - we could have done the whole thing in 15 minutes!  Oh well, at least we made the effort. That being said, it was a very pretty little spot and a glorious day so we didn't actually \"lose out\".I couldn't quite catch the zip-liner in the background!Pretty little \"dolls house\" (about 6 feet high) at the restaurantInside the grotto - we had to hunch down all the waySince I have a somewhat Gary Larsonesque sense of humour I thought the photos inside the grotto came out looking much like what an ear, nose and throat specialist much see every day! Well, actually, I have a pretty dirty sense of humour so that wasn't my first thought - but I'm trying to keep it classy here (fat chance)!  So while the waterfall and the grotto weren't exactly that exciting, coming back along Lake Annecy we took the lake road rather than the highway and I had my first, ever view of Talloires, which is at the opposite end of the lake from Annecy itself, and it was beautifuil! It is just a small town, as opposed to the tourist magnet which is Annecy, and I just loved it.When my brother came out in May and we took the dinner/dance boat trip on the lake, it must have been Talloires that they was all lit up at the far end - and very lovely it is too. I have to get my backside into gear one weekend before the weather turns and get back down there - I mean, it's only about 90 minutes away!And finally, an old friend from my first days here in Geneva called to let me know that she had bought tickets to the \"Simply Youthful Theatre\" (the under-18s anglophone theatre group here in Geneva) and did I want to go (she still supports them because her daughter used to be involved with them)?  You can tell we're getting old because we actually went to the three o'clock matinée!!! but that was intentional as (a) it wouldn't be so crowded (this particular theatre gets extremely hot) and (b) we had time to go out to dinner afterwards and have a good old chinwag.They were performing \"Legally Blond\". I had never seen the movie because it just wasn't the kind of thing that appealed to me but while it wasn't the best performance I have seen this group put on (that accolade is still unbeaten by their performance of The Addams Family), they were still very, very good, with the young Reese-Witherspoon lookalike hamming it up for all she was worth. Well done indeed kids.I suspect I might be a bit weird but I always feel rather glad when the summer months of July and August start drawing to an end. It's most likely because I don't like the heat, and although it's still in the 80s and 90s here at least in the mornings it is cooler. I guess I'm just not made for the tropics!!!Anyway, the last couple of days I have hopped off the bus on the bridge and walked the last 30 minutes to work - still a bit sweaty but nothing like it has been. Yesterday morning I was stopped by a man who asked me for some money \"for something to eat\". I hate it because I genuinely don't know what to do in these cases. He looked perfectly fine, not skinny or dirty and didn't seem to be a Roma but still I didn't know what to do so I just said \"no\". I never give to the Roma since the time I saw a woman sitting on the floor outside the supermarket with a sleeping baby in her arms (drugged up I suppose) and the next day I saw a different woman but with the same baby! So that's me done with them! A few years ago, when I was still driving all the way in to work, I would often see a Roma man panhandling at the traffic lights, a pitiful look on his face and pleading eyes. One day I was stopped at the red light where he was panhandling when a police car pulled up behind me. The pitiful look disappeared, the cap went back on his head and he trotted off down a side street, completely forgetting his limp! We do see quite a few obviously very disabled beggars here - but it makes me wonder if these countries are sending all their disabled beggars here or if there is just a disproportionate number of these people born disabled. I can't figure it out!On the other side of that story, a few years ago I was in a supermarket parking lot with my friend when a very skinny young lad came running up to us and asked for money. I said \"no\" and got in the car, but my friend said \"we both have sons his age and he looks like he hasn't eaten for weeks, what do you think?\" My response was \"what about drugs\" and she just said \"well let's give him the benefit of the doubt\", so we handed him five Swiss francs. I hope he got something to eat, and in the end I agreed with her. Then two Saturdays ago I was coming out of the tobacconists and saw a man, probably in his 40s, sitting on the floor begging. I don't know why but I just gave him one euro. Then last Saturday, coming out of the same tobacconist's I heard the emergency services pull up and they were ferrying the same man away on a stretcher - and that's when I noticed the empty booze bottle sitting beside him. I figured it was booze anyway with him and I honestly have no rhyme or reason as to when or to whom I give as I still haven't quite figured it out. I think I mentioned before that I pick up stuff every week when shopping and when I have a crateful I take it down to the local food bank. Well this week, as I went in to drop off my donation, the older chappie there gave me a big smile and said \"oh thank goodness, we are getting to that time of the year again, and the ladies have just been out shopping\". I noticed last year, towards November, they were starting to run short of supplies before their legally-allowed canvassing in front of the supermarket in October (they are allowed to do this two days a year). I will always continue to give to them (run by the splendid Red Cross volunteers), but as for individual beggars I just don't know.On another note, I sent off an email to the French authorities at the end of July asking what formalities I would have to complete to request French citizenship. I was starting to get the impression that France must be full up because four weeks later I still hadn't had a reply, but this week I finally got one. The in-joke is that if you want to invade France you do it between 12 and 2 pm because everyone will be at lunch (true) or during August because they are all on holiday - also seemingly true.  We'll see. I started reading up some of the stuff they request and yikes - just yikes. Of course I can get it all done but I just thank God I am \"administratively minded\" because that is one helluva lot of paperwork to ferret out, and even then, I am looking at about two years before it would go through (just in time for Brexit or thereabouts).And finally, now that the kids are starting back to school, the bloody traffic is already hell. It took me two hours to get home again the other night!! Anyway, as I mentioned above, I have been starting to try to get in some walking now that the weather is cooler, but last night it started to rain and of course the traffic as I was about to leave was already gridlocked. I work on the north side of Lake Geneva and the train station is also on this side, so my bus gets to snake its way up to the train station and then loop back round to come across the bridge to the south side. Just getting to the train station can sometimes take an hour (it only takes 25 minutes to walk it!!!) but you don't know what it's going to be like until you are already stuck on the bus. Anyway, last night I thought I might once again hop on the ferry boat to take me over the lake, but I missed it by about three minutes. So, I decided to just keep on walking and in 40 minutes I was past the train station, past the end of the lake and over the bridge!!! Not bad eh! I actually don't mind walking but realize it might be time to get some waterproof shoes if I'm going to keep this up! The farting noises coming from my wet shoes was quite embarrassing!Still, what with my son just turning 30 I realize I will be 59 at the end of this month!!! Which means ..... drum roll please .... bloody hell - 60 next year! And at the end of last week I was feeling really bloated (hormonal/water retention/just plain fat after pigging out?) and made the mistake of stepping on the scales. YIIIIIIKES! I had actually hit the exact weight I was when I was nine months pregnant with my second son 25 years ago and I had put on 23 kg with that pregnancy!!!!! Shame on me! So calculating my 59th birthday on 24 September 2017, ergo my 60th birthday on 24 September 2018(!!!) that would pretty well give me 52 weeks to lose a pound a week before my 60th right? (Actually, I don't need to lose 50 lbs as I was quite tiny up until about my 46th birthday (I know I weighed 66 kg then), but 40 lbs off wouldn't go amiss. I know people seem to want to get \"fit at 50\" but obviously that ship sailed aaaaages ago, but oh well, here goes. Let's see how I get on!"},
{"title": "Happy birthday André!", "date": "Wednesday 30 August 2017", "text": "Although we got together as a family the other Saturday night, today is my oldest son's actual 30th birthday. Wow, talk about weird - having such an old guy for a son!!! When did that happen?Anyway, he went from this:Ah, how cute!To this:And even cuter!Much love to them both and I hope the next 30 years bring you health, wealth and happiness!What a joke that is! I'm talking about my brother and teaching an old dog new tricks but, on an only slightly different level, I guess I could be talking about myself too. I can't say I am particularly interested in technology, don't have to have the latest gadgets and only learn how to use something when I either have to or it interests me. I learned how to use my new sewing machine because it interests me - my iphone - nah, not so much. In fact, the only reason I have an iphone is because the Blackberry I had kept dying on me so I thought I had better \"upgrade\". As to all the functionalities, I'm not that interested, although I have to admit it can be a bit embarrassing when I am out with friends and we try to set up another date - they all check on their phones and I have to think really hard to remember because my appointments are all written down in my diary! Of course I use a computer extensively for my work and am forever grateful that I know how to use it, but in and of itself, I'm embarrassingly disinterested.That being said, I positively look like Bill Gates compared to my brother (or both of them, in fact). When his wife died suddenly last year, in addition to being absolutely devastated P was also in the unfortunate situation of \"being the one who didn't know where anything was\". In fact he told me that one of the hardest things was figuring out such things as where she ordered the heating fuel from and so on, as he had no idea.  I do remember trying to get my ex involved in this kind of stuff but he too just wasn't interested. Every so often he would do his nut about how \"someone was obviously draining the bank account\" (I guess he meant me) because we had no money, but during our divorce I was able to demonstrate extensively just where all the money was going - and it sure as hell had nothing to do with me! Don't laugh but I also always did our accounts basically on the back of an envelope because I knew how much was going into the bank and I was supposed to know how much was going out. This didn't quite work out when I was married because he was constantly spending and I had no idea what on. Since I am on my own, however, I am pretty much spot on. (On a side note, my friend Steve, who came over from England over Christmas, laughed when I told him I do my accounts on the back of an envelope and have envelopes in a tin under my armchair with all the money divied up for various bills.  He was incredulous that \"you have a Swiss bank account and do your accounting on the back of an envelope\"!)  Note: it's not that kind of Swiss bank account but yep, that's about the truth of it!Anyway, back to my brother. When his wife died he didn't have a credit card, barely knew where the cheque book was, didn't have a mobile phone and couldn't use the internet or email.  He was supposed to go to Greece with me the first year after her death but wouldn't book it himself through the English travel agent because \"I don't have a credit card and I can't use email\"! So I booked it from over here using my credit card and then he wanted to send me a cheque in pounds!!! I told him they haven't used cheques in Switzerland since 2003 (true) and a cheque in sterling was no good to me. Talk about hard work - sometimes he's like pulling teeth!I used to phone him every week to see how he was getting on and after the first year, when all the \"first\" anniversaries were over he began to do a little better. He told me that he desperately missed female company and while he has made friends at his widows and widowers club, he misses being able to chat to a woman over dinner and so on. Not that anyone would or could ever replace his wife, but he just wanted some companionship - as do we all I suppose!Well finally he seems to have met someone who makes him laugh again. She is his age and also a widow. It is in the very early stages and they won't be seeing each other an awful lot since she lives 150 miles away, but so far they seem to be making each other happy.  His new lady friend, M, is also trying to drag him at least into the 20th century technology-wise (she can forget the 21st century I think), so he has now got a phone, can reply to an email as long as you write to him first, and got his first look at Facebook the other day and was stunned to see pictures of his recent trip out to France to visit me. He loved it. And most recently, M has got him turned on to Whatsapp so that the hours they spend on the phone every night are no longer costing them a fortune!So all seemed to be going along swimmingly - until last night, that is! I had just got into bed to read at 11 p.m. when I get a Whatsapp message from my brother.P - \"that thing I was saying about the shoes, why did you take them, now I have nothing\" (or something along these lines).Me - \"Say what?\"P - \"I only bought those shoes because I thought they were smart.  Blah, blah, blah\"Me - \"Come again? Hey, who do you think you have been chatting with for the last five minutes?\"P - \"You, M, of course!\"Me - \"Ha, bloody ha. You have been divulging your deepest secrets to your sister since, oh, about 11.05 pm!\"P - \"Oh, shit, please please forget we had this conversation. I'm going to take myself off and give myself a good talking to\"!Me - \"No worries, it's forgotten already. Night!\"Except I didn't forget it - I just wrote it down here so that I would never forget that conversation!  Tee hee! Actually there was nothing raunchy or super-secretive about the conversation at all (much to my disappointment) but he sure as hell wasn't making any sense to me, until I figured out what was going on when he sent a photo of what looked like an older lady and two younger females (turns out it was his lady friend and her granddaughters).  But - and I'm sure we've all done it - it just goes to show you have to be really careful before you let that trigger finger loose!Old dog and new tricks!"},
{"title": "More this and that", "date": "Monday 21 August 2017", "text": "Not at lot has been going on round here lately. The traffic is starting to pick up as families are heading back home after their holidays and preparing for the new school year. Oh how I used to hate it in England when school would finish towards the end of July and before you knew it the bloody shops would start pushing their \"back-to-school\" supplies. It seems like we had only just gotten out of school and here we were heading back already! Of course compared to the 10-12 weeks summer break the kids have round here (as compared to - what - 6-7 in England) - we really were almost heading straight back! Later, as a working parent, I came to appreciate how difficult it is to keep the kids occupied during those long school breaks, but at the time it sure didn't seem fair to me!So what's new? Oh yes I got a call from my youngest son's gf the other night asking if I wanted to come over on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate my oldest son's 30th birthday (you know, the one who just got married). Actually his birthday is on 30 August but both couples seem to be pretty booked up at the weekends so this was one of the few times we were all available. It was a lovely, simple evening and I thoroughly enjoyed it. After we ate, Jen got out a board game called \"Cranium\" - a new one to me - but actually quite fun. Because three of us (my sons and I) had grown up with a more anglophone culture, we skipped over some of the more difficult French-based questions, but found plenty to keep us going. For instance, I had to get my team mates to say \"Mr. Bean\" by miming him (got it in one!!!) and another time I had to mime \"work interview\". I didn't mind this stuff at all, but, for example, the \"tooth fairy\" in English becomes the \"little mouse\" in French so we had a few crossed wires mixed in with the giggles. There was also one card where I was blind-folded and I had to get them to say \"Mont Blanc\" by drawing it. Guess what, I managed it! I drew round my finger on the paper so I knew where I had drawn Lake Geneva (in order to put the Mont Blanc further south) but when I took my blindfold off I have to admit Lake Geneva looked more like a penis (but luckily no-one came up with that one)!I think I mentioned previously that a few of us are going to host a monthly board game evening and with that in mind I had already bought a few fun games. I bought a new game called \"Pie Face\" where basically the loser gets \"tarted\" with whipped cream! I had to nag my sons into playing and I so wish I could figure out how to put the video on here as the video of the two of them playing and roaring laughing when the eldest got hit in the face with the cream was great. Something else to figure out I suppose. But it was great fun - oh and I got \"tarted\" too, by the way!André knows already that Jordan is too good for him!André's response to getting \"tarted\" - hey, I like this game (slurp, slurp)!On the Sunday, I had spotted a vide-grenier taking place at a place called Thorens-Glières. It had been ages since I had been up there so a friend and I took a trip out there. For once I didn't buy anything (except a huge hamburger) but she did quite well with a lovely bag, bracelet and tiny, leather slippers for her great nephew. Very pretty. ThorensDuring the second World War, there was a huge battle between the occupying Germans and the French resistance on top of the Plâteau de Glières, so I think I might take a run up there next weekend to re-visit the museum, time and weather permitting, of course.On the way back, my friend asked if I would stop at the little church called La Benite Fontaine (the Blessed Fountain) so she could fill up a couple of water bottles of spring water/holy water. I don't know that it is really holy water, but it is certainly untreated mountain spring water and she, very touchingly, wanted to get some water for her beloved labrador who, we suspect, is on his last legs. She knows the time is coming but thought a little \"help from God\" wouldn't do him any harm either would it.A little shrine at La BeniteOne elderly lady was there filling up about 10 bottles with the water and I asked her if it was good - she said \"well it's natural spring water and I'm not doing so badly on it am I\" as she trudged back up the hillside with her two carrier bags full of bottled water.\"Thank you\" plaques addressed to the Virgin MaryAt the springIt's actually a lovely spot to picnic too!Church of La Benite FontaineFrance is a Catholic country and I'm not Catholic - but you can't beat a beautiful church in my opinion!"},
{"title": "I was in a really good mood until .....", "date": "Wednesday 16 August 2017", "text": "The temperature here dropped quite a bit last week, much to my relief. I really don't \"do\" heat - I mean, if it is cold you can always get warmer by moving, can't you, but getting out of the heat can sometimes be difficult, to say the least. So any puny exercise regime I might kid myself I am following soon falls by the wayside once the summer hits. In the spring I had gotten into a fairly regular routine of walking either to work or at lunchtime and going to the gym, but once the temperature gets up into the 30s and above (around June) I just can't cope with it. I failed miserably in my attempt to lose weight in time for my son's wedding in July. Oh, I absolutely did lose about 10 lbs but probably put 8 back on so not much cheer there. Anyway, with last week being a bit cooler I did manage to exercise five times in all, and I know I've said this before, but I always feel so good when I do this. Beats me why I ever quit of course, but if anyone knows where you can buy bottled motivation or willpower please let me know.For today, at least, I am on track though, as I got off the bus and walked 30 minutes this morning and plodded my way round a pitifully hot Botanical Gardens at lunch time, so I will be well over my 10,000 steps today. And it is such a lovely walk - well I have three lunchtime routes in fact. The first is to the Mont Blanc bridge and back (all on the flat). The second is three times round the Botanical Gardens (which includes a slight uphill part), and the third is up to the US mission, which is perched on top of a hill and which, though I huff and puff all the way to the top, I am actually beginning to find easier with every attempt I make.As it was so hot I decided to take my time today and take photos (well that's my excuse). I made it three times round the circuit nevertheless, but crikey - was I sweating!Kiddies' carousel in the GardensUN BeachI had lunch at the UN beach restaurant that you can see in the distance with a friend last week - it's been ages since I have eaten there and it really feels like you are on holiday when you eat there.I loved this tree (being chased by a pterodactyl?) but couldn't get the whole tree in - the trunk was beautiful.Young goats play fighting - very cute!This walk takes me about 45 minutes, which gives me 15 minutes to get back to work and into the shower. But .... and here's the bit that pissed me off, I had gone up to one of the shower rooms away from the main exercise rooms since they get quite crowded at lunchtime. I was the first in and left my clothes on one of the 10 clothes pegs in that room - a room which has only one shower. When I got back from my walk though, I saw that my clothes had been moved out of the shower room and into the general toilet area - frankly that is a no-no to me since there were nine other places to hang your clothes up other than mine. The shower was already running when I got there so I waited .... and waited .... and waited .... and - you get the idea. In the end, I timed it and the person in the shower actually had the water running for 20 minutes after I had got there. Bloody hell! I don't take 30 minute showers at home and can be in and out in five minutes, so what she was doing for well over 20 minutes is beyond me - assuming she doesn't work down a coal mine - which she doesn't. Well eventually the shower stopped and I thought \"oh goody, I can get in there in a minute\"! But no, another 15 minutes to huff and puff and get herself dry and whatever else she was doing. For me this is just not on when there is only one shower and we have 60 minutes for lunch. So after 30 minutes she finally came out and when she saw me said \"oh I moved your stuff outside in case you wanted to go to another shower room\". I pointed out that no, I really wanted to use this one since this is where I left my stuff so please don't move it in future (I may also have muttered something about \"keeping the bloody shower short and sweet in future too\", but I can't be sure!!!) Hell I was ticked off but you know what, in the end, I figured hey there are more important things to get mad about and having to wait 30 minutes for a shower is really just a first world problem isn't it. So all's well, I'm back \"in the zone\", but jeepers you should see my frizzy hair!"},
{"title": "Creativity!", "date": "Tuesday 8 August 2017", "text": "I'm not in the slightest bit artistic or creative. That's not false modesty - it's just the truth. I can and do enjoy learning crafts but as a \"self-starter\" - well that's just not me. You know when people are creative because it's just there from an early age and for me that wasn't the case. Oh don't get me wrong, as I am getting more and more free time to myself, I am thoroughly enjoying taking patchwork lessons, cookery lessons and so on, but it doesn't come naturally or easily. I take that back - I actually can cook and enjoy it - the lessons are more about discovering different cuisines and ingredients.I recently discovered a small haberdashery store not too far from home where they offer patchwork lessons pretty much any time, including Saturday mornings. They also offer knitting lessons and I would love to do that later, when I am retired. I have this thing about making myself a beautiful pair of woolen socks some day. Who knows, that may well happen. In fact my mom was a beautiful knitter - she could and would knit anything up until she was almost 80 years of age, when her eyesight started to fail her. Of course, with that generation it was often of necessity. I remember her unraveling old sweaters and knitting them back up as \"new\" (oh my aching arms - having to hold them both out so that she could wrap the wool around them). In fact, about five years ago my childhood friend, Ian, decided he had had enough of England and just upped sticks and went off to Bulgaria to live with no fall back plan (note, he's still there and loving it)! When my ex left me in 2010 Ian invited me out to Bulgaria to meet up. Now his father had died at the age of 40 leaving his mom a widow with five young children to support so money was tight! We laughed so much on that holiday about \"the old times\", but one of the funniest things I remember him saying was that you always knew what you would be getting for Christmas because your mom would be knitting away and all of a sudden she would say \"stand up and put your arms out\"! And he was right¨Anyway, where was I going with this ramble? Oh yes, creativity. I think I mentioned in a blog post about my son's wedding that one of his closest friends showed up in a bright orange suit - I mean, really garish - and his brother showed up in a matching canary yellow suit because \"they said not to wear black or white\"! I have a pretty wacky sense of humour so I loved it.See if you can pick them out!My youngest son tells me all the women love S because he is like a great, big, red-haired teddy bear - and he's right. He is a lovely person and a very talented wrought-iron worker - now working for himself.  Well my external balcony has been badly in need of some TLC for quite some time - in fact, the mason started dismantling the balcony and working on the cement part of it just yesterday. Quite by coincidence, S called me and said could he come over last night with his ideas for my balcony and the side gate I want to put in.  We had already talked about what I want and he came over with his initial sketches - which I loved!This will be what my wrought-iron balcony will look like (he is going to give me a white cow with black spots on the left (sorry, I'm not good with \"breeds\") and the one on the right will have brown spots - the one chewing the grass). And when I asked him \"where are my rats?\", he is now going to add a couple of rats running along the handrail! I should explain my home backs on to a dairy farm so this for me was just so spot on (yeah, I know I'm nuts!)For the side gate he came up with this:I'm not too sure about the cat on the right (he's green) so I am thinking of having him take a look at the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland (oh, and he's going to add in a couple of hedgehogs too). I can't wait!Cheshire Cat - from Alice in WonderlandI love it! I love bright colours and I love \"wacky\". I know it might not appeal to everyone but hey .... one of the great joys of paying all your own bills is that you get to choose everything right?On an only somewhat similar note, I watched a lovely documentary the other night celebrating comedian Billy Connolly's birthday where they had invited three different artists to create pictures of Billy, which would eventually be displayed in the art museum but also on buildings around Glasgow, to celebrate one of Glasgow's favourite lads! The young lady who created the really wacky (as you can see, I love that word) portrait of him took her inspiration from his various - often \"potty humour\" - jokes and I think she really managed to capture the very spirit of him.  All three were wonderful (as is Billy), but wow, what talent!And finally, I also saw Grayson Perry on TV the other night. He is a (happily married) artist who just happens to be a transvestite. \"Odd\" I guess is the way he might be described, or more likely \"outrageous\" but what came over so strongly in this programme was what an intensely funny and interesting man he is. I'm not sure that his art appeals to me, but his unconventional side certainly does!Grayson Perry (left) and his wife!"},
{"title": "Memories of a lovely day!", "date": "Monday 31 July 2017", "text": "My son and his wife are back from their honeymoon and started back at work today (berrrrkkkkk!!! is how he put it). But they had a wonderful honeymoon in Croatia (in the Split region), which makes me think a long weekend in Croatia could be in my stars too.Back to the wedding, I really can't believe how perfectly everything went. Even the weather, which threatened rain off and on, remained perfect all day (if a little too hot and humid, but I'm not complaining).  The setting for the ceremony was a lovely place called La Médicée, a kind of old mansion house which had been renovated but had retained its oldy-worldy charm. I have rummaged around for photos but can't actually find any that do it justice. I think what I really loved about the place was that it was \"rustic\" rather than pristine, with wild flowers blooming everywhere, in addition to the pots and pots of cultivated plants.My sons are both in the same band and although there is a four-year age difference, they have many friends in common. The \"mates\" were just starting to show up as we got there and I had to laugh when I saw Sylvain, the rather gorgeous young red-head who is going to be re-doing my balcony soon. He is a \"mate\" and had decided to wear a bright, bright orange suit with matching hat - I mean it literally hurt your eyes to look at him in the sunlight - and a young man (who turned out to be Sylvain's brother - I should have known), was in a matching outfit but in canary yellow! What a sight those two were! I went up to say hallo and complimented them on their \"discreet little outfits\" - to which they both just grinned and said \"well they said no black or white\"! And you know what, I loved it - just my kind of humour. The young people all looked very handsome though all dressed up - which is not something I often see with that lot.On to the wedding, I have to say the ceremony was just fabulous, even though I was having to try to give a running commentary to my family as the main part of the ceremony was in French - although where possible people took it in turns to speak in either English or French. The basic gist of the ceremony was that \"while people seemed to think that André and Lily met in 2006, they were wrong. They actually met around 400 years B.C.! You see, in those days there were \"men\", \"women\" and \"androids\" - beings made up of a male and a female half joined together at the back, but having two heads, four arms, four legs and two bodies. Sadly, over time it seemed that these androids became vain and started thinking they were more important than God, so Zeus became angry, took his sword and split them down the middle, forever to wander the earth looking for their other half. Now Aristotle had this theory - that somewhere in the future it would be possible for these androids to find their other halves - so taking the time machine (that he very handily happened to have available to him), and plugging in the GPS, he time-warped himself to Geneva in 2006, to the Academie de Langues et de Commerce, where he passed himself off as both a janitor and a professor of Greek history at the same time! Well one day he was busy painting the walls (in his janitor capacity) when André happened to glance over and spot Lily, at which point Aristotle shouted \"eureka (side note: I know that was Archimedes but it was a commonly used expression in ancient Greece) and he realized that André and Lily had indeed found their other halves\". So he had managed to prove his theory you see!I tell you, the lady celebrant made this such a fun story that everyone was giggling. She then went on to re-enact André getting down on one knee to propose last September and the completely unaware Lily thinking he was stopping to tie his laces! As I said, the ceremony was lovely. I think I may have mentioned before that Lily's mom is originally from Korea but came to Switzerland at the age of eight. There were a couple of sweet \"nods\" to mom's Korean culture during the ceremony, but one that moved us all was that they had tied cards to the nearest tree with the names of loved ones who were no longer with us physically but who were there in spirit! At the end of the ceremony they bowed to each other, bowed to their guests and then bowed to the lost loved ones!Both dads were blubbing their eyes out but somehow Lily's mom and I just looked at each other and rolled our eyes!After an initial apéritif, which allowed the photographer to work his magic (the photos above are just ipad photos) we went in to the beautiful hall, wonderfully decorated, and were served a really good five-course meal. I think the caterers might have been recommended by la Médicée but in any case they were excellent. After that there were a few games and the dancing started at around midnight. At this point we old foggies were getting tired so we left around 1 a.m. I understand they partied on until 5 a.m. so there were a few bleary eyes the next morning but hey - as long as no-one was driving who cares.The next day André and Lily had organized a light brunch for anyone who had stayed overnight in hotels in the local area (I drove my family home but we came back again the next day).  It was again scorching hot and difficult to get out of the sun, but it was nice to see the mates all turn up again on so little sleep.My family and I ended up sitting on the same table as my ex and his new gf but actually it was all right. Everyone was polite and chatted so I am so glad it went well. He had phoned me on the Monday night to see if \"we\" wanted to go out for a drink with them but I just said I would rather not, but that I would see him at the wedding. Phew, thank God that bit went without a hitch!The photographer was a young Englishman (now a friend) who the kids had flown out from England and who they put up at their apartment. He is going to make them a website (I can't wait) but as it isn't ready I thought I would post a couple of his lovely photos. Oh, and it had been one of his dreams to do a photoshoot in the Swiss alps (although with the French alps right there I wonder why not do it there - maybe he hadn't heard as much about the French alps). Anyway, on the Saturday the three of them drove up to Zermatt, caught the little train up to the village, then the rack railway up to Riffelsee and hiked round to the most beautiful vantage point for taking pictures of the Matterhorn. They caught Lily unawares as she was changing back into her wedding dress though - ha! Another one for the album!Photo by Ap-Art PhotographyPhoto by Ap-Art Photography"},
{"title": "La suite!", "date": "Thursday 27 July 2017", "text": "After the hectic weekend, I had a day to myself on the Monday before my family arrived from the UK for the wedding. I had looked into getting a spray on tan just for the event but in the end was too lazy / cheap / tired and decided to \"do-it-myself\"! Well what a mistake that was. I should know from previous attempts that it takes time and skill to get it looking half-way decent and I have to admit even I was shocked when I realized how \"streaky\" I ended up looking. It was only my legs in any case as I didn't care about the rest but .... good Lord what a mess! So much so, that I actually went to the dermatologist yesterday lunch time on another matter and he took one look at my legs and just laughed! Oh well, as I was already telling myself about my lack of weight loss, \"nobody is looking at you anyway\"! But darn it!Which brings to mind another \"roaring success of mine\". My family arrived on the Tuesday and as I was showing my sister and her husband up to the attic bedroom they both turned to me and said \"what is that smell? It smells like sh\"\"t\"! And yes, you've guess it, it was indeed me! You see, I had been getting bitten to pieces by mozzies (as I always do) and couldn't find my usual insect repellent so I smothered on some other mozzie stuff (at least it had a picture of a mozzie on the bottle) that I found in the bathroom drawer. I have to admit I thought it was a bit \"different\" and definitely very pongy but hey ho, needs must. Well when we trudged back downstairs I picked up the bottle and having taken the time to actually read the instructions this time, I found out it was some kind of \"liquid moth ball\", i.e. you put a small cap full of it in your washing to repel moths. I had smothered the bloody stuff all over me and reeked of camphor! Even more embarrassingly, I had done the same thing on Sunday when I had been invited over to my neighbours for lunch - I wondered why no one wanted to sit next to me! Lordy, lordy, as they say, \"you can take the girl out the country but .......\"!Anyway, getting back to the subject, on our first full day \"pre-wedding\" I took my family up to a lovely little village called Les Lindarets. Now the locals here are obviously very smart because they took what is basically just your small, ordinary alpine village - and allow their goats to run free, and then sell goat feed to the tourists who drive up there in their droves - all to see the goats!!! Smart eh! So my sister and I went into a gift shop (which actually had an older goat and a kid wandering round inside it) and bought three bags of goat treats. I then handed them to my brother-in-law outside the shop (knowing full well what would happen) and we sat back and watched!The goats were actually OK as long as you didn't get the whole herd crowding round you, but they really were funny.  After that we went back down the usual \"touristy\" route, past a lovely lake called le Lac de Montriond and on to the waterfall and horse-shoe gorge which form the basis of my usual visitor pit stops.Lac de MontriondCascade de RougetOn the day of the wedding we had time in the morning for a wander round the local market. It is much bigger than my usual Saturday morning market and I really regret not being able to make it there throughout the year - oh well, retirement will come soon enough I suppose.And then we were off to the wedding. I knew my way all the way to the motorway exit but got lost after that (so much for GPS eh). Thankfully, we bumped into the local postie who was able to direct us right to the front door. Thank God!!! I couldn't even imagine what it would be like to be late for my own son's wedding!  (Note, the photographer is currently putting together his beautiful photos into a website so I will share more on that next time - but of course the photos are beautiful)!On the Friday we had a simple brunch with any of the stragglers that were left behind from the wedding (many had either partied all night or had booked hotels nearby). There is a lovely bridge about 10 minutes from the wedding venue that I knew would be a nice spot for my family to see so we tootled up there after lunch. It is called Pont de l'Abîme (bridge over the abyss) and it really is quite spectacular, but of course it was hard to capture the height when looking down so I took one of the billboard photos to give you an idea.Pont de l'AbîmeThen on the evening my neighbours invited us all round for an aperitif. These were the neighbours who had kept my second son after he was born and I went back to work and they are like second parents to him. I had taken their daughter home to England with me when I was on maternity leave and - get this - both couples (the neighbours and my sister and her husband) had got married on exactly the same day over 40 years ago! The weird thing is, I know these two couples would probably end up being really good friends if they (a) lived in the same country, and (b) spoke each other's language! As it was, I was interpreter-in-chief but it was still a lovely way to end our day.Their last free day before returning home was the Saturday so we did our usual \"Lac des Confins, La Clusaz, Annecy\" run but you know what - I never tire of it and neither do my family. I posted a picture of Lac des Confins when my brother was over in May, but this time we were lucky in that the cable cars were running so we were able to zoom up to the Plâteau de Beauregard for lunch, then back down to La Clusaz, and back through Annecy before heading home.La ClusazWe had planned to go down to a local village fête to round off our day but the heavens decided not to cooperate and we knocked that on the head. Instead, we decided to go up to my friend, Stan's, little bar for a pizza and a natter, and yet again my family were delighted by what a congenial little place it is. Oh, and get this, I mentioned before that Stan's youngest (my son's growing-up buddy) is a professional rugby player. Well guess who got to take a selfie with Ronaldo last week - yep - that's Daniel in the middle with his medal!Daniel's a talented rugby player but, more importantly, a lovely young man (as are all Stan's children - he must be doing something right)!And finally, on a slightly sour note, on the Sunday night after my family had left, I was watching TV when I thought I heard yelling. When I muted the TV I realized that there was major yelling going on outside, so I went out to look.  A young man was up at one of my neighbour's living room windows yelling and screaming vile names, presumably at the daughter of the house. He then started throwing his skateboard at the window and yelling at her to come out. The daughter is around 28, I would say, and lives with her boyfriend. I assumed this was the bf and that they had split up, but in fact it turned out that he was a long-ago boyfriend against whom she had a restraining order and this was the second time he had violated it. By the time I got out there, three other neighbours had showed up, as well as her father and the police arrived several minutes later, by which time the young man had disappeared. It was very unsettling for me though, as it triggered awful memories of lying in bed waiting for my ex to stumble home drunk and not knowing what kind of mood he would be in, or indeed if the temper tantrums and throwing stuff around fits would erupt. I'm glad for this young girl that she is away from him and hope that the police take it further. I'm also soooooo glad that I don't have to live that kind of life any more. But what a dreadful trigger!!!"},
{"title": "What a week that was!", "date": "Wednesday 26 July 2017", "text": "My goodness, I was expecting to be busy last week but I think even I underestimated just how busy! That being said, I have to say it was just the perfect week. It's so lovely when everything goes even better than planned isn't it.On the first Saturday I was off I went down to Chambéry, which is about 80 km from here, for the wedding of a dear friend. Marilyn and Philippe already lived in our little neighbourhood when we moved in - in fact Marilyn was heavily pregnant with Maddie as we moved in - and with both Marilyn and my ex being American we instantly hit it off - it was nice to speak English sometimes. In fact, our kids pretty much grew up together and many a happy day was spent skiing and then enjoying the après-ski!I think my youngest was just a baby when I took this picture, hence he isn't in it!Well time marches on, Marilyn and Philippe moved down to Chambéry and then on to the States. The kids grew up, we grew old and sadly Philippe became ill and died suddenly last year. So it was a somewhat bitter-sweet day when his daughter, Madeleine, got married here in France, although Marilyn made sure Philippe's presence was felt everywhere.Madeleine and Yousaf got married earlier this year in a civil ceremony in Gibraltar and then had another celebration in the lovely Château de Candie just outside Chambéry. And how beautiful they were. This really was a \"United Nations\" wedding though as Yousaf's father is Pakistani, his mom is Colombian and they live in Dubai! Madeleine's dad was French and her mother is American - so I would say we had many bases covered there wouldn't you! And it really was a lovely mixture of people - all very friendly and welcoming.Oh, and one of the things that tickled me was as part of the favours there was a bar of yack's milk, a fridge magnet from Colombia, and this lovely little tuk-tuk from Pakistan - isn't it sweet! It was so good to see them all again, and see what lovely kids they turned out to be - but more especially to re-connect with Marilyn again after all these years!I stayed till 1 a.m. (lasting on just one glass of wine as I had to drive) and got home around 2.30 a.m. on the Sunday morning.Then the next day my neighbour had invited a group of us over to lunch, as a kind of semi-annual get together of old friends and former neighbours. Thankfully I had had the forethought to make something to take round beforehand as I was pretty tired that morning, I have to say. I knew there was the little granddaughter from next door going also so I made sure to take a couple of games I had just bought to keep her (and the adults as it turned out) occupied. Ker-plunk was a big hit!  In fact, a group of us have decided to get together once a month for a board game evening, so I have been buying games which I have fond memories of from my childhood, as well as new games that have recently come out (Pie Face anyone) and of course new sets of playing cards. I have wonderful memories of playing Tarot and Belote (sp?) as a singleton, as well as Uno, so I'm hoping these evenings really take off!More to follow - it really was a heck of a week!Lunch with the neighboursKer-plunking!Hunting for grasshoppers!"},

{"title": "Phew!", "date": "Tuesday 11 July 2017", "text": "I got it finished. By \"it\", I mean the quilt I decided to make for my son's wedding in a fit of insanity (wedding is next week). By \"insanity\" I mean, if you have never made a quilt before why would you suddenly decide to make one for your son's wedding? Which implies (a) a deadline, and (b) it can't just be \"n'importe quoi\" - I mean, it should be reasonably well done right? I must be nuts.Anyway, I had already given them money as a wedding present since they have everything they need as they have lived together for nine years already. But, I thought I would like to give them something a bit more personal and decided to make a quilt. I had just learned how to transfer photos onto fabric so decided to incorporate some into the central panel. I also knew I wanted a photo of each of them as toddlers so while I already have photos of my son when he was little, obviously, I had to go on to Facebook and steal one of Lily (the one and only toddler photo of her) from her FB page. That bloody quilt took me ages, all the more so since I was unsure what I was doing and was kinda learning as I went along. But, despite chewing my nails down to the quick and making quite a few blunders (I won't point them out to you), I finally got it finished this weekend, which is just as well as I will be fully occupied from here on up to the wedding.There are loads of cock-ups but I have to say I am rather proud of it - I just hope they like it!And moving swiftly on, in other news, I mentioned recently that my Uncle Frank - my dad's last surviving sibling - had died recently. The funeral was in England and I couldn't go but sent my condolences to his son, Simon. So yesterday I received a memorial card back from Simon in memory of his dad, which kinda triggered a memory of something my brother said at my mom's funeral last year.I was very fond of my Uncle Frank and, compared to some of the other brothers, I always considered him rather more \"restrained\" - quieter, if you like. But my brother Phil told a story of Frankie in his younger days when he might have been slightly less \"restrained\". Dad and Frankie both played football, and apparently Frankie was quite gifted. Moreover, he was a \"left footer\" - something which was quite prized because (apparently) most players are \"right footed\". So one day, local talent scouts arranged to be at a match to check Frankie out. Well seemingly Uncle Frank had been \"out on the razzle\" the night before, played about 10 minutes then walked over to the side of the pitch and threw up. And that, as they say, was when he saw a glorious future filed firmly behind him!Uncle Frank is in the front row, seated second from the left. And, parenthetically, my dad is in the back row, standing, first player on the left - you know, the one wearing the odd socks!And talking of pictures (we were, weren't we?), now that the quilt is finished my next job on the \"to do\" list is to start sorting/purging old pictures. I have an idea for my boys for Christmas where I want to sort out a few photos of them when they were younger and make them into photo albums using Snapfish. I experimented with Snapfish for the first time recently with the few photos I have of my trip to Cuba. The quality wasn't great because my photos weren't great but at least I got to play around with the formatting (it isn't easy) and was able to send off for my album. My boys love the old photos so I hope they will like what I put together.And again on the subject of photos, my neighbour was in my house the other day and asked me why I still had my wedding photo up since I have been divorced nearly six years. To be honest, I barely notice that photo since it is tucked away on a corner wall, but I thought \"she's right\", I don't need to have photos of my ex on my wall since there is no love lost between us.  At the weekend I told my sister that I was dreading seeing him again next week at the wedding and was praying to God he wouldn't just show up at the house \"because we're all great friends you see\" - err, not! She said not to worry as she would answer the door for the week!!! Yay, for sisters. I have already re-programmed my doorbell to play the theme music from \"the Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" for the week just in case. On top of that, until I get a photo from my son's wedding to replace my old wedding photo, I used my Photoshop skills - to great effect, I think. I hope you will agree!"},
{"title": "Neighbours are a wonderful thing - well in my case at least!", "date": "Thursday 6 July 2017", "text": "I think I mentioned that last year I decided to employ someone to cut my grass. I was sick of doing it myself because while I don't have much land, trying to cut grass on the side of a mountain in searing heat just wasn't my thing, so I called the guy who cuts my hedges and he jumped at the chance. He is pretty reasonably priced and it seems to be working out with him cutting the grass about twice a month - depending on the weather. What a relief that is!Well the grass was getting a bit long as we had had quite a bit of rain recently so while we were having our neighbourhood clean-up on Sunday I hesitated to cut in front of my house but then thought no, that is what I pay him for. And yay, when I got home Tuesday evening it had been done. It is a lovely garden with a beautiful view so when the grass is cut it is quite stunning. And as an added bonus for my gardener, my neighbours also decided to employ him - I guess things kinda snowball like that don't they.Anyway, at the top of my garden I have a few raised beds where I have planted what is laughingly called \"my veggie plot\". I could plant a lot more as I have the room but I honestly don't have the time to take care of any more - maybe when I retire. And next to the raised beds I planted a peach tree, which amazed me by actually producing a few (very small) peaches last year - I had assumed it was too cold, and some red currant, raspberry and gooseberry bushes. Trouble is, between all those bushes the weeds were growing at a rate of knots so I had decided that this Sunday I would get out there and tackle that. Buuuuut, when I got home last night I saw that the weeds had all gone. It was weird because I don't remember my gardener doing it and he normally doesn't but .... As I was stood there pondering, my neighbour tootled over and asked if I would mind if he cut the hazelnut tree back, then the mirabelle plum tree, and how about the honeysuckle and the lilac????? Only he wanted it to be \"nice for the wedding\" in two weeks!!! Wow, I told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. The way he put it is, he spends 10 minutes chopping away and the next 30 watching the Tour de France so it is no big deal! I tell you, I have great neighbours (all of them in fact) but I think I am particularly lucky with both sets of immediate neighbours. Of course over the years we have always helped each other out - I was dropping his wife off at the hospital once a month on my way to work for a while - but hearing what some people have to put up with (One Family, One Income I am talking to you), I really appreciate having such nice people around, all the more so as I live on my own now.Oh, and off on a totally different tangent, this morning I thought I should start getting my backside into gear and get back to walking more, even if it is otherwise too hot to exercise. So I caught the express bus which dropped me at the train station in 20 minutes and hopped off to walk the last 30 minutes to work. The hotels around the train station are particularly popular with Japanese tourists for obvious reasons and traffic being heavy around there, when you want to cross the roads you really can't nip over between traffic - you have to wait for the \"little green man\". So a whole bunch of people were standing waiting for the lights to change when I spotted two (Japanese?) women standing partially on the road waiting to cross but totally absorbed in their phones. After a couple of minutes the \"little green man\" appeared and everyone scooted over to the other side. While I was crossing I watched the women tapping away on their phones and continuing to do so for the minute or so that we had to cross. By the time they had looked up the lights had changed back to red and they were stuck there again. A younger woman just looked at me and laughed saying \"now that was surreal\", and yes indeed it was!"},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Monday 3 July 2017", "text": "It's been a while since I last posted but that's because the days just seem to be flying by. I have been really busy at work ahead of our 24th July meeting but most of the gruntwork is done so my feet have time to touch the floor now! The bloody traffic has been dreadful of late and I really don't know why but hopefully with the schools breaking up soon it should be a bit calmer. And the weather!!!!! A week ago last Friday as I was driving home the external temperature sensor on my car showed 37 degrees C (98 F). Then last Friday it flashed up at 14 degrees C (57 F)! A drop of over 20 degrees in one week! Crikey. Not that I minded too much because 37 is just way too hot for me, particularly since my office is in a beautiful old (protected) building (so read \"no AC\"). Yuck that was miserable. And of course, over here unlike places that routinely get much hotter, homes don't have AC either (or none that I know of anyway) so you really are trying to make the most of any little thru-breeze you can get. It's back to about 25 at the moment and so much more bearable!We had some sad news on the home front too. My dad's last remaining sibling, Uncle Frank, started to suffer from Alzheimer's a few years ago. His wife had had a severe stroke a couple of years ago and needs full-time care so their only child, S, made arrangements for her to be moved into a home in the south of England near him. For Uncle Frank he had changes made to his own home so that dad could move in with him and his family. Three weeks ago they decided to give Frankie a break and take him away with them on holiday to Wales. Frankie got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, got confused about how to get back to his room and fell down the stairs, breaking his back and dying within 24 hours. So very sad. I know Alzheimer's is no fun (dad had it) but it just seems such a sad way for him to go when things were finally starting to \"look up for him a bit\"!Then the weekend before last, on the Friday evening, one of my two sewing clubs held our end-of-year dinner in a lovely restaurant near me. Quite by coincidence, the other Monday-night sewing club chose to have their end-of-year lunch at the same restaurant the following day, in addition to springing a surprise farewell lunch on a lovely German lady who was leaving our region to move to Brittany to be nearer her sons. She and I got along well as the two \"foreigners\" and she was quite tearful when she realized what they had organized. And this being a patchwork club the ladies had had an all-day \"sew-in\" and made her a beautiful quilt as a souvenir. It really was stunning. I, of course, couldn't take part in the \"sew-in\" because I was at work so I bought her a beautiful book of post card images of Haute Savoie (the region I live in) as a reminder! She was moved to tears. Then she started threatening not to move to Brittany at all .......But the sad thing that put a real damper on her leaving do was that one of the other ladies' husbands had been killed in a freak accident just two days earlier. He was only 64 and had been towing a 1,000 litre water butt out to the field when it moved, fell off the trailer and crushed him! Absolutely tragic and of course the shock of something like that must be unbelievable. While I'm sure losing someone you love to illness is appalling at least there is some knowledge of what might happen, but to lose your husband like that just doesn't bear thinking about! So very sad.Getting back to my rotten commute, last Friday the traffic in Geneva seemed to be easier than normal at leaving time, but once I got through the border and pulled off the motorway to head home I got stuck in nose-to-tail traffic for another hour. The roads were completely blocked and we all got told to turn around and take little back roads!!!! Aaaarrrrkkkkkkk! It turns out it was a demonstration by local farmers using their tractors to block the roads. Much as I love France I have to say the French are very good at going on strike (I'll never fly Air France - they always end up going on strike at Easter, the school holidays, Christmas you name it). I suppose the other side of that coin is that they are not afraid to fight for what they want. BUUUUT on Friday night I wasn't impressed I can tell you. Turns out though, that they were protesting because they wanted something done about the \"travellers\" (gypsies by any other name) who would just park up on their land and seemingly would only move when they were good and ready. I guess that changes my opinions of the farmers' actions now! While we get a couple of groups of travellers round by us who do leave the fields clean, some are just disgusting pigs. There is a more or less permanent site near Annecy's small airport and they are filthy tips. I saw an article one time about how a group of travellers parked up on a hospital car park in England and it took ages to get them moved so I can understand the farmers' frustration.Well, the good news is that a group of travellers cut through one of the farmer's chains protecting his field and installed themselves there. So what did the farmer do? He called up a few like-minded friends and they went down to the field and sprayed liquid manure all over them!!! You gotta love that one haven't you - and they moved off pretty sharpish by all accounts! I do so love a good ending.And finally, on Sunday we had our annual neighbourhood clean up - a little later than usual but it seemed the last available date before people disappeared on their summer hols. It honestly doesn't take long to have our little place looking spic and span - and then we all pitch in and eat together on our little island. There was waaaayyyy too much food but hey, we all had a really pleasant day, we met two new sets of neighbours and the kids (and one dad!!!) had a blast!He was definitely outnumbered!Princessing is hard work!"},
{"title": "A girl needs all the support she can get!", "date": "Tuesday 20 June 2017", "text": "Just this week a comment on another blog about buying underwear (you know, the kind of thing you discuss transatlantic with someone you have never met) reminded me of a \"bra buying\" story I had all but forgotten about!Some years ago my oldest sister, her daughter and I decided to go to Marks and Spencer's in Dorset to be properly measured for a bra. We have always been \"well stacked\" in my family (well the female side anyway, although apparently cosmetic surgery for \"moobs\" (man boobs) is now the fastest growing cosmetic surgery for men, but I digress). Anyway, we went in to be measured in turn and all three of us came out in fits of giggles. As is pretty common, we had all been wearing totally the wrong size of bra for years! Of course the \"right\" size bra ended up basically looking like two wheelbarrows welded together, so not exactly a turn on, but my niece said that as soon as she started wearing the correct size bra her back pain totally disappeared! Ha, who wudda thunk!A few years later the same sister had to have an operation on her shoulder. Shortly after the op she decided that she would like to be re-fitted for a new bra, so back to Marks and Sparks she trotted with her husband (who was driving) and my mom in her wheelchair (who was just along for the ride).When her turn came to be measured she went into the changing room with the lady but with her shoulder operation being so recent the lady was afraid to touch her in order to take a proper measurement. In the end they called my sister's husband into the changing room thinking that he could help very gently move my sister's arm/shoulder in order for the lady to measure her.After a little while they finished up and my sister and the assistant walked out. At that point, my brother-in-law stuck his head out from behind the curtain and called out \"Who's next please? Professionally qualified bra fitter at your service!\" They said the look on the waiting ladies faces was a sight to behold, and my mom went into a fit of the giggles! Oh, and did I mention that my brother-in-law was a cop!!!! So ladies, if you are looking for a professionally-qualified bra fitter and you're in Dorset, you know where to go!"},
{"title": "And even busier!", "date": "Monday 19 June 2017", "text": "And still as busy as ever, but at least on the positive side, I know that this will be my busiest period so I know what to expect. That being said, added to the general exhaustion of last week, the weather was scorching and the traffic was awful. I mean, one night when I didn't work late, I left work at 5.30 pm and made it home at almost 8 p.m.!!! Not sure what that is all about but I am so looking forward to the kids getting out of school and there being less traffic on the roads for a couple of months!Add to that, the state of my house has been getting to me and when I get like that I always feel like I am chomping at the bit to do something about it. By European standards I have a fairly large house with an enormous basement, and of course when you have all that space you fill it up don't you. Not just me of course. At one time we were five living here but as the kids (and one gf) moved out and the ex left me, my house became the repository for all things unwanted, particularly an entire three-bedroomed farmhouse' worth of stuff that my ex left behind two years ago. Admittedly my kids took what stuff of his they wanted but that still left me with a shedload! Oh, and does anyone else have the same problem that when you switch from summer tyres to winter tyres, all the leftover tyres get dumped back at your place! Then of course, nobody can really recognize whose are whose summer tyres to put them back on when summer rolls around! Urrggghh!I'm not totally blameless of course. I love to cook and for more than 20 years subscribed to the BBC Good Food Guide. Trouble was, I went through the magazines and either highlighted recipes or ripped them out, meaning to get around to trying them later. Well you can imagine how that went can't you, and while I have discovered some fabulous recipes, if I live to be 1,500 years old I would never get around to trying them all. On top of that, being just me at home now, why would I want to cook Ken Hom's full Peking Duck menu!! So to that end, I vowed to not only attack the basement but also start going through the house, and much to my shame, the picture below shows the recipes \"I was going to try out\" taken from just one drawer!!! (Man, this is like washing your dirty underwear in public!!!) Shame on me!I took quite a large load to the tip on Saturday - stuff I could donate or give away I will advertise on Facebook or take to the local charity. It's amazing though how just getting rid of one small pile of stuff instantly lifts your mood isn't it!Still, not being too hard on myself, I have to show you my \"major achievements\" this weekend too. Every time I go on holiday I tend to pick up little souvenirs but with the intention of actually bringing back something \"useful\", or at least not just a dust collector. For instance, the table runner you can see in the above picture I bought on the Floating Islands in Peru four years ago. I had a few things I fell in love with in Greece last year that I wanted to put up on my external walls, but had no drill to put them up with (the little drill I bought after my ex left was not strong enough).  Anyway, having cleared some stuff out of the basement I came across my ex' power drill so thought \"sod it, I'm gonna put those things up\". I tell you, it was hard going as I was drilling into solid concrete, sometimes with metal inside it (I hit that in a few places), but after much sweating and swearing, and a couple of my neighbours looking on laughing (they did offer to help), I managed to get six pieces put up in about an hour, so if anyone needs a \"handywoman\" just give me a call!I thought, living in France, my little frog was quite appropriate!My little lizard is actually very, very brightly coloured - but the sun drowned the colours out!And after the terrible events in the UK in the past month (two terror attacks in London and a loser blowing himself up at the Ariana Grande concert, plus the tower block going up in flames) it felt nice to find a small bit of \"joy\" this weekend. My next door neighbours have three grandchildren. The nine year old is down's syndrome and then there are two five year olds. Well, I was out in what I laughingly call my \"veggie plot\" attempting to take it back from the encroaching field, when the three kids came \"to help\". I think in reality they were more interested in watching the horses galloping around (you can see them better from my garden which backs directly onto the field) but the excuse was \"to help me\"!Anyway, the two five-year olds eventually left but the oldest, the little DS boy, stayed to \"help me\", and eventually, with the help of his dad, he was able to tell me that he now knew when he had to go pee and could tell his mommy and daddy! I was shocked because, I suppose, not being in their situation, I had never given it any thought how long it would take to \"potty train\" him. But, he was as pleased as punch, and for the first time ever I got a big kiss!Oh, and if I really want to be a nasty cow (I do), I stopped in at Stan's for a coffee on my way back from shopping on Saturday and as I walked in just routinely said \"bonjour\" to the couple who were waiting to pay him. Turns out, it was the dumpy, fat-ankled little cow that my ex-husband ran off with in 2010 and maaaaaaan has she got fat! I asked Stan if she was pregnant (she looked about eight months) and he said of course not as she is nearly 50 (she is 10 years younger than me). I had been working in the garden that morning and looked a bit of a mess but decided to clean myself up before going shopping - good thing eh - bumping into her like that. I must ask her when the baby is due next time! (Yeah, strike me down I know)!"},
{"title": "Busy, busy, busy!", "date": "Wednesday 7 June 2017", "text": "As I have mentioned before, my work is very cyclical and right now we are busy gearing up for a big meeting in July. I don't mind at all because I hate the \"down\" times and get a real buzz out of being up against deadlines. Ok, I wouldn't want to be like that all the time but it certainly makes the days go faster.So, what's new? Well although my oldest got married in a civil service in March (they bought the wedding forward in order for Lily's granddad to be there. Thankfully they did as he sadly died shortly thereafter), the big celebration will be in July. As the best man, it was up to my youngest to organize the stag do. I only got to see the one photo posted on Facebook but I saw a couple on my youngest's mobile phone - and it was quite a do! One of the girlfriends found a \"Heidi\" outfit for him but by the time they had added a red cape apparently he looked more like Little Red Riding Hood. As they were about to set off though, one of the girls decided that his make-up wasn't quite right so they set about putting that right!After a few drinks (nobody was driving) they went off to play \"balloon football\". Berrrrrkkk. The thought of a few drinks in me then running round a field playing balloon football doesn't bear thinking about, but apparently he was fine (at that point at least)!Next up was a trip to the local go-kart place where I'm given to understand his stomach didn't make it past the finishing line at the same time as the rest of his body! Oh well, you only do it once right? That's where he lost his Marilyn Monroe wig too apparently. Man, I have to get hold of some more photos!After that it was back to Max's place (he of the tattooed arm in the photo) and BBQ and partying till 5 a.m. when they all passed out until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. All good fun I guess. On a side note, Max is a friend of both my sons as they play in a band together. His father has his own plumbing business and took my youngest on as an apprentice a few years back, so technically Max is Jordan's boss too. To give credit where credit is due, Max bought a run down old house on around 10,000 square metres of land and over a period of about three years has slowly done it up to what is apparently a stunning home now. Not bad at the ripe old age of 27 but hey, he put the hard work in and is now sitting pretty, something I hope my youngest will be able to do in a few years when he has acquired more skills.After that it was Jordan's turn. He turned 25 last Wednesday so his girlfriend organized a surprise party for him at a bar about 200 metres from their home. She got him there by saying that the bar was doing a special that evening and how about they just go out for a quick drink before dinner. Well when he got there she had arranged with a whole bunch of his friends to be hiding inside the bar! Apparently they had a great evening!It's so nice that these kids have been friends for so many years and still make time to get together or go hiking or skiing when possible. The bar is called the \"684\" because it is 684 metres above sea level, just in case anyone is asking!  Oh, and the handsome young black man kneeling down in the red T-shirt is my friend, Stan's, son, the professional rugby player. And again, another party. Daniel had been chosen to play for France in the rugby sevens held in the UK the week before so his girlfriend organized another surprise party last Monday for when he got back. Lovely times indeed!In other news, I am starting to see all the little things that need fixing up in my house and realize I should get round to having them done. So a couple of weeks ago I had the chap who painted my house take a look at my external balcony, which is in a very sorry state. The cement had started to leak and the underside paint was starting to chip because of it. It didn't make any difference to the inside of the house but it was looking pretty shabby. I was therefore somewhat shocked when he came up with a quote of €1,800! I mean the balcony is probably only about 7 square metres and I am not asking him to do the barrier at all. So thinking that was a ridiculous quote I went out to the DIY place and bought a few basic supplies to have a go myself. Cost me €140 for the lot and that included some of the tools that I would need. Anyway, while I was chipping away at it my doorbell rang and my friend had sent over a guy who does work for her - reliable if a bit pushy. So I asked him to take a look but made the mistake of telling him what the other guy had quoted. His response was \"oh, that's about right, but did he mention you would have to do this, and this and this too?\" Turns out his quote would come in at around €2,000 but he \"would do a better job\"! So still not convinced, next time I went up for a drink at Stan's I happened to bump into Philippe, who is in the business, and asked him to give me a basic quote \"off the top of his head\", given that he knew my house and had already seen my balcony. He came up with about €400, and that included the supplies! When I showed him the written quote I had he nearly fell off his chair. As he said, \"they can see you coming can't they!\" I hate the thought that these people are taking advantage of me (a) because I'm a woman and (b) because I'm alone. So to make a long story short, Philippe is going to come and do it for me - we just have to set up a time.And on the subject of the balcony, the wooden barriers are also pretty shabby having been exposed to the elements for so long. My sons have a friend who has his own sheet metal business so tonight he is coming to give me a quote to get that done. My house looks out onto a dairy farm so I have an idea of what I want for the balcony itself.  What do you think?And I want him to give me a quote for putting in a gate at the side of my house. So far my gardens have been totally open but as they are building more and more in the village and I have had a little sod come into my back garden and steal my decorations (the neighbour caught him and gave him a bollocking), I think I may as well go ahead and get the gate put in. At least that way it would be \"fenced off\" from the front, even while still being open at the back, although to get into the back they would then have to go through two other neighbours' gardens. For the side gate I have seen a picture of a gate made by this same young man with a cat chasing a mouse. We'll see - I guess it depends on the price!As I said, all the little bitty things that need doing around the house have been getting to me, so amongst the pile of junk in my basement I finally managed to track down my ex' heavy duty drill. Over the course of my travels I have picked up lovely little souvenirs that I wanted put on my walls but never got round to it. Well now Jordan has shown me how to get the drill bit in right (yeah, I'm that good), last night I decided to get a few pieces put up. Trouble is, all my souvenirs stand a chance of being put up at eye level because I \"ain't getting up no ladder!\"And finally, a bit of a rant. I don't rant very often and tend to keep my political opinions to myself but I was horrified at the insensitive, oafish tweets that the tangerine buffoon posted about Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, in the aftermath of the latest atrocities. I don't remember him being so offensive to the Mayor of Manchester - oh right, Sadiq Khan is muslim, not that that's got anything to do with it of course. Thankfully, people have come out overwhelmingly in support of Sadiq Khan, who at least knows how to conduct himself with class, which is more than can be said of you-know-who! And to think he has the code to the \"big button\"! It's downright scary!"},
{"title": "Ooooh ger off mi foot!", "date": "Tuesday 30 May 2017", "text": "I was sad to learn that former Blue Peter presenter John Noakes died this week at the age of 83. I understand that he had been very ill with dementia and that it was in so many ways a relief, but I have such fond memories of watching Blue Peter as a little girl, it just seems to be the end of an era I suppose. For me, John and his lovely dog, Shep, were the highlight of the programme and if I am having vague rumblings about getting a dog when I retire, Shep is the one I want!  Rest in peace John and thank you for so many wonderful memories.John and ShepAnd the infamous elephant scene:In other news, the weather here in Geneva is absolutely glorious, if a little hot for me, so as usual it was out and about this weekend at a local flea market. I look at it as having a lovely day out for a few euros, bring home some junk, and then give most of it back to charity in about a year's time. So an economical day out, right! Sunday was the first time I had ever been up to Groisy, and I have to admit, if and when the time comes to downsize I would definitely give Groisy a thought - the only downside possibly being that it is at an even higher altitude than where I currently live so not so sure about driving on snow in later years.This photo doesn't do the view justice but ....Groisy churchWe had a wander round the flea market and while I was happy with my haul we were both glad to get out of the heat!Love the oldie-worldy lamp I picked up!And moving swiftly on, I was able to get off the bus and walk to work this morning from the train station and for once chose to walk through town to check out some of the shops. It's amazing what interesting little places you miss when you are always on the bus and I noticed quite a few \"newbie\" shops that might merit further inspection. The Geneva authorities give parts of the park over to wild flowers, which were stunningly beautiful, with some giving off a lovely perfume - so yes for once I did take time to stop and smell the roses!In other news, I have been feeling particularly lacking in energy lately (probably due to the humidity) so last week I decided to have another shot at going vegetarian. I had done this twice before many years ago, and well remember how much energy I had after the initial few days of feeling yuck. And true to form, for the first few days I am feeling a bit light headed but otherwise it hasn't been difficult so far. \"If it was so great why did you stop?\" you might ask. Well I was much younger then and was thoroughly defeated each time by a full English breakfast whenever I went home. This time who knows what will happen. I like to cook and love veg and pulses and so on, so, as I said, it hasn't been difficult so far. Just hoping one of the side-effects will be weight loss. We'll see.Oh, and I think I have found an outfit for the wedding in July. I have ordered it and everything else I have had from this company I have been very pleased with so I am keeping my fingers crossed.And finally, Anne's \"Train Wreck Tuesdays\" posts about verbal dueling with her mother got me to thinking about an only slightly related incident with my own mom many years ago. I remember being in her kitchen in Dorset when she commented that \"they don't make fridges likes they used to, you know.\" So when I asked her why she said \"see that fridge, we bought it when you were three and it's still going\"! I was about 50 at the time, so yes indeed it was impressive. Or maybe it was really that nobody liked to point out to her that the fridge had probably conked out 30 years ago, but England being cold in the summer half the time she had probably never noticed! Ah, God love her!"},
{"title": "A Time to Live", "date": "Friday 19 May 2017", "text": "US blogger Sam recently posted about the tragic sudden death of a very young and very dear friend. Quite by coincidence I had seen a trailer for a BBC documentary called \"A Time to Live\" which aired on Wednesday. It recounted the story of a group of people in the UK (around 12 I think - I didn't count) who had all been diagnosed with terminal illnesses and had been given XX number of months/years to live. While I'm sure to most of us that would be a horrific experience, the way the documentary unfolded, while it was indeed terribly sad, it was also thought-provoking and strangely uplifting.If I remember right, the youngest person they interviewed was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 23. The oldest (that I remember) was a gentleman of 69. All were sad that they would not get more time with their loved ones, and some with younger children were very concerned about making sure they would be ok once that parent died. But the over-riding emotion that seemed to emanate from all of these people was gratitude for the chance to really live life to the full! Sounds weird I know. So I started writing down comments that they made to try to make sense of it all afterwards, and here are just a few (paraphrased as best I can remember them).One lady, upon learning her diagnosis, talked to her children and with their agreement left her husband of 28 years to travel, indulge in her passion for art and learn salsa. It wasn't quite as \"clinical\" as it sounds and she and her husband both moved on but .....\"It allows you to do things instead of just dreaming about doing them\"!Another young woman was asked if she would like to go back in time with the possibility of \"eternal life\" (well, as \"eternal\" as any of us have it). She thought for a minute and said \"if 'eternal life' meant going back to how I was living before then no, I don't want it. All the stress and rushing around just living to work, and so on - no, I don't want it. Not now I really know what it feels like to be alive\"!One man who was naturally devastated at being told that his illness was terminal \"started to shuffle\", like the sick person that he now was! He was \"a sick old man\" so he knew he had to \"shuffle\". And then he decided that he bloody well didn't have to shuffle - or indeed have his behaviour conform to any particular way of being just because he was sick! So he started running constantly. I get the impression he was a runner anyway, but he explained how wonderful and \"full of life\" he felt when he ran despite being \"terminal\". I don't remember the proper name but he entered \"the great desert race\" not knowing whether he would still be alive when the time came. He was and he completed it! To him, the fact of enrolling was the important thing - finishing it was very much secondary.Another lady said it was a blessing knowing that her time was \"finite\" because it allowed her to put all her affairs in order - but more importantly sort the children's photos for them and slip little messages on postcards in amongst their photos for when they would feel sad or lonely.There was an overriding positivity to them all. \"Knowing how long you have gives you a game plan/clarity, and reinforces the gift of life when you realize it is finite\"!And lastly, an older lady who had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, seemed like she had been a heck of a character during her life, a frequent traveller and a \"grab life by the horns\" kind of person. So after diagnosis she joined a group of solo-travelling women and continued to travel as long as her health would allow. Then she met up with them in the UK in her wheelchair when she was no longer able to travel. She said she had \"no intention of seeing this disease through to the end\" but would be travelling to Dignitas in Switzerland when the time came to end her own life. Her sadness was that she would have to do this \"before she was ready\" because after that she would no longer be well enough to travel. Her final comment was that she would have liked to have remained in her own home and \"do it here\" (in the UK) but sadly it is not (yet) legal.As I said, very sad, thought-provoking, but incredibly uplifting too.The narrator's final words were that all these people had made the choice to live life to the full knowing that their time was running out. And she (the narrator) had also made a choice to not tell her audience the names of those who had died since the documentary had been filmed. The right decision I think. RIP those who have passed!"},
{"title": "I'll have what she's having!", "date": "Wednesday 17 May 2017", "text": "As I mentioned previously my brother, his son and son's gf came out last week for a long weekend, and although rotten weather was forecast we actually didn't do too bad - for one day at least - and then not so bad on the others. As their first day here was warm and sunny I decided to head up to Lac des Confins. Despite appearances (see the snow in the background) it was actually beautiful and Lady Luck was yet again on our side as the restaurant I wanted to take them to was open for the last day before it closes until July. Their busy season (cross-country skiing in this case) has just wound down so they take a few weeks off before gearing up for the lesser, summer season.Not the greatest picture of me and my brother but we were looking into the sun!Linda, Darren, Anna and PhilWe then drove down to my favourite ski resort of La Clusaz and while it was also pretty much closed up for the season it was still very pretty. After that we picnicked a bit further down the road (Nathalie, sorry I couldn't get a picture of the \"Thônes\" signpost for you but traffic was diverted and we ended up taking the \"even more scenic route\" - i.e. we got lost), arriving in Annecy to spend a few hours walking round the old town before my kids were to join us later for a dinner-dance boat trip around Lake Annecy. It turned into a bit of a nail-biter as my oldest and his wife (that still sounds so funny to me to be saying that) were driving from Geneva after work and he called to say that the traffic was horrendous but he \"hoped to make it before the boat set sail\". Crikey, I mean there is no leeway in that is there - you either make it before the boat leaves or you don't! But as luck would have it, they made it with minutes to spare, and what a lovely trip that was. You know, I came to Geneva in 1980 and have been to Annecy many, many times but have never taken a boat trip. We always stay up one end of the lake when we visit - but what a mistake that was as the \"far end\" is stunning. As this was the beginning of the season for the boat operators there was barely anyone on board so we more or less had it to ourselves. The food and service was excellent - I can't say it was overly expensive for what we got, and when we reached the far end of the lake the little town was all lit up and very beautiful. I can't believe I have never done that trip before in all these years. After dinner, a lady got up to sing and again, it was a real treat. I hate to have to shout over loud music to talk and hate it even more if it isn't my type of music, but she was excellent, not too loud, and seemed to sing just the right combination of songs in different languages to keep everyone happy. When we got back to port we could have stayed on board to dance until 1.00 a.m. but since no-one was really up for that we all headed home.  My eldest and Darren talked \"politics\", as is their want, but it was really nice to see them all get to know each other better. I also took a few of those \"helium balloon\" photos of everyone so we all had a good laugh.  I'll try to post a few when I get my act together. But it really was a lovely, lovely evening.Just before the boat sets offThen on the Saturday we headed off to Lavey-les-Bains. It was raining so my concern was that if there were storms we would not be allowed in the hot springs, but again as luck would have it, while it rained there were no storms so we got to spend a few hours there. My youngest had suggested that instead of taking my usual route along the north bank of Lake Geneva it would be shorter to go through Chamonix and down to Martigny. At Chamonix we decided to stop and have some lunch and here it did rain quite a bit but we had a lovely lunch anyway and got to see the cable cars taking supplies (and a few hardy tourists I imagine) up to the top of the Mont Blanc/Aiguille du Midi.Aiguille du MidiSince this wasn't my usual route to Lavey I ended up going the wrong direction on the motorway for quite a while but we made it in the end, although I think we were all tired of being on the road at that point. So on the way back we decided to skip stopping off at Evian in favour of just getting home and getting out of our wet clothes.On the last full day of their visit the weather picked up a little. It wasn't great but at least it wasn't raining so we were able to get out to Sixt Fer à Cheval and Cascade de Rouget.This is what Fer à Cheval looks like on a good dayDarren and Linda - not so bad weather really!At Cascade de RougetOn Monday before I was to take them back to the airport we had a little time to kill so we decided to stop in at Yvoire, which is just starting to open up for the season, followed by a quick stop in Geneva's old town for coffee before heading out to the airport.YvoireWe almost came a cropper though because as we headed out for the airport we became aware of a strong smell of smoke, only to discover that one of the hotels being renovated in central Geneva had gone up in flames. Emergency services had closed the roads but luckily we were early enough that I was able to take another route (and no-one was injured in the fire).This was my brother's first trip since he lost his wife last year and I think it did him the world of good. He and his son kept joking (I hope) about leaving clothes and toiletries behind for \"when they move out here\" - yikes! I told them Brexit was gonna be really, really hard and I wasn't sure the French were going to let any more Brits in ever again - not sure they bought it though!After the excitement of that weekend last weekend was back to normal. I had driven up to my youngest's to get him to sign his US tax declaration and then my friend and I decided to take a trip out to a vide-grenier (car boot/garage sale) near him.  There wasn't much of interest there, to be honest, but I did pick up a nice little dish with a smaller dish embedded into it (you know, where you serve olives and there is a little dish to put the stones). After that we had heard that there was a \"garden sale\" up at Combloux and since we had tried to make it to Combloux several times in the past and got lost we decided to give it another shot - and WOW - just WOW! I had obviously been to/through Combloux years ago when I used to ski in Megève, but I had totally forgotten how spectacular it is.ComblouxMy little haul!And finally (gosh don't I yack on!) on Monday night I had my weekly sewing club. One of the ladies showed up late as she \"there was a radio programme on about sex toys and she wanted to listen to the end of it\"! Now all of these ladies are older than me so you can imagine how that was greeted. The other ladies were in uproar and the conversation definitely took a \"turn for the worse\". I won't go into great detail but to say it was ribald would be an understatement. And you think men are bad - they ain't got nothing on little old ladies! In fact, in a previous post I had mentioned that sometimes when I go to my local fabric store, if I can't get a parking place I have to park round the corner at the Easy Love sex store! Well I think the evening ended with a kinda \"Charlies' Angels pact\" where all us little old ladies are gonna go to the fabric store together and then do a \"granny sortie\" into the sex store (the subject of another post I imagine).And last night, was my final - for this year - once-a-month patchwork lesson in Cluses. The ladies there got to talking about the French Presidential election. To be fair it was really interesting as I didn't know much about all the candidates and these ladies had some interesting views. But eventually they got to discussing the new (39-year old) President, Emmanuel Macron, and his 64-year old wife, Brigitte. The discussion was more along the lines of \"like him or not give him a chance to actually do something\" and for the most part the conversation was cautiously optimistic. But, of course, inevitably, the conversation got around to the 24-year age difference with his wife. These ladies were all for it, even if the conversation, yet again, turned somewhat ribald in the kinda \"I'll have what she's having\" kind of way. And this being France and a sewing class, the new First Lady's outfit was put under the microscope. For me the colour was beautiful but it was way too short (she's got knobbly knees) and to be honest she ruined the look as she struggled to walk in six-inch stilettos over the cobbled stones of the Elysee Palace. (On that note, I once saw a picture of Sarah Jessica Parker in killer heels hobbling like a cane toad over an icy New York pavement and she looked ridiculous - and I love SJP)! France's new First LadyYeah, yeah, I know, women always get judged on their looks and nobody ever comments on the also 24-year age difference between the tangerine buffoon with the haystack hair and the US First Lady! But like I said, these ladies' comments were pretty darn positive, though I'm not sure I'd like to be 64 years old with a 39 year-old husband and subject to all that scrutiny! Could someone pass me my fluffy slippers please!"},
{"title": "What we women have to put up with!", "date": "Monday 1 May 2017", "text": "At my latest gynae check up last week he pointed out that it was time for another mamo (every two years in my case). I know we all have to go through these things but really .... don't we women have to put up with it! I had dropped my son and his girlfriend off at the airport on Friday and have to pick them up again tonight, so had to bring the car in to work. I hate driving into Geneva and much prefer to get the bus at the border so I can ignore the traffic and read. But today being 1st May and a holiday in France (but not in Switzerland) I thought it would be a good time to try to get a mamo booked up, reasoning that traffic would still be fairly calm today. And wonder of wonders, I managed to get an early morning slot. My appointment was at the clinic where I had my youngest almost 25 years ago and I have to say it is still just as luxurious. I mean, if you have to be in hospital if there is a bit of luxury so much the better right?  In Switzerland we have privatized medicine and by law everyone has to have medical insurance. I am lucky enough to have very good coverage through my employer so have the luxury of being able to use Swiss facilities. I can use French facilities also of course but since I lived in Switzerland previously I have kept some of my main doctors here. The other thing is everything is to hand in Geneva - hospitals, clinics, specialists etc. whereas in France it means running all over the place as they are much further spread out. Of course they are also one quarter of the price of Swiss medical facilities but you can also end up waiting months to get an appointment, so for the time being I will be sticking this side of the border.Up till now I have always had female radiologists but I don't know why I was so surprised to get a young man this time. I know it's no big deal but I was just a bit surprised. And of course there is always the ignominy of him crawling under the machine to try to push my boobs into the right position for the x-ray. I suppose it could be worse - I mean, if there was a fire alarm while your boob was stuck in that thing then what do you do? Of course he and the doctor were obviously extremely professional but yuck ... I hate those bloody things. Still, it is better to be safe than sorry I guess and I do understand how lucky I am that these things are routinely covered by my insurance.  I also realize I am lucky in that being \"stacked\" the mamograms don't hurt either. Some colleagues have told me that it is agony, but for me not a bit of it. In fact one friend described it as \"open the fridge door, stick your boob in, then slam the door\"! She frightened me half to death as I had never had one at that point but now I know it's no big deal!Anyway, enough about my boobs. One of my new year's resolutions for 2015 was to join a hiking group. I live in perfect hiking country and rarely ever do any walking, so I actually went out and joined three groups. Problem is, I don't think I was specific enough in my resolution 'cos it turns out you actually have to turn up for these hikes, not just join the group! Damn, who would have thought! Trouble is, I am so unfit that what the locals consider \"easy\" is usually enough to have me on my knees so I wanted to start off really slowly. The other week a colleague mentioned that our local villages had organized their annual hike and did we want to go. So in for a penny, I said yes. It was advertised as being 13 km long but I knew it wasn't going to be a flat 13 km. Nevertheless, three of us set off on Sunday morning to join up with the group. I was quite proud of myself actually because Sunday morning I really didn't want to go, but I knew I wasn't going to be able to think up an excuse fast enough. So we set off to pick up our paperwork from a very well organized meeting spot and headed off. On one side of Lake Geneva are the alps (the side where I live) and on the other side are the Jura mountains, and kinda slap bang in the middle is the Salève. The first part of our hike was up the Petit Salève, which actually wasn't too bad.SalèveThen back down to one of the local villages where soup was available for those who wanted it. At the entrance to the \"soup kitchen\" there was a display of old photos and a lovely elderly man representing \"Friends of Old Monnetier\" who took the time to explain all the old photos to anyone who was interested.  The trip back through the villages was lovely with tons of wisteria everywhere - apparently the area is known for it. At one point we came across a house with a plaque on it saying that Richard Wagner and John Ruskin had lived here (although not together!).View of the alps from Petit SalèveWagner wrote Walkyrie hereI suppose in the olden days it was common for wealthy people to travel to various beauty spots to take the air, take the water, etc.. The Salève would most likely have been visited for its pure air and is en route to Chamonix/Mont Blanc, although what we would cover in probably 90 minutes by car must have taken them days!  On the way down we came across a lovely tree stump that someone had taken the time to make into a \"hobbit house\"!After that we headed back towards another village called Esery. This was somewhat flatter but at this point we were starting to flag.On the road to EserySince it was no longer \"fun\" we decided to call it a day. So we trecked back to K's house where she had tea and the most wonderful apricot and almond cake waiting. While we didn't make the full circuit (we managed about 11 km), I think we were all pleased with what we managed to achieve for our first outing. The old bones are creaking a bit this morning though!"},
{"title": "Mental health", "date": "Friday 28 April 2017", "text": "Most evenings, if I'm not going out, it is usually around 9 p.m. by the time I sit down for the evening. Last night I saw that the second part of \"Mind Over Marathon\" was on, so I sat down to watch it. It had caught my eye a couple of weeks ago so I had set it to record but hadn't got round to watching the first part, therefore I won't know the whole story until I watch that tonight. From what I gather from the second part, seemingly the documentary team had recruited 10 people with \"mental health issues\" last year and started them on a training schedule with a view to running the London Marathon.The London Marathon took place on 23 April - St. George's Day (the patron saint of England - you know the guy that killed the dragon).St. GeorgeOf course there were the usual wonderful nutters dressed up as dinosaurs and so on, and many, superb individual achievements. I have nothing but respect for the people that give it their all and do this!This runner almost collapsed 150 metres out, so another runner helped him across the line!People can and do run in aid of any charity they wish but the official charity this year, supported by Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, was \"Heads Together\" - a mental illness charity.  Without having seen the first part of the documentary, I believe all ten of the people in training had suffered from some kind of mental issue. The one man who dropped out seemed to suffer from agoraphobia, some from depression, but the one that really touched me was a lady whose three year old son had died from pneumonia - and five days later her devastated husband committed suicide as a result!  It was horrendous, but she wanted to run the marathon in aid of the charity and to do something for herself after living through such a devastating turn of events.The documentary follows the group's training, their ups and downs, over a period of six months, and then at the great day itself. Kate, Wills and Harry came out to see them in training at one point and then were there to officially start the race as well as cheering the runners on throughout the race. It was such a moving documentary. I don't think I'm giving much away by saying that the chappie with agoraphobia dropped out BUT - and this is a a big BUT - he was able to travel down to London on the train by himself to cheer the others on, so he was also one of the success stories, but in a different way. It was a very moving, feel good documentary and well worth an hour of your time if you want to get motivated!On a slightly less impressive note, I am enrolled with two friends on a 13 km walk this weekend. I think the organizers' aim is to promote local cuisine, farms, cheeses etc. so the walk will follow a route where the walkers are welcomed to various pit stops along the route. 13 km doesn't sound that much to me but as my friend pointed out, \"you do realize how hilly it is round here don't you\"?!!! I mean, we live in the alps so chances are it wasn't going to be flat was it!! Oh well, we will play it by ear and I will report later.As I mentioned previously, I went on a \"Persian cookery course\" on Wednesday night and while it was a great improvement over the vegan course I had taken, I was a little disappointed in the dishes we cooked. Oh, the lady demonstrator was great, very dynamic, but somehow the dishes disappointed. I can't help feeling there are much more tasty dishes than that in (in this case Iranian) cuisine!  Still, at least I got to see certain techniques and use a few ingredients I hadn't used before. Sometime ago I bought a beautiful cookery book by British-born Israeli Yotam Ottolenghi, so hopefully I will be able to use a little of the knowledge gained on Wednesday night in some of the wonderful recipes in his book.And finally, this morning I dropped my youngest and his girlfriend off at the airport as they are spending a long weekend at a friend's in Brussels! Gotta try their wonderful beer, if you go to Brussels. I don't know Brussels much but I understand it is beautiful. I will know more when they get back. So on that note, I wish you all a wonderful weekend and if I don't get back from this walk by 10 p.m. on Sunday please send out a search party!"},
{"title": "Say cheese!", "date": "Wednesday 26 April 2017", "text": "Nathalie's comment on my last post about \"save a piece of reblochon for me\" got me to thinking about cheese (as you do). This might sound like heresy but I am not a great fan of cheese for some reason. A little is fine but I suspect I might have an intolerance because too much cheese (hard cheese in particular) brings me out in a sweat! Weird right. Chocolate has the same effect so I really do think it might be a slight lactose intolerance. Anyway, that being said, I think my most favourite food in all the world has got to be tartiflette! It is pure, unadulterated stodge that sticks to your ribs and turns the world into an even more beautiful place than it already is.TartifletteTraditionally tartiflette is is an alpine dish made to be eaten after many hours hard skiing or, in my case, after a day sitting around on my backside during the winter then looking for a treat to cheer myself up. I did used to ski many moons ago but as I found happy hour starting earlier and earlier when I had to sit around looking after my toddler I kinda gave up. I was never very good anyway - extremely enthusiastic but not an awful lot of control! But tartiflette .... a slice of heaven on earth. Strangely enough, local folklore has it that fondue is a Swiss invention and raclette a French invention, but I understand I might be committing heresy here.Anyway, tartiflette is traditionally made using a local cheese called reblochon. Very creamy, pretty smelly but delicious.I remember one year deciding to drive to England when my kids were about eight and four (I must be mad - about 1,000 km with two young kids in the car) and I decided to take some reblochon cheese with me so I could make tartiflette for my parents. Despite my best efforts, the car was pretty stinky with the cheese in the back but we made it all the way to the port at Cherbourg, parked the car and I had just got out to stretch my legs when my youngest threw up all over the back seat!!!! I mean, we had, at that point, just driven about 800 km and he waited till we stopped at the port to throw up over the seats! Not even a chance of opening the window or stepping out of the car - no, it all went over the seats. So I cleaned up as best I could but when we pulled onto the ferry he did it again. I can tell you no-one wanted to park next to us, with the smell of sick and cheese everywhere. Luckily I always took a cabin so I was able to hose the kids down but the car .... not so much!Talking of insanity, when I was on maternity leave with my youngest I again decided \"it would be fun\" to drive to England to spend some time with my family. My youngest was about six weeks old at the time so we were just starting to get into some kind of routine at night. The oldest was four so I had to make frequent potty stops along the way and to feed the baby. At one point I was in a service station and was a bit stuck. I needed to use the loo and I needed to take the baby with me. Of course I couldn't leave the four-year-old either so I decided I would take him with me into the ladies but started drilling into him that he waited outside the door for me and \"no matter what, he was to stay there. And even if the nice man or lady offered him some candy, he was to stay there. I would be less than one minute, but he was to stay there\". You get the idea. So just as I was going into the toilet I said \"so what do you say if the nice lady offers you some candy to walk away with her?\" And he looked at me and said \"merci beaucoup?\"! I give up! Anyway, I got to pee and nobody kidnapped him so I guess all's well that ends well right, although horror of horrors, on the way back the ringroad around Paris was closed so I had to drive through central Paris with a newborn and a four-year old! You gotta be young, or insane, or both!As I mentioned before, cheese (and to a lesser extent chocolate) disagrees with me on occasion, sometimes more dramatically than others (if you know what I mean). Anyway, before I married my ex I dated a young man who, at the time, was a medical student. He qualified while we were together and eventually became a surgeon. He asked me to marry him but I refused even though he was adorable and a very decent man, but I just felt that he was too \"staid\" for me, despite us having spent five very happy years together. Anyway, Karim and I split and I married my ex. When I came back to Geneva, a friend's son had to have emergency surgery on  Easter Sunday and her husband recognized Karim from years before. That set the wheels in motion for him getting in touch with me. We have had lunch a couple of times and agreed to meet up for dinner one evening. He is married and it was all perfectly above board - we are just old friends. So we agreed to meet in my local town and had a really pleasant evening. I ordered tartiflette and guess what - the \"unfortunate reaction\" kicked in!!! TMI, I know, but I was dropping Karim back at his car when I felt my stomach start to rumble. I knew I then had to show him the way to get back onto the motorway so I dropped him at his car and shot off like a bat out of hell towards the motorway. Considering we had just spent a lovely evening together when I kicked him forcibly out of my car without hardly saying goodbye he must have wondered what the hell had happened😌! I was so stressed that I actually got lost on the back roads (the same back roads I have been driving round for the last 28 years) and only just made it home!! Bloody hell. Still, I think we are good enough friends that I can explain what happened next time I see him - he is a doctor after all!And finally, my youngest in particular was never a great fan of cheese but as his tastes have changed he has started to develop a liking for it. Not so long ago they drove up to Alsace to see Jen's grandparents (about a six-seven hour drive) and he called me to say that they had introduced him to the greatest cheese - \"it's called abondance\" - which they make in a place called Abondance, which is about 20 minutes from here!!!! Kids!!And Nathalie, talking of Les Flottins, I wrote a post about the exhibition in Evian over New Year (see my post dated 4 January). It was beautiful.  Am off to a Persian cookery class tonight organized by Migros (the local equivalent of Wal-Mart). The vegan cookery course we went to wasn't so great but I have high hopes of this one. Will let you know how it goes."},
{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Tuesday 25 April 2017", "text": "My whole little spiel yesterday about people's behaviour on buses was brought about by what was quite a funny incident yesterday morning - and then I forgot to mention it. I think I'm becoming a bit batty but I don't actually mind. Truth be told I'm actually quite enjoying  that side of getting older!After the chaos of digging up my garden last weekend I spent about four hours on Saturday pressure spraying my terrace to get a year's worth of accumulated muck off it. I don't mind doing this at all as it is so instantly satisfying but, while the weather was beautifully sunny there was quite a strong wind, so standing outside soaking wet all afternoon ended up with my feeling like I had been kicked in the kidneys by the time Sunday rolled around. I knew then that I had better get back to exercising as it instantly relieves the aches and pains and lifts my mood. Anyway, yesterday morning the weather was nice and I made it to the Mont Blanc bridge in good time to be able to hop off the bus and walk the last 30 minutes to work. Just as I was waiting to get off the bus, however, I spotted a woman sitting close to the door - about my age but much heavier set - and noticed a big white label sticking out of her top - she had got her top on inside out. What to do? I guess it's like do you tell a man that his fly is undone or what? Well to be honest, if it was a male colleague I would most likely tell him his zip's slipped but a stranger? So the question was do I tell this lady or not? In the end I decided it was kinder to discreetly let her know.  She was obviously embarrassed - although to be honest it's easily done right - but I was very discreet about it, so it was all the more amazing to me that she promptly turned round, took her top off and put it on the right way - all while sitting on the bus!! Now even I wouldn't have done that as it wasn't so glaringly obvious her top was inside out. Wow! I mean, she did have a kind of thermal undershirt on but all the same to just sit there in your bra and vest .... there's nowt so queer as folk!Anyway, this morning I again made it to the bridge in time to hop off the bus and start walking to work - only for the heavens to open up and me to have to do a runner up a back street where I ended up catching the same bus a bit further along. The bus has to go round via the train station so by cutting through the back streets I was able to catch the same one - the driver must have thought I had gone nuts though! At least, just walking that short distance allowed me to see how far the park people had come along with their planting already. Beautiful!And talking of bad backs, it's like the walking wounded here at work right now. The boss of my unit is Danish. He has two young children and this being spring break he and his family went away for a few days. They arrived back from their trip late Monday evening exhausted, all the more so since they had to hang around at the airport because their luggage had got lost. Now lost luggage is not the end of the world but when you have small children in tow it isn't pleasant. I was asking him this morning how things were going and he commented that his mother-in-law had arrived back ahead of them \"so that she can spend the rest of the week finishing my sentences\".   Eeew, anyone else sense that all's not quite quiet on the western front? Actually I think he is going through a rough time at the moment as the kids seem to have been continually sick, his wife has come down with some kind of virus but has to go into work today (short-term contract) and mother-in-law is in the house to crack the whip!!! Yikes, Not sure living alone is so bad now! Then C, my other colleague who I work most closely with, started walking round clutching his back. He is a runner and particularly in periods of intense stress needs to run to keep his stress levels down. Only thing is he hurt his leg and hasn't been able to run for a while, and now seems to have put his back out - something he again puts down to stress.  Crikey, if it goes on like this much longer I will soon be the \"last (wo)man standing\" (chocolate being my preferred form of stress relief)!In other matters, last night I had my regular Monday night sewing club. I am working on two projects - tote bags for my sons' girlfriend/wife - and the one I was working on last night is really intricate. I enjoy all the embroidery/bead work but goodness, I worked for two solid hours last night and only finished a small section of the bag. Talk about over-estimating how much you can get through. Then when I got home my brother (the one who just lost his wife) had left me a phone message. You can see more and more how much his wife used to do because I don't think Phil has ever used an answering machine before. The message was something like \"START OF MESSAGE, I've got my euros so am all set for next week. STOP. Looking forward to it. STOP. Will try you again tomorrow. STOP. END OF MESSAGE\"! It makes him sound like a resistance fighter in World War II leaving cryptic messages for the Allies in sodding morse code! Aaah, bless him!And finally, Sunday was the first round of the French elections - which proved interesting to say the least. It ended up with centrist - Macron - going through to the final round with right wing Marine Le Pen. What a weird situation that is. I mean, picture elections in the UK where neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party made it through to the final round - or in the US where the Republican and Democratic parties were scuppered in the initial stages!!! That's what we are dealing with here in France.  I would have bet against Trump getting in and I would have bet against Brexit so you can see how well my political instincts are honed, so while I would say the right wing Le Pen will never get in - who the heck knows!!!  Of course, the fact that Macron's wife is 25 years older than him has given plenty of fodder to the gutter press. But hey, does anyone remember the uproar about Trump being 100 years older than Melania? No, me neither!  I guess we will just have to wait and see then!"},
{"title": "On the buses!", "date": "Monday 24 April 2017", "text": "I have mentioned before that I really dislike having someone eating their breakfast or whatever when sitting next to me on the bus. Maybe it's just me - I guess we all have our little niggles right - but I hate the elbows in the ribs and the smell of someone's breakfast all within 10 inches of my nose that early in the morning. I posted previously that there is a chap who gets on and always has his tuna-mayo sandwich followed by a slice of pizza and coffee, so you get a varied array of smells depending on how far along his route we are. Well on Friday the guy sitting next to me seemed to have a bottomless pit for a bag. First the crackers, then the sandwich, then the banana, followed by more crackers then another banana - in the end I had to smile because it just put me in mind of the scene where Mr. Bean is sitting an exam and has the never-ending bag of supplies, or indeed Mary Poppins' bottomless bag (you see, I really am easily amused)! The only thing missing from this banquet was the flip-down table!Whinging apart, there are worse places than Geneva to be on a bus, as witnessed by the elderly couple on the bus on Friday evening. The gent didn't seem to be completely with it and it was obviously the lady's job to take care of him. Immediately people jumped up and helped him to a seat while the lady was trying to explain to him that she would be getting off at the Museum as she was going to Paulette's but that he must get off at the next stop and make his way home. He seemed a little confused but I have seen them on the bus before and I guess this is the way it rolls for them - it can't be easy for either of them. Anyway, the lady got off and when the gent went to follow her a couple of young men stopped him and explained that \"she was going to see Paulette and that he should get off at the next stop\", and then took it upon themselves to make sure he got off safely at the right stop, at which point he seemed to get his bearings. Sad really, but at least there were decent people around to take care of him. I make no judgement on the lady (his wife?) leaving him on the bus as I would guess this is their norm, for the time being at least, until one day it won't be!I also mentioned in a post in January about a young cyclist (she was 27 I think) who had been killed on my bus route having gone underneath the wheels of a truck as it was turning. Her loved ones put up a tribute which still remains, although the dead flowers have now been replaced by candles. What amazed me though is that a cycling helmet had been left amongst the tributes, and three months later it is still there - no-one has taken it! It warms the heart a little, I must say.In other matters, I had great plans for the Easter weekend, none of which came to fruition because, apart from being woken up at 4.40 a.m. by a telemarketing company, unbeknownst to me my neighbour had set up with his friend to come over with his digger to dig out the ditch which would re-channel the underground springs in the garden. So I was woken up to that unexpected joy at 8 a.m! This is what my back garden looked like over Easter, and where I spent my time humping stones out of the ditch in order for them to lay the piping. Happy days! Still, to be fair, it ended up costing us less than half what our other neighbours paid!My sister made some smart-arsed comment about how if I really didn't want them to visit in July I should just tell them rather than digging a moat, but I explained that while the ditch was for the underground springs I thought the anti-tank guns out front would suffice to keep them away!This is the top end of my garden leading down to the neighbours' where the springs would have ended up if I had gone ahead and started without them. I don't have much land (and for that I am thankful) but am lucky enough to have the field behind which is agricultural land so even better. I think I only have about 350 square metres, but frankly that is more than enough. It's sad really but when we first moved in in 1990 the farmer was selling a riding lawnmower and my ex desperately wanted to buy it! I mean, you have a plot of land about as big as three handkerchiefs and he wants a riding lawnmower!!!! And worse still, I would have given in and let him get it if we had had the money, but having just bought a house and paid for a move from Switzerland to France we were broke! How stupid would he (we) have looked on a riding lawnmower having to do a 350-point turn just to turn around and go in the other direction!!! I don't know if it was just because he was used to that kind of thing in the U.S. where people have bigger gardens but really .........????? He also bought a ruddy great roto-tiller to turn over a patch of ground as big as my underwear so we could grow veggies (my 80-year old neighbour just leaned on his shovel and smiled benignly). And then the lawnmower - everyone else's cost maybe €400 and we had to have one that cost €2,000!!  I never did understand but I sure as heck discovered pretty fast why we never had any money! More importantly, he never took care of anything so it really was money down the drain. When he moved back to the States and left me to empty the farmhouse he had rented, he had three strimmers/weed whackers rusting in the garage and he didn't even have a garden of any description! Nothing. He had, I think, four rose bushes at the side of the house, no grass at all, and that was it!  One day, he came to the house and said he needed to borrow the aforementioned expensive lawnmower. When I asked what for he said he \"needed it\" but I knew he was just going to give it to one of his buddies so I said his buddy could borrow it when he replaced the hedge trimmer he had lent him last time which he then broke and never replaced! Grrrr, those bloody mates drove me nuts - but at least I don't have to deal with them any more.And on a slightly different note, in connection with a programme on UK TV about people who were living \"mortgage free\", Jane over at Shoestring Cottage was talking about \"saving money\" and one of her commentators mentioned the moneysavingexpert.com website where you can calculate how much interest you would save by making overpayments on your mortgage. I started overpaying my mortgage three years ago but couldn't be bothered to work out the back details so I input my info as though I was starting overpaying this month and - just wow! According to their calculation table, I would save myself around €72,000 and almost eight years on the mortgage by doing this. When I did a rough estimate of the three years that I didn't take into count I reckon it will be nearer €100,000! Just wow!And finally, it's a small world isn't it? I follow Anne's blog at New Happenings at the Table. She is based in Alabama and one of the ladies who commented on her blog (Nathalie) put in a mention to me about how, while she lives in Florida, her dad lives just up the road from me in a place called Thônes! Blogging world really is small isn't it!"},

Nobody answered so I called back and got an answering message for \"Media something or other\" who are doing a survey on my media use!!!!! I have no idea how they got my mobile number  - probably just random computer dialing but bloody hell!

{"title": "Oh to be creative!", "date": "Wednesday 12 April 2017", "text": "This week is one of the weeks where I have sewing evenings twice in one week. Every Monday night I go to one of two sewing clubs - I have to alternate as they both meet on Monday - and then once a month I have my actual patchwork lesson on a Tuesday in a town called Cluses. I love these lessons because patchwork is something that I have always been fascinated by and I have to admit I'm improving, albeit very slowly. I'm not a natural by any means and I really don't see myself as creative because I depend on my teacher an awful lot to help pick out and coordinate colours and so on. It's a gift I wish I had but I genuinely don't. Of course when Lydie puts it all together I think \"oh yes, that's perfect, why didn't I see that\"! Of course it's her job to be creative and how she makes her living but again I wish I had that creativity naturally!Our last project was working with jelly rolls (I am still in the process of making a quilt with my last effort) and at the moment we are making a cloth bag with all kinds of appliqué, embroidery and decorations on it. Last night our teacher started showing us how to use rubber stamps/dies. When I was thinking about writing a post about this I was talking to my colleague and we realized that in French a rubber stamp is called a \"tampon\" so I was chatting away to her and explaining how we had been using \"tampons\" to put pictures onto different fabrics and so on. It's weird when you live outside of your own country for any length of time because you end up effectively losing some of your own language and speaking - in my case - Franglais. For instance, a collapsible plastic crate (that you might use for carrying groceries) is called a \"cagette\", a basement is a \"cave\" and so on and when you can't instantly think of a word in English you just use the French word because everyone understands anyway. I noticed my sister (who lives in Denmark) does this also, just throwing Danish words into the conversation when she can't think of the English word. Anyway, if I ever start writing about making pretty pictures with tampons will someone please send me a comment!Well my project is coming along pretty well and I picked out a few images to rubber stamp onto my fabric which I will later embroider. Lydie was explaining that you have to be careful to wipe off excess ink before you press it onto your fabric as it will run and spoil the look. So I explained that many, many years ago, when I first came to Geneva, I worked in the Budget Unit and was responsible for sending out hundreds of invoices which were all typed on the typewriter and had as many as six carbon copies. Well one time I must have been using carbon paper and touched my upper lip. Nobody said anything to me but as I walked down the corridor my friend gave the Nazi salute and walked off. I had no idea what she was on about until I walked into the bathroom and saw ...Of course the obvious choice of photo there would have been Hitler but there's no place in my blog for him, so better Charlie Chaplin I think. And to think they had let me walk around all afternoon looking like this .....I am usually pretty tired by the time I get home from this class as I go straight there from work and get home around 11 pm. So last night I was brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed when the phone rang and it was BLOODY TELEMARKETING COLD CALLERS! I get at least three a day and I was furious that they had the nerve to call at that time of night. OK I wasn't in bed yet but they didn't know that! Unfortunately, by the time I had picked up ready to give them a piece of my mind they had hung up. I had looked into getting a phone that could block calls but the only model that seemed to fit the bill didn't have a very good write-up as an actual phone, despite having the facility to block certain numbers. And the problem of course is that these buggers just keep changing numbers anyway. Since they are usually calling from an overseas call centre I can't block them through France Telecom either and for some reason I can't get my phone to switch to \"silent\". So when I want to have a siesta at the week-end I now have to turn the bloody phone off! These people are a real pest, and while for me they are more of just a nuisance, I can easily understand how older, more vulnerable people can be bamboozled by them. Ugh!!"},
{"title": "KABUT!", "date": "Monday 10 April 2017", "text": "Car boot (garage sale/yard sale) season has started up again, only over here they call them \"vide-gerniers\" (attic emptiers). And yes I know I don't need more \"stuff\" because I already have way too much of it to begin with it, but I like to think of it as having a nice afternoon out at very low cost while temporarily \"renting\" the stuff I purchase before handing it back to the charity shop! Convoluted much? Anyway, this Sunday was one of my favourites, at a place called Thyez, which is about 20 minutes from home. It is set in a stunning location and the good weather meant that the place was packed.ThyezThere were quite a few families around picnicing and I thought what a lovely place to let the kids have a run and burn off some energy (says she looking back fondly to our afternoons in the local park with just a bottle of water and jam sandwiches). I can see why parents want to get the kids out running around for sure!  There were also the usual food and drinks vendors and the lovely restaurant where my friend and I had eaten last year, but this time it seemed to be fully booked. Not to worry though, as neither of us were hungry anyway.To be honest, there wasn't an awful lot of stuff that interested me, although that didn't stop me from buying of course. My friend found a beautiful candle-holder similar to one she had picked up in Mexico a few years ago - man, I wish I had beaten her to it - it was really pretty!So here is my haul.I picked up the lovely picture in the background for €2. I may (or may not) repaint the frame but think I would like to hang it in the spare bedroom. The two \"coils\" in the front are actually belts for me. I needed belts because mine are starting to fall to pieces (probably pulling them too tight to get them round my belly) and yes, I know, who the heck wants a plastic \"Noddy car\"? Well me, it turns out! When my oldest was little he was car mad (as was the youngest, to be honest) but his absolute \"favourite car in all the world\" was \"doggy car\". It was a yellow plastic car with Dougal the dog from the Magic Roundabout driving it (a bit like this one only the other two \"passengers\" had fallen out).Doggy car went everywhere and the little bugger actually managed to throw it off our third floor balcony the day we were moving from Switzerland to France. It landed in gorse bushes and guess who ended up scrabbling around looking for doggy car while the movers just looked on in amazement. But hell, there was no way I was \"emigrating\" without doggy car! I found it and am pretty sure we still have it somewhere (I would never have thrown it away), so when I saw this car at the vide-grenier I jumped at it - and I'm going to give it to my now-married son for Christmas! (He has the same warped sense of humour as I do luckily)!I mentioned very early on in the blog that when my husband left I ended up back in contact with \"my best friend in all the world from the age of three\", Ian. He was also my neighbour and as toddlers we played together, walked to school together - everything, until we drifted apart when we went to different schools at the age of 16. When I got back in touch with Ian we hadn't seen or spoken to each other in 36 years! A few months previously he had decided he had had enough of England, the rotten weather, and \"chasing pennies\" so he bought himself what I call an old Postman Pat van (there's a definite theme developing here), re-vamped it, threw his tools and a mattress in the back and buggered off to Bulgaria for the simple reason \"that it looks cheap to live there\" (he didn't know the first thing about Bulgaria)!This isn't really his van!In July of that year he said \"Anna, if you've got nothing better to do, why don't you fly out to Bulgaria and we can get together\"! So I did - call it my Shirley Valentine moment or whatever you want, but I bloody well did it - and we had the most fantastic time together, my jaws hurt so much from laughing! While we definitely weren't meant to be together long-term, we remain friends to this day. Ian has stayed on in Bulgaria, which he loves and recently posted a clipping from the local Bulgarian newspaper entitled \"We did it!\". I ran it through google translate and seemingly the expat Brits had successfully pulled off the first ever KABUT in the local area. It took me a while to figure out that KABUT was actually \"car boot\" - it seems it was a great success so well done Ian!And finally, I was talking to my brother yesterday evening. He has now started volunteering at the local hospice two days a week, is still going regularly to his widows and widowers meetings (which he loves), had just been out for Sunday lunch with the group and was looking forward to starting their walking tours. Also this week he had been to his first afternoon dance meeting with the group. He said he hasn't laughed so long and so hard since his wife died. As usual the women way outnumbered the men so he got waltzed off his feet all afternoon. But his absolute favourite was an 81-year-old widow who had him up and dancing constantly. He said he had never trodden on so many women's feet in such a short time and he LOVED it! All I can think is GREAT - if there have to be widows and widowers I, for one, am delighted that they can still enjoy life after so much sadness!"},
{"title": "Fixing Dad!", "date": "Friday 7 April 2017", "text": "Every so often I come across a book recommendation, or a website that looks interesting so I jot it down on a scrap of paper and leave it next to my computer at home. Sometimes I get to doing something about looking it up and other times, when I have too many scraps of paper piling up, I just throw them all in the bin because they are making the place look mess(ier)!Well last night I finally sat down about 9 pm and thought \"I don't want to spend the evening on my computer or watching rubbish TV (although last night I discovered the wonderful Channel 4 programme \"Walks With My Dog\" - to be followed up as it was lovely), so I actually picked up one of my \"scraps\" and it read \"Fixing Dad\". It certainly didn't disappoint!It is the true story of two brothers who are desperately worried about the state of their dad's health, particularly his type 2 diabetes. In addition to that he has heart problems, high cholesterol - you name it - and he is only 62. They realize that the lovely dad that brought them up all those years ago was now a shadow of his former self and basically decided to \"bully\" him into doing something about it. After one scene where a man in the next hospital bed to dad reveals that he had a foot amputated due to diabetes, the shock enables them to get dad on board, They sought medical opinions wherever and whenever they could and, in the words of Baldrick, \"devised a cunning plan\".  They narrowed their goals down to \"fitness, nutrition and mind\", and started from there.It was lovely to watch them sparring with each other - something of an understated Laurel and Hardy routine - and that made it all the more pleasurable to watch as they were just so normal! In one of the scenes at the beginning you had a shot of 17-ish stone dad (about 250 lb) dressed up in lycra shirt and cycling shorts setting off on his first park ride on a very wobbly bike! Cue a quip from one of the brothers - \"That's comedy gold right there\"!  The brothers realized that spending so much time \"bullying\" dad into doing something about his health was also taking away time from their own families and there were the inevitable tensions and bickering. At one point they are in a taxi and one of the brothers is speaking on the phone to someone about their \"dad project\" when dad tells him to get off the phone and basically keep his business private. So the brother replies \"she's calling about our project, what am I supposed to do, hang up on her? you miserable old git\"! But you know what, it was also actually a sign of how very affectionate and comfortable they were with each other!Eventually they pay for a private full check-up for dad which reveals another, non-diabetes-related blow (don't want to give too much away here) but while this knocks them for six, as a family they get on with it and eventually come out the other end of a very long, dark tunnel. One very telling realization though is they realize that before the project dad seemed to have just \"given up\" because he was depressed and lonely - something they hadn't thought of before.Eventually they all do a 100 mile bike ride around London in aid of Diabetes UK, and you see dad standing up to give a talk in a large auditorium about fighting back against diabetes. It's a smashing documentary, about an hour long and very \"feel good\"!In fact, it was Ilona's comment on a Dr. Michael Moseley article in the Daily Fail that made me look up this documentary. Dr. Moseley was basically saying that it was time people fought back against type 2 diabetes, rather than just looking for a magic pill - which just isn't going to happen. In his opinion, diabetes in the U.K. (and presumably elsewhere in the western world) is a ticking time bomb.They had a stock photo of an obese man in the article and I mentioned to my colleague how mortified I would feel if I actually recognized myself as \"that obese person\" in the Daily Fail article. Some of the clothes worn in these photos are pretty distinctive so I guess it would come as a helluva shock.I'm overweight, although not shockingly so, and I seem to have been bobbing up and down with the same 7 lbs since Christmas. I had set the goal of losing weight by the time of my son's wedding in July, but that ship sailed when they bought the civil ceremony forward to March! Oh well, there is still the \"party\" side of the wedding to aim for in July, so I guess it's time to get back in the saddle.On another note, I am the Treasurer (read \"I keep the money in a tin under my bed\") of our small group that runs the second-hand book shop at work. Whenever we get a reasonable sum together we meet to decide where to allocate the money. One time we managed to buy two wheelchairs for a hospice in Peru, and this time we have donated to a young man's trek across Mongolia in aid of a muscular dystrophy charity. Since we still had a little left I asked that we donate to a food bank in my local town run by the Red Cross. Every week when I shop I pick up a few items for them, and when I have a box full I take it down. Towards the end of the year their stocks start to run very low as there are strict rules about when and where they can collect. So I took our donation down to them on Tuesday and while they are used to people making financial contributions I don't think they were expecting as much as we were able to donate. To say they were surprised would be an understatement.I was so glad we were able to give just a little back, all the more so since I actually spotted one of my neighbours picking up a food parcel! I just said hallo and went about my business. It's a strange world we live in sometimes isn't it!"},
{"title": "As long as we don't look in the mirror ......", "date": "Wednesday 29 March 2017", "text": "..... we could be 30 again! Wow, what a lovely couple of days I've just had. My ex and I got married in Switzerland in 1985 and moved to D.C. where I worked initially for a small law firm but was then offered a job at the World Bank. I have to admit the law firm was quite a shock to the old system - I mean, coming from Europe with six weeks vacation, 10 days official holidays, medical coverage and the culture of actually going out for lunch, then being expected to eat lunch at your desk while working, getting a generous one whole week annual leave and no medical coverage - just wow! That being said, they were nice enough but obviously when the opportunity arose to work at the Bank under much better working conditions and where I could use my languages, well I just jumped at the chance, of course.It was at the Bank that I met Angie. Angie is Indian and ended up working with me in the West Africa Section. We hit it off instantly. You know how sometimes you meet someone and you seem to be able to talk about anything and everything - well that was what it was like.  In 1987 I got pregnant with my first child and my ex pushed and pushed for us to move as he wasn't happy in D.C. So very, very reluctantly I ended up giving up my job at the Bank and moving to Pittsburgh. Now I have nothing against Pittsburgh, but frankly I didn't leave Birmingham (U.K.) to end up in Pittsburgh - that just wasn't what my dream was all about. And to be honest things didn't really improve in Pittsburgh anyway because although we were near family my ex was still working nights and weekends and I was working all hours God sends from home while looking after my son. It was just no life, so when I had a phone call out of the blue to offer me a job back in Switzerland we jumped at the chance, and moved back in 1989.Now I hadn't seen Angie since I left D.C. in January 1988. She stayed on at the Bank and I remember getting hold of her and another friend at the time of the Washington sniper horrors and basically just wishing them to \"stay safe\". As a side note, I actually lived in Montgomery County and one of the ladies that those bastards shot was sitting on a bench outside Silver Spring metro station - the one I used to get to work every day! Because I knew so many of the areas where those pigs were killing people, I remember being horror-struck by it all!After that Angie and I chatted I think a couple of times via skype and again it didn't feel like more than a few months since we had last seen each other. Eventually we got in touch via the miracle of Facebook and I got to see pictures of her (now grown) girls and she got to see pictures of my \"baby's\" wedding last week - you know, the one I was on maternity leave with the last time we saw each other! Well it's strange how fate works because her oldest daughter now works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was coming over to Geneva for her work - and Angie (now retired) contacted me about meeting up. And that's what we did yesterday! Despite the almost 30 years that have elapsed and the generous extra padding that comes with middle age, we both instantly recognized each other and more or less went \"so, where were we\"! We got to have lunch together in the company of a very beautiful peacock who was strutting his stuff through the lunch tables, and then yesterday Angie took herself off to Chamonix, Mont Blanc, which is about 45 minutes from my home (I told her to watch out for the photo opportunity with the slobbery Pyrennean (sp?) mountain dog that grossed my mother-in-law out).Inside the glacier - where my mother-in-law was grossed-out by \"slobbery dog\"!Standing on the \"transparent balcony\" over the glacier - she's braver than I am - I mean, just LOOK at those slippers!The funny thing is, when I left D.C. her then-8-year-old daughter very sweetly gave me a blue plastic bracelet and I was so touched by it that I have kept it all these years!!!! Angie, like me, is divorced and, again like me, her children are grown up and out of the house. She was telling me that she took herself off on some kind of \"solos\" trip to visit the U.S. national parks and had a wonderful time. I was telling her that I do \"solos\" trips too and love them, so she mentioned that we should plan a trip somewhere in the U.S. together soon (sounds great to me). But then I mentioned that I would really like to do the Golden Triangle in India (Delhi, Agra and Jaipur), and she laughed and said \"well you know I'm from Jaipur and I go home every year so why not let's make another date\"! Sounds great, kinda like Thelma and Louise but without the icky bit at the end!And all this time, Steve, who came out to visit at Christmas, is on whatsapp with me shouting (metaphorically) \"DO IT, DO IT, IT'LL BE GREAT\"! So you know what, I think I will!Funnily enough, Steve called this weekend and was asking what my holiday plans were for this year. I told him I had to get the July wedding over first but then after that maybe go away for my birthday in September. He mentioned that he was going to Rhodes again with his brother and his wife, but that he wasn't staying in the same hotel as they all needed their space - so why didn't I join him out there!!! And by jove I think I will! He's great company and Greece is beautiful, so what's not to like!I guess all this \"new stuff\" is why I have felt quite euphoric lately. I had no idea why really. It could be because spring is here and I love spring, but I think also the thought of just doing \"something else\" is what is really doing it for me. Happy times indeed!"},

Her funeral was beautiful, very touching, and very funny because that is what we all wanted. On the order of service we had a beautiful picture of mom and dad in uniform during WWII.  I held it all together until they played Vera Lynn singing \"We'll Meet Again\" as we walked out! I think given the poignancy of the times Vera Lynn and her beautiful voice will remain one of the enduring symbols of love and hope of all time!"},
{"title": "Didn't we luck out!", "date": "Monday 20 March 2017", "text": "Friday (St. Patrick's Day) was my son and his girlfriend's wedding day, and I have to say we really lucked out with the weather. Actually it had been lovely all week but they kept forecasting rain \"for tomorrow\". Then \"tomorrow\" kept getting pushed back so we did, indeed, have beautiful weather \"on the day\" and \"tomorrow\" (i.e. Saturday) it piddled down more or less all day. I guess the Gods were indeed smiling on us!I went to work during the day as they weren't getting married till 5 p.m. but I did make sure to leave early after having a shower at work and getting changed. The Geneva Car Show was on (what a pain in the butt that is) and by all accounts 690,000 people visited it, so I left nothing to chance and left work really early to get to their village. Maybe I'm a bit obsessive/compulsive because I was the first one there, but I prefer that since I didn't really know where I was going and the thought of screeching into the parking lot at the last minute gave me the heebie jeebies!There were about 20 of us there and apart from the actual ceremony itself it was a very laid back affair, lasting only about 20 minutes. The lady Maire began by reading out several articles of the Swiss Civil Code (their rights and obligations under Swiss Law) and then asked them individually if they accepted the other as their spouse. After that, a few words of wisdom, a quick poem and that was it - they were married. Lovely!With the wedding celebration already being planned for July, I had wondered why they had suddenly brought the civil ceremony so far forward but it turns out that Lily's grandfather is seriously ill and had recently taken a turn for the worse, so they brought the ceremony as far forward as they could in order for him to be able to attend.André and Lily - the happy coupleJordan - André's witness - and JenAfter the ceremony we all went back to their place for a very laid back dinner - \"grab a seat and a glass where you can\" kind of thing. Absolutely perfect to my way of thinking, to be honest.  Now onwards and upwards to the celebration in July when family will be coming in from abroad. Aaaah, one down, one to go!"},
{"title": "Ollie the (not so) reluctant star!", "date": "Thursday 16 March 2017", "text": "Did anyone see this short clip of Ollie taken at Crufts recently. I am thinking I might get a dog when I retire in a couple of years, but have never been particularly attracted to small dogs. Ollie might just change my mind. You've got to love a dog this mad (and to be honest, the commentary is great too!) After a rather \"iffy\" weekend last weekend weather-wise, it has turned out absolutely beautiful here again. I haven't been sleeping too well though (probably the full moon and upcoming events) so I haven't been out walking or exercising in general and I really have missed it. Who would have thought! So once I get this week over I intend to start up again next week. Of course I still want to lose weight and seem to be yo-yoing up and down around the same few pounds, but as of Monday I had lost 7 lbs. I have been using myfitnesspal.com to track calories and was a bit surprised to see that although I was tracking my intake and \"being good\", I still wasn't losing as much as I thought I should be, given that I was also exercising. But then it hit me - I looked at the number of grams of sugar I was taking in and not just the calories and I was going over pretty much every day! Bingo. It wasn't chocolate and ice cream, of course, but fruit for the main part, although interestingly there seems to be quite a bit of fructose hidden in other foodstuffs that you would never imagine! I love fruit but when I saw how much fructose I was getting through I realize I may have been overdoing it, so I am going to try cutting that out to see what happens.To say I have missed walking, also includes missing hopping off my bus on the bridge and walking to work when I can. Well today for the first time in ages I had to bring my car all the way to work and I absolutely hated it. The traffic is terrible as the Car Show is on but the thought of having to go back to driving all the way in every day would do my head in, I can tell you. And talking of bridges, I mentioned last year that the one-and-only bridge in town up to my village was going to be out of commission for a year starting last August. Well I saw this morning that they will be opening it up to alternating traffic again as from Monday! Yipeeeeeee! We still have probably another six months to go with these repairs, but at least this is an improvement on having to drive all round the reekin for the past eight months.Looking at the weather forecast, we are in for lovely weather tomorrow, and then wet and  horrible for the weekend. Good job my son is getting married tomorrow then!!!!! Can't wait!"},
{"title": "Roly Poly Hippo Takes A Bath!", "date": "Thursday 9 March 2017", "text": "Roly Poly Hippo Takes A Bath was one of my youngest's favourite story books when he was little (about 16 I think - nah, that can't be right. I'm sure he can read now - although you probably wouldn't guess)! You know, it was one of those books where there is one line per page and lots of pictures of Roly Poly Hippo getting nice and clean in his bath and then going outside and rolling around in the mud - much to the horror or Mommy Hippo! Now I don't suppose this has much to do with this post really but I do seem to have some kind of word-connection kinda thing going on over the events of the last few days.The first I guess is this weekend. As I have mentioned before, the road where I live is called (in French) fields of song, not, as I originally thought, because of the bird song, but because we have loads of underground mountain springs which \"sing\" as they trickle down the mountain. In fact, our water is of such good quality that it is not \"treated\" as such, which means we get to enjoy real spring water which is so much better than some chemically treated water I have tasted.  The downside of that, though, is that if ever our little village has excess water and the local town is in short supply, we are not allowed to sell it on to them - but then I can live with that, I'm sure!Five of us home owners recently had the opportunity to purchase small tracts of land directly backing on to our gardens, something we did just in case the field behind us (the one in the header photo to this blog) is sold for construction (although technically it is non-constructible land) and we wanted to be sure that they could not build an access road immediately backing onto our homes. What that now means is that we are also responsible for the upkeep of the land and so on, although in the 28 years I have lived here the HLM (the owners of the land) have never maintained it - it has always been the homeowners. Another point, however, is that if, on the rare occasion, the rains/spring water get too much and flood the village road, we are also responsible for taking care of that. So the five homeowners got together and have decided to bury pipes under the land in order to channel the spring water safely away from our homes and from the road. The only problem is, two of my neighbours already did this by hand-digging trenches and laying pipes, my immediate neighbour had someone in to do it last week-end, and now I have mountain streams flowing through my back garden - which sounds lovely but definitely is not! I now need to do the same thing, but can only realistically do it when my neighbour \"further downstream\" is also ready, and since he has a helluva lot more pipeline to lay than me I think he wants to wait until April to do it. Hence the reference to Roly Poly Hippo, because we spent the last three days sloshing round in the mud in our wellies digging ditches to temporarily channel the springs securely. Yuck! I only ever occasionally (maybe three weeks out of the year) had actual \"flooding\" in my garden (never in the house) but now I have a permanent stream that needs to be taken care of pretty quickly!The other thing that made me think of Roly Poly Hippo was the wonderful show three of us went to here in Geneva last night - Tango Fire!!! Oh man, was it good. I love the passion and intensity of Argentine tango anyway, and this group were just spectacular.When the women strutted on stage in their skimpy outfits my friend suggested I get something similar for the wedding next week - so there's another one just got crossed off my Christmas list!It was funny though, because after the show finished, the audience started going up the stairs to the upper exits - and I swear you could hear the creaking knees (mine included) from a mile away. So if ever you feel the need to beat yourself up comparing yourself to these show girls by looking like a pregnant hippo with fat ankles - I can highly recommend this Tango Fire! Just sayin!"},
{"title": "Say what????", "date": "Friday 3 March 2017", "text": "I have a Facebook account - there I admitted it! Not that I post much on it, but it is a good way to keep up with family members dotted all over the world - particularly nephews and nieces - who seem particularly keen on it. On Wednesday night I happened to be glancing over FB when I noticed that my oldest son was online. Our neighbour, with whom we are very close, turned 70 today so I sent André a message reminding him to wish Michel a happy birthday. He said he would and then asked if I was free on March 17th \"only Lily and I are getting married that day\"!!!! Say what!!!!! That is two weeks from today!!!! It's not the whole \"we're getting married\" business that threw me, it's the lack of notice!! Unlike the UK, church weddings are not legal in Switzerland (or France, for that matter) so typically people get married first at the Town Hall and then in Church, if that is what they want. In my case, the kids don't want a religious ceremony as neither are religious, so in July we will be having a non-religious family celebration of their marriage. My ex and I got married in Switzerland and the paperwork wasn't particularly fearsome, but with Lily being Swiss their paperwork was more complex because marriage to a Swiss confers certain rights to the spouse - I guess they are making sure it isn't a marriage of convenience. Fair enough and good for the Swiss, but heck, when was he thinking about mentioning the date to me? Bloody hell, now I've got two weeks to find something suitable to wear and no, I haven't exactly lost a ton of weight either! Kids! In fact this morning he emailed me to ask if I could send scanned copies of his brother's British and American passports to him today! Apparently the Maire who will be marrying them needs copies today of Jordan's passports to register him as the official witness. Luckily I make a habit of scanning all official documents so was able to send them but \"no pressure there then\"!On the \"losing weight\" scene, I went walking again today and have to say it is slowly getting very slightly easier going uphill. On the way back I came through the botanical gardens again and I have noticed several times now the beautiful scents given off by some flowers in particular areas of the gardens. I try to look at the names of the flowers/bushes but can't keep the Latin ones in my head of course. Maybe I should take my ipad with me next time. But, going through a group of rhododendrons there is always the most beautiful scent - and I didn't know rhododendrons gave off a scent (not that I know much about any botanical matters really). In fact, in one part of the gardens is the \"Jardin des Senteurs\" (\"perfume gardens\", I guess, for want of a better translation). It is specifically designed for blind or sight-impaired people and has all the plant names written in brail. Some of the scents there are just fabulous! So that's another thing to add to my list of \"things I want to delve further into\" when I retire!And moving swiftly on, last night a friend and I went to see La La Land. I always try to wait a few weeks when a film comes out to avoid the crowds at the initial screenings. After first going to the wrong cinema we made it to the right cinema just as the opening titles were coming up. I have to say - crikey - what an amazing place that cinema was! I nearly fainted when I found out the entrance fee was 25 Swiss francs (that's about 25 dollars) and that had even come down from the 35 Swiss francs he was charging previously. But ..... and it's a big but here ..... the cinema was absolute luxury! Imagine yourself on a plane in first class, reclinable seats, plenty of space, and with your own individual tray for drinks etc. There was a bar/coffee shop just outside and some people brought their glass of wine in with them. Frankly, although it was expensive, it was a real treat to see a film this way and. I feel, worth occasionally splashing out on. I must not be the only one to feel this way because apparently this guy has recently bought another run-down cinema and will be doing it up in the same vein! Now that's an entrepreneurial spirit if ever there was one!As for the film, it was ok/good. Very \"feel good\" but not the greatest of films but by no means boring. I would give it a 7/10, to be honest.The film is all about a young man desperate to open his own jazz club and a young woman desperate to find fame as an actress. I couldn't help noticing that while Emma Stone is not, in my opinion, conventionally beautiful, to my mind she has something very attractive about her (but of course, with Hollywood make-up artists they all look great). Nevertheless, I think she is attractive (and talented). This week, of course, we had the Oscars and while I don't watch them (9-hour time difference and no interest anyway) there was a real whoo-haa in the press about La La Land being named the best film by mistake. Not the end of the world by any means, and of course there are far more important things going on in the world, but I couldn't help noticing how dreadful Faye Dunaway looked. Yes, I know she's getting on and all that but her plastic surgery is just appalling! So then I got to thinking how hard it must be for someone who was once considered a great beauty to age, and how desperate so many seem to hold on to their looks. In the end, isn't it easier for the rest of us mere mortals not to have to \"apoligize\" for aging and not be examined under the microscope. Just a thought!And finally, another thought (gosh, I seem to be having a lot of those lately)! OH and I split up in June last year after seven years together. I ended it because I was tired of never doing anything ever and felt that with my divorce well and truly in the past and the kids moved on I am just chomping at the bit to do things and he just wasn't. We're still friends in any case, and occasionally have a drink together, but we are no longer a couple and we're both fine with that. Well the other night I was having a drink with him after work and they were playing salsa music in the background. I commented on how much I love that music and ex-OH commented how much he \"loathed it with a vengeance\" (see how compatible we aren't!). Well I had been talking to a colleague who, like me, had previously taken salsa lessons and was thinking of going back to it in September when they start up again from scratch. The salsa teacher I had was great but like so many other women I didn't have a partner, and while she made sure we all swapped partners as much as possible, it wasn't ideal. So I was looking up the schedule for the current classes (she teaches other things than salsa) and I noticed that she gives private lessons. They are expensive but I was wondering if it might be worth treating myself to 10 private lessons so that I can get more out of it. I wouldn't just want salsa lessons either, as she teaches ballroom dances such as the waltz and the foxtrot and so on (which I tried out and loved). Normally each year I try to go away in February/March for a break from the winter, but this year, with the wedding coming up, I won't be going away until later in the year, so I was wondering - should I put some of the money I would have spent on going away into private dance lessons? Being a Libran I have to weigh these things up, not only because of the cost but because I have (happily) gotten involved in so many different clubs/projects that I also don't want to have every night taken up with going out. Aaaahhh first world problems to be sure!"},
{"title": "Got the monkey off my shoulder!", "date": "Wednesday 1 March 2017", "text": "I didn't feel like walking today. We had a helluva storm last night and today, for the first time in ages, it was grey, windy and cold-ish. Cars coming down from villages higher up the mountain had quite a good coverage of snow and there were broken tree branches everywhere - so nah, I didn't feel like walking. But hey, I got that monkey off my shoulder - you know, the one who says \"oh don't bother, just this once, it won't matter\". And of course, it wouldn't matter, but I actually got off my backside and went walking again at lunchtime. Yay me!It was too muddy to go on one of my usual circuits so I walked along the lakefront, and while it was pretty windy, it was a really pleasant walk. It definitely blows the cobwebs away and is a real mood booster. Also they usually have various exhibitions along the lake front - at the moment they have sculptures which, to be honest, are quite beyond me and my peasant heart, but previously they had photos of people from all over the world photographed in authentic, unretouched detail -  they were so interesting. OK so stopping to pour over sculptures or photos probably doesn't do much in the way of calorie burning, but at least I got out there right!On Saturday night a friend and I went to see \"Shrek, The Musical\", performed by Simply Theatre, which is the under-18s theatre group. We saw them perform The Addams Family last year and they were fantastic. And Saturday they didn't disappoint either. In fact, we were talking on the way home and both agreed that we think we actually prefer them to the adult productions. Just wow, I don't know where they get their talent (or their confidence) from but they were amazing. (I have to admit to a little weakness here, but donkey could certainly have given Eddie Murphy a run for his money - couldn't find a picture on their site though. Shame!!!)Then on Sunday I got to watch the latest match in the rugby six nations - England versus Italy. I love the six nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy) because it is on every year and while it doesn't last long you get to see some great rugby. Sunday's match was scrappy, but entertaining, rugby. The referee was French and usually when they want to address an issue with a specific player they shout \"number 10 white\", or \"number 8 blue\". For some reason this time the ref just called out, \"hey you with the beard\" and five Italians turned round! I guess you had to be there but it was really funny - and the giggling from the commentary box was a real treat!"},
{"title": "Switzerland", "date": "Tuesday 28 February 2017", "text": "This week has been one of my quieter weeks and I must admit I have quite enjoyed not having much planned (for a change). I weighed myself on Monday and there was no change - so while disappointing at least it was back to \"normal\" rather than the seemingly overnight 5 lb weight gain of the other week. It really is slow going considering how much I am exercising but I think I might be all right with that.Yesterday I got to Geneva in good time so managed to hop off the bus and walk the last 30 minutes in to work. It was absolutely beautiful - bright sunshine and not even cold - and I saw a young woman at the end of one of the jetties sticking out into the lake doing her yoga practice. It was lovely to see. In fact, you do see quite a few \"fitness\" groups exercising outside in the parks round here - what better backdrop for your fitness regime. Last year, during the good weather, we also had a gent practising the bagpipes in the park outside every Wednesday, and then salsa music playing later in the evening outside one of the stately homes just near here. Sometimes I forget I'm actually at work!When I walk in to work, I walk through an area called Pâquis, which is central Geneva, but not the \"posh bit\" (you know, where Sophia Loren lives - that's over the other side of the lake). I like Pâquis though as it has character, although over the years it has been dragged down and what used to be called \"full of character\" is now a bit less salubrious. At the hotel on my first night in Geneva in May 1980 I met Gill. She was starting work at the same place as me and we became (and have remained) friends over the years, even though she subsequently left my employer to work somewhere else. Well Gill and I rented a studio together in Pâquis for the first three months while we were looking for our own place. We went out together recently and walked past our old studio and both laughed when we remembered the dirty old dog that lived opposite our studio who seemingly, casually, always ended up standing on his balcony when we got home from work. We, of course, would dash in, have a quick wash, change our clothes and then dash back out again - without realizing that the dirty old sod could see straight through our net curtains when the lights were on!! Well, I guess if it gave him a thrill so be it, but we started changing in the bathroom after that once we realized what was going on!A couple of months after I arrived, Gill very kindly moved out to allow my parents to come and visit for a week. One night my parents and I were walking down towards the lake when my dad commented on \"what a lot of people there were out\"! I started laughing because I hadn't thought to tell them about the \"main industry\" of Pâquis! So I asked my dad if it didn't strike him as strange that so many of those \"people\" were sitting on cars! You see, Pâquis is the main prostitution area of Geneva! I'm not sure if prostitution is legal or just tolerated in Switzerland but either way it is regulated and you really don't get hassled walking down there. Tell a lie, I think I did get propositioned once in all that time but I just laughed in the guy's face.Anyway, since it was mom and dad's first time in Switzerland a friend suggested I take them up to Zermatt for a long weekend. I didn't have a car yet so booked us on the train. The only thing was, I knew we had to get the train as far as Täsch and then change for the little rack railway that takes you up to Zermatt (only locals are allowed to drive in Zermatt so it is pretty much a \"pedestrianized\" village).  Once we got past Montreux I knew to be on the look-out for Täsch but didn't know how much further it was, so when we stopped at one station I asked my mom what the name of the station was and she said \"sortie\" - at which point half the train burst into giggles. You see \"sortie\" means \"exit\". In fact, I think my mom and dad were part of the entertainment on that trip as they bounced back and forth from one side of the train to the other going \"Ted come and look at this, no Mannie come and look at this\". Lovely times indeed.When we eventually got to Täsch and on to the little train we encountered what I can only describe as a typical British battleaxe! You know the kind, probably lived through the last days of the British Raj and totally bombastic. It was mid-July, scorching hot and a group of young people had opened a small window on the train to let some air in. Well they were told in no uncertain terms to close it again as she was cold! To give them their due, they did shut it but the rest of us almost suffered from heat stroke on the way up! Anyway it turned out that \"Miss Crawford\" (the battleaxe) seemed to be quite taken with my dad so she invited us to have a drink with her that evening. Being polite we did, but then she wanted to get together for every meal thereafter, so we spent the next few days dodging Miss Crawford, or as my mom would put it \"Crawfie to the left\" and we would all dodge into a doorway as she was such a crashing boor.On a friend's recommendation I had booked us into a lovely little hotel called the Hotel Romantica. It was small but spotlessly clean and the owners were very friendly.Hotel RomanticaZermatt (with the Matterhorn in the background)I hadn't realized, because nobody had told me, but my dad had just come out of hospital with another \"heart episode\". He had had several heart attacks over the years and, I found out later, it was touch and go whether he would be able to come out to Switzerland this time. But manage it he did and we had a lovely time, taking the cog railway up to the top of the mountains, stopping for lunch and then either walking or getting the train back down. Somewhere I have a lovely picture of him lying in the grass at the top of the mountain, lapping up the sun. I don't know if Switzerland actually did him good or just the fact that he had a tan when he went back made him look so well, but I have to say that trip was one of the best memories I have of time spent with my parents!"},
{"title": "Beginning to get the hang of this exercise malarky!", "date": "Friday 24 February 2017", "text": "Five weeks in and I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this business. My weight is not down as much as I would like despite the fact that I have been counting calories as between hormones and water retention my weight still tends to go up and down like a yo yo. Still the general trend is down so I guess I need to stop myself chomping at the bit. Last year I had some credit with Amazon so I bought myself the cheapest fitbit I could find that would sync to my phone, and I have to admit I am loving it. They say you should walk at least 10,000 steps per day for optimal fitness and my fitbit really brought home how sedentary I was/am. I guess on an average work day I am hitting around 5,000 - 6,000 steps, so in order to hit the 10,000 I need to hop off the bus 30 minutes from work and walk in and walk at lunchtime. A tall order some days, although to be honest once I have got my backside into gear I have enjoyed it. The trick for me is not to look up too much when I am going uphill as it is a bit soul destroying to see how far you have to go yet. I have to admit though it it is getting a little easier - not a lot, but we're getting there. Walking in in the mornings also brings home to me how slow I walk. Seriously! Even when I was young and relatively fit I was always a dawdler and not much has changed, although I'm told if you take your hands out your pockets it does help you speed up!!When we lived in D.C. my ex and I didn't get to spend much time together since he worked nights and weekends and I worked the opposite schedule. When we did have some time, however, we liked to go to Washington zoo, where I think my favourite animal was the sloth! And don't get me started on Sid in Ice Age - what's not to love? They are so cute and seemingly laid back, so maybe that is where I get my dawdling tendencies from!SidAnyway, this morning a Tunisian colleague caught the same bus as me so I made him hop off the bus on the Mont Blanc bridge with me and walk in - well I got to run alongside him as his legs are much longer than mine. Imed is a great friend and always good for a laugh, so it was a pleasure to get a chance to chat to him too. We met many years ago at work when he had come into my office to help a colleague with her computer. All of a sudden there was a loud \"ping\". My colleague didn't notice but Imed did and looked up. Seemingly my bra had finally admitted defeat and the strap broke, flinging a plastic bit out the top of my shirt. Imed looked at me with a \"what just happened\" look on his face, so I waved my bra strap at him. One big, cheesy grin from him later and we have remained great friends to this day!It is weird though being able to go out walking over here when I see the damage being done by storm Doris in the UK and Ireland. The weather was supposed to break here today but it really hasn't. A little rain (snow in the mountains - always welcome at this time of year) and that's it apparently for the next week or so. Long may it last, is all I can say is I love spring.Talking of \"springs\", the subdivision where I live is called \"Fields of Song\" in French not, as I originally thought, because of the bird song, but because we have loads of underground springs which apparently \"sing\" as they make their way down the mountains. Well since several of us homeowners bought the small plots of land behind each of our properties recently in order to prevent an access road being built if ever the field behind the houses is sold for construction, some of the neighbours have laid pipes through their land in order to channel the springs properly and keep the water off the road when the heavy rains come. I haven't got round to doing mine yet so at the moment I have a spring flowing through my veggie plot, which is fine if it is contained, but I guess I had better get moving on that too, unless I want an impromptu swimming pool appearing!And finally, a small group of us at work run a second-hand bookshop, the profits from which are donated to various charities of our choosing. I am the treasurer and last year, for instance, a Peruvian colleague asked for 500 Swiss francs to take to Peru where her chosen charity was able to buy two wheelchairs with that money (you certainly wouldn't get even one wheelchair for that over here). Anyway, Yoli also collects plastic bottle tops which she takes with her when she goes home to give to the same charity since she gets $250 for every 250 kg of plastic! So yesterday as I took a plastic bag of bottle tops up to her office she laughed as she told me that last time she went home she was entitled to take three suitcases with her, so she filled one completely with bottle tops - and then got stopped at Peruvian customs! The customs officers told her they thought they had seen pretty much everything, but Yoli proved them wrong! I am very interested in recycling, organic farming etc. and would love to get involved with a Transition Network group but have yet to find one locally. But the thought of French bottle caps being lugged to Peru to end up buying wheelchairs for a charity definitely appeals to both my sense of good husbandry and irony!"},
{"title": "Ooohhh la la!", "date": "Tuesday 21 February 2017", "text": "Last week we started a new project at my monthly patchwork course - \"I ❤ Paris\". It is a kind of tote bag and we are going to learn how to appliqué pictures, add different kinds of decorations and so on. I am going with the theme \"I ❤ Paris\" because our teacher has tons of ideas for it (and she's from Paris incidentally). Our task this month is to embroider a lamppost onto one of the panels and the Eiffel Tour on another, just to get the hang of the kind of needlework/stitching she wants us to do. Next lesson we will be adding in a panel with a photo on it (I still have to chose my photo) and she also asked us to find small snippets of fabric with a \"Paris\" theme to it to add later. Now a couple of the ladies have the same fabric for this with pictures of stiletto heels, leather handbags and so on, but do you think I could find anything similar? No, of course I couldn't. What I did find was fabric along similar lines except it was beach-themed - sunglasses, parasols, beach balls and so on. Yeah, yeah, I know, Paris isn't on the ocean so please don't tell anyone, but I think the little cutouts might be quite nice anyway so I'll just have to go with what I have.In order to make this bag we had to pick out six different, coordinating fabrics. I am useless at this stuff as I really don't have an eye for colour, so I decided to nip down to Cluses to ask Lydie, my teacher, for help, with the proviso that she does not allow me to chose anything pink and green or orange and green or yellow and green! I love those colours so tend to gravitate towards them all the time but this time I wanted something different. Anyway, she did a great job and we picked out a really nice selection of strong, bold colours that are not green and something!  Actually her shop is a little Aladdin's cave for anyone who likes that kind of stuff (we don't have the same selection as in the U.S. or the U.K.). But, I totally forgot to look for the \"I ❤ Paris\" fabric so last Saturday I decided to run out to a local \"chain store\" fabric shop a bit nearer to me.Mondial Tissus (\"World Fabrics\") exists throughout France (I believe) and is a kind of generic fabric store, as opposed to Lydie's Aladdin's cave where she really specializes with some beautiful (if expensive) stuff. Anyway, Mondial Tissus is located in a commercial area about 20 minutes from home - you know, the kind of place that houses every shop/garden centre/garage possible. The trouble is, since all the roads/roundabouts tend to look the same to me I tend to go shooting past the \"Mondial\" turn off..... except that I now have a fail-safe trigger - yes, it's the sex shop right next door! No kidding, they share the same parking lot - Easy Love and Mondial Tissus! Or I guess more correctly, Mondial Tissus has about six parking spaces and if they are all full you just walk round the corner and use one of the 50 or so Easy Love parking spaces! You can imagine the look on some of the little old grannies' faces can't you!Actually, that right there could be a business opportunity - buy all your kinky gear in Easy Love then nip into Mondial Tissus and have your alterations done! Who said the entrepreneurial spirit is dead!Now I don't know what got into me but as I was heading towards my car I thought \"what the heck, why not\", so decided to have a quick look in \"the other place\"! I have never been in a sex shop before and since I am technically an adult I talked myself into going in because \"I have every right to go in this shop and no I'm not the slightest bit embarassed and don't I look like a woman of the world\" kinda thing right! Well I went in and had to go up some dingy stairs that made it look a bit like a speakeasy. I got to the top of the stairs, took a deep breath, one good look around (still standing at the entrance) and dashed out of there. Honestly, I think I made more of a prat of myself by doing that than if I had just wandered nonchalantly around! Maybe next time! Actually, the first time I had ever seen a sex shop was when my sister moved to Copenhagen in 1979 and we went past a sex supermarket!!!! Can you imagine grabbing a trolley outside and filling that up. To be honest, what was I thinking - \"oh I'll just buy these fluffy handcuffs and handcuff myself to the bed\"! What a pillock!So, moving seamlessly on, on Sunday I drove over to my son's to drop off some paperwork I had for him. As it was a lovely day I decided to take a trip out in the car afterwards to try to find the departure point for a hike up the Môle. It's not a particularly arduous hike (apparently) but there are several different departure points for it so I decided to try and find one of the them for the day when I get my act into gear and actually hike up it. I found it eventually and while I was up above the snow line there wasn't much snow and there were loads of people making their way back down it on such a glorious day.The Môle is the smaller mountain on the leftDeparture point for the hikeOne of my goals for this year is to get out into the mountains more. Well, that and lose weight in time for the wedding. I had been really, really good last week, watching everything I ate and exercising every day, so on Sunday I weighed myself and was thrilled to see I was down 6 lbs from my starting weight. Problem was on Monday (weigh-in day) I was up 5 lbs!!!!! What the flip!!!! So I tried again today and I am down 3 lbs again! Crikey, talk about hormonal! It can be so discouraging, particularly as I have been so \"good\" but I have to keep the faith I siuppose, and in all honesty the exercise alone was making me feel wonderful anyway. Time to get the nose back to the grindstone I think. Actually, when my friend Steve was over at New Year we were both moaning about how unfit we had both become compared to when we met in Peru four years ago, so we have a bet that next time he comes over we are going to walk up the mountain behind me to the Chalet de Balme. It's not a particularly difficult hike but I guess you have to get started somewhere right?Chalet de BalmeLet's see if I can put my money where my mouth is!"},
{"title": "Oops!", "date": "Friday 17 February 2017", "text": "As I mentioned previously, I have been looking around for groups to join locally in order to get out more and meet different people. So finally, after many years of diddling around, last Friday I went to the first meeting of our local \"village committee\"! This is the group that organizes most of the events in the village (village fête, the annual car boot, Papa Noel comes to school, dinner for the \"oldies\") and a damn good job they do too. Our is a small village and compared to some of the villages on the other side of the Lake, we are relatively \"parochial\" (i.e. read \"poor\") and our village fête looks nothing like some of the other village fêtes where there are quite a few wealthy inhabitants. Think \"deepest France\" (to cobble a line from Paddington Bear) or \"la France profonde\". But you know, it is actually lovely. Nothing fancy, as epitomized by kids trying to catch trout in a barrel with their bare hands! Anyway, for several years I have diddled about saying \"oh I must join in\" and done nothing about it, but last Friday I bumped into my neighbour as he was heading off to the meeting and decided to tag along finally. They are desperately in need of new and young blood so all I can say is hats off to them for doing as much as they do. I'm not sure how many hours I can put in as I am gone at least 12 hours a day, but I will most certainly do what I can - which is only fair when you think of it. I mean, I have lived in this village for 28 years now (I only lived in the UK for 21) so time to pitch in I think.I also went on a vegan cookery course the other week, given by Migros in Geneva. Migros is the Swiss equivalent of Wal Mart or Tesco, i.e. they are a supermarket but have a finger in every pie, and over the years I have taken many of their evening classes, particularly when I was single. This course wasn't actually that great, nor was it actually that \"vegan\" given that one of the deserts was made with chocolate made from cow's milk, but since I am not looking to become vegan and am only interested in doing more interesting things with non-meat products, I thought I would give it a shot. Problem was, one of the young women managed to explode the soup while blitzing it so we ended up spending at least 20 minutes wiping walls and floors to get the soup off. As I say, it really wasn't that good, but at least I have tried it right!  I see Migros are also offering a one-off Persian cookery evening that looks interesting, plus vegetarian Indian cookery so I'll have to check them out.In France, the local \"night school\" (they call it the MJC here - Maison de Jeunesse et de Culture), is where I took the infamous tap dancing try-out (in over 100 degree weather). They are all over France and offer some interesting possibilities also. As I was leaving my board game evening the other night, I noticed that my local town is hoping to set up a jardin partagé - something which interests me very much. Now I'm not sure exactly what they mean by \"jardin partage\" but I take it to mean \"communal veggie plots\". Not allotments exactly but something along those lines, and they are hoping to bring in people to teach organic gardening, if I understood exactly. Valérie, my former neighbour and board game evening co-conspirator, is also interested in this so we have agreed to meet up for the next meeting on this project. It's all go isn't it - but as I said before, I like \"all go\", and now that I am single and my kids are moved out, I am looking forward to doing more of this kind of stuff. In fact, I remember as a single girl in Geneva, during the five years before I married I never, ever spent one evening at home in all those five years! Crikey, it looks like I'm heading that way again.On Thursday as I was heading to work I stopped to let school kids cross the road and they were all dressed up for Carnaval. This relates to mardi gras (which is on 28 February this year) but local schools spread out the celebrations over a couple of weeks. I have to say I liked seeing the teenagers dressed up as rabbits, clowns and so on. Halloween hasn't really taken off over here (I don't see any reason why it should either), but Carnaval has always been part of the local traditions.I obviously couldn't be taking pictures of the kids crossing the road while I was driving!And finally, a bit of drama the other Friday. I work directly opposite the Israeli Mission which, for obvious reasons, has huge concrete bollards outside it and armed guards. Well apparently there was a bomb scare last Friday evening, the police were called and an untended suitcase was eventually blown up. Turns out it was just someone's suitcase left at the bus stop, and my colleagues think it could have been \"one of ours\". We regularly have training courses for groups from various geographical regions on the work of our organization. They suspect a group of trainees was running to catch the bus at the end of one of these courses and someone must have ran over to get his ticket while the others held the bus up for him. End result, he forgot his suitcase and his underpants and toothbrush were blown to smithereens! Still, better an unfortunate incident like that than a real bomb any day.And on that note, I am looking forward to a quiet weekend. No news as yet from the Nutty Professor or the mailbox name-plate Gods. Weigh-in on Monday. I have been really careful counting calories and have exercised every day but I don't actually feel as though I have lost any weight. Damn and drat. Fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "Worth the effort!", "date": "Wednesday 15 February 2017", "text": "I always end up running round like crazy on Saturdays because God forbid anything should be open in France on a Sunday - nope - that's  not going to happen round here. So for me Saturdays are always pretty chaotic. It's always a shock when I go home to England and find things open on Sundays. I mean, last time I was there I had an optician's appointment and they offered for me to pick up my new glasses on the Sunday! Well you could have knocked me down with a feather. Round here (I hesitate to say \"in France\") there ain't nothing open on a Sunday! Well in the summer months you might get a garden centre, but definitely not a DIY place (crazy, I know - how much money could they make?). I have to say after nearly 30 years in France I still find it very customer \"unfriendly\" but that may have more to do with France's strict employment laws. We have an Asian restaurant opened up in town which is very good and very popular and they were forced to close on Sundays. It beats me, I can tell you, but in a way it isn't always such a bad thing. I mean, do you really want Sunday to be just like every other day of the week? I'm not religious so I don't even say that coming from a religious angle, but I'm not sure I'd want everything to be open \"as usual\" (except maybe the DIY places)!Anyway I digress, but as I said Saturdays I am always pretty busy trying to get all my running around done. I whizzed off to the market first thing and then dashed off to the hardware store (before they close for the day at noon - see what I mean - they don't open back up in the afternoon)! Since I have gone back to my maiden name I had ordered two new name plates for my mail box (one for the outside and one for the inside which can only be seen by the mail man when he opens all the boxes up at once). I had specifically asked for \"Ms T, formerly Mrs. B\" since I realize I will be getting mail for a while in my married name. I thought they might get my maiden name wrong as it isn't easy for the French but no, everything was just as I asked for. Except, when I went to put them on the mail box, the second plaque (which was hidden behind the first one) was in the name of \"Aquitaine Solutions\"!!! Bugger, I hadn't noticed it when I picked them up, so I had to dash back to the hardware store to drop that off and get them to order the correct one. (Anyone at Aquitaine Solutions wondering where your nameplate is - I have it and am holding it to ransom until ....). The chappie was very nice and apologetic of course, but still!Then, I managed to make it back into town just in time to catch the jeweller (a.k.a. the Nutty Professor). I had dropped off a necklace that had been given to me by my ex for my 50th birthday (he left me four months later - nice) since the Nutty Professor buys gold. As I had never worn the necklace I wanted it out of the house as it had no sentimental value to me. He had originally told me to come back in two weeks' time. So getting somewhat more savvy to the ways of the Nutty Professor I went back three weeks later just before lunch (thinking he would want to be out of there to go eat). I was right of course, but while he indeed had the gold chain and pendant he couldn't find the precious stones that he had removed. He said they were quite small but there were a lot of them and I might want to have them re-set into something else. But do you think he could find the bag with them in!!! No of course he couldn't. Frankly the place was such a mess it makes me wonder how he ever found anything. So he spent 30 minutes searching up and down for the stones but to no avail. In the end we agreed he would pay me for the gold and I would come back when he had found the stones, but then do you think he could find his cheque book????? Of course he couldn't. So 45 minutes after he should have closed for lunch the two of us are still rummaging around looking for his stuff but only managed to find the cheque book. As I waited for my cheque I happened to glance at a collection box he had on his counter collecting small coins for various charities. I told him I didn't want to ruin his day any more than it already was but he should have handed in the collection box at the post office by noon that day (it was now nearly 13h) and of course the post office shuts (for the day) at noon on Saturdays! He wasn't too worried about that though as he said (quite rightly I suppose) that they would soon come round asking for the piggy bank when they wanted their money. And to top it off, since he was buying gold he had to register the purchase with the French authorities (fill out various forms etc), except that he had used the last of his forms without thinking to make copies of a blank so now I have to go back in the coming weeks to sign off on the cheque he gave me!  It was quite comical actually but as I said before, while I am incredibly patient I think it isn't such a bad thing he is retiring in two months!So the weekend was just one mad dash after another but I realize I actually like my life to be busy (although not the  \"chasing your tail\" kind of busy) so I have signed up to a couple of more things to keep me out of trouble (more about that in another post).On a totally different note, I am doing well with the exercise (pretty much five days a week) and as I love the side effects of the exercise and the weather here is gorgeous I hope to keep it up and get some weight off (weigh-in with Janet in Florida on Monday - \"hi Janet\").  I have exercised all three days this week so far during my lunch hour, but today I made a point of taking my ipad with me as the weather is so gorgeous. I had bought a lovely little bag in St. Lucia which I wasn't using so thought it would be good to carry my ipad on my walks. I trotted (read \"crawled\") up (\"up\" being the operative word) to the US Mission and while it is still a challenge for me it seems to be getting easier. But oh the walk back down - definitely worth the effort!My pretty St. Lucia bag﻿Through Geneva's botanical gardens﻿Saw this little man in the botanical gardens!﻿﻿Believe it or not the alps are over there - but it's too sunny to see them!What the view from the same spot looks like on a good day - photo by the Swiss Watch BlogSo while the aim is to lose weight, I think the scenery is worth the effort anyway (and long may that enthusiasm last)!"},

One colleague mentioned that X was no longer working as a driver and had been moved to another department and couldn't understand how that had happened. As I had worked in HR for over 20 years I explained that sometimes people had other qualifications/skills that they either brought with them or had developed over time which allowed them to move up. So this colleague then commented on how he didn't know how X and his wife (she works here as well) managed because X always had new, top-of-the-range cars and so on, and neither of them \"were the sharpest knife in the drawer\"! So this led to a whole big discussion on how an outward show of wealth does not necessarily indicate real wealth - usually the opposite in fact (says me, trying to kick my €10 bag bought in Turin market under the table). But I agree absolutely, so many people have to have the latest \"designer\" bling and run up thousands in debt to get it. In fact a colleague of my ex had got himself into so much debt that my ex, as his supervisor, was called in to try to sort it out (big joke that is)! Ex couldn't sort his way out of paper bag financially! I am so much better off with only half the income but no ex - but then I digress. Anyway, ex's said colleague had a fair income for a single man with no dependants, but he went out every night to the bar, eating and drinking, doing the same at lunch-time and then sometimes couldn't pay his rent - you get the idea.I had been mulling the idea of advertising or even \"subliminal persuasion\" over my mind for some time. Geneva is obviously a pretty wealthy city and on my journey in to work, once I catch the bus at the border (with my musings and €10 bag for company), I go past a few high-end shops in the centre of town - Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc., but there is one advert outside a shop that I absolutely hate. I have no idea why it bothers me so much but I think it is so lame and no way would it persuade me to part with my money (even assuming I had that kind of money - which I don't). I can't say their stuff isn't good or quality or anything like that - I just hate the ad!I think the guy is supposed to look like some sexy silver fox (obviously with money) and so appealing to the young, beautiful woman behind him. I personally think he looks like the Lion King's geriatric granddad and I think that's what bothers me. All their ads seem to show some suave, sophisticated man being \"adored\" from a distance by some insipid waif. It just gets on my nerves, I suppose.Talking of irritating adverts, the worst I can think of at the moment is that bloody awful Moneysupermarket.com ad! I think Sharon Osbourne actually appears in it too but I can't bear to watch it through to the end!Which then got me to thinking about what some people will do for money (or more to the point, what won't some people do for money)? Like these bloody awful reality TV shows (cue raised eyebrows, startled look, dramatic music and tears), Real Housewives Of Fill-In-The-Blank, Keeping Up With The You-Know-Who-You-Wished-You'd-Never-Heard-Ofs, I'm A Celebrity Watch Me Chew On A Piece Of Camel's Ass etc! I have never sat down and watched any of these programmes but have come across them, on a few unfortunate occasions, while channel hopping, and I can't believe my eyes. I mean, once you have had sex with a total stranger on TV what does the next person have to do to top that? Just how vulgar do you have to be, or how low do you have to go to \"win\"? Beats me. I suppose the film Indecent Proposal really put that idea out there didn't it?Now I'm no Demi Moore (never was, never will be) but after my ex left I briefly dated a very wealthy Spanish lawyer (Mr. Testosterone Plus - great fun for a while but not in the long run). One day he asked me how much money I had to borrow to buy my ex out of the house. After I told him he offered to pay it off for me!  I just laughed (because he was obviously joking right?) but when he said it a second time \"because I have given more money than that to the Prado\" (and after I had picked myself up off the floor) it took me about three seconds to say \"thanks, but no thanks\"! He couldn't believe it (and neither could I frankly) but I had to explain to him that you can never put a price on freedom and I value mine too much! Although we have since split, I think that may be the reason we've remained friends to this day. No amount of money is worth giving up your independence for - it's worth more than gold dust!"},
{"title": "There's madness in the air!", "date": "Wednesday 1 February 2017", "text": "They say round here that you always know when it is going to snow because the kids get all hyper. That may well be true but yesterday it rained and I swear all the loonies came out anyway. Tuesday's and Thursdays are the worst days on the road for getting to work for some reason, and yesterday being Tuesday and raining for the first time in ages, it seemed like all the crazies came out. I decided to take \"the back road\" down to the motorway, thinking that traffic might be a bit backed up in town because of the bridge still being down (six months and counting). The road I have to take to get down to the motorway is called \"la route forestière\", or the forestry road - and for good reason. It is a winding road down through the forest and quite steep in parts, but as there was no snow I didn't mind taking it. That was until I heard \"boy racer\" zooming up behind me as soon as I pulled out of my village. Round here they do quite a bit of rally car driving as the roads are obviously ideal. They are not ideal, however, for rally racing during ordinary, non-rally days, but that didn't stop boy racer roaring up my backside revving his souped up piece of crap. As soon as I got to the next village I pulled over to let him and another car go past as I can't stand being tailgated. Immediately leaving the next village the road goes under a railway bridge and then takes a sharp right, so you can't see if anything is coming in the opposite direction. Logically (to my mind at least), since it is still dark, you slow down before the bridge and flash your headlights just to make sure, but boy racer was obviously too good a driver for that and went tearing hell for leather at the bridge - only to have to slam his brakes on at the last minute for the truck coming from the opposite direction. Then, once he had recovered sufficiently from that piece of insanity, he went tearing off again, belting over a speed bump without slowing down, (it's called a speed bump for a reason) and promptly had his exhaust pipe fall off! Idiot had to then stop and pick it up while we drove past, and I do believe the woman in front of me gave him the royal wave!﻿The royal waveWhen I finally got on the motorway at the second exit there is always a long line of traffic lined up on the hard shoulder trying to head off in the direction of Evian. It is dangerous and if you live round here and don't want to get off there you stick in the outside lane and again, slow down! Except one eejit stayed in the middle lane and then slammed his brakes on, gave a redneck turn signal and just pulled straight over to the next lane - right in front of the truck I was passing! Why anyone would try to argue with a 10-tonne truck I have no idea, but thankfully for both of us the trucker was a bloody good driver and avoided hitting him, but gave him a severe blast of the horn nevertheless.Redneck turn signal!Then about 5 km further up the road there was a big sign saying \"direction Paris - accident - 10 km further ahead\". Thankfully I don't have to go that way but as it leads to a major customs post you can imagine the tailbacks! That is one of the problems round here of course - the massive numbers of cars trying to get into Geneva every day, from France in particular. I think I heard once something like 250,000 cars a day cross the local borders so you can imagine what just one accident does to the flow or traffic. Moreover, you can also see why it would never be possible to pull over every car that crosses the borders between France and Switzerland every day, terrorist threat or not!So about another 5 km ahead, just before I get to the border, there is another difficult motorway exit for people trying to exit at one of the local French towns, and again people keep way over to the left and slow right down. Unfortunately for me, I came up behind a young man in the left-hand lane who obviously wanted to get over to the third right-hand lane so he just stopped in the middle of my lane!!!!  Again, luckily, I know not to drive fast but bloody hell. Whatever you do, you don't just stop!   Aaaaarrggghh I think I am losing my nerve. At least I hope I don't lose my nerve before I can retire in a couple of years time because this rush hour commuting business is just miserable.I finally got past the border and was trying to pull into the Park and Ride but when the light hit green for us to get over to the parking lot we couldn't as the place was jam packed with cars dropping off school kids for what I guess was a day's skiing trip. While I was sitting there at the lights I saw a woman with her umbrella up, talking on her phone, just waltzing across the road to the bus stop, totally oblivious to the fact that the traffic coming towards her had a green light! Like I say, I really do think I must be losing my nerve. Sadly, last Friday I was on the bus when we drove past an accident just a little further up the road. The emergency service were working on someone and a truck driver was standing there sobbing. It turned out that a 27 year old female cyclist had gone under a truck that was turning right and she was killed on the spot. I don't know who was at fault, but in the end one young woman lost her life, the truck driver's life will presumably never be the same and I imagine two families' will be destroyed. All because of a moment's inattention!When I did finally make it on to the bus I had the dubious pleasure of sharing it with about 20 eight-year-olds going on a school trip. I'm not knocking the kids of course because they were incredibly polite, but you can imagine the decibel range on that bus!! Still better loud kids than someone's tears I guess.Thankfully today was absolutely glorious so I got to go walking again at lunchtime. It doesn't take long to forget all your troubles does it."},
{"title": "A veritable heatwave!", "date": "Monday 30 January 2017", "text": "When I left to go to work this morning it was +1°!!! My goodness, after the last three weeks or so of well below zero (-9° last Wednesday) it almost feels tropical! This weekend we were so lucky to have temperatures above zero and bright sunshine. You could almost be forgiven for thinking spring was on its way, although realistically I know we still have the crappy weather to come in February and March. One thing I did notice with the dry weather though is that I keep getting shocked by static electricity. My colleague was explaining that it was because there is no moisture in the air (it snowed two weeks back but nothing since) so every time I touch the car or the tap to fill up the kettle I get a shock. Yuck. She said don't feel sorry for yourself, imagine how my bloody cat feels!Picture by BianotiOn a positive note, I weighed myself this morning and I have lost 4 lbs! Yipee (and finally. I have been pretty good since new year exercising and such but for three weeks my weight wavered back and forth around those same 3-4 lb. I have to admit it was getting a bit frustrating to be making a sustained effort and see no reaction from the scales, so this morning's weigh-in felt pretty good. I have been exercising at lunchtimes three or four times a week since the beginning of the year but seemingly with little effect, so in order to get somewhere I knew I had to sort out the \"calories in\" too. My friend is following the Dukan diet and doing pretty well so far but the big \"but\" there for me is the lack of fruit. I have my reservations about that diet anyway but you know how when you are desperate you will try anything. I checked it out online (from the UK site) as I already have the books, and by their calculations I should hit my ideal weight by May 2017. For the privilege of joining up and receiving online support though, they wanted £232!!! I couldn't believe it. When I looked at Slimming World online (the meetings are not available over here) or Weight Watchers they were pretty much of a muchness price-wise and I think both of them are pretty good systems. Dukan, however, wanted £232 to cover online support for just that 16-18 week period until I would supposedly achieve my goal weight. Thankfully I didn't sign up in my initial spurt of enthusiasm because I only stuck it out 36 hours before I caved and ate fruit. Going on a total protein diet just wouldn't do it for me, even if the results are (initially) very good. I crave fruit so decided to give it a miss and have signed up for a wonderful site called myfitnesspal.com. It has a free calorie and exercise counter plus online support and forums etc. I think in the end the only way I will lose weight is to do it sensibly and slowly, and looking at the calories in certain foods does bring home how the \"extra\" calories seem to slip in. We'll see I suppose, but so far I am enjoying it.On Saturday I stopped in at the local jeweler's - a Harry Potter kind of oldy-worldy shop in town - supposedly to pick up a cheque for a necklace I had sold him three weeks ago. On my 50th birthday my ex bought me a pendant gold necklace with precious stones in it. I never wear necklaces (and he knew that) because I hate anything around my neck. Moreover the marriage was already on the rocks (he left me four months later) so I finally decided to take this necklace down to the jeweler he bought it from (I had the receipt) to see if I could get something for it. He was only interested in the gold so told me to come back next week when he knew the price of gold and he would have a cheque for me. So I stop in three weeks later and I wait 45 minutes while he is dealing with a customer. And you know what, I actually don't mind the waiting. I think I have spent so many years working full-time with young kids and a three-hour daily commute that finally arriving at a point in my life where I can just stand around and daydream is fine by me. Except of course, when it actually came time to serve me he explained that he hadn't had time to remove the stones so could I come back next week? It does baffle me a little that he couldn't have told me that 45 minutes earlier though, but oh well. I guess I have become zen in my old age.For some strange reason, while I was daydreaming I got to thinking about a post by John over at Going Gently. He asked if people had ever \"made a scene\". Being \"very British\" it's not something I would typically do although I can think of one instance when I made a very justifiable scene in a French shop, but that I suspect is a story for another day. No, this story relates to my mom and dad's old neighbour. When they first moved to Dorset they lived next to an old widow named Vera. Eventually Vera died and her son decided that rather than sell her place they would rent it out. Now the only reason I \"knew\" the new people (or had any dealings with them) was because they owned a home in France and asked me to help them with the French while they were trying to sell their place. Eventually they moved out and the son went in to the house to clean it up for the next set of renters. Apparently the place was a pig sty although you would never have guessed it to look at them - all \"butter wouldn't melt in their mouth\" types. He was furious. He knew that the wife worked in a local charity shop so one day he went into the shop with a very large bin bag, plonked it on the counter and said \"oh you left this behind at my mom's place\" and walked out! When the woman picked it up he had cut the bottom out of the bin bag and filled it with all the crap and dirt that he had had to clean up after them - which subsequently spilled all over the floor and counter of the charity shop! Well done him is all I can say, I just cannot believe people can be so filthy.And finally, now I am back in my work/home/work routine I am, as ever, getting plenty of reading done on the bus part of my commute. I am an avid reader and tend to have 3-4 books on the go sometimes, depending on my mood. I have just finished a lovely book by a Swedish writer called Frederik Backman. If you want a feel good, beautifully written, easy read I can highly recommend \"A Man Called Ove\". Utterly charming, is about the best expression I can find for it."},
{"title": "A couple of busy weekends!", "date": "Wednesday 25 January 2017", "text": "These last two weeks have been pretty busy socially. I mentioned before that I am trying out different clubs/courses in a bid to get more involved in my local area before I retire. While I am social enough, I am also quite content in my own company and as retirement is looming tantalisingly close I feel I need to make the effort to meet people outside the work environment (either that or get a dog when I retire!!!)Shortly after my husband left I decided to go on my first \"solo travellers\" holiday to Turkey, since I had always loved travelling and now, being free, was the perfect opportunity. It was wonderful - I love Turkey and can highly recommend solo travelling to anyone, no matter whether they are shy or more outgoing. These groups cater for everyone.  Anyway, on my way to London to join up with the group, I ended up buying myself an expensive camera in the Geneva airport duty free shop because since I was obviously going to become a seasoned international traveller I was logically going to need a good camera to document my travels! Of course I hadn't got a clue how to use the bloody thing so booked in for a three-month evening class on photography, and you know what, I hated it! Oh the teacher was great but I really wasn't interested in learning about photography, and in any case (apparently - according to the teacher) since my new camera was the Michael Schumacher of the camera world I couldn't possibly take a bad picture with it anyway!After that, I took salsa lessons for about a year, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite having two left feet and no sense of rhythm. We were all around the same age (in our 50s) and frankly terrible but it was such good fun. I didn't go back after the first year though because having to drive back into Geneva of an evening, particularly if it was snowing, was really not something I wanted to do after a long day at work.So moving on, I think I mentioned previously that I have now joined a \"board game\" group with my former neighbour. It seems to be quite popular here in France (and in Geneva apparently) and people of all ages meet up about once a month to learn different kinds of board games. Well two weeks ago we met up with our local group on the Saturday evening. Valérie knew one of the ladies who was there with her 10-year-old son so we ended up playing a new board game which another lady very kindly spent a fair amount of time explaining to us. I was absolutely useless though. Now in my defence I will say I was sitting on the wrong side of the table so was reading upside down and in French, but all the same I kept getting hammered by the others, particularly the 10-year-old! We then played another game which was all about speed of reflexes and again we all got clobbered by the 10-year-old. He was playing so fast I joked that he was probably cheating, but he actually wasn't - he was getting the answers right pretty much 100%! Crikey, that makes me feel old.Then late on the Sunday afternoon a friend and I drove in to Geneva to watch Ravel's Bolero being performed by the Russian National Opera and Ballet. I had never seen Bolero before but of course the music is absolutely haunting (it takes me back to the magnificent performance by Torvil and Dean in the 1984 winter olympics). The dancers were simply amazing of course and made it look so easy, but just try flinging your leg behind your head and see how long it takes before you end up in the emergency room!Then of course on the Monday night I had my usual sewing club (I alternate between two clubs as they both meet on the Monday night) and on Tuesday my once-a-month patchwork lesson. It gets to be quite full on when everything happens at the same time but I try to make the effort because otherwise I feel like all I ever do is get up, go to work, drive home, rinse and repeat - and I'm sure I'm not the only one to feel that way!On Christmas Day my oldest son mentioned to me that the Irish comedian, Dara O'Briain, was playing in Geneva so I got seven tickets to go see him and he certainly didn't disappoint!Dara O'BriainMy friend volunteered to drive as I had driven last time and on the way in we saw that the motorway was pretty busy so decided to take a back road. Round here Sunday night traffic can be pretty busy with all the skiers coming down from the mountains so it's better to take the back roads if you know them. As a slight aside, some lunatic almost hit us just as we were getting off the motorway - he didn't even attempt to stop as we were navigating the traffic island and how he didn't hit us (I had my legs pulled all the way up to my chest in case) I have no idea. The frustrating thing is, have you ever wanted to slam on the horn at some dangerous nutter but only succeeded in hitting your turn signal or slamming the windscreen wipers on!  Very frustrating.As I had all seven tickets for the show I called my kids to arrange a time to meet at the theatre only to find out that they were coming back from a weekend in the Valais (a mountainous canton in Swiss Germany). Since they would not hold the tickets for them at reception I told my kids DON'T DARE be late because once Dara starts his show I am NOT getting up to come out and give you the tickets! Can you imagine, suddenly becoming part the show if Dara spots you getting up and walking out! Anyway Jordan made it with five minutes to spare thank God, and Dara was wonderful, as long as you are capable of listening at 150 miles an hour. Yes, he talks that fast! But the theatre was packed and the show was great, although I'll be glad of a few days doing nothing at this point. As an aside, I understand Dara was at CERN last night (the European Centre for Nuclear Research), which is only about 10 km from here, presumably giving another show and, as a nerd himself, digging up potential material for a future gig about nerds and their toys, a.k.a. the hadron collider!"},
{"title": "A coat well travelled!", "date": "Monday 23 January 2017", "text": "I first came to Geneva to work when I was 21. I was young, skinny and suddenly had what seemed like an enormous amount of money to spend and since I had to look presentable for work what did I do ..... what most red-blooded young women did .... I shopped! I suppose for many of us being young was when clothes shopping was fun - before the weight gain and old lady dresses that looked like they had been made from your mom's sofa fabric and but which went nicely with the curtains thank you very much!One winter I remember I bought myself a rather nice pair of boots and a woolly coat which I thought made me look a bit like a sheep but boy did that coat have a lot of success!Taken on the quai in Conwy, 1981In February of that year I flew to Denmark to see my sister. One day we decided to take the kids on a day trip to Sweden - she had a two-year-old and a new born. So new coat and boots to hand we caught the early morning ferry. It was cold but sunny as I remember, so we decided to have a wander along a lovely little deserted beach. All of a sudden the two-year-old shot off and charged straight into the sea! IN FEBRUARY! IN SWEDEN! My sister screamed, I tore after him fully clothed and hauled him out. To be honest it wasn't that deep because he hadn't had time to go far but it was deep enough for me to get bloody soaked in my fancy new boots and coat. The little sod!!! We had to strip him off and wrap him in whatever we had to hand in the car and I just had to sit there and wallow in my misery. That little sod is 36 now - I must remind him of that incident one day!Anyway, in 1985 I married and we moved to DC where I worked for the World Bank. I remember getting off the metro one evening and a lady came running up to me to ask where I had bought the coat as she loved it! I had to let her down gently and explain that I had bought it in Switzerland but hey - more success for the coat!Then in 1989 we moved back to Switzerland and a couple of years after that my sister-in-law was saying how much she loved that coat. I didn't wear it much anymore so I told her she was welcome to have it. This was the sister-in-law who sadly died unexpectedly a year ago last week. So at the weekend I called my brother to see how he was doing after the one year anniversary of her death. In actual fact he was doing fine so that was a relief all round. But, he was telling me that he has got a job, on a voluntary basis, for two days a week working in local hospice care. Then he laughed and said that after her death he had had the hospice people come to the house to take her clothes for their charity shops. She had loads of clothes (I can't remember if he said 30 or 50 coats but you get the idea). Anyway, they took everything away so that he didn't have to deal with it. And last week, on the anniversary of her death, he took a long walk along the quai at Llandudno - and what did he see walking towards him - yep you guessed it, my coat! I told him I think that was his wife's way of poking fun at him ... I'm sure she is, but boy has that coat done some travelling!"},
{"title": "The ongoing saga of brrrrrrrr!", "date": "Wednesday 18 January 2017", "text": "Following seamlessly on from my previous post, my fuel supplier managed to make it out to my house on Monday to deliver 2,000 litres of heating fuel (despite one of their trucks being out of action and despite it not being possible to go through town because the bridge is out - so kudos to the fuel company for that). When I got home Monday night, I ran downstairs to turn the furnace on and luxuriated briefly in the hot air coming off the radiators before I had to run out to go to sewing club. Got home at 10.30 p.m. and there was no bloody heat!!!! Whaaaaaatttttt???? I ran back downstairs and restarted the furnace and went to bed - and woke up the next morning freeeeezzzing again! What the *!*!*!*!*!!?  So again I got on the phone to my maintenance company who promised to come out the same day. They called later and left a message to say that the fuel guy must have flipped an inlet valve on the fuel tank to the \"off\" position as no fuel was getting through to the furnace!! Bloody hell. So now I am going to get billed for two call-outs by the maintenance company since neither call-out was for an \"emergency\" or break down. One bill will be for them to point out that I had no fuel in the tank, and the second because the supply valve had been turned off! Oh well, I honestly don't care at this point as I am just so glad to be warm again (did I mention that it was minus 9°C this morning?)!Yesterday morning I was talking to my boss. He hasn't been feeling well lately but with two young children at home (five and one), it is never a good time to get sick. He was telling me that he had been ill all weekend and thought his oldest was coming down with the same flu-like symptoms! His kids seem to have been continually sick for the past year, which I guess is probably down to the oldest starting school and the youngest starting day-care, as mom has just gone back to work. Well yesterday he called me from home to say that he had to take off in the afternoon as he had a funeral to go to. I reminded him that he had a meeting scheduled at 15h with visitors from Australia! Oh sh*t! So he had to scramble around to get a colleague to stand in for him at the last minute. Then he gets a call from his wife to say that her car has broken down. She was able to get it to a garage and get herself home but they still needed to work out how to pick the kids up later. So immediately after the funeral he had to dash to the garage to get a car seat out of it. Problem was he was on his scooter. He said it was almost lethal trying to get home on a scooter with a car seat strapped to the back in a howling wind!And just to keep the brrrrr saga going, the weather here has been below freezing for about a week now. We have a wind that sometimes blows in Geneva called \"la bise\" - it really howls and makes the wind chill factor pretty unbearable, I have to say. On the positive side, it blows all the clouds away and leaves the lake looking absolutely stunning.Lake Geneva during the biseThis was taken in front of my office buildingWould you like ice with that?My journey to work involves driving to the border and parking in the P&R, and then hopping on the number 25 bus, which takes me door-to-door. Last night I hopped on the bus but the traffic was awful, (as it was in the morning) because when the bise is blowing the ferry boats across the lake don't run. So commuters who would normally park on the south side of the lake and hop a ferry (usually over to Lausanne), have to take their cars and trudge through town, hence the dreadful traffic.Again it was blowing a hooley so I was so glad to get on the bus and get a seat. About 30 minutes into the journey a voice comes over the tannoy saying \"due to traffic delays, this vehicle will not be going to the P&R but will end it's journey at bus stop \"Weber\"! Frickin hell! Anyway, I dutifully hopped off the bus a little earlier in order to be able to get either bus number 5 or the next number 25 that came along. I stood with two men and we were all stomping our feet trying to keep the cold out. The one gent had an enormous package and a carrier bag so for him getting on and off rush hour buses was no mean feet. After a couple of minutes the number 5 came along, so the two of us and \"Mr Big Parcel\" managed to insinuate ourselves onto the crowded bus. Not two minutes later we hear over the tannoy \"due to traffic delays, this vehicle will not be going to the P&R but will end its journey at bus stop \"Rieu\"!  One bloody stop further. You can't make this stuff up. I suppose the only saving grace is that this always seems to happen when it is raining and I will take the bise over freezing rain any day. So the three of us, including Mr Big Parcel, trudged off that bus and stood waiting for the next one, stomping our feet to try to keep warm. At this point you either laugh or cry - thankfully the three of us ended up laughing about it. To be fair the next bus came along in less than 10 minutes and we eventually made it to the park and ride. But have you ever had that feeling where you think \"if just one more thing goes wrong ......\""},
{"title": "It's Friday 13th - ho bloody ho!", "date": "Friday 13 January 2017", "text": "I'm not at all superstitious but I have to say the start to the new year is surpassing itself so far!  My friend, Steve, left on 1st January and when I ran down to the basement just before he left I found that my water heater had started peeing water all over the place and flooding that section of the basement. Bloody hell! I had to take Steve to the airport but before leaving I sent a text message to my son (the plumber - yay me) telling him what had happened. When I got back from the airport Jordan had been over and taken a look at it. It seemed to be a valve problem but since the shops were closed and there was nothing we could do about it until the next day, I had to make do with buckets and frequent trips up and down stairs. Anyway the next day Jordan was able to change the valve and while it still drips (it always did - apparently it is normal for that older kind of boiler), it is now much more manageable. It used to take about a week to fill a bucket with the drips and now I guess it would take about five days so at least it is livable. He was saying though that since I am on my own now, if I want to go ahead and change the heater, I don't need a 300 litre tank, but could get away with a 150 litre tank, so I think I will go with that and have him install it for me later when the weather improves.Then I get home last night - bearing in mind it has been -6 degrees here and they are forecasting -12 - and I have no heat!!!!  Again bl*****dy hell. I checked to make sure the fuel lines were open and turned it on and off a few times but there was nothing doing. One time a cat must have gotten down in my basement and somehow managed to sit on the fuel tank and flip the fuel supply line to \"off\", but that wasn't the case this time.I have a maintenance contract with a very professional local company so I called them immediately and left a message. They called me back at 7 a.m. this morning and the first thing he asked me was if I had fuel in the tanks! Well, of course I do, you moron, I always start the winter season with 2000 litres and when it gets down to about 1000 I order more. Anyway, the guy came out this morning and they called me at work to say that I had indeed run out of fuel (so who's the moron now?)! Well talk about feeling like a bloody idiot. You know the old joke about the woman who goes to the garage complaining about a clunking noise in her car and it turns out there is a golf ball in the trunk! I couldn't understand it as by my reckoning I should still have about 400 litres in the tank (you can't actually see how much is left in the tank). Then I remembered that I had had a leak in the summer and I guess I lost quite a bit more fuel than I thought so the tank was indeed empty. I put in an emergency order this morning but I don't think they will be able to deliver until Tuesday as one of their trucks has had an accident. Thankfully I have a few electric heaters and a paraffin heater so I was ok last night, although I will admit to having what must be the quickest shower in living memory this morning.  Still, what with the heaters and an extremely fetching pair of long johns, I think I will survive until I can get this whole fuel tank/water heater system replaced!"},
{"title": "The trials and tribulations of being a woman!", "date": "Wednesday 11 January 2017", "text": "Yesterday I had lunch with a group of friends/former colleagues. We have all worked together over the years and as time goes by we, as a group, are passing from \"active\" to retired colleagues.  I started working with Janet in 1980 when I first came to Geneva and she retired about three years ago, so we go way back. I have to admit we had an awful lot of fun in those days. In fact, we all worked hard but were able to have some great times along the way too. It has always been a very friendly place to work but as time went by and the number of employees more than doubled it has become difficult to maintain that kind of friendly, family atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great place to work, though just not as \"familial\" as it used to be.Anyway, the girls were asking about my preparations for my son's wedding in July so I was telling them about how I had seen a beautiful dress, how I was definitely going to lose 16 kg (yeah right) and that I was thinking of getting a spray-on tan for the event. I had had one many years ago - oh, about 20 I would guess - and it turned out lovely. It was one of those shower-type salons where you go in there starkers except for your shower hat and then get sprayed on all sides for about 20 seconds. The tan was very subtle as I am not dark skinned and I looked really \"healthy\" as opposed to tanned. Trouble is, it was quite expensive and only lasted about five days so I didn't bother going back.I am fair skinned and tend to go from lily white/blue to bright red with freckles then back to whitish/blue. In fact the only time I ever had a decent tan was when I back-packed round Australia for six months so my tan had six months to build up. I tell ya, when I landed back in London on December 14th 1983 (see how I remember the date) in my shorts and t-shirt (freezing my buns off because all my clothes had got soaked in Jakarta), very briefly I was probably the most tanned person at Heathrow Airport! That feeling of smug satisfaction lasted all of about 10 minutes until I got outside in the freezing snow and cold and had to try to fish out something not totally sodden to wear on the journey back to mom and dad's!Anyway, fast forward to about seven years ago and they opened a new beauty salon directly over the road from work, I decided to give it another shot.  Of course, I was expecting something like the last set-up so I got the shock of my life when she handed me something that looked like a condom, told me to take all my clothes off and \"put that on\" (the condom - turned out it was a two-inch square of plastic to \"cover my modesty\"), and \"would you mind if Françoise comes along to watch as she is a trainee?\"  What!!! Who was going to be watching me looking like a beached whale wearing a condom?  But of course, being a wimp, I said yes. They actually sprayed/sponged me all over with the fake tan, the crowning humiliation of which was when they asked me to lift my boobs (off my knees) so that they could get under there! Oh the shame. I have to admit though that yet again it looked good, but, again, it only lasted about five days.So when I told the \"ladies that lunch\" about my plans one of them reminded me of her experience at the same salon. They sprayed her with the fake tan and when she woke up the next morning, instead of a beautiful allover tan she looked like a leopard. Apparently some of the holes in the spray nozzle had been blocked and she ending up covered in polka-dots. I mean, seriously! Of course it's hysterical now but at the time she didn't find it very funny. Another friend was telling us about the time she tried it before going out that same evening (she's a redhead so doesn't tan) and somehow she managed to get covered in what can only be described as \"dripping paint\". She spent the afternoon locked in her (absent) boss's office trying to scrub herself down to get rid of the drip stains. She said she ended up bright red all over and scratched to hell!Oh my goodness, that has given me food for thought. I think I might just try one of those gentle sprays you can buy over the counter, just for the bits that you can see. After all, I don't want to end up looking like Ross in that episode of Friends!"},
{"title": "Finally!", "date": "Tuesday 10 January 2017", "text": "In a bid to become more involved in the local French community, I decided to join two evening sewing clubs. Unfortunately they both meet on a Monday night so I have to alternate between them. One is a club where you can just make anything you want and the ladies will help you out - or like some do, just bring your mending along and have a good natter. I think that's a great idea, it's social, cheap (€40 a year just for the room rental) and who knows, you could actually end up learning something. The other club is much more \"serious\" and more patchwork oriented, which is something I am really keen to learn. Again in this club, one of the older ladies rarely actually sews anything but just comes along for the natter. I was at the patchwork club last night and while we had snow predicted I was really hoping it wouldn't fall until later as some of the ladies won't go out in the snow. Anyway, I made it and have now almost finished the \"pochon\" that I am making (kinda fabric bag thingy). I had wanted to finish several of these to put Christmas gifts in for my sons' girlfriends but they never got finished in time. There's always next year I suppose.This isn't mine - but it is something similarWhen we finished up at 10 pm I was just arriving at my village when I thought I noticed something move. We are out in the sticks and there are no lights in the run-up to the village so I slowed right down, and for the first time in nearly 28 years I spotted a deer.Yes I know everyone knows what a deer looks like but I couldn't resist! And then about 30 seconds later another deer. Luckily there was no-one behind me so I was able to slow right down and admire them. I know to many this might not seem like a biggy, but as I said, I have been in the house almost 28 years, we are in open countryside and have forests all round and I have never spotted a deer. Foxes and even wild boar but never deer (ha, I initially spelled that \"bore\" and not \"boar\" - that conjures up a Gary Larson cartoon in my twisted little mind)!\"Wild bore\" - image by emfreyMy friend used to get them wandering up to her back garden but us, never. I saw boar coming back from a restaurant one time (I was coming back from the restaurant, not the boar) and my son once saw one running through our back garden but we have never had deer. It was a lovely sight I can tell you.My ex in-laws lived not far from Pittsburgh airport, and although it was near the airport it was actually quite rural. If we took a particular favourite backroad up to their place we could almost guarantee coming across deer.  Every year we went back after that it seemed like they had stripped more and more of the woodland to build shopping malls and it was not uncommon then to see deer running along the highways dodging traffic. Very sad I thought, as their natural habitat was being destroyed with each year that passed. I suppose it also begs the question how the heck could all these shopping malls make money. I mean, when I lived there I used to drive about 30 minutes to a shopping mall, and in the space of what seemed like 15 years there were new shopping malls springing up every mile or so. Not sure how they could compete to be honest.Anyway, that was just a by-the-way. Tonight I have my once-a-month patchwork lesson down in a place called Cluses. I have to go straight there from work as it is quite a trek and of course we got snow today so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the roads will be ok. We are in the process of making a patchwork quilt and I am hoping to be able to incorporate into mine three photos taken of my son and his fiancée for their engagement. Apparently you can photocopy a photo onto special fabric and incorporate it into the quilt. Now being a bit of a novice I am going to need help from Lydie, my teacher, but my aim is to get this quilt finished, personalized with their initials and give it to them as a wedding present. Wish me luck, because my sewing output is stupendously low.On another note, in a bid to lose some weight I have been really good about exercising since the New Year and have exercised every day except one so far but have I lost any weight? Have I heck. I haven't moved an ounce and it is so discouraging. The only positive I suppose is that I have realized how much I actually enjoy exercising. Well, to put it more accurately, I enjoy the way I feel after I have exercised. A bit like banging your head against a brick wall I suppose - it feels great when you stop! As the weather has been great - cold but sunny - I have tried to get outside and walk for an hour at lunchtimes. I have never minded the cold, although the other day it was -6 and with the wind blowing I hate to think what the wind chill factor was. Nevertheless, I conjured up my stiff upper lip, donned four layers of clothing and trudged out at lunchtime.  Trouble is, the cold always makes my nose run. It isn't really the done thing to stop and ask someone to blow your nose for you because you can't bend your elbows is it! Gotta work on Plan B I think."},
{"title": "And the rest of Christmas", "date": "Thursday 5 January 2017", "text": "Christmas 2015 was a lovely break. The weather was mild and I got an awful lot done but you know how sometimes when you don't actually do anything fun it seems to feel like less of a break than if you actually let your hair down a bit!  Well this Christmas was definitely different. I had a lovely Christmas Day lunch with my family and a friend. I made rack of lamb and gratin, which turned out pretty well, followed by fruit salad because I find the food over the holidays way, way too heavy. My oldest mentioned that the Irish comedian Dara O'Briain was appearing in Geneva at the end of January so seven of us have booked tickets for that. Dara is hilarious and it will be so nice to go out with my kids so I am really looking forward to it.Then, as I mentioned yesterday, Steve came out from England for the new year. As he arrived early in the morning we went straight from the airport to Annecy (trying to pack in as much as possible of course). The Christmas market was still on so we had a lovely time, eating tartiflette and wandering round the market and the old town.(I couldn't get a decent picture of the stands so I have just included a shot of what was the old prison \"in the day\" as the market takes place all around that area). While it was busy it wasn't heaving so that proved a nice start to his stay.The next day we headed up to my favourite ski resort of La Clusaz (about 40 minutes from home). Again beautiful weather but no snow. La Clusaz is a medium-sized resort and they just don't have the capability to manufacture snow on such a large scale so I hate to think how much money they would be losing. The daily ski lift was €37 and someone mentioned that they could expect 20,000 visitors (per day? per Christmas week?  - I'm not sure) but in any case it must be fairly catastrophic for the lift operators, the seasonal workers, the restaurants etc., not to mention how disappointing it would be to people who had reserved accommodation for the Christmas week. There were a few small groups of ski classes but only for the toddlers as there just wasn't the snow (although the kids looked great all decked out in their ski gear). We decided to take the cable car up to the Plateau de Beauregard which should have been covered in snow but there was none! We had a lovely lunch outside on the terrace and while admittedly our restaurant was packed ... oh my goodness, how much money must they have been losing over the Christmas break!At the Plateau de BeauregardI posted yesterday about the lovely time we had on New Year's Eve at Lavey and Evian so on New Year's Day, as we had stayed up till 5 a.m., we decided to spend the day at home slobbing around and putting the world to rights. Since we can both yack for England that wasn't a problem!For his return flight I had told Steve to book as late a flight as possible just in case we got hammered by snow/traffic. That gave us time to have a wander around Yvoire (a medieval village on the lake) and then a quick lunch in Geneva's old town before I took him off to the airport.Photo by Matt ReesThere was hardly anything open at Yvoire, of course, but we were still able to have a walk around and a coffee.  Very few shops were open but while everything was pretty, all Christmasy and so on, this lady mannequin caught my eye!It was kinda scary thinking that if I don't do anything about my weight before my son's wedding I might end up looking like that so now it's time to get serious (to be fair, I have been good so far since returning to work, exercising, walking, gym etc. - so just another 180 days to go then!).Place du Bourg du Four, old town, Geneva(not my picture, sorry I can't remember the name of the photographer)It's Steve's birthday next week and as I was taking down the Christmas cards I had a wonderful idea! Steve and I are both divorced and while we have had relationships both of us are pretty adamant that we will never get married again, nor will we ever live with someone again (I know you can never say \"never\", but I'm pretty sure \"never\" means \"never\")! We both own our own homes and neither of us are of an age to start again or feel inclined to say to another \"significant other\" during a second divorce \"here, take 50% of the home I bought with my own money\"! He refers to himself as a king in his own little castle, so I guess that makes me a queen. So after cutting, sticking and pasting (all with my tongue sticking out), I just sent him this birthday card (I had to black out his last name for obvious reasons).  Happy birthday Steve!The first page of his birthday card!The inside - hope he likes it!"},
{"title": "What a magical New Year's Eve!", "date": "Wednesday 4 January 2017", "text": "Do you know how some day's are just diamonds, how some days just seem to work out! Well New Year's Eve was just one of them. It was obviously a good visitor's combination trip because I followed the same route some years ago with my family and we all agreed it was such a great way to celebrate the New Year.As I mentioned previously, I had a friend over from England for four nights. We met in Peru four years ago and had remained in touch.Steve had even been out to visit me once previously when he was on business in Zurich. Turns out he is still just as much fun as I remember and we had a wonderful time. On top of that, the weather cooperated 100% - though not for the skiers of course, but for we lesser mortals it was just fantastic.On the morning of 31st we headed out to Lavey-les-Bains which is a hot springs about two hours from here. We took the \"scenic route\" (although to be honest around here all routes are \"scenic\", following Lake Geneva on the north side in order to arrive high up above Vevey, Montreux and the Château de Chillon. Again we lucked out as it started out foggy but as we got to the highest point on the motorway the fog started to lift!Château de Chillon - image by IncotradeAnother 45 minutes and we were at Lavey. It was freezing cold out but the springs, of course, were steaming and sooooooo relaxing. It wasn't too packed considering and at one point I was standing under one of the pressure jets having my back pummelled when I looked at the man next to me and recognized a work colleague with his young son (don't usually see 'em with their clothes off do ya!). We had a chat and he told me that his wife - who is also a colleague - had gone off to Strasbourg with their daughter. Steve and I had been talking about just how you should never assume you won't be caught out if you are having an affair because I mean, what were the chances of me bumping into a colleague (fair, I suppose) but again what were the chances of my standing next to him in the steaming mist of Lavey?  Of course he was there with his son and not his mistress but crikey it's a small world isn't it!After about three hours we headed off back home via Evian, which is on the south side of Lake Geneva. I knew the \"Festival des Flottins\" was on but didn't really know much about it, although I knew that Steve would like Evian anyway. Well what a lovely surprise \"Les Flottins\" was! And here, for your greater delight is their story!* * *\"Listen, listen! And you will hear.  And if you want to believe, you will believe! Wherever you are... sprinkle alittle pixie dust around you and tune in to the sound of fairy bells!Since the beginning of time, fairy-folk of all kinds from throughout theAlps, including elves, sirens, nymphs, witches, fairies, pixies and hobgoblins,have been washed up on the beach in Evian. From snowfalls to avalanches, fromtrickling springs to streams to rivers, from small rivers to the majesticRhone, they are carried along on their driftwood rafts according to the whims ofMother Nature, until they finally reach the banks of Lake Geneva, a magicalplace where they find rest. These tiny creatures are known asFlottins…”Every winter, Flottins flock to their village, built entirely from pieces ofdriftwood washed up by the river. In their bright, cheerful world, these joyfultravellers lead a peaceful existence. But one November evening, as Santa Clausset out on a practice flight over Lake Geneva, a squabble between the leadingreindeer forced the sleigh into an emergency landing on the water. Panicstations! The inhabitants of the village immediately swam out into the lake tosave them and, that very night, they set about building a magnificent cabinfrom driftwood for their marooned visitors. Since then, Santa Claus pays avisit to his Flottin friends once a year before setting out on his big trip...* * *These magical creatures were all over Evian and kids were allowed to climb and play anywhere they wanted.The whole town was filled with these things and the nearer you got to the casino (which of course was beautifully lit up) the more there were. It was just stunning and I can't even say it was that crowded. After a couple of hours and a few hot drinks in Evian we headed off home to spend New Year's Eve in front of the TV watching comedy shows, eating smoked salmon blinis with a bottle of champagne. As I say, some days are just diamonds!"},
{"title": "Are you a tortoise or a hare?", "date": "Wednesday 21 December 2016", "text": "Things at work have started to calm down now that my meeting is done and dusted. I am now working on another report that has to go to translation in January but at this point we are actually well ahead of the game. Work and traffic is quiet as schools are out and many people have extended their Christmas holidays, so I am actually quite enjoying getting ahead. Christmas is prepared, presents wrapped and I know what I am making on Christmas Day (not turkey for a change, I hate having to make a specific dish for a specific day so I have decided instead to cook rack of lamb plus potato gratin, plus a few other sides). After Christmas I have my friend coming over from England for a few days, so hence the reference to the \"tortoise and the hare\".My house has been getting me down as it is pretty cluttered since I seem to be the repository for everyone else's junk, and while I keep it clean it honestly could do with a good scrub. Logic seems to suggest it is better to get rid of stuff and then clean, of course, so I am trying to do a little bit at a time. However, with a 40-hour working week and a minimum daily commute of three hours, as you can imagine I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to start cleaning when I get home from work.  My ex was the kind to throw everything out of a cupboard/room, charge into it and keep going (and yelling at all and sundry) until it was done. The problem with that, of course, was that apart from the fact that the urge to clean didn't come over him too often, being an ex-Marine he used to bark orders at everyone since he seemed to think everyone should pitch in and be \"available\" and at his command. My feelings are that if I feel like doing something I just get on and do it, that way it is not really a chore for me. Plus I stop when I choose to and just do a bit more another day. I am out on a Monday night so on Tuesdays and Wednesday I have been spending up to an hour each night scrubbing/pitching stuff in the kitchen. UUUUUGGGGHHH you wouldn't believe the state of the extractor fan - you know, on top the bit you can't see unless you are 6ft 8! Yuck! I climbed up a ladder to change a light bulb and could see just how grimy it was, so I spent one hour one night cleaning the top and one hour the next doing the underneath. Then another night would be a specific cupboard and so on, and if I felt like quitting in the middle of it I just did - no-one was there to yell about it. I have the Marie Kondo book on decluttering and while I think she is madder than a bag of rats I have to say I respect some of her methods - it's just that they are not for me. (In any case, someone who has made so much money - presumably - telling people how to declutter can't exactly be that mad can she). So bit by bit I am getting stuff done and in reality it doesn't take that long to see progress.Other than that, there hasn't been much new here. I went to my son's school the other week to see him pick up his plumbing diploma (so if anyone needs a fully-qualified plumber give me a shout). Glad I made it actually even though it was very low key. What did strike me though was how respectful the young lads (and a few girls) were towards their teachers - it was so nice to see. Jordan will be doing another two years apprenticeship to qualify in heating/air con installation so then we will really be talking (and hopefully making a bit more money, but I am pleased for him all the same).In other news, the Russian National Ballet are giving a tribute performance of Ravel's Bolero in February here in Geneva so I bought tickets for that. I also enrolled for a one-time evening class on how to put together a vegan buffet, also taking place in February. It's funny really, because as I would like to lose some weight before the wedding in July I have been looking at the Dukan diet and that seems to be strongly based around eating lots of protein/meat - and here am I going on a vegan cookery course! Oh the irony! Here at work quite a few people lost a fair amount of weight on that diet but to be honest most put it back on too. Not sure I can stomach it but I will see how I feel in the new year. I'm also not sure I would be that drawn to a vegan diet either to be honest, but vegetarianism is something that has always interested me. Indeed, I actually gave it a shot a couple of times many years ago, and I have to say I felt wonderful on it - and then went off to England to visit family and screwed up with the \"full English breakfast\" trap! I might give it some more thought though depending on how motivating I find this course.Last weekend I got up on Saturday and thought \"hey, I don't actually need any shopping, I don't feel like doing anything\" so I decided to do bugger all and just lounged about on the sofa all day and read - and you know what, it was great! It is something I have never really allowed myself to do - take a day \"just for myself\", but in the end who do I have to answer to anyway? Actually slobbing around for a day is fine very occasionally for me, but not something I could do very often as I tend to get ants in my pants. That being said, it was a rare treat - I must remember to do more of it!So on that note, if I don't post again before Christmas I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy 2017.  I had wanted to mention the atrocities in Berlin yesterday but what can anyone say anymore about such barbarity - or about Aleppo (those poor, innocent civilians), or about ...... wherever these monsters work their evil. In fact, I have a colleague/friend who retired to Nice a couple of years ago and she was actually in a beach front restaurant when they killed all those people on Bastille Day. In order to get back to her apartment she had to walk past all the dead and injured - of course the horror is still with her and will most likely remain so forever!So stay safe and my best wishes to everyone for the new year."},
{"title": "Looks can be deceptive!", "date": "Thursday 15 December 2016", "text": "On Sunday I went over to visit my oldest son and his girlfriend as it was Lily's birthday and I had a gift for her. So I finally got to hear a bit more about the wedding plans - no thanks to my son though of course! What is it with young men, or maybe just men in general? I mean, we women can probably natter about anything for hours but do you think he has told me anything about how the plans were going?  It turns out that they have booked a venue not so far from where I live (about 40 minutes I guess). They had wanted to book something in Switzerland but the cost was prohibitive (no surprise there then) so they have booked what looks like a renovated barn complex and very nice it is too. In fact, I know that area quite well because \"in the day\" we used to take our camper down to the Parc National des Bauges every second weekend to go fishing. Good times actually, as we made friends with quite a few French couples who kept caravans there all through the season so that the men could spend as much time fishing as possible and the women seemed quite content just taking walks or chatting. It was pretty nice for the kids too as there was a well-thought-out camp site where they had the river and park to play in and plenty of friends to run with. Then of course they got older and didn't want to come with mom and dad any more so that kinda put the kibosh on that!!!Les BaugesIn fact, on New Year's Eve 1999/2000 about five couples from the fishing group came up to our village where we rented the village hall and had a fancy dress party. You ain't seen nothing until you have seen two fat, elderly French fishermen dressed as Asterix and Obelix!Anyway, I digress, but as Lily's mom will be dressed in traditional Korean dress, I have to come up with something to wear that is also somewhat formal. Question: I have seen the most beautiful dress but it is silver and I'm not sure that that would be appropriate to wear to a wedding. I know only the bride is supposed to wear white but I'm not sure about silver. I suppose it would be ok if it was jazzed up with a colourful shawl or something, and come to think of it Lily did actually show me an outfit she liked for me and that was pale grey, so maybe it is a possibility. Oh and I just need to lose about 15 kg too - forgot about that minor detail! Thankfully I have some time but right now the blubber isn't exactly falling off or disappearing subliminally!I tell you what though, André is pretty damn lucky he has Lily organizing this (what on earth did we do before the internet?) as she is a natural organizer and obviously enjoying it - well for the time being at least. I have offered to help but she seems on top of everything for the moment.  André has also seen the most gorgeous suit which is pretty darn expensive, but as it is Italian we were both nagging him to drive down to Milan (the home of fashion!! and only about four hours' drive away), and check that out too. I mean, with the recent referendum in Italy the euro took yet another hit so it would be to his advantage to either look there or, indeed, fly to England for the weekend and look around.Lily mentioned that they had booked someone to come over and do hair and make-up on the day and that \"I should feel free to come over\". I hadn't even thought about that, I mean, I did get my hair done the day I got married but it never occurred to me to have someone do my make-up! (Yeah, tell me I'm sounding like a dinosaur - I know).Talking of \"make-overs\", many, many years ago, when said dinosaurs actually did still roam the earth, I took six months leave from my job and back-packed around Australia (wonderful time - the subject of another post I suspect). Anyway, I was just 24 and my friend and I were in Brisbane waiting for the next bus going further north to our next stop. Trouble was, we had about three hours to wait so since we were in the city centre my friend suggested we had a shufty round the local department store and get a \"free\" makeover. Of course the aim is to get you to buy their products but we did get the makeover. Well .... we were both young, in shorts and T-shirts and lugging backpacks - and we came out looking like two hookers! You know, pile it on with a trowel and strip it off with a blow torch kinda thing. We both dashed straight to the nearest loo and washed as much of it off as we could but heck, it took some scrubbing!Photo by Cindy ShermanI have a lovely colleague who took a month off to do a course at the London school of make-up so she offered to give me a free tutorial since, as she pointed out, she needs to practice too! So she did my make-up the other day during my lunch break and hey - I didn't look quite so bad. It's amazing what can be achieved in the right hands isn't it! And it does bring it home how so many celebrities might not be quite so stunning if they didn't have the help of make-up artists, stylists, hairdressers, back-lighting and good old photo shop.  To be honest though, there is such a \"fashion\" now for the ultra-white (false) teeth, the hair extensions, botox etc. that so many look identical. Shame really, because the most interesting faces (in my humble opinion) are the ones that have a bit of character to them. Ah well, I'd better be off to see if I can re-produce what my colleague did - wish me luck!"},
{"title": "Slum Britain", "date": "Thursday 8 December 2016", "text": "Did anyone see the programme on TV the other night called \"Slum Britain\"? I found it so very sad but also very thought-provoking.  Fifty years ago, photographer Nick Hedges went round Britain taking photos of families living in poverty in various cities around the UK. Birmingham was probably what interested me the most (although not necessarily the most soul-destroying) because that is where I grew up and I knew some of the areas he had photographed. I believe he was commissioned by Shelter - the organization working on behalf of homeless people - and the programme took a look, where possible, at the current lives of some of the children from those photographs 50 years ago to see what had become of theme.Photo by Nick HedgesThe living accommodation (if you can call it \"living\") was dire - damp, cold and over-crowded, and of course many, not yet having access to contraception, had large families, with ever-more kids coming along each year and often no way to take care of the ones they already had.I was born in inner-city Birmingham in housing somewhat similar to that portrayed in the film Billy Elliott. It was nowhere near as appalling as that shown in the Hedges' photos of course, but cramped and depressing nevertheless and our home was, in fact, bulldozed as a slum when I was three years old. I obviously have very limited memories of that home but I do have some (I remember describing things to my mom once and she was stunned that I could remember so much detail!). Billy ElliottWe were moved out to a council estate to what, in comparison, must have looked like a palace to my family, with four bedrooms. Even then, in the six terraced houses in our new little block there were 40 kids! How our parents managed to keep us all fed and warm is beyond me (but I suppose on the positive side, we always had someone to play with).Dad and Judy (down the \"old end\")The overwhelming feelings I got from watching the programme was of hopelessness but also stoicism. As one man put it, \"yes we were poor, but then so was everyone else and we knew no different\". I understand that absolutely. Another sad, but very telling comment, was that in those days everyone pulled together and there was a sense of community, which is sadly missing nowadays. But I think the comment that struck me the most was that where previously people were short of \"stuff\" today people are short of \"hope\"! That really hit me.They highlighted the case of a few of those \"children\" (now adults) whose current situations were pretty dire. At first it annoyed me somewhat because in some cases they were drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and had pets (one was even shooting up) and I thought if they could afford all that how come they were using a soup kitchen? But as the programme went on I got a better understanding of how - when you remove just one brick from that security wall - the hole thing comes down and your life and future can be lost just like that. In fact, someone recently mentioned to me the movie \"Cathy Come Home\" which gives a vivid portrayal of just this.Another man described how he had skipped school, joined the army and worked hard at every job he subsequently had because there was \"no way he was going back to that\"! I have always been interested in these kinds of issues. I remember reading a book called \"Around About a Pound a Week\" which (and I paraphrase) detailed a survey of how people in the 1930s (I think) in similar circumstances as described above tried to manage on \"around about a pound a week\", with the inevitable large families and poor housing. One of the salient points, to my mind, was that the more they were able to afford in rent (i.e. live on the ground floor), the less likely they were to have to live in dank, depressing basements, and hence the less likely the children were to get sick (and possibly even die) - the catch-22 situation!I also read sometime ago (and I can't for the life of me remember the title of it) a book written by an American journalist as she tried to survive on minimum wage jobs in several different US states (for six months, I think). The biggest take-away from that book was that, as with the English survey mentioned above, accommodation was pretty much the deciding factor in who would survive and who would go under, because if you couldn't afford a kitchenette, you couldn't cook for yourself, so were more likely to live off junk food and hence more likely to get sick and so on and so forth. Depressing stuff I suppose but something that fascinates me.Every week when I am shopping I pick up a few items for the local Red Cross-run food bank, and when I have a case full I take it down there when they are open on a Tuesday night. I am also the treasurer (i.e. I have a little tin with the \"takings\" in) for our second-hand book store at work and occasionally we meet to discuss where we would like to make donations to. (Last time we were able to fund two wheelchairs in Peru for an organization close to a Peruvian colleague's heart). I suppose because I work in such a wealthy city as Geneva the difference between the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\" is more striking, although I'm sure the same could be said of any big city, to be honest.I am hoping to retire in three-four years time (when my mortgage is paid off) and I am already giving thought to how I would like to spend some of my time working with these kinds of organizations. Many of my colleagues already work voluntarily with various aid groups here in the region so I will have opportunities to see where is the best fit for me (they are currently working with local refugee groups - of course - a battered women's refuge, a local soup kitchen, two orphanages in Uruguay and I am slowly introducing the idea of working with the food bank in the small town where I live).I actually had an idea for another post in my mind today, but watching this programme last night really brought home to me how someone only has to lose just that one brick in the wall and the whole lot can so easily come tumbling down!"},
{"title": "All quiet on the western front!", "date": "Wednesday 30 November 2016", "text": "There's not much going on here at the moment. All the work is done in preparation for the big meeting next week and then ..... probably bugger all to do until Christmas (or very little). I prefer to be busy but that's the way my work goes - very cyclical. Still, with all the stuff I have to do in connection with reverting to my maiden name I suppose it's as well to have some down time too. Talking of changing my name though, I have to admit it has really been pretty easy so far.  I stopped in at the Mairie (the local \"town hall\") on Saturday to register my change of name now that I have my new passport and it took about three minutes - two of which were spent just chatting! It was funny though because the lady pulled out a paper sheet from her drawer, put a pencil line through \"B\" and inserted my new name of \"T\" and that was it! Talk about high tech. Well actually she laughed and said that she would input put it into the computer also but probably \"after coffee\"!I emailed a copy of my new passport to the French bank and received my new cheque book about a week later (on a side note, they haven't used cheques in Switzerland for 13 years now) and then I stopped in at the Swiss bank - having waited until my salary went in in my old name - on Monday and today (Wednesday) I have already received my new bank cards! Very impressed. Electricity, mobile phones, water bill - all switched.  Next up is my driving licence, although that does already have both names. Still, it's about to fall apart at the seams being a paper licence so I guess I should drag it into the twentieth century (at the very least) and get the credit-card-style one too. But so far, as I said, so good.I'm still not sure what my kids are doing for Christmas this year. I didn't see them on Christmas day last year as they had other plans - but that was ok with me as we got together on the 29th. My youngest said he will be up home as his girlfriend will be working (she is a psychiatric nurse) but I don't know what the oldest will be doing yet. And, devil that I am, I don't think I will cook a turkey. I hate having to do/eat something just because it is a particular day so I am thinking lamb this year. Not sure yet but I am leaning that way.Oh, André (the oldest) and his fiancée (am still getting used to that word) flew to the UK recently and had engagement pictures taken just south of London, and how lovely they are. (These are pictures of pictures so maybe not the best quality but good enough for me until I can order copies) and Lily tells me she found her wedding dress on her last long week-end in London!To think that when my ex left I bought myself an expensive camera (in the duty-free at the airport) and took photography lessons and I am still crap. I lugged that bloody thing up Machu Picchu in Peru (and admittedly got some beautiful photos) but it was so heavy that I ended up taking most of my photos on my ipad! Still, I'm sure I have other qualities.Talking of Peru, amongst the many people I met on that trip was a lovely Yorkshireman called Steve. He and I have stayed in touch over the last four years and now he is coming out to spend New Year here with me. He has been out before, although only briefly, but as we were chatting the other day we ended up arranging for him to come out again. I told him to bring his cozzie because I plan to take him to Lavey-les-Bains hotsprings on New Year's eve (via Vevey/Montreux on the way out and Evian on the way back - i.e. the scenic route). I did this once years ago when my family came over and I think it was the best New Year's I have ever spent - so totally different. (I don't suppose there's much chance I can lose 15 kg between now and then though!). Anyway, he is good fun so it should be great, particularly as my employer (very generously) closes between Christmas and New Year!So on that note, I will love you and leave you. Just a shout out to Sonya Ann though who has been off the radar recently. Hope you are feeling better my dear - blogworld is a very quiet place without you!"},
{"title": "My first pub quiz", "date": "Wednesday 23 November 2016", "text": "Last Friday my colleague invited me to join her for my first ever pub quiz! Yes I was a \"quiz virgin\" - but even though it was a heck of a trek for me, as it sounded like fun I thought I would give it a shot.Her mom and dad had just arrived from Ireland and being the dutiful daughter that she is she got mom to baby-sit (on her first night and her birthday to boot) while dad came out to the pub with us for the quiz (though to be fair, mom loved the chance to baby-sit little-un as she doesn't get the chance to see him that often, of course). Anyway, dad's name is Charlie so our team name was - you guessed it - Charlie's Angels (I like to think we looked the part but that might be wishful thinking or beer goggles on my part)!Anyway, it was well organized and well-attended, and was being held to raise money for a local refugee charity called \"Foodkind\". A lovely young Scottish girl gave a short presentation on how the charity works and a local (minor) celebrity DJ was the compere. Actually he was very good and sharp-witted (giving the team called \"The Brexiteers\" quite a run for their money).To be honest, the questions were very much \"locally-oriented\" and maybe not quite what I was expecting, but then as the profits were going to a small, local refugee charity I suppose that should come as no surprise really. I mean, how many of you have ever looked at the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) website? Nah, didn't think so. Me neither. Oddly enough, it's amazing what you \"think you know, but don't really\", if you know what I mean, although I was quite chuffed at myself for correctly guessing the name of the third goal-scorer on the 1998 French World Cup winning team (well this is France after all). Still even though we didn't win (well didn't actually come close) it was good fun and Charlie was an absolute doll, so I think I will give it another go. Apparently Paddy's Irish Pub in the local town runs a quiz about once a month (where I guess the questions might be a little less specific) so I might give that a shot next time.Then on Saturday night my friend and I were out again at the local GEDS (Geneva English Drama Society) presentation of Noel Coward's \"Relative Values\". As always, they do a wonderful job but I have to say how much I enjoyed the actual play itself - never having seen a Noel Coward play before. Very drôle!Actually, as much as I would like to fly into London or wherever to see some of these plays (and even though you can get some pretty good deals from here), being able to see these \"amateur\" performances has allowed me see theatre that I would otherwise never get to see, and I have had some really good experiences.Actually they are putting on Puss in Boots for the Christmas panto. Don't think I will be going to that as it really is for young children but who knows - maybe when grandchildren come along ......!Altogether now \"HE'S BEHIND YOU\"!!!!!!!"},
{"title": "That was fast!", "date": "Friday 18 November 2016", "text": "I wrote a couple of posts back about how I had gone the Deed Poll route of changing my name back to my maiden name. I had wanted to do it for ages but was put off by the amount of work that would be involved getting everything changed to be honest. And then, of course, I still had another six years to run on my current passport so kept saying \"I'll do it when I have to renew my passport\" and so on. Trouble is, if I waited those six years I would (hopefully) be retired and would, I think, probably be even less inclined to go through all the hassle. But then, as I mentioned in my earlier post, I was working late one night with my colleague and when we took a short break I thought \"sod it\", went on the Deed Poll site and changed my name \"just like that\"!I also went the Deed Poll route because apart from being a perfectly legal way to change my name, according to their web site the Deed Poll was all I needed in order to get my passport changed. If reverting to my maiden name, the alternative, according to the passport office, was to submit God knows how many different papers (all of which I had) but in the original copy and all in English! Well I knew I wasn't going to be sending off my original birth certificate, marriage certificate or divorce judgement anywhere, and I certainly wasn't going to bloody well pay to have the 14 pages of my divorce judgement translated officially into English when all my paperwork showed my maiden name as \"T\" - so hence I stuck with the Deed Poll route.The problem was, the passport office wrote back and said they also needed \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\", so I emailed them copies of my birth certificate, my marriage certificate and divorce judgement, my French driver's licence (showing both names) and an attestation from my employer giving both names and still it wasn't good enough. When I complained that (a) I crossed the Franco-Swiss border twice a day and despite Schengen I could still get stopped, and (b) I had been led to believe that the Deed Poll act alone was enough, they told me they couldn't be responsible for what was on the Deed Poll site!!!! Talk about frustrated. I mean, it's not like I was trying to change my name to Elvis Presley or anything, I just wanted my birth name back.So next they said they would accept an attestation from my employer stating that my name was now \"T\" and not \"B\" so I told them that neither my employer nor the Swiss authorities (for my work permit) would change my name to \"T\" until they (the passport office) issued me with appropriate photo ID in that name! My God, I felt like the puppy chasing it's tail! I am pretty placid as it happens but I thought my head was going to explode. Their response to that was to get my employer to submit another attestation confirming that neither they nor the Swiss would issue me with new papers until I got my passport back in the name of \"T\"!!! So I drafted an attestation to this effect which my employer happily stamped and BINGO - it worked! While I understand that passports aren't (nor should they be) given out lightly, you can only imagine how frustrated I was. That being said - and to be fair to the passport office - I mailed my old passport off to them on 2 November and had my new passport back on 16 November so despite all the hassle the turn around time was pretty impressive. I also, despite my frustration, remained polite because they were only doing their jobs and to be honest, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar anyway. I mean, if someone who holds some kind of power over you really wants to screw you they can - so why tempt fate.That little \"chip\" at the bottom of the passport means that it is an e-passport, which means that I can go through the automated customs control when entering the UK as it has all my details micro-chipped. I think I was coming back from Turkey the first time I went through the automated passport control and while there were occasional blips I think it works pretty well.This morning I contacted my Swiss bank for an appointment to change my salary account etc. over to my new name and we will do it the day after pay day (wouldn't want my pay to end up bouncing around in cyber space), and the lady told me that I will have my new bank cards, etc. in three days! I then contacted my French bank and she told me to email her a copy of my new passport and she would take over from there - just like that - I didn't even have to go in! I don't know what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting anything quite so efficient. I am actually pretty organized and have been making lists of everything I need to change and the appropriate phone numbers. I'm sure I will forget a few things, but at least now the the ball is rolling. Trouble is, my married name was so much easier for the French-speakers to pronounce than my maiden name - ah well!!!!After that, once all is in order, I will give more thought to applying for French citizenship. That alone could take about two years by all accounts but I reckon I would still have time to \"outrun Brexit\"!"},
{"title": "It's been a while", "date": "Tuesday 15 November 2016", "text": "As I mentioned in a previous post, I have been frantically busy these last few weeks preparing for a big meeting in mid-December. While I'm still busy at least I got my last big report (250 pages) off to the Translation Department (they must be thrilled) so I am finally able to catch my breath, a little. All that to say that not much has been going on in my life lately (although WHOOOOAAAAA to what's been going on in the rest of the world)! Crikey - Trump! Who would have thought it. I have no great affinity for Hilary either but the thought of the US having Trump represent them on the world stage just makes my mind boggle! Still, it is what it is, as they say, and like it or hate it we now have to deal with it.My boss was telling me that they were watching the news on the day the results came in and his five-year-old looked at Trump on the TV and said (in Spanish) \"is it Darth Vader papa?\" Dad just cracked up (and no, they're not Mexican). In fact, my lovely Mexican colleague has just been shaking his head in disbelief, while sending round some rather funny pictures. There was a great one about a new sport in Mexico that shows a bunch of athletes running up to a wall and scaling it with ladders, but I couldn't figure out how to load it.  Then there were these:The \"Mexican\" Trojan  Horse!Trump, Mexico salutes you!Talking of kids, the weather has been beautiful here in Geneva and when I can I hop off the bus on the Mont Blanc bridge and walk the 30 minutes to work through the park. When my oldest started his first year in the international school, we had him riding the school bus to school from the stop outside my work. He was only five but since I could stand with him at the bus stop and it was the last stop before arriving at school we knew he would be OK. So on the first evening I asked him how he had enjoyed his bus ride. He said it was fine and \"I got to see the man's willy\"! I nearly fell over and asked him to say that again so he did - \"I got to see the man's willy\"! I didn't really know what to think but Mother Hen here was already mentally drafting an email to the school about the pervert driving the school bus. Anyway, the next day as I was driving to the bus stop my son shouted out \"look mommy, there's the man's willy\"! Talk about relief - I guess the moral of that story is take a deep breath before you fire off an incendiary email!Anyway, our drive in to Geneva was hell (still is) because of the sheer volume of traffic on the bridge. Problem was if you missed the school bus you had to drive all the way out the other side of Geneva to school, thereby making you at least 40 minutes late for work so, as you can imagine it was pretty stressful. One time, however, my ex made it to the bus stop in really good time so he parked the car and was standing waiting for the bus with my son when said son asked if daddy thought he (the five-year-old) was strong enough to push the car. Dad said why not let's give it a try, so making sure the handbrake was on, dad and son went to the back of the car and started \"pushing\" to see if the car would move forward. After a couple of minutes of pushing, little 'un looked up and said \"oh daddy, there goes my bus\"! Way to go dad, get there 20 minutes early and still end up chasing the bus all the way to school!Which reminds me of my lovely friend Joyce telling me the story of how many years ago two of her three young children also caught the school bus and between her and her husband they had to juggle picking the kids up at varying bus stops depending on ..... So one time her husband said to her son Kevin to get off the bus at the Pickwick. Well her husband was waiting at the bus stop and when Kevin got off dad asked where Steven was (the youngest), so Kevin said \"well you didn't mention anything about Steven\" - so yet another dad had to chase a school bus - this time to recuperate their youngest who had been left on the bus by his older brother! Talking of school days, I remember when my oldest (still five years of age) was in the school Christmas play and, still being on maternity leave with my youngest, I was able to go watch. Frankly he was crap. I mean, some kids are gifted actors right from the get-go, and then you get the kids like my son who should just move the scenery around, to be honest. He ended up being a \"shepherd\", muttered his lines with his thumb in his mouth and that was it - until he spotted me at the back of the room and shouted out \"it's OK mommy, we've finished now - can we go to McDonalds?\" and everyone burst out laughing. Happy days eh!"},
{"title": "Ouch!", "date": "Friday 28 October 2016", "text": "It's been a while since my last post, but I have been working late quite a bit and by the time I get home I haven't felt much like blogging, to be honest. More to the point, there hasn't been an awful lot going on besides work either so I guess there was no point posting anyway. I don't mind being busy or working late because I can pretty much judge when those times will be and my employer is very decent about it. Nobody looks at the clock when I arrive (I have a dreadful commute) and I don't look at the clock when I leave so everyone is happy  - swings and roundabouts really.So let's see, what's happened since my last post. André's girlfriend, Lily, is in London for a long weekend at the moment \"wedding dress hunting\". With the pound being through the floor against the Swiss franc and London having so much more choice than Geneva I think she will have a fun time scouting out bridal shops. Of course, they're not just in London, but London is her \"first\" foray into serious wedding dress hunting. She and André are still getting to grips with the horrendous prices being quoted for their \"ideal wedding\", and I think, from the little my son has said so far, they may be coming round to something much simpler and I would think - to be honest - a nicer wedding than a big formal do.Well on to the \"ouch\" in the subject line. Under the terms of my mortgage, the only time I can make an extra payment on my loan is if I pay a minimum of 10% of the total original loan amount, so you can imagine that takes quite some saving up. I made the first such payment a year ago and have just made my second additional payment this week, so \"ouch\" is pretty appropriate when I look at my savings account now, but that is balanced by the warm glow I get when I look at the amount of my outstanding mortgage! By my calculations, I am right on track to pay off my mortgage in just under four years, as opposed to another nine years, as originally planned! Happy days. With that paid off it will mean I can retire, as while I have a decent pension it wouldn't be enough to retire and continue to pay a mortgage.To be honest, I am happy to work as I enjoy the contact and the work is fine, but I am truly tired of the minimum three-hour commute each day, so will be looking forward to quitting and moving on to other things. My house is actually too big for me I suppose so I could look at down-sizing. I imagine it makes sense to do that in the future at some point but for the time being I love where I live, my neighbours are wonderful (all 20 of them) and being on my own that is so important, plus I know pretty much everyone in the village, having lived here 27 years. On top of that, to downsize to something smaller would mean moving in to the local town - which is fine - but the prices there are so much higher than out in my little village that I'm not sure I would actually pay off my mortgage by downsizing. Something to be looked at for the future I guess but certainly not for the time-being.In other matters, Rambler made me laugh with her comment on a recent post where she described cranking her old car up to start it and \"did I remember those funny little indicators that used to shoot out of the side of the car when you were turning?\" (Yes I do - but only vaguely). But her comment got me thinking about when we kids learned to drive. At the time, dad taught us and (very bravely) leap-frogged all the way up the road in the passenger seat with each of us as we crunched gears and stalled while learning (and this in a major city)! God he was brave (or maybe totally nuts) but either way he saved us all a small fortune in driving lessons.Of course, mom and I (me being the \"baby\") used to make an \"outing\" of it every time dad took one of the older kids out for a lesson. I mean, how much worse could it be trying to navigate your way round a large city with your mom and little sister sitting in the back?  Pretty rotten right, but we never thought anything of it. I remember my brother-in-law taking my sister out one time and trying to get her to do a three-point turn in one of the smaller back streets. She executed her three-point turn \"perfectly\" and waited for him to say something. So he said \"shall we just try that again\" and off she went, forward, back and forward again, and pulled up level with the curb. On her third attempt he very gently said \"well that was very good, but aren't we supposed to be facing in the other direction\"!! (Smart arse)!Another time, my older brother was out with my dad. Now R was the nervous one in the family and could not get the hang of this driving malarky. As usual mom and I were sitting in the back (I'm surprised we didn't take a picnic actually) and R was messing up terribly. Eventually dad lost his temper and told him to switch seats with him and he would show him what he wanted. It was absolutely pissing down with rain as my dad jumped into the driving seat and wound down the window to look in the rear view mirror before pulling out. Right at that moment a truck went past through a huuuuuuge puddle and chucked a bucketful of water straight through the window and into my dad's face. To say mom and I had to stifle our giggles would be an understatement!But back to Rambler's comments about the little plastic indicators/turn signals. When my brother R was taking his driving test for the first time, the examiner said for him to imagine his indicators weren't working and what should be the hand signal given if he wanted to turn right (bearing in mind that we drive on the left in the UK). So R put his right arm out the window to indicate that (a) his signals weren't working, and (b) he intended to turn right. So then the examiner asked him what hand signal he should make if he wanted to turn left. The correct answer, of course, was to again put his right arm out the window but to make circling motions with his arm to indicate that he was turning left. R must have been pretty \"hot and bothered\" though because he flung his left arm out - and smacked the examiner straight across the face! Needless to say, he didn't pass. In fact, both my brothers took several attempts to pass whereas all the girls passed the first time (and my sister did it in Denmark on the \"wrong\" side of the road to boot) - yay for the ladies!And finally my brother-in-law's mom used to tell the story of a friend of hers who was taking her driving test many, many years ago in her own car. As she came up to some traffic lights the car in front went through on orange, so she followed on behind him. The examiner made her pull up at the nearest bus stop and asked her why she had \"gone through a red light\", to which she replied that she had simply followed the car in front. So he turned to her and said \"well I'll tell you right now that you have failed your test, so this exam is over\". To which this lady turned round to the examiner and said \"well, I'll tell you right now that if that's the case I'm not taking you back\" - and they both had to get out and catch the bus back to the driving centre! You've gotta love an old lady like that!"},
{"title": "The engagement lunch!", "date": "Tuesday 18 October 2016", "text": "This weekend was the engagement lunch for my oldest son and his girlfriend at their place. It was also the first time for me to meet Lily's family and I have to say what a lovely family they are. I had no idea what to expect, of course. My own family are very close and down-to-earth and we laugh a lot. Turns out Lily's family are just the same - except they speak French! Well actually her mom also speaks English as she was raised speaking it so another plus.It was a very relaxed affair where I also got to see another side of both my sons - very confident and sociable. In fact it was nice to hear from other people what nice lads they are. I knew that of course but it's nice to have it confirmed!Jen, Jordan, André and LilyLily's family are Swiss and after some debate on the US presidential candidates the subject changed to \"the Swiss\"! I have to say they took some good-natured ribbing very well. André repeated what I think was a  Robin Williams sketch about \"the Swiss\". Apparently the Swiss army is the only army in the world where the soldiers have a bottle opener as part of their knives. So André does this impression of a Swiss Lieutenant strutting his stuff along the lines of enlisted men saying \"now men, I'm going to show you how to open a bottle of Chardonnay properly!\" Like I say, they took it very well. Certainly my family don't mind having the p.... taken out of them so it was nice to see Lily's family reacting the same way (in fact, I thought dad might bust a gut he was laughing so much)!  (A propos of nothing, I have carried a Swiss army knife in my bag for over 30 years and they are wonderful!)A bit later the boys got to talking about a recent \"gig\" they had done. They are in a band and while I think they are good musicians I really can't stand the heavy metal music - but them I'm an old fogey of course!  They played two nights in Germany, one in Belgium and one in the Czech Republic. Jordan was explaining that after their gig in the Czech Republic they decided they wanted to go out clubbing and found a night club down a little back street - big metal door with a spy hole in it - think \"speakeasy\"! Anyway, they were let in and went to the bar to get a drink. Max is actually Jordan's boss but is the bass guitarist in the band too. He is not particularly tall but being a plumber by trade and in the process of renovating his own house he is built like a tank - with the muscular, tattooed arms to go with it. Anyway, Max was out on the dance floor strutting his stuff when it finally sunk in to the others that there were no women there. Max, of course, became the centre of quite a bit of interest until it finally dawned on him that things \"weren't right\". Jordan then did a perfect imitation of Max scuttling back to his seat while they all sat there demurely sipping their drinks before doing a runner.Oh, and my graffiti cake didn't turn out too bad. I didn't quite get the spun sugar right but the taste was pretty good - you just had to be careful not to break your teeth on the toffee topping!And finally, I have a lovely Mexican colleague who sometimes forwards me funny stuff like the one below. I think I will sign OH up for \"Guiding Hands\" so that he can still see the cricket results on his phone while pretending to listen to me!"},
{"title": "Peter Kay - The Last Parkinson", "date": "Friday 14 October 2016", "text": "My TV went on theblink the other week - for about four days I couldn't get it to work. Nowsometimes it plays up if we have storms in the mountains but this time Icouldn't seem to \"wait it out\". I did all the usual girlie things -you know, unplug it, thump it, turn the electricity off etc. I even got theinstruction manual out, took a photo of how the wires at the back were hookedup to the Freesat box etc. but still nothing worked. So I gave up. Usually Iread a lot anyway and just have the TV on as background noise, but I must admitit felt a bit weird sitting there in complete silence. So I got on to youtubeand initially started off playing clips of the wonderful Robin Williams! He wassuch a motor-mouth and so funny (God rest his soul).Eventually I ended up with a clip of Robin Williams on the Michael Parkinson(talk) show and he was hilarious. In fact, over the years Parkie had somewonderful guests on - what a fabulous job to have eh! Anyway, I eventually gotto the final Parkie episode before he called it quits. He had some of hisfavourite acts back on (always Billy Connelly of course), Michael Caine, DavidBeckham (who is an amazingly good sport - get the pun!!!), David Attenboroughand Peter Kay. For me, Peter Kay is a relative newcomer - I say newcomer inthat I have only known about him in say the last five years and I just lovehim. No swearing, very drôle, with just a very sharp narrative on everydaylife (particularly in the north of England). I wanted to share one of his jokeswhich just tickled me. It would be interesting to see if others find it funnybecause humour is very personal and specific but this one just tickled me.PK  \"Me and my nan are reallyclose.

{"title": "Blissful poverty!", "date": "Thursday 13 October 2016", "text": "As I mentioned in my last post, we had a celebration lunch for my youngest son and his girlfriend on Saturday and this Sunday we have the \"getting-to-know-the-future-in-laws\" lunch for my oldest's engagement. I'm looking forward to it (Lily was telling me how excited her mom is that her only child is finally getting married - they've been together nine years). They are aiming to get married next July but the younger two will be getting married \"when they can afford it\". It speaks volumes of course - weren't we all broke when we got married? But not necessarily unhappy because of it!That got me to thinking about my sister and her husband. They had been married a few years when their first daughter came along. Then of course the whole \"buy a house\", \"need a car\", \"down to one salary\" business happened. Things became tight. My sister quit work when she had her daughter so they were indeed down to one salary and money was not exactly growing on trees. But, having a baby, she also needed a car to get around, so having a fair-sized mortgage and next to no money they ended up buy her an old Daf! What a clunker! More like a sardine tin on four wheels powered by a large elastic band!This isn't her car - but you get the picture!Anyway, she came over to mom and dad's one night in her \"new\" car and offered to take me out for a spin in the old bone-cruncher. I was a teenager and had just gotten out of the shower but she said \"no need to get dressed, just put a towel on and your dressing gown\". So I did! How bloody mad can you be. Here's us tootling round our housing estate in her old clunker with me just dressed in a towel! The very next time she came over in that car with her baby the bloody thing broke down. I know it might be selfish but I'm so glad she broke down with the baby in the car rather than me in the \"altogether\"! That would have been a fun walk home!When I was talking to her recently about their exploits with old clunkers she told me about the time they had bought a \"switchback\" (don't ask, I have no idea except to say it was a crappy old car), and that when they opened the hood to look at the engine there was a vibrator strapped to the battery with sellotape and busy charging! Yes one of those kinds of vibrators!!  What the hell - I guess someone didn't want to get caught short!But the best one was when they bought an old clunker that ran on cooking oil! I would never have believed it but it did in fact run on cooking oil! So what did they do - they went up the local chippie and bought his used oil for a lower price! Every time she drove off in that thing the whole blood road smelled of fish and chips!  They didn't keep it for long and have since moved slightly more \"upmarket\" - but happy days eh!"},
{"title": "It's all go!", "date": "Monday 10 October 2016", "text": "I mentioned in a previous post that when I was sitting at Geneva airport waiting for my flight to Greece recently my oldest phoned me to say that he and Lily had gotten engaged! The youngest was already in the process of getting \"paxed\" so pretty much all I could say was \"crikey\"! (PACS is a civil partnership in France, but they intend to get married also so both are effectively \"engaged\").So this weekend Jordan and Jen invited a small group to lunch at her mom's place. Jen and her lovely girlfriend did all the work but her mom surprised them with the blue and white balloons - I thought it was lovely gesture. It was the first time I had seen either couple since they got \"engaged\" so I got to admire the rings too!It was a lovely day and at one point I found myself standing outside with both couples so took advantage to shoot a short video of them all singing \"happy birthday\" to Ammy (grandma in the States - it's her birthday this week), and then I took a photo of the two happy couples!Jordan, Jen, Lily and AndréNext Saturday we have lunch with Lily's parents. I am going to try to make Lorraine Pascale's \"grafitti cake\". My sister already made it and said it was pretty easy, and I suppose if I drop it nobody will be any the wiser - but wish me luck anyway!This will be the first time I have met Lily's parents too so it's all go here. Both the girls are only children so the biggest contingent for the weddings will be made up of mine and my ex' family. I was talking to my oldest about their wedding plans (they are aiming for July 2017) and they said they almost fainted when the wedding planner gave them an initial figure. My feeling is you start with that and work your way down, but I did stress that they shouldn't worry at all about not inviting people from my side as everyone will understand and it is their day after all! They can always celebrate with my family when they go over to the UK next. The other thing I pointed out was that in my opinion they don't need to pay a fortune for a beautiful \"special\" venue (demeure in French) because God had already seen to it for the special venue by giving us a view of the Mont Blanc from my back garden with Lake Geneva as a backdrop!I think Lily was a bit relieved when I told them that the wedding was not about the amount spent but about the people you spend your day with. André is coming over one night this week so we can have a look at the list but I really will encourage them to whittle it down. Gone are the days when the girl's parents pay for the wedding (at least over here) and I personally think spending thousands of pounds/francs on a large wedding that neither of them want is madness. My ex and I paid for our own wedding (although both sets of parents were also generous) and I figure if you want a HUUUUUGE wedding you can go ahead and pay for it yourself - otherwise, be reasonable. It is so much better to put that money into their future - and thankfully they seem to agree with me.I have to say it's pretty exciting though ......"},
{"title": "Just like that!", "date": "Friday 7 October 2016", "text": "My work has very defined cycles. Our unit is responsible for two meetings a year - one in July and the other in December - for which we prepare two very large reports each. Preparation for the December meeting has already started and workload begins to build-up from September onwards. This week has been pretty hectic already but I have to admit I now realize that I really do enjoy the build-up. Assuming all goes to plan (!) I get quite a buzz out of putting it all together in time for the meeting, and that in turn, strangely, gives me more energy at home to get things done. I suppose it really boils down to \"if you've got nothing to do, you usually can't be arsed to do it!\"On a slightly different note, ever since my divorce I have been wanting to revert to my maiden name, but was just so put off by the sheer volume of paperwork that that will entail. In the UK you can actually change your name easily by Deed Poll, but of course once that is done everything else has to follow on - new passport, new bank account names, new driving licence etc. It's all the rest that was making me drag my feet to be honest.Anyway, back to the original subject. I work very closely in the build-up to our meetings with C, and to be honest, we couldn't do it without him. For as messy as his office is, he must have a brain like a computer because somehow or other he just pulls it all together. On Wednesday he and I worked on over 300 excel files in order to have them ready to be sent out for verification. As you can imagine, it was a helluva job, if only because of the wear and tear on our eyes.Around 19h I said \"look I've got to give my eyes a rest - how about we take a 10 minute break\". He said \"fine, I'll just go off to the loo and see you in 10\". So while he was gone I again clicked on the Deed Poll site. It just seemed so easy to go ahead and change my name so I thought \"sod it, let's just do it\". Within less than five minutes I had filled in the necessary information, put in my credit card number and ordered five original certificates of my changed name. These should arrive within two weeks. It is perfectly legal and as of now my name has legally changed - I just have to do the follow-up!When C came back after 10 minutes he asked what I had been looking at and I told him that in the time it had taken for him to go the loo I had legally changed my name. He couldn't believe it so I showed him. I told him he'd better not go to the loo again or I might decide to get married!!It is actually quite scary I suppose because I had every right to change my name to anything I wanted and of course, as I said to my friend, I could have put her name and date of birth in and I would effectively have become her!! I did put under \"comments\" that I was simply reverting to my maiden name, but in any case the Deed Poll office doesn't question it, as long as the new name is not considered to be outrageously ridiculous!So in the words of the great Tommy Cooper, I have now changed my nameJUST LIKE THAT!"},
{"title": "The pros of getting older!", "date": "Wednesday 5 October 2016", "text": "This morning as I was on the bus to work, two \"swarthy\" looking men were already sprawled across the back seat and speaking (shouting?) to each other really loudly in what I took to be an Eastern European language. The one in particular was totally scuzzy looking and seemed to be getting really angry with the other one. They made no attempt to move over and let other people sit down and they really gave me the creeps. I always wedge my handbag between me and the wall in any case, but today I made sure that I had it looped round my arm while I was reading too - you get the idea. Thankfully they got off pretty quickly and you could hear people breathing a sigh of relief.It is quite strange really to see cultural differences because in Switzerland people tend to be polite and quietly spoken in order not to bother others. That's not always the case of course but this kind of loud, intimidating behaviour is not the norm. Of course the two men (who I took to be Roms) probably couldn't have given a you-know-what anyway, but you could see that no-one wanted to get anywhere near them.  Unfortunately, a couple of stops along another big guy got on with his breakfast. I have seem him before and he inevitably has an egg and tuna sandwich (lovely smell at 7.30 a.m.) but this morning he also had what looked like a slice of pizza and a large orange juice. I suppose he bothers me because of the stink. If remember correctly, you are not (or at least were not) allowed to eat on a bus in the UK in any case, but I suppose that could have changed.Then there was a rather lovely young woman who, in the 30 minutes it took her to get to her stop, applied her full make-up and styled her hair. I was fascinated actually because she did a really expert job and transformed herself but I did wonder where my eye-liner would end up if I tried to put it on on the bus.I suppose what I am really on about is what people find acceptable or otherwise to do in public. I mean, if I felt my toenails needed clipping on the bus is that ok? For me, that sandwich was just too smelly to inflict on people sitting right next to you, and I, personally, wouldn't dream of putting my make-up on on the bus either but that's a matter of personal choice/convenience right? In fact, our previous, horrendous HR director (she of the white porsche, power suit, high heels, and attaché case but dreadful personal hygiene) used to apply her full war paint when she was on the train and somehow I didn't think it was appropriate! As I say, I suppose it's just a question of personal choice in the end.Anyway, yesterday's bus ride in was entirely different and, for the most part, much more fun. When I say \"for the most part\", I mean that the traffic was bloody awful (took me two hours to get to work) but otherwise it was quite a laugh. You see, one of my colleagues happened to hop on the same bus and, like me, can talk the hind leg off a donkey! I don't know how we got round to it (do you ever?) but we ended up talking about how each generation has a different attitude to technology. Her parents are coming over from the UK and I think her mom was having trouble with her ipad. So K said \"don't worry, while you're here you can use mine\". To which her mom replied that while she liked K's friends she wanted to be able to stay in touch with her own friends!I suppose that equates to my mom - when my sister was leaving to start a new life in Denmark - telling her to buy a TV while she was still in England \"cos that way you can get English television\"! My kids roll their eyes at me too of course, because they were born into the internet and ipads era weren't they? Anyhow, somehow I got around to telling K that there were some good programmes on TV but sometimes on too late for me and that I had never figured out how to record them!!! I know, I know but I just didn't get it! The only thing my bloody ex left me with when he left was a bunch of instruction manuals and you know how if you're not that interested you just don't get it! - hey that was his job - he didn't have many!But I digress. Since K had the same system as me she started explaining to me how to do it. I recognized the man sitting next to her as someone from work although I didn't know him personally but I could see him trying to stifle a giggle as we were going through it! The conversation went a bit like this, only on a bus instead of a horse.But you know what, I didn't care how stupid I sounded because you are entitled to that with the passing of the years aren't you!I think I mentioned previously how much I enjoy the company of older people. Well many years ago - I was just a teenager working my Saturday job in town - as we left work it started to rain. While I was standing at the bus stop waiting to go home, a \"really old lady\" (i.e. probably my age now) walked up to the bus stop with a large paper bag on her head! She had just been to the hairdresser's apparently and since she didn't have an umbrella she took the next best option!  I thought it was great, she obviously couldn't give a you-know-what - but I think if it had been me I might have cut some eye-holes in it!Another time, again at the same job, another \"really old lady\" came in to work and was complaining that she thought she had a hole in her boots because her feet were wet and cold. So one of her friends said \"well if you just have to run out at lunch-time why don't you put a plastic bag on each foot - at least it'll keep you dry for a bit\"!When this lady came back from lunch she had two plastic bags on the outside of her boots! I swear she skated in like Torvill and Dean on their way to Olympic gold!Happy days!"},

{"title": "Ha, how about that!", "date": "Thursday 22 September 2016", "text": "Hey after her comment on my blog I just clicked on Wendy's profile to hop over to her blog. Now usually it pops up as \"user profile\" or \"blogger profile\", but since I am at work (in Switzerland) all this stuff comes out in German, so Wendy you are coming out as \"nutzerprofil\". So hi from one nutzer to another!I wanted to write a bit more about my trip to Greece when I got time as it was such a lovely trip and I think, out of all the \"solos\" trips I have done so far, possibly the nicest group. I would say the youngest was about 45 and the oldest was 85 (and he was an absolute blast). Charles, the 85-year-old, was totally with it and very drôle. He had a gammy left leg that used to seize up on him occasionally and he would wander off in an anti-clockwise circle in order to try to free his leg up. Seriously, he would just say \"don't mind me, I'll catch up with you all in a minute\" and then do his little circular dance until he got his left leg coordinated with his right leg again. That being said, he was still able to walk and more than kept up with everyone else. One day he actually climbed up to the top of a volcano (I didn't!) but on the way down he slipped and fell, hurting his ankle. That is no reflection on his age, by the way, he just slipped on loose shingle. So our guide shot off back to the boat and took all the ice to put on Charles' ankle. When someone on the boat asked for a gin tonic with ice the guide explained why they had no ice, so Charles took his sock off, filled it with ice and said \"dip that in your drink\"!Another chap, a widower of around my age, was on his first \"solos\" trip and seemed a little quiet to begin with, but by the end of the trip he had really come out of his shell. One night we started talking about the stupid stuff that had happened in our lives and he was telling us about the time when as a young man he had just passed his driving test and his dad lent him his car. He felt like \"Jack the Lad\" driving round in his dad's car trying to look cool. One night he was pulled over by the police for a routine road check and they asked him to open the boot. Well John's dad was a greengrocer and when he opened the boot there were about 50 cabbages in the back! The cops, doubtless thinking there was something hidden underneath, proceeded to take out all the cabbages one-by-one and put them on the side of the road. Of course there was nothing for them to find so they jumped in their patrol car and drove off - leaving John to put all the cabbages back into the car and looking decidedly uncool!Another, older John - Geordie John - commented one night that while Greek food was lovely you couldn't beat blackberry and apple pie with custard. So John No. 1 said - \"oh you mean toenail pie\"! We all cracked up laughing at that but seemingly his mother referred to it as toenail pie in reference to the bits of apple core that sometimes got left in the pie and \"tasted like toenails\" - now how would she know? Of course it could have been that John's mom had really dodgy hygiene standards but I prefer not to go there .....I also hit it off with a 74-year-old lady called Cath and have given her my email address. I hope we get to keep in touch as she was such fun and it is nice to stay in touch even if infrequently. When I got home I spoke to my brother (who had originally been planning to come with me) and told him all about it. While I understand why he backed out of this trip I'm hoping that my latest experience will give him the courage to go out and do the same - somehow I think it will.And a few photos:My hotel in MykonosAnd finally, talking of my oldest son's engagement, he told me that he had asked his younger brother to be his best man. J's reaction was \"oh shit\"! Nuff said I think!"},
{"title": "Exciting stuff!", "date": "Tuesday 20 September 2016", "text": "It was very difficult for me to post from Greece on my ipad so I had to wait till I got back home (and back to work - berkkkkkkk). I shouldn't bitch I suppose because work is what pays for everything, but it's tough going from lazing on a beautiful beach in Greece to getting up while it's still dark, and it's cold and raining!!!! To be honest though, the rain was only on the weekend and it is actually lovely again now. Anyway, here I am back at work, slogging away over a hot computer and excel tables of HS tariff codes!It was my son's 29th birthday on 30th August and though I wasn't able to see him on his birthday I met up with him later at \"band practice\" near my home to give him his birthday present. He told me that he and his girlfriend had spent the night in a château near here to celebrate so he was a bit \"fragile\"!  So, I gave him his present and said I would see him when I got back.On Monday I left my car at work and caught the bus to Geneva airport for my flight to London. Once I had gotten through security I had a couple of hours to wait so thought I would treat myself at their snazzy \"smoked salmon-ish\" kinda place. You know the place where the food tastes really, really good but then you have to sell a kidney to pay for it - but I digress! While I was sitting there I looked at my phone and saw that I had missed two calls from my ex in the US and two from my son. I thought \"oh my God what has happened\" so called my son back immediately (never bothered calling the ex back - tee, hee)! It turns out that André and Lily had actually gotten engaged over the weekend and the little shit hadn't told me when I gave him his present (hence the night in the château)! I'm embarrassed to say this but I actually shed a tear. \"Embarrassed\" because I'm not usually sentimental but this just felt so good. Lily is Swiss and they met at college and have been together nine years I think. More to the point she is lovely so I guess I can be excused a little soppyness.André and Lily in Iceland ﻿I have never actually met Lily's family (she is an only child) so we are having a get-together brunch on October 16th (what do you think are my chances of losing 4 kg by then? Shave my legs - oh right!). Actually, her maternal grandmother is from Guyana (granddad was Austrian but died a few years ago) so that set of grandparents only ever spoke English to each other. Not that it is a problem as I speak French anyway, but I am looking forward to getting to know them.  They are planning to get married next September/October time so that gives them a year to sort out what kind of wedding they want. As sod's law would have it, my other son and his girlfriend are getting PACSed this month (civil partnership) and then will be getting married when they can afford it - just hope it's not next September/October time!!! I have already put in an order for three grandchildren each (and am definitely looking forward to that prospect), but I may be jumping the gun a bit I suppose.I have mentioned before that I go to a patchwork club on a Monday night. I am very much a beginner but I reckon if I start now I might have a baby quilt ready in due course - or am I getting ahead of myself?Anyway, while I was sitting at the restaurant in the airport I saw another English woman sitting opposite me. She started talking to a man eating his lunch next to her and it turned out he was Iraki. She then proceeded to very rudely berate him for \"all that is wrong with the way women are treated in Irak, and she should know because she works for a charity that saves parakeets\"!!!!  WTF!!! She went on and on in a very loud, posh English voice and the poor bugger kept trying to eat his lunch in peace. I think if it would have been me I would have politely told her to piss off. Who the hell did she think she was. Of course there are problems in Irak but talking to this poor guy trying to mind his own business like he was Satan's spawn was appalling! It turns out in the end she wasn't English (thank God) but Danish (her English was that good), so Denmark you get the kudos for that bore unfortunately but at least the parakeets are safe!The flight to London only takes about 90 minutes and I was booked in to spend the night at an airport hotel in order to get a very early flight the next morning to Greece. On the way out the terminal I thought I should just get a bit of money from the ATM. I punched in my code but after a few minutes of gurgling by the machine no money came out. There was a chap standing next to me and he said that he could witness for me that the machine had malfunctioned so I went straight to the desk and explained that while my account had been debited 200 pounds no money had come out. The girl there really wasn't that interested (very poor customer service attitude) so I asked her for a form to fill out to document what had happened. And yes she did have such a form so why the hell didn't she volunteer it I wonder. When I got to my hotel I immediately sent an email to their customer service saying what had happened but couldn't do anything more about it as my UK bank details were all at home. It makes me wonder though what would have happened if that was the only money I had access to. I would have been totally screwed.So this morning I called my bank and got the never-ending \"for deposits, press 1, for internet banking, press 2, para espanol, marque el no. 3\". Those things drive me MAAAADDD but it seems you never get through to an actual person any more do you! Eventually I did get through to India (I suppose) and to be fair a very helpful lady went through all the details with me and said that they would sort it out and re-credit my account. When I hung up, my colleague burst out laughing saying that while I would probably get my 200 pounds back, that call alone would probably cost me 300!! Yeah, thanks for that!Anyway, I spent the night at the Premier Inn at Heathrow's Terminal 5 and I have to say I am very impressed with their efficiency. The rooms are basic but spotlessly clean, the restaurant has good food and the staff hustle (again 50/50 Brits and Eastern Europeans - Brexit be damned)! I had to get up at the crack of dawn to get my flight the next day and while I was waiting for the \"Hoppa\" bus back to the airport I got talking to the desk clerk. He told me that he was (also) Iraki and had got out of Irak 10 years ago and managed to come to the UK. He was incredibly polite and helpful so I didn't bore him with how it was all his fault the way women were treated in Irak. Yet again I think that while the problem of immigration is indeed very real, the gutter press making out all immigrants to be sponging scroungers does nobody any favours at all!"},

{"title": "Well it is France!", "date": "Saturday 3 September 2016", "text": "I had an appointment with my bank in town this morning at 9.30 a.m. to set up an extra mortgage payment. In order to be able to make an additional payment I have to pay a minimum of at least 10% of the initial amount of the mortgage, so you can see that that is not something that happens every month. I am pretty much on track to do that once a year though now in a bid to get my mortgage paid off early (and hence be able to retire) but as you can imagine there will be a gaping hole in my savings account once that goes through. I also intend to revert to my maiden name when I come back off holiday so I had a few questions for her about that too. I have been divorced almost five years and put off changing my name back because I didn't have the energy frankly. It is a lot of work - the passport and bank accounts being the easy bit - the hard work is all the rest of the paperwork. So I wanted to be sure that while I was getting everything sorted, the bank wouldn't \"bounce\" my electricity debits, for instance, if the name on the electric bill no longer matched the name on the bank account for a brief period. It only took about 30 minutes to set that up so afterwards I had time to head off to the local tip with my grass cuttings and back towards home where I played the lottery for next Friday's euromillions. I play every week - not much - just for the fun of it. When they put the price up about 18 months ago I thought no way am I going to increase the amount of money I give them to play \"my\" numbers, so I just dropped the numbers down to end up paying less. It doesn't matter to me as I am not superstitious about numbers and I'll be damned if I am going to give them more money. Still, playing a few euros is a nice little way to daydream. It's actually quite fun thinking about what I would do \"if\" I won, and to be honest, while everyone talks about what they would do if they won the big one, how great would it be to say win 20,000 euros - wouldn't that put a big smile on your face? Or even 1,000? You know what I mean, anything would be lovely.After that I headed back home. I didn't go to the market or supermarket obviously since I am leaving on vacation on Monday, so having nothing better to do I stopped in at Stan's for a coffee. There were about eight people there discussing local events and putting the world to rights. Stan's son - the professional rugby player - had apparently played a blinding match last night down in Montpellier so he was dissecting the match with one man. A couple of others were discussing the \"stupid way they have gone about closing the bridge\" - the one-and-only-bridge across the river into town. I mentioned previously that it will be closed for at least a year and it is already a nightmare with buses, trucks, cars etc. having to go miles out of their way (down the \"forestry road\" no less - you can imagine how wide that is), just to get back into town. I sat next to Philippe - a friend who has retired but still does a few small construction/DIY jobs on the side. He is going to come and work on my balcony before I get new railings, etc. put up. And then finally there was the old \"pepe\" talking about how to improve your soil for your veggie patch. He was deep in conversation with our postman and while it was only 10.30 a.m. they were both having white wine! I guess the postman getting up really early this might have been his lunch break, but they had two glasses each while I was sitting there - and at about 11 a.m. the postman drove off to finish his route! Vive la France, as they say!"},

In fact, by doing that I got to see my mom for the last time just a few weeks before she died so it was a definite plus, but otherwise it is quite a pain to have to fly west to the UK before flying east to my next destination, but hey, first world problems right?This time I fly with a group (none of whom know each other BTW) from London to Mykonos, spend four nights on Mykonos and then over to Santorini for five nights. Then back to London, another night in a hotel in London (we get back too late to guarantee a connecting flight to Geneva) and back to Geneva the following day. I am really looking forward to it. I went to Crete many, many years ago and it was beautiful but I haven't been back to Greece since and I just know I will love it - the scenery, the food, the weather (although the weather is great here too). What's not to like?I finally got round to going to the hairdresser on Tuesday. I haven't been in over a year as I have just been hacking bits off it myself when it got on my nerves. It tends to have a slight wave so (I delude myself) you really can't see what an amateur job I have been doing. It's hard to cut the back of course but then I really don't care what impression I make on people when I'm leaving anyway (that's also a good enough excuse to only polish the front of your shoes too)! But still, I have to say a professional cut is nice for a change. Just wish I had a bit of a tan but since I don't tolerate the sun I suppose that's not going to happen and I can't seem to get the hang of spray on stuff - it always looks a bit streaky and who in the world's palms of their hands are streaky anyway?I'm not worried about \"bikini waxes\" and all that stuff 'cos I just don't go in for that. Yuck. I'm lucky that I'm not hairy anyway so just a disposable razor and I'm hot to trot. It's weird though, but since I have become, ahhm, of a certain age, I get just one bloody whisker on my chin occasionally. Just one! I mean who does that? So it is hardly a problem preparing for a holiday in that sense. When I die and I am in my coffin I must just get one of my boys to promise to get that whisker!  Not much to ask is it?So I have tomorrow to get my work up-to-date, which shouldn't be that difficult, and then two weeks of bliss before the long hard slog up to the dreaded 'C' word!  I imagine internet connection won't be too bad so I will post when I can. If not, \"see you\" when I get back!"},
{"title": "First day at school", "date": "Wednesday 31 August 2016", "text": "My colleague told me last night that he would be late this morning as his little boy was starting his first day at school. I told him to take plenty of pictures so that he can embarrass the hell out of him when he's 21 so he did. Really sweet pictures actually as his little boy was very good (probably because he hasn't yet realized he has to go back again tomorrow, but hey, that's part of tomorrow's fun right?).We actually filmed my oldest son's first day going to the \"big\" school (he was five) and he whinged and cried the whole time, which is actually pretty funny now as he turned 29 yesterday! Ha, I knew it was worth the wait, the little bugger!It did bring to mind an awful example of our dreadful parenting with him many years ago though. I was offered a job back in Switzerland when André was just 22 months old. It was a dreadful wrench for the US grandparents as he was their only grandchild at that point but as we were both unhappy we made the decision to move back to Europe. I came out to Switzerland ahead of my husband and son (they stayed in England with my parents for three weeks) in order for me to find an apartment, buy a car and find a place in a daycare as we knew my husband would have to find a job too. It was a very stressful time for me, trying to work full-time and set up the whole \"family\" side of things too, so-much-so that I actually ended up on beta blockers for a short period of time as my heart was beating 100-to-the-dozen. Still I managed to get it all done and they were able to come out and join me three weeks later.Initially we were advised to put André in the daycare for just a short period of time in order for him to get used to it, more particularly since he didn't speak a word of French. Well, I had no choice so he was more or less thrown in full-time right from the get-go. I felt awful but what could I do?My husband was lucky enough to find a temporary job straight away so early mornings were a rush, to say the least, what with the traffic and rush-hour and getting to daycare and work. One morning my husband was getting André ready and I was dealing with other stuff when André started playing up, he didn't want to go to the crèche, his feet hurt etc. We had just bought him new shoes and were pretty pissed off that he was play-acting right now when we were in a rush to get to work. I remember my husband yelled at him and I could have cried.Anyway, we did make it to the crèche and I explained to the owner that he was having a \"bit of a hissy fit\" and complaining about his new shoes hurting (he hobbled all the way up the path!!!). She said not to worry, that he would get over it but to just get on and leave. So she took him on her lap in order to make a bit of fuss of him and took off his shoes to put his slippers on. When she took off his shoes she found the padding paper in the toes that my husband hadn't thought to take out! Poor kid, it's a wonder he could stand up. I feel bad about it to this day but we laugh about it now of course. I'm sure we've all done dreadful things like that but hey ... we all make mistakes right? Tell me it's not just me!"},
{"title": "Going round in circles", "date": "Friday 26 August 2016", "text": "As I mentioned previously, I drive to the French/Swiss border every morning, park my car and catch a bus across Geneva to work. On a good day this bus ride takes about 45 minutes - on a bad day - oh my God, I hate to even think about how long it can take! The only positive thing about this bus journey is that it is way less stressful than driving, it halved my petrol consumption and obviously makes for less wear-and-tear on the car. Well I guess there is really another positive thing in that as I go terminus-to-terminus I get to read for almost two hours a day - something I love to do anyway!I actually get on the bus at the last-but-one stop where the parking lot is, travel the final stop back to the border and then do the complete journey in the opposite direction, so that I can be sure to get a seat. Well, this morning my friend and I hopped on the bus at the parking lot and right at the back there was a young man sprawled across the floor along the central aisle, fast asleep and reeking of booze. We decided to go further up the front of the bus because at some point other people were going to get on and they would be needing to get past him/step over him. I mentioned him to the driver but he said that he knew perfectly well about the young man as he had been \"driving him around continuously since 5 a.m.\"! He went up to the young man and with great difficulty managed to get him into a seat out of the way and propped him up against a window. In one of his few coherent moments the young man said he was \"heading for Ferney\", whereupon the driver just laughed and said \"you've been going round and round in circles for the last three hours and you're still no closer to getting to Ferney\". I thought the driver was actually pretty good natured about the whole thing because I get that this kind of stuff happens a lot, particularly on the late-night/overnight buses and trains!In fact, my colleague's husband is a bus driver. He prefers to work the night shift and he was saying that the drunks and the druggies are always doing this kind of thing on the late-night buses \"but they never buy a bloody ticket\"! (I thought that comment was great - like that is the problem with these people)! Of course, that doesn't negate the fact that I suppose they could also be a real threat to the drivers but she has never mentioned any incident like that. The biggest problems seem to be the lunatic drivers who pull out in front of a bus giving no thought to just how much damage a bloody great bus could do to them!My colleague did say though that one time her husband had a passed-out druggie on his night bus. When he got to the terminus he picked up the guy's bag of dope and walked over and threw it into a bin, then walked back to the guy, woke him up and told him that he had seen the transport cops waiting at the next stop. The guy shot up, jumped off the bus and ran off like a lunatic - and all without his stash of dope! Cruel? Maybe - but definitely very funny!"},

I have actually written my 100th post (and here's me thinking I would struggle to find things to write about)! I guess I now realize that I write like I speak - think I have nothing to say and then never stop rabbiting! Oh well, here's to the next 100 and even if no-one reads this stuff I am really enjoying writing it!So to end on a funny note, I see that they published the funniest jokes from The Fringe yesterday. All pretty good but I actually really liked this one:\"How come old people are always going on about how there's no place like home? But as soon as you put them in one .....\" Cheers!"},
{"title": "Yuck - there's no getting away from her!", "date": "Thursday 25 August 2016", "text": "After work last night I stopped in to say hi to my mate Stan again and lo and behold my ex's skank ex-girlfriend showed up there again. I know to expect it of course because she lives about 150 metres away from me but I wish someone would just do a \"beam me up Scotty\" on her and have her end up in a magical land, far, far away. As I guess that's not going to happen anytime soon I shall just have to keep on sticking my nose in the air.It did get me to thinking again about a few things though. When my ex first buggered off, after much egging on by my friends I joined an internet dating site. I have written about this before and while I did indeed meet a few nice men on there (just one sicko), it wasn't for me. I mean, I was married 26 years and the internet wasn't even around when I first started dating! But the whole episode did bring to mind another incident while on this site which was an absolute hoot.One night I got a message from a lady called Mary - \"did I want to chat\"? Now she wasn't a \"woman looking for a woman\", she was a \"woman looking for a man\" but explained that she hopped over to the \"other side\" to see what kinds of drivel some of the women were writing in their profiles. I knew exactly what she meant because the men who were \"sensual, romantic, liking long walks on the beach\" etc. were really starting to get on my t*ts. I mean, have you ever met anyone - male or female - who was any or all of those things? I haven't. I had actually put a real tongue-in-cheek profile which was funny, and I'm convinced that is why I did so well on that site - in fact that was what made Mary contact me. Turns out she was Irish and worked close to me so we agreed to go out for a pizza one night and a chinwag. Well what a blast we had! She had been married and when we compared notes on our exes we were doubled up laughing. I have to say that was one of the funniest evenings out I had had in a long time and definitely worth doing. I think she retired back to Ireland not long after that so wherever you are Mary, I hope you are still having a blast!On an only slightly related topic, since I enjoy writing my blog, as you will imagine I also enjoy reading other people's blogs. In fact, when I \"discovered\" blogs I was in little piggy heaven because as someone who loves to read there was a huge great bloggy universe out there just waiting to be read on any topic I could wish for!I like reading cookery blogs, crafty blogs, chit-chat blogs you name it. Recently I came across a fabulous blog that has been going a few years about people who had been cheated on by narcissist/psycho partners and it was/is such a great read. BTW, I don't consider my ex to be in that bracket but I certainly had an ex-boss who was the supreme example of a psychopath so it really is interesting to read about it from that perspective. And while there are many, many sad tales on this blog there is also an awful lot of gallows humour.  I have been reading the whole blog from the beginning and it is taking me ages (I am up to June 2013 at the moment). Well in last night's post the blogger had written an internet dating site profile for her ex-husband. Other people then chimed in with their own versions, sometimes giving the \"what he really means by that\" comments in square brackets.One lady wrote for her ex-husband:\"Age 57, great physique, am told I look 10 years younger, a real stallion!\" (or words to that effect).She then wrote her version of his profile:\"Age 57, looks 67, drives like he's 97 and acts like he's 27. Takes three lots of medication for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and problems with his 'waterworks'.\" I burst out laughing at that one. She had actually found his profile on Ashley Madison while still married to him and published his username on this blog so everyone could hop over and have a laugh. He must have thought his profile was really pulling the women in after that!Another guy had written about how his partner kept losing his job because \"hey, they actually want me to show up occasionally, but it's really your fault when I don't! I mean you are supposed to get me up in time. What do you mean, that's what the alarm clock is for and I'm 28 FFS - can't you see that it's your job to get me up!\" This made me really laugh because my ex always swore blind I turned his alarm off and that I was the reason he either was late to work or didn't show at all!  No shit Sherlock, you're 45 - time to put the big boy's knickers on and get yourself to work. N.B. I eventually stopped even trying to wake him and just let him run his own three-ring circus. It didn't change his behaviour of course but it made it easier for him to blame me, so I guess kudos to me for that!I had intended to go to bed early last night but I got into reading the over 100 comments on that particular post and laughing my head off and only ended up going to bed after midnight. Then of course, I was mentally writing a dating profile for my ex and couldn't stop my mind from whizzing by. Maybe someday I will do it and post it here. Watch this space!"},
{"title": "Who'll blink first?", "date": "Wednesday 17 August 2016", "text": "During the month of August traffic here in Geneva is great. Most people are on holiday, the kids are off school and there's not much going on at work - quiet time. Monday being 15 August it was even quieter since France, as a Catholic country, celebrates Assumption (I think that's how you write it) so it is pretty much a national holiday. All-in-all not a bad time to do the work run. It actually means I get home about 30 minutes earlier too - which can't be bad. So last night I got home around 6.30 pm and decided to pop in to Stan's cafe for a drink. It was hot so I decided to sit inside and chat to Stan as we watched the Olympics.But bloody hell, sitting outside is my ex's tart - the skank that he left me for in 2010! Now she is actually from the village where I live and she and her new boyfriend - you know, the one she cheated on my ex with - rented a place in the village near me. In fact, it is so near me that if you look at the main picture at the top of my blog, across the field at the back of my garden is her rental property backing on to the same field. Maybe I should invite her over for a coffee sometime - or maybe not!Don't get me wrong, I couldn't care less that my ex buggered off with her. Truth be told I should probably thank her (but I wasn't going to tell them that). I had wanted a divorce for many years and he wouldn't agree to it, nor would he agree to move out \"cos it's my house\"! Well, actually it was our house, or more likely my house, because I had put most of the money into it. I knew almost from the beginning that my marriage was a mistake but after getting married we moved to the States, where my first son was born. I knew if it would even be possible to get a divorce that I couldn't support myself and my son on whatever salary I could earn in the States. I also knew that his father would never agree to allow me to take my son back to Switzerland, where I had a job waiting for me and where I could earn enough to look after the both of us. And of course, as far as the US was concerned, my son was/is a U.S. citizen (although he is also British), so basically I was stuck in the States with the ex. I hated that feeling of being trapped!Eventually though, even he hated our life in the States too and when I was offered a job back in Switzerland we moved back. We had another son but actually I would say life got worse not better. You know the score, two kids, two full-time jobs, long commute, etc. and basically just the usual pressurized life. As the pressure grew and grew my husband became more and more aggressive (he was aggressive enough to begin with) and eventually went from just screaming and giving orders all the time to actual physical violence.While I documented everything, to the people who say \"I wudda, cudda, shudda\", I say you weren't living my life, trying to get by on three non-consecutive hours sleep a night so I don't really want to hear about how you would have magically gotten yourself and your kids out of there. I'm not stupid and I'm not weak, but after years and years of violence and lack of sleep I could barely see straight, let alone negotiate my way through a divorce from an unwilling husband!Anyway, all that was to explain why I was not in the slightest bit bothered when the twat ran off with the skank. In fact, I almost had to nail my feet to the floor to stop myself jumping for joy when he finally came home after six weeks absence to solemnly let me know I was going to be receiving divorce papers! Yipee was all I could think!You see, he had started going down to this cruddy bar in town - you know the kind where they all come crashing out through the window at closing time, and where the landlady keeps on serving regardless of how drunk the customers are.Anyway, skank looks like a bad version of Amy, in the Big Bang Theory (although truth be told the actress that plays Amy is, in my opinion, very pretty in real life). (On that note, I must tell you about the time I waltzed in there one time, all dolled up to the nines, to have a look!!!! - skank and twat couldn't get out of there fast enough, but maybe more on that another time.)You may wonder what the skank could possibly see in my scrawny, violent, alcoholic husband but since she earned a pittance working in France and my ex was on a good salary working in Switzerland I think I can see why she found him so amazingly attractive.  Anyway, long story short, they ended up shacking up together at her place, and it only took him six weeks to come home and \"drop the divorce bombshell\" on me (I repeat - yipee)!  What I do resent though is that my ex had the gall to introduce the skank to my kids before he had even told me about her and that I will never forgive him for, even if my kids were older. It was putting them in a dreadful position, but then hey, that's the kind of person he is.Of course about three weeks after the \"bombshell\" he decided that \"he didn't think we should throw away over 20 years of marriage\" (i.e. skank ain't so great and can I come back? - the answer of course was not f*ç*çing likely). And it strikes me that the person who couldn't keep it in his pants was the one throwing away over 20 years of marriage, not me, but I digress! Well we got divorced after I served him with papers. It took about two years and in order to get him to finally sign I ended up taking on all the joint debt and some of his debts, plus buying him out of the home - which he tells people he \"gave\" me - yeah, to the tune of €300,000 worth of debt in my name, ya prat!Immediately after they shacked up together but before the divorce was finalized was the worst period of my life, because although he was gone, he and the skank behaved like the drunken idiots they were and roughly every three weeks they would both throw a hissy fit and he would move back with his suitcases \"cos it's still my house\" - it almost broke me! Eventually the paperwork went through and I changed the locks. It still wasn't over though because he still thought we were \"great friends\" and actually bought a couple of cousins of his who were visiting from the States up to the house in my absence to show them round (eh, actually, it's now my house - seems we have a problem with boundaries here).  Anyway he and the skank were together about three years when guess what, the skank cheated on him with another guy and he was devastated! Makes me laugh now to be honest, this coming from a guy who was in Ghana for work and woke up with a prostitute in his bed but \"don't worry, I was too drunk to do anything\"!!!!! I kid you not. Oh the stories. Maybe one day I will write them all down and while for some it would seem unbelievable, for many more it would just go to show them that they are not alone living in this kind of hell.Anyway, and back to the original narrative, I had met a chap in Stan's a few times and would always say \"bonjour\" and \"au revoir\". Turns out this guy is the skank's new boyfriend!!! He seems pleasant enough, but when I rolled up to Stan's the other night and saw her and the boyfriend sitting outside I didn't know what to do so I just stuck my nose in the air and ignored everyone. This has happened more than once and sometimes acquaintances of mine will be sitting with the skank but what do you do? I have no desire to say anything to that tart. Not easy though. Tellingly though, at one time she told Stan (who subsequently told me) that she \"had to leave my ex or he would have ended up killing her\"! I said to Stan, I really don't give a shit about her or her life, but as far as that goes, I can believe it 100%.I'm not actually sure whether I should be writing some of this stuff down but I have read quite a few blogs written by women who have been cheated on and it is good to know I'm not alone. Actually some of those blogs are incredibly funny and I think therapeutic for others so keep up the good work ladies (although of course men aren't the only ones who cheat). In the end my alcoholic ex was diagnosed as bipolar, which may go some way to explaining some of his behaviour (his spending for example, and the fact that he could go three nights without sleep and hence I shouldn't be allowed to sleep either), but it neither explains nor excuses his violence. Having said that, while it is hell for those that are afflicted by this, I can tell you it is hell for those that have to live with it too!"},
{"title": "Another busy weekend!", "date": "Friday 12 August 2016", "text": "When my little neighbourhood got together (in July?) to do our annual clean up, my neighbour's daughter suggested a small group of us got together for a potluck lunch one last time before one couple, Marc and Valérie, moved out. With just one daughter left at home they now find their house too large for them, so they decided to sell up and look for something smaller. They put the house on the market and it sold really quickly - in fact, I think they move out in September. It will be our loss as they are such a lovely couple, and while they are not moving far it won't be the same somehow. My immediate neighbours very kindly offered to host it and we really lucked out in that after a wet and miserable Friday, that Saturday turned out just scorching.The food was lovely, although of course there was way too much, and the company excellent - just ripe for a bit of silliness I guess (so that would be where I come in of course).  One time when I was England my sister had bought me a game called \"Doughnuts\", which I took round and dared everyone to have a go.Our host, Michel, playing doughnutsWe had a silly half hour, with everyone cheating like mad, but it certainly added up to good fun!MarcThen, just in case we hadn't been silly enough, I got out my ipad and started taking pictures using an app that my niece from Denmark had shown me. Wait for it, it gets better!Me (on one of my better days)Our host, againAnd then there was Dani!And last of all, another version of me!I tell you, if you ever need an ice-breaker, this certainly did it. Of course another really good ice breaker is to take a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey down to the local pub and get your poshest friend to read out a random extract from it (but I guess that will have to wait for another time!) In fact, Michel came round last night and asked me how to download the app and how to use it. Maybe it's just me but I love \"silly\".So after a very long, protracted, but hilarious lunch (about six hours all in all - well it is France), we all said our goodbyes and staggered home bearing enough left-over food to feed an army.Then on Sunday it was the last day of the local Bluegrass Festival. This is an annual six-day event in my small town which features about 30 bands from all over the world, although oddly enough the majority seem to be from Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic and Russia are very well represented). I think the original idea many years ago was that different towns worldwide would host this event but apparently La Roche did it so well that it has hosted it ever since - well certainly for the last 11 years that I can remember. It is a fabulous event featuring extremely talented musicians, with food and drinks stalls, souvenir stalls and everything in between. Again, as another sign of the times, the roads around the event were blocked off with concrete bollards to stop any through traffic, just like in Geneva at the moment, but if that is the price we have to pay for greater security I'm happy to pay it!"},
{"title": "Don't let it rain on my parade!", "date": "Friday 5 August 2016", "text": "As I explained yesterday, both banks of the the lake are pretty difficult to navigate right now due to huge concrete bollards being placed in the middle of the road during the Geneva festivities, so last night, for the first time, I decided to take the ferry-boat over the lake. The journey is only about 10 minutes long and cuts out the centre of town and the bridge and you know what, it was really nice.The ferry-boat pick up stopYou can just see part of the fun-fair set up for the Fêtes de Genève.The Jet d'Eau in the distanceThe crossing was very pleasant and calm, although in the winter it might not be so much fun I guess.But for some strange reason I had the most amazing urge to burst into \"Don't let it rain on my parade\"! Not sure the other passengers would have enjoyed it much though, cos Barbra Streisand I ain't (although I might have her nose).Since the roadblocks will last another week I tried a different approach this morning, getting off my bus at the station and switching to the tram which would take me nearer to work, but not quite all the way there. Touchingly a young man offered me his seat but as I was getting off in a couple of stops I thanked him but refused. Which kinda goes to show that (a) good manners still exist and (b) I probably need to up the night cream if I am starting to look like a little old lady! (To be fair though, if an older person or pregnant woman gets on the bus someone will always offer them a seat, so again that could mean that (a) I am indeed starting to look like an old biddy or (b) I need to do something about my gut)! When I got off I had about a 15 minute walk to work and managed to avoid the rain by nano-seconds. But it did bring home to me how slow I walk, I mean, old ladies with zimmer frames were passing me! I guess I could speed up my walking by taking my hands out of my pockets, but I like to think of it as a sign that I am rather laid-back (unruffled by the world, so to speak) as opposed to overweight and unfit!And talking of alternative means of transport, I was delighted to read in the British news today of a \"UFO\" being \"chased down the road\" by Irish police! Well those were the headlines but I think it was more a case of some kind of art work designed for publicity purposes. Rather nice though eh!My colleague and I were joking that it is really a cunningly-designed \"Trojan Horse\" aimed at baffling the Irish but actually full of Brits trying to slip into Ireland illegally after Brexit (\"have you got enough room in the back there Ethel\")!Today is Friday and the weekend looms bright and sunny. Tomorrow I have to go into town to play our syndicate's lottery. When I worked in my previous post we had an absolute psychopath of a boss (and I mean that in the literal sense of the word). The bitch made everyone's life hell wherever she went (or had been, or indeed eventually ended up after us) and apart from filing an official complaint against her (she eventually \"left\"/\"was pushed\" - whatever you want to call it) a group of us also set up a lottery syndicate. Something like the two-pronged approach in warfare - \"if she doesn't leave we'll just win the lottery and all do a runner\"! Anyway, my colleague collects the money from everyone every five weeks and I play it in France since lottery winnings are taxed in Switzerland (about 35% I think) but not taxed in France. So tomorrow I get to check our winnings (fingers crossed) and play again for the next five weeks. Isn't daydreaming about winning the lottery a nice daydream though! And for me it is just that - a nice daydream. Many years ago though I would have given anything to win just a little something as I was desperate to get out of my dreadful marriage and a lottery win would have given me a wonderful head-start to getting away from him and the violent, debt-ridden life he was inflicting on me. Then I hated going home on a Friday night because I knew what I was in for and I remember one Friday night crying as I was heading home, praying to God to just let me win \"a little something, just enough to help me get away from him\".And I reckon someone somewhere must have been listening because the next morning I got a phone call from my local supermarket. It turns out I had entered one of their competitions (I don't remember doing it) and they asked me to come down to pick up my winner's prize! Turns out I had won a raclette machine! Bloody hell, what was I supposed to do with that? Throw it at him? Tie it round his neck and  push him in the lake?Whichever way you look at it, I guess God really does seem to have a sense of humour!"},
{"title": "A (sad) sign of the times!", "date": "Thursday 4 August 2016", "text": "As I mentioned the other day, 1st August is Swiss national day and this year they lucked out and got lovely weather to hold their parties and let off the fireworks. I have to let you into a little \"in\" joke though. My colleague is married to a Swiss guy and they were over at his family's for the celebrations when his cousin asked his aunt if \"the fireworks were starting at 9 pm or 9.05\"?  She burst out laughing and they didn't know why! Well put it this way, there is probably a very good reason the Swiss watch-making industry is so successful - I mean that potential five minute difference for the firework start time could have been really important.  Sorry if you don't get the joke but to say the Swiss are sticklers for time-keeping and very punctual would be an understatement!Anyway, the beginning of August is therefore a busy time here in Geneva. After Swiss national day we have Geneva Lake Parade, followed by the Fêtes de Genève. I guess in total about 10 days of very well-organized celebrations (again another Swiss trait).  Now I park every morning at the border and catch the bus across town to work. I am lucky in that the no. 25 bus goes door-to-door for me so once I am installed I don't have to move again until I get to work. Yesterday, however, there were repeated announcements on the bus to say that until 14 August the two buses that normally go to my particular stop would not be going that far and that we should all get off after the train station and catch the shuttles which would be laid on. Well since about 80 people get off the bus and I'm sure the shuttles will only take about 12 people at a time I decided to walk, but to be honest I didn't really understand the whole \"why\" of having the bus cut short it's route. When I got to the lake, however, I realized what it was all about. Placed strategically all along the middle of the road were huge concrete barriers which would allow cars to get through slowly but no way would a bus be able to get through. Anti-terrorist-nutter barriers! How sad that we have come to this. Of course nothing will stop a nutter with a knife or a back-pack but at least Geneva is doing what it can to avoid another \"Nice\" situation! The lake front will be packed until the end of next week and the Swiss are, rightly, trying to take precautions. Again, how sad that we have to.So tonight I will trot off down towards the bridge and, for the first time, catch one of the ferries over the lake to try to make up for not being able to get into town by bus. Could be interesting (I hear the ferries are great). I suppose, trying to put a positive spin on it again, if I end up walking twice a day for a while (30 minutes each way) it could help me lose some of the blubber. Who knows, maybe I will enjoy it enough to take it up long-term!Given the fact that it is the holidays here and there is less traffic on the roads during the month of August, I have been getting home that bit earlier and taken to stopping in at \"my mate Stan's\" little place. In my little village we have a grand total of zero public transport, zero shops and one small (but excellent) restaurant. Basically if you don't drive here you're screwed, unless you are like some of the old-timers who walked everywhere, but when you are in a rush, as we always seem to be, it just isn't feasible to walk everywhere nowadays. I reckon it would take me an hour to walk to the local train station (which isn't exactly a major transit centre anyway) and maybe 45 minutes to the local supermarket, bearing in mind that the walk back from said supermarket with my groceries is up an alp! So that's not gonna happen. Anyway, \"my mate Stan\" saw potential and after much too-ing and fro-ing managed to open a little shop/cafe in the village. Basically it is just two portacabins stuck together from where he sells a small supply of basic groceries and where you can sit for a coffee or beer etc. But the pièce de résistance is that the location is absolutely spot on. To be fair, he did the grunt work of clearing the roadway and lugging the portacabins in but slowly it has become a very popular spot indeed. There is room for the farmers to park their tractors (I kid you not), the view is fabulous and Stan is well liked.Now Stan is Nigerian, married to a French woman, and has had to put up with his share of racism, but over time has become quite the local character. My kids grew up with his kids and are close friends and I have to say that he and Martine have three lovely, well-balanced and polite kids who are a pleasure to be around. In fact OH likes going to Stan's for a drink or a plate of fries and they get yacking about Nigeria or politics or whatever is the subject of the day. In a few years Stan will retire and spend more time in Nigeria and you know what, he will be very much missed. In fact, if I had some uuuooomph left in me I would love to take over his little place, do it up and do what I have always wanted which would be have a little cafe with second-hand books, etc. I could really see the potential there, but I'm not sure I will have the energy when I retire in a couple of years. Who knows, we'll see! Watch this space.The view from Stan'sThe outside of Stan's place - painted by one of his kids' friends!"},

{"title": "It's been a while", "date": "Monday 1 August 2016", "text": "I can see it's been a while since I last posted, but I have been extremely busy (which I like) and I have to admit the horrific events of recent weeks have meant that I haven't felt like posting anyway. I mean, what right do I have to post about the banalities of my life when there are such awful things happening! Obviously I am more aware of what has been happening in France but the madness has been taking place everywhere! I did give some thought to just stopping reading the news entirely on the grounds that \"the big stuff\" would filter through to me eventually anyway and the smaller events, about which I could do nothing anyway, would pass on by without my being any the wiser. I know a couple of people who do this and it works for them, although I don't know that I am ready to cut myself off completely just yet. We'll see.Talking of lunacy, on Thursday Geneva airport went into virtual lockdown due to \"specific information received\" by the Swiss authorities from their French counterparts. The roads around the airport were backlogged and although passengers were allowed into the terminal it was very slow going. It turns out that a woman from Annecy had called in \"information about a possible terrorist threat\". Seemingly she was a jealous wife who wanted to make life difficult (impossible?) for her husband who would be travelling through the airport that day!!!! Jesus H ...... I can think of a million ways of making my ex's life difficult without doing something as insane as that! Well the French moved quickly and she was hauled into court the next day. Given a six-month prison sentence - three months suspended and three months inside! I think in other times that might have been seen as harsh but in today's climate I can only say \"foolish, foolish woman\" and well done the French for moving so quickly and (hopefully) setting an example! Not sure how that stunt improved their marriage though!On another note, I was pleasantly surprised to see Hugh Fernley Whittingstall back on TV last week in his war on waste. This time his major gripe was against the three major coffee sellers in the UK and their supposedly recyclable cups. It turns out that while the outer part of the cups are indeed recyclable, the inner lining is plastic and not recyclable, so while most people think they are doing their bit by putting their cups in the recycling bins it is a waste of time. In fact, there is only one facility in the UK capable of handling these cups and and none of the big three send their cups to this facility! But then, as the Mean Queen said, it beats me why people have to walk around with their coffee anyway. Why don't they have a cup before they leave for work or when they get there - saves waste and money! On the other hand, the big success story last week would seem to be the amazing drop in the use of plastic bags since England introduced a 5p charge for each bag in major stores. If I remember correctly, the number of bags distributed in England dropped by 6 billion since the introduction of the charge, although what took them so long to introduce it when others have been doing it for ages beats me!In other news I finally got round to preparing my son's first US tax return last week. As a US citizen he has to file both here in France and in the US (pain in the butt that is I can tell you). He doesn't owe anything in the US because there is a foreign-earned income exclusion of over $100,000 (I wish) for those living outside the US but he has to file anyway. So while the filing was late he won't owe anyway. Since he is also going to do another two years' apprenticeship (he qualified as a plumber in June but wants to take additional courses for two years) I also filled out the school forms for him for the next year. So with everything finally being sent off I thought I would stop over to take copies up for him on Sunday. He lives about 20 minutes from me in a lovely quiet little village in the mountains. Absolute tranquility! I had thought when he and his girlfriend started looking for an apartment together that they might want to be in town, but not a bit of it. They both love the mountains and the little villages so chose an apartment \"in the back of beyond\" almost. But good luck to them.After I left him I decided to head off to Samoens as I had seen that they were having a vide-grenier (car boot/yard sale) up there. My son told me how to take a back route and I was up there in only 20 minutes. On the way out of his village I passed the local \"farm shop\" where you take what you want and if no-one is there you just leave your money in an honesty box! How lovely is that! I didn't stop in but I will next time. Anyway, it turns out the vide-grenier in Samoens is today not yesterday (which explains why it wasn't that busy) but it was lovely to spend a few hours up there just pottering around. (The sign you can just make out on the wall of the Town Hall in the photo reads \"Soutien à la ville de Nice\" - \"Support to the town of Nice\")!SamoënsThe weather was lovely when I left home in the morning but started to turn when I was up there so after a little potter round I left and just made it home before the heavens opened!When I got home I called my brother (the one who lost his wife in January) and we got talking about how life can be lonely sometimes. He was a saying that while he would never even want to try to replace his wife he would like some companionship, just someone to go to lunch with or maybe to the cinema. I understand absolutely and to be honest I think he is doing amazingly well. He joined the Ramblers, a widows and widowers' group and the University of the Third Age. Now this group seems to do amazing things in the UK - I am so impressed - but when I looked up the equivalent here in Geneva or in France it strikes me as more geared towards the arts and literature - and that's something that I am not interested in joining a group for. In any case most of their activites take place during the day time, and I am still working, so that's pretty much ruled that group out.While surfing though I happened to stumble across a group called Quintonic, and it is designed for the over-50s who are looking to meet up for various activities.  It is not a dating site (I'm not looking for that in any case) but it would be nice to meet older people outside the work environment to talk about things other than work. Anyway, I will give it a shot and see if anything pans out.OH, as I may have mentioned before, is Dutch and while I was \"site surfing\" I found a free online site where you can learn various things (thanks to Jane at Shoestring Cottage) and guess what, they offer a free course in Dutch! Now I love languages and am game for most things so I have enrolled.  Watch this space - but don't stand too close as I suspect I will be spitting all over the shop trying to get the pronunciation right!  We'll see if it impresses OH - although somehow I doubt it!And finally, today is Swiss national day (oh if only the traffic was this easy every day). So Switzerland is pretty much \"closed for business\", except for the likes of me who have to work. But I am sitting here at my desk, with a view of the lake, listening to fabulous salsa music being played in the park behind me - what's not to love!"},
{"title": "And so the bastards strike again!", "date": "Friday 15 July 2016", "text": "Who knows how many times we will have to wake up to the news of these murdering bastards wreaking their havoc, not just in France of course, but anywhere in the world where these morons with enormous chips on their shoulders have a supposed \"grudge\". I didn't hear about Nice until this morning as I didn't stay up for the fireworks. Many small towns in France have the Bastille Day fireworks on 13th so that people can \"recuperate\" during the day on 14th July, which is a holiday here. Not for me, of course, since I work in Switzerland, so I only heard about the atrocity this morning when I got up.The pathetic thing is, though, more often than not the bastards who carry out these atrocities are just pawns - cannon fodder, if you like - in the games played by the \"kingpins\", who are usually too cowardly to carry it out themselves. They are society's \"rejects\" - drugged up zombies, or more often than not petty criminals, who see this as their one shot to \"be Mr. Big\". If only they knew, they are destined to be used, chewed up and then spat out by their puppet masters, brainwashed into carrying out these heinous acts and then consigned to the cesspit of history as the cowards they are.I feel so tremendously for those caught up in it, for the emergency crews confronted with such horrors, and also for the innocent, law-abiding Tunisians (I believe in this case), going about their daily lives, minding their own business, and who will surely bear the backlash of this in some cities. Indeed my best friend is Tunisian, and you couldn't ask for a kinder, more hard-working family man than him. I am sad beyond words!"},
{"title": "Thank God the Euro is over!", "date": "Monday 11 July 2016", "text": "When I was on the bus going home on Friday night, a couple about my age got on at the train station, and ended up having to stand as it was pretty crowded. Eventually they both found seats though not together. When we were almost at the P & R the man's phone rang really loudly, and he seemed to be being \"Facetimed\" by a couple of youngish-sounding kids speaking in English. The man was obviously French-speaking but his English was excellent and I get the impression they might have been his kids (divorcé?). He told the kids he was on the bus and scanned the camera round for them to see, and then one of them asked if he would like them to sing happy birthday to him! To which he replied yes, of course! So the kids sang happy birthday at the top of their voices with the whole bus listening in - and you know what, it was really sweet. He obviously thoroughly enjoyed it - all the more so when everyone on the bus started clapping when the kids finished singing! What a lovely way to end the week!And on another planet, Euro 2016 is finally over (thank God - I really can't be faffed with football). And at the risk of being shot, I was almost glad France lost - but only from a purely selfish point of view, I promise! With France playing Portugal in the final last night, it was a fair bet that the noise from the partygoers was gonna be loud and ongoing in the event of a French win.I had been out most of the day up near Chamonix and after pottering around and getting stuff ready for work the next day, I sat down to read for a while before going to bed. I briefly had the final on TV but only as a bit of \"background noise\" really. In fact, I so much \"don't care for football\" that I actually went to bed but left the TV on for about 10 minutes of extra time just so I would know who had won - but then gave up as I realized I really, really didn't care even to wait for the final score! Trouble was, it had been scorching hot all day and I really wanted to have my bedroom window wide open to create a through-breeze, but with the partying going on I eventually decided to close it and hope for the best.I woke up sometime around 1 a.m. and that's when I realized France must have lost because there was absolutely no partying going on outside - none at all. So giving a totally selfish sigh of thanks, I opened my bedroom windows again and got some air for the remainder of the night - though whose bright idea it was to have the final on a Sunday night I have no idea - bright spark, er not!This morning coming in to work on the bus I spotted a French flag lying in the middle of the road - you know, one of those supporters' flags you attach to the car window. While I'm sure it had just accidentally fallen off, it did look rather forlorn, I have to say.Yeah, yeah I know that's not the French flag - I just couldn't find a photo!Which reminds me, several years ago, during a rugby world cup, I had a couple of these flags on my car in support of England. It was a Saturday and England had just played (and beaten) France, so on my way back from grocery shopping I drove all the way up to my village tooting my horn like mad. The problem was, the actual flag must have flown off and I was left tooting my horn with just a plastic stick hanging off my car window. They must have thought I was a complete nutter - and I suppose they wouldn't have been far wrong would they!"},
{"title": "It's a different world out there!", "date": "Tuesday 5 July 2016", "text": "Oh my goodness, haven't times changed! Or maybe they haven't, it's just that the place and circumstances changed. Ya see, when I was a kid growing up in central Birmingham (UK), our idea of a holiday was a day trip to Stratford-on-Avon for my dad to go fishing. Admittedly, times and finances have moved on since then, but last night really brought home to me what a little bubble Geneva really is. I'm not saying it's bad or good, it's just so different.For a start, there is a lot of money here. Of course there are people who don't make a lot of money too but there is also very, very obvious wealth. When I was a kid, during my first year of high school, they were organizing a one-week camping holiday to Crackington Haven in Cornwall (lovely spot by the way).Our nutty (but extremely effective) English teacher had an antiquated old school bus that he used to drive us kids down there for the week. God alone knows how he got that thing (think large sardine can on wheels) down the tiny Cornish roads but somehow he did. And of course \"camping\" was probably a posh word for what we did. In reality we just had a bunch of maybe ten small tents pitched in a field, no washing facilities, primus stoves for cooking and the loo was a field's walk away. Yes we were expected to wash and brush our teeth in the stream which, as you can imagine, turned into a very perfunctory job because of how bloody cold the water was. Still, we had a great time even if the \"facilities\" were somewhat rudimentary (I mean, we were all working class kids and didn't really know \"posh\"). Every night one tent made dinner and another made desert and this being England it was actually cold enough in August for the huge desert dish of jelly to set outside! One night I remember eating my \"desert\" when I commented to my friend that I didn't like the peach slices much, to which she replied \"what peach slices?\" I looked down at my bowl of jelly and there was half a slug staring back up at me - I had eaten the other half!Sylvester the SlugNow being of a \"sensitive disposition\" I immediately wanted to chuck up, but also, having some manners, decided I couldn't possibly do it in front of my class mates (in the middle of a field - why not?), so ran all the way across two fields to throw up in the \"facilities\" (read \"bog\" kindly provided by the farmer). Yuck, but then I suppose it didn't kill me and indeed I have very fond memories of that, and other such holidays (with the exception of \"meeting\" Sylvester the Slug)!One place that really did impress me was the Witches' Museum in Boscastle, where we got to see not only the horrific details of the torture meted out to so-called witches years ago, but just happened to be there during a freak evening tide, which was really spooky!But you know, none of us had any money and something as simple as a week's camping like this was such a treat. And, something I really appreciate now, after we had packed our tents up we were made to spread out in a single line and walk the full length of the field picking up any litter - so you see we left the place cleaner than we found it. And that is the way it should be don't you think.Compare that to this. Last night, as I was leaving to catch my bus, I saw my friend having a drink and he called me over. I couldn't stay for long as I had to meet up with a tradesman who was coming to give me a quote, but I sat with him for a short while. Eventually another friend joined us and we got talking about holidays.  When I mentioned that I was going to Mykonos and Santorini in September she said \"Oh my son is there right now. A whole gang of them go every year when school is out - it has become something of a tradition\"!MykonosSantoriniDon't get me wrong, she is a very lovely person indeed, but her son is 18 - and this is what his \"holiday with the mates\" looks like!  She is Spanish by the way, not Greek, otherwise he could well have been going to visit family, I suppose. But her kids, like mine, were lucky enough to go to one of the international schools here, and there you see wealth by the shedload! Many families (like hers and mine) work but are lucky enough to get financial assistance from their employer.  Others, though, are just loaded and for them this is nothing out of the ordinary! I mean, how come I get to eat slugs and they get to party in Mykonos? Not jealous at all, it's just that it really brings home how my life and circumstances have moved on. In fact, many years ago, when my oldest was still at school, one of the parents rented an apartment in Verbier for her kid to invite his friends to go skiing! I mean, my kid got to go skiing in Verbier, Switzerland!!!  Good Lord, I've never been skiing in Verbier! To be fair, the lads were great though, and as soon as they arrived they moved everything that could be broken into a cupboard and, I am told, left the place absolutely spotless. So credit where credit is due I suppose. In fact, my ex used to throw New Year's parties at the (isolated) farmhouse he rented after he left me and while I insisted everyone slept over rather than got behind the wheel, they partied all night and then all pulled together to clean up afterwards (Sonya Anne - there's an idea for you after your 4th of July party!), so fair play to them.On a totally different note, yesterday I got the wonderful news that my son had passed his final exams in plumbing after a two-year apprenticeship. I am so thrilled for him. He is going to continue another two-years of study to take further exams but at least he has got that under his belt. When I sent him a message to congratulate him he wrote back saying \"thanks, and thank you for everything\"!  Oh, I want to cry.  Weird how that's all it takes isn't it - a bit of recognition!And moving seamlessly on, this weekend my lawnmower started going on the blink (probably needs an overhaul) and as it was so hot I got really, really sick to the back teeth of the idea of ever cutting my grass again! I had been talking to my neighbours, who feel the same way as I do about their lawn, so I called the guy who comes once a year to cut my hedges. The upshot is that we have both set up an agreement with him to cut our lawns in future. So that's one thing less to worry about. I don't have a lot to cut but I hate the heat and end up looking like a lobster so while I don't mind doing the rest of the gardening (slug chasing ha, ha - payback time you bastards), he will now do the grunt work. And in fact he isn't asking as much as I was expecting so it's win-win all round as I sense he needs the work. So now I feel like Lady Mary in Downton Abbey - having to manage my \"staff\".  Posh isn't the word for it!And how about Nigel Farage resigning! Whatever his reasons it seems like all those that orchestrated the \"out\" vote for Britain are now like the proverbial rats leaving the sinking ship. As far as I am concerned let the two ladies run the country (May and Leadsome could make a good team, IMHO) - I'm sure they can't screw things up any more than the pillocks who just crawled back under their rocks now the real work has to be done. Oh and last one out, put the light out will you!So on that note, I will love you and leave you. For Anne (New Happenings at the Table), I did weigh myself on Monday as promised and you know what, whether I weigh myself in lb, kg or stones, it still don't get any better! Bloody awful in fact. But at least yesterday I was good and hopped off the bus on the Mont Blanc bridge to walk the 30 minutes to work and went to the gym at lunchtime (hee, hee, I hear you snigger - we'll see how long that lasts)!  So back for the weigh-in next Monday then! And good luck!"},
{"title": "This and that", "date": "Friday 1 July 2016", "text": "Oh I'm so glad it's the week-end after the last 10 days or so of racing round like a lunatic (not to mention a very contentious referendum and all the fall-out from that). I'm glad the referendum is over but I wish we could just get on with working out the best way forward for the country, However, given the behaviour of some of our so-called politicians I feel we are in for a long and bumpy ride.Talking of the referendum, I would hazard a guess Brexit has actually increased job vacancies in one area at least - for those working in passport offices! From what I understand there has been a run on Brits asking for new (mainly Irish) passports, so much so that the Irish passport office have had to issue a \"hold your hosses there folks - we've run out of passports\" notice. Not surprised really, as those Brits having the right to another EU passport are wisely doing the necessary to obtain them (as I will do myself shortly). I imagine, also, that those non-Brits currently living in the UK are also flooding the UK offices with requests for naturalization for the security that will afford.  My poor colleague and her husband (both Brits) had a baby three weeks ago here in France and have applied for a British passport for her in order to travel to visit their folks in the UK next month. Well good luck with that, I suspect this is the worst time to be hoping for a quick turn-around time for a new passport!Talking of Irish passports, my (Irish) colleague has been reading out to me some of the banter going round the internet about how to apply for an Irish passport. (1) Get your application in early; (2) Wear green; and (3) Turn up drunk! I would hasten to add this isn't coming from me - but we both burst out laughing.  \"Test to verify aptitude for Irish citizenship - drink 10 pints of guinness in 15 minutes\"! Again, I would stress, not coming from me - off the internet - but I'm sure the Irish in any case would be the first to poke fun at themselves!On a completely different note, I can't believe it's the 1st of July already and there is the usual mad rush here of people setting off on holidays, where the motorways become jam-packed and people become bad tempered. I'm so glad I don't  have school-aged kids anymore so I don't have to go on holiday to the south of France at the same time as 10 million other French people. But it's not just the holidaymakers though. Some lunatic was riding my arse on the motorway this morning raring to get past when in fact she couldn't get past anyone as there was so much traffic. Eventually I pulled over to let her past and she proceeded to ride the arse of every single car she came up behind. She was a relatively young woman and I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. I mean, if you are that hyper at 7 o'clock in the morning you are a heart attack waiting to happen surely. I'm just glad I'm pretty laid back as coping with a \"hyper\" personality would probably kill me in about two weeks. And all for what?I remember years ago my friend telling me that he was driving through a set of two-lane tunnels in Chambéry. He was in the outer lane and couldn't get over because of the traffic. Anyway, a young man in a crappy car started riding his tail and flashing his lights. As Philippe said, \"I couldn't get over even if I had wanted to - which I didn't\". So this young lunatic had to wait until Philippe reached the end of the second tunnel and was able to pull over, whereupon said young man whizzed past him giving him the finger - and promptly hit the central reservation, effectively tearing the side off his car and totalling it. He wasn't hurt but I'm sure his pride was - and Philippe said he got a good laugh out of it. I remember also several years ago a young man doing the same thing to me one morning in central Geneva. He was behind me, tail-gating, and bursting to get past - which he eventually did. He continued in the same vein all the way, weaving in and out of traffic and being a thorough menace. A couple of km further up the road, I looked in my rear-view mirror at the traffic lights - and he was again one car behind me - so all the racing around didn't get him anywhere, except perhaps one step closer to a coronary!Again last night I thought my time really was up. On leaving Geneva there is a pretty big motorway intersection, with two lanes (on the right) merging and the third, left-hand lane, separated by large bollards, where you have to go straight ahead. Well at one point there was a break in the bollards, where someone must have hit one, and a complete lunatic slammed his breaks on and tried to do a completely illegal right-hand turn to merge into the other two lanes. Luckily for me I wasn't going very fast, but I would say about four cars narrowly avoided him. Had there been anything coming up behind him, God alone knows what would have happened. It might not be Los Angeles but the speed limit along there is 130 km/hour (so of course everyone is doing 140)!  Seems some people have a death wish - I just hope they don't take me with them.Since I seem to have got on the \"I want to lose weight\" band wagon again, this morning I thought I had better hop off the bus on the Mont Blanc bridge and walk the 30 minutes to work (competitive much?). As I was coming through Geneva I passed an Asian store so I decided to pop in and buy some coconut water (my latest guilty pleasure). Blimey, when I compare prices at work to the prices in town - what a rip-off. Geneva is expensive anyway but prices in the cafeteria at work are just so ridiculous it is unbelievable. In fact, there is a joke that goes \"you know you've been in Geneva too long when you live in a studio but still have a cleaning lady\"! And that's about the extent of it - there is a lot of money in this city and the prices really reflect it.On a totally different note, I have been reading about the atrocities in Turkey as they are starting to piece together what happened at Istanbul Airport. One story in particular saddened me. A Tunisian father had flown to Istanbul to try to convince his son, who had run away to Syria, to come back home - the father was killed in the carnage! I only hope the son has to live with that for the rest of his life. What a senseless loss of life, and how Turkey seems to be taking such a beating right now. I have no intention of getting into the politics behind it all, but suffice it so say I have been to Turkey several times and it is a beautiful country with lovely people and I feel so much for those that have lost loved ones yet again in another senseless killing.So that's about it for today. I'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend of not much happening. I have a wedding drink to go to tomorrow from one of the young women in my sewing club but other than that a quiet weekend.  Thank goodness!"},
{"title": "I'm too old for this!", "date": "Wednesday 29 June 2016", "text": "Crikey, what a week last week was! Apart from being incredibly busy at work it seems like all my \"end-of-term\" parties came about during the same week. I ended up going out every night since last Thursday, all day Saturday and Sunday and then again Monday and Tuesday. Problem is, while an evening out with the ladies from the sewing club ladies is just the thing for us adrenalin junkies, I ain't 25 any more. I remember when I first came to Geneva, I lived in the city itself as a single girl for five years and I never, ever, stayed home in the evenings -  not even once!  Quite an achievement but then I suppose I was that much younger right! But I am soooooo glad not to be going out tonight.Last night was the final of my monthly patchwork lessons down in a place called Cluses. So far we have been making small projects designed to teach us different techniques and I have to say Lydie, the teacher, is excellent. When we go back in September we will start working on a jellyroll quilt and I am really looking forward to that. She did offer to do a couple of afternoon courses during the holidays where participants can make one of two tops, each aimed at teaching a different technique. So she asked anyone interested in participating to let her know which project they wanted to make along with their sizes so that she could get the appropriate patterns - small, medium or large!!! Well, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this one can't you. Bloody hell, have you ever seen French women - they come in sizes \"skinny\", \"extremely skinny\" and \"invisible\"! I, on the other hand, need an \"extra large\" in France just to house my \"womanly assets\". Flaming hell, where they will be putting in bust darts I will be inserting tent poles! Somehow I think I won't be bothering with this particular course, all the more so since it will be given during the day time and I work full-time - thank God for that, is all I can say! Still, the thought of stripping off in front of a bunch of French women has bought home to me (yet again) how much weight I have put on in a relatively short space of time. I had started at Weight Watchers in January but then two deaths in the family in two months, and two trips back to the UK and I kinda got out of the swing of it and, to be honest, while I'm sure it works, I can't help feeling that Slimming World is much easier to follow and more effective.  But of course they don't have it over here and trying to do it online when you have as much willpower as a chocolate teapot just isn't going to cut it.Anyhow, today at lunch I was talking about \"Brexit\" to a Scottish colleague and he said that finalizing the purchase of a house in Switzerland on Friday had been completely overshadowed by the vote. When I commented to him that it probably made financial sense for him to buy a house after many years of renting he said \"oh, I bought it to lose weight\"! Funny that, I'm sure a WW subscription is a helluva lot cheaper than spending 2 million Swiss francs on a house, but then what do I know! Anyway, he explained that since it is out in the country he will now be able to cycle to work and back every day, thereby getting a couple of hours of exercise in each day and hopefully losing about 10 kg in the process. I don't know about you but I still think a subscription to Weight Watchers would have been cheaper but who knows how the Scottish mind works! Anyway, idiot here then challenged him to see if we could both lose 10 kg by Christmas, so I guess we're on. I'll probably lose the bet as I swear it's easier for men to lose weight, but if the alternative means having to strip down to my bra in a sewing class and drag a hand-made marquee over my head, I think I'll go with the weight-loss challenge. Watch this space - I'm off to shave my legs before weigh-in!Anyhoo, I'm not a football fan so haven't been watching the Euro 2016, but I have to say \"well done Iceland\"! What an achievement. Of course they knocked England out of the tournament a couple of days ago (and this from a country with a population of 320,000 people)! What can you say, except well done - I hope you go all the way (even if you have to forgive them for using up all the vowels in a game of scrabble)! And blimey, well done England - fancy leaving Europe twice in one week. Again, what an achievement!Talking of Brexit, I was up at my son's the other night discussing what we plan to do when Brexit comes into force (if it ever does - but that's another story). There is no rush of course but we pretty much agreed that we will both apply for French citizenship. There is no problem with being an Anglo-French dual national, but I did check that there would also be no problem for him having Franco-American citizenship - and it seems that there won't. Blimey, he'll have to buy a new handbag for all those passports!  It's not so much a problem for my other son as he both lives and works in Switzerland, but son number two and I are both in France. Anyway, when leaving his place you come out onto a landing and are immediately faced with a field as it is quite rural. And in this field are a couple of (very noisy) donkeys. Actually, aren't all donkeys bloody noisy - we have had all manner of beasts in the field behind my house and donkeys do seem to take the gold medal in the noise-making Olympics - even worse than a randy bull, in my expert opinion.I guess it must be something about my family then that seems to attract donkeys, as my parents' home in Dorset backed onto a field where the owner kept a couple of donkeys - Bailie and Mary. Aaaaahhhh! I remember my dad used to go to the back fence and throw apples for them from the tree in his back garden. Anyway, one day he got it into his head that Bailie was getting more apples than Mary and \"it just wasn't fair\", so he did what any upstanding proponent of justice and fair play would do - and \"invited\" Mary into the back garden by way of the gate! What on earth he was thinking we don't know but he had this bloody donkey in the back garden, with Bailie looking forlornly on from social purgatory in the field.In retrospect it might be that my dad was already starting to become unwell at this point - he must have been around 80 years old, I guess, and his behaviour had certainly started to become a little strange, to say the least. He eventually went on to develop full-blown Alzheimers, but at this point we didn't know he was ill, so just took it as one of dad's madcap schemes. The problem was, instead of behaving in the conciliatory manner of all well-behaved donkeys and eating the apples my dad had so kindly provided for her, Mary tootled over to his veggie patch and started munching her way through his lovingly tended carrots!At this point dad must have realized that Plan A wasn't exactly working so had to instantly switch to \"Plan B\". Plan B, as it turned out, was my old man standing behind Mary and trying to push her back into the field. Well, if you have ever tried to push a reluctant donkey anywhere it didn't want to go you will realize that \"Plan B\" wasn't going to work either.  That being said, it was incredibly funny watching my 80-year-old dad trying to push this donkey out of the back garden. What a pity we didn't have a camera to hand! Eventually the owner managed to get Mary out of mom and dad's garden, but I suspect that was the last time she was ever invited over for lunch, the ungrateful cow - er donkey!"},
{"title": "International cooperation at its best!", "date": "Tuesday 28 June 2016", "text": "This weekend I took a bus trip down to Turin to visit the market. We had done it last year and thoroughly enjoyed it, so even though it meant getting up at the crack of dawn it was something we wanted to do again. It is has been pretty much non-stop for me since last week so I must admit I was completely Christmas-crackered (\"knackered\" in Cockney rhyming slang) after last week.Work has been frantic, but always is at this time of year. I don't mind actually but it does seem to be a feast or a famine sometimes. One of my sewing clubs had kindly moved their end of year get-together from Saturday to Friday night so that I could be there, and although I was a bit worried I might end up missing it because of working late, I actually made it to our rendez-vous point just in time to meet up with the others.One of the great things about these ladies is that they always seem to pick out a new-to-me restaurant that ends up being a little treasure. We ended up very close to where my son lives in a small village called St. Jean de Tholome, eating at what you could, I guess, technically call a \"burger joint\", but in reality it was superb.St. Jean de TholomeThe food was excellent and very reasonably priced and the staff really friendly. Now I know why you have to reserve (well we were 12 anyway but apparently it is hard to get a table if you haven't called ahead).After dinner some of the ladies decided to go out for a drink but I begged off as it was already 12.30 and I had to be up at 4.30 to get the bus to Turin.  I have to admit getting up at the crack of dawn didn't exactly thrill me, but as long as no-one spoke to me for the first hour it was doable and heading up through Chamonix to get to the Mont Blanc tunnel was a dream. And of course I didn't regret it. While black clouds threatened everything turned out just fine. The market was again wonderful and I really love all the hustle and bustle. Geneva is lovely and pristine, but I have to say it lacks that vibrant buzz that you get in Italy!ChamonixYet again the fruit and veg were just amazing and so tasty compared to the plastic rubbish you often find here, and at least half-price, or maybe even one-third of our local prices. When I asked one of the ladies why this should be she said the Italian producers weren't taxed like the French were (though that didn't explain why things should taste so much better in Italy, particularly given that we are on pretty much the same latitude! Go figure).I also bought myself a very nice, \"really expensive\" (not) handbag and a lovely throw for my bed for the grand total of 20€!Lunch in the centre of the market place was again fabulous (spaghetti carbonara à l'italienne anyone)! While we were eating, a group of young schoolgirls started taking photos with a selfie stick (I'm thinking they were probably from an international school as they were speaking English and French). Just as they were about to take the last photo an Italian pizzaolo ran up to them, jumped in the air and got right into the middle of their shot. I bet it turned out to be the best photo they took!We were told to be back at the bus by 3 pm but one group of ladies came back very distressed. They were a group of four sisters (I think) and one great-granddaughter out for a day's shopping, but right at the last minute they had lost track of the oldest sister, aged 86. Being that age, of course, she didn't have a mobile phone and they were worried sick. Now I know people say to watch them like a hawk, but just as with kids all it took was one moment's inattention and she was gone. The market would have been pretty confusing for her anyway I guess. We waited until 3.30 pm and in the end the trip organizer arranged with another coach heading back to France a couple of hours later to bring them back if and when .... trouble was, \"when\" didn't happen. In the end two of the sisters stayed back in Turin to look for \"mamie\" and the other sister brought the young girl home.  What a nightmare - they were absolutely frantic.On the way back, before reaching the border, the coach stopped at a big hypermarket so that people could do more shopping. According to one lady, bottles of spirits, for example, would be about €10 per bottle cheaper in Italy, as would cigarettes etc. so a lot of French routinely cross the border to stock up as it is cheaper than France - even taking into account the toll to get through the Mont Blanc tunnel (a feat of engineering indeed - 11.5 km of road hacked out under the Mont Blanc)!But something to think about is this. Put that shopping in the context of \"Brexit\" and swap \"Turin\" for \"Calais\" or \"Cherbourg\" and you can get some idea of the kind of impact Brexit will probably have on the French economy. Brits routinely hop over to France on a day trip to fill the car up with French products but if, after Brexit, the Brits are again limited to two bottles of wine, 200 cigarettes and €100 of other goods, what will that knock-on effect be for the local French hypermarket?  Tough times ahead, I think.I bought some mozzarella and parmesan cheeses and a little olive oil but other than that not too much at the hypermarket.Anyway, when we got back to France, the coach started dropping people off, including the sister of the lost \"mamie\", who had to get all the other sisters' stuff off the coach, in addition to her own. My friend and I were the last two people off the coach at the final stop, so the driver and his young helper offloaded our stuff and headed back to the depot. Trouble is, when we had finished loading up my car we found we had ended up with two extra bags! Obviously someone had forgotten them on the coach. So when I got home, I put what I could in the fridge and called the organizer. He said if someone called him he would give them my number but otherwise, I guess, I should take it as a windfall, since I couldn't hang on to the perishables too long.Next day, however, I got a phone call from the owner of the missing bags. She then put me on to her son-in-law and we arranged for him to come over and pick up the bags (which included clothes and shoe shopping in addition to the groceries). On the off chance I asked him if he was related to the mamie who had gotten lost and he said yes - that is why his wife had missed some of the bags on the coach. It turns out that mamie had wandered off and got completely lost. She had been found by an Italian policeman in the backstreets of Turin. Said policeman, who didn't speak a word of French, managed to collar a French lady, who didn't speak a word of Italian but who took pity on the older lady, brought her back to her own bus and the driver took her back to France with them. Trouble was, this bus ended up back at a town called Aix-les-Bains, about 70 km away. Mamie had been so distressed that she couldn't remember her own phone number but the Good Samaritan went through the phone directory and eventually managed to track the family down.So in the end it all worked out. A kindly Italian policeman found a French Good Samaritan to bring the distressed older French lady back and an honest Brit returned the unclaimed bags to them, via her lovely French neighbours who agreed to stay in to hand over the bags to the son-in-law (I hope you are following this). I tell you, I think we should just kick out those idiots in Brussels and let the proletariat run the show - I think we would do a better job don't you!Talking of Brexit, I went to bed Wednesday night thinking it would be a close call but we would remain in the EU. I got the shock of my life the next morning to hear they had voted \"out\". I say \"they\" deliberately as I was really, really angry that I wasn't allowed to vote because of the arbitrary decision to exclude expats who had lived outside the country for more than 15 years. Bloody hell, as someone most closely affected by the damn vote I was spitting cobs at the thought of not being able to vote on an issue which could see me getting kicked out of France! In all honesty, I don't see that happening but I really, really resented not being allowed to vote on an issue that affected me 100%. I have calmed down now, and while I would indeed have voted to remain in the EU given the chance, I think the fact that the UK has voted out is a good kick in the teeth for the complacent, arrogant dictators in Brussels - let's hope it is the wake-up call they need, or maybe other countries will follow suit.I intend to start the process of reverting to my maiden name after my holiday in September. Once my British passport is updated my son and I will begin taking the necessary steps to become naturalized French citizens. I will go ahead regardless of how events unfold after Brexit as whatever happens I intend to stay here when I retire.Anyhoo, moving seamlessly on, on Sunday we had our annual \"neighbours day\", where we basically spend a couple of hours cleaning up our \"lotissement\" (housing plan, I guess) and then have a pot luck lunch together. Again we were lucky in that the weather was nice, and I have to admit our little lotissement really does look nice once it is all squared away - not that it ever really looks bad as people do seem to take care of it.It's a nice lotissement to live in. The people are friendly and seem to look out for each other. There may be tensions occasionally of course, but as I am on my own I feel very secure in this friendly little French enclave. Brexit be damned!"},

{"title": "In or out!", "date": "Thursday 23 June 2016", "text": "Whichever way it goes, I can't wait for the \"Brexit\" issue to be decided. I don't even live in the UK and I have found it so tiring, though to be honest, living in France I consider myself to be one of the people most keenly concerned in the event of an \"out\" vote. If it comes to \"out\", I think there will be tremendous chaos as there will be so much change and so much to be sorted out. For me, for instance, I would have to ask for a residence permit for France (carte de séjour), something that neither my son nor I need currently as citizens of an EU member State. Then what happens to all the EU citizens (think Polish nationals, for instance) currently living and working in the UK? While I'm pretty certain anyone already living there would have an automatic right to stay, just like I will in France, administratively it will be a nightmare.  Then there is the issue of \"reciprocity\" of health care systems, pension funds etc. I know one thing, I wouldn't want to be the one having to sort all that out.For me, personally, getting residency in France wouldn't be a problem as I have been here 27 years already, and can get it through my employer anyway. In fact, I intend to revert back to my maiden name in the coming months (not looking forward to all the extra work that will involve) and once that is sorted, and if necessary, I would probably ask for French citizenship, but in my new name, should the UK vote out.Still, it hasn't happened yet, but like so many I can't wait for tomorrow morning to find out the results and for the whole thing to be over. Personally, if I had the vote (and that's a whole different issue), I would have voted \"in\". Purely from a trade point of view, with the UK having almost 50% of its trade intra-EU (and therefore tariff-free), I think it would be an economic disaster from that point of view alone. Now I know the big issue in so many minds is immigration (it is here in France too, by the way), and I'll be damned if I know the answers, but I would have voted \"in\" if I had got the chance. And there is my biggest bone of contention.  I am a born-and-bred Brit living in France and have NO say or vote on an issue that can affect my right of residence in another EU-member State because I have been out of the country more than 15 years! How screwed up is that!Now I know there are idiots who think (if you can use the word \"think\" in their case) and have even said outright that if you chose to live in another country, well then just take that nationality and \"bugger off\". Well it isn't actually that simple. Quite a few countries do not allow dual citizenship (as was the case when I was living in the US some years ago) and there is no way I would give up my citizenship to take on another nationality. And what if I have no desire to take on that country's citizenship anyway, or what if I happen to be living in another country because of work commitments, or if said work commitments mean I have to move around? To be told \"just leave\" is simplistic and idiotic and in any case I don't see why anyone else gets to decide what I should or should not do regarding my citizenship (think armchair critics of the DM)! (Gets down off the soap box)!Anyway, like I say, only time will tell. My gut feeling is \"remain\" will win, but since when was my gut a good economic indicator! That being said, during the Scottish referendum on independence, again I hoped that they would chose to remain part of the UK, which in fact they did but as in this case, I think it would have proved very, very interesting had they voted for independence, to see the reality of the outcome, as opposed to the predictions of the scaremongerers and doomsayers on both sides. The honest truth is, I think, that nobody knows what will/would have happened unless and until the vote is counted.  But like I said, I think everyone will be glad when it is decided one way or the other and the \"incivilities\" can stop.In other matters, the weather has finally picked up here after a particularly crappy beginning to June. Wet, wet, wet - a little bit of sunshine then wet again. The upshot of that of course is that my bloody lawn grows like triffids and I can't get out there to mow it for ages, but when I do I end up feeling like a great explorer, machete in hand, slogging my way through the overgrowth. I don't have that much land, but being on the side of a mountain it is not flat (to put it mildly) and the bloody grass bag gets so heavy. Yuck. My neighbours mentioned something about getting a lawn service in to do theirs - I must ask them about it because I am getting to dislike it more than ever now and between the two homes it might be worth it.That being said, my peonies were a riot of colour recently too, although peonies, unfortunately, don't last that long and all the bloody rain we have had has tended to bash them about a bit.Another positive last weekend was that my youngest son installed a new kitchen sink for me (after me nagging him for ages). Jordan did a couple of years of bilingual office studies after school with thoughts of looking for work in one of the multi-nationals here in Geneva but didn't really like it. Still, it's not a bad skill to have in any case. So as his friend's dad was looking for an apprentice for his plumbing business J made the hop over to an apprenticeship. He has just completed his second year as an apprentice plumber for the mind-boggling monthly salary of half the minimum wage. But, despite that, he is very happy - much happier, I think, than if he had ended up working in an office. So while he is a bit older than most other apprentices he probably has the maturity to handle it better. He has just finished his second year exams (finals for this part of the diploma) and the first exam was English oral!  Ha, ha, how great is that. He doesn't have his results yet but fingers crossed.He had never installed a sink on his own before so what better way to figure it out than to practice on his mom! I must admit I kinda blackmailed him a bit since as he is on such a low wage I told him I would continue to take care of his car expenses and I just had it serviced and new tyres put on the other week. So really, you see, he had no choice did he! Still, he made a good job of it and I must admit I am so pleased to get rid of the old sink. My oldest son had been doing his usual enthusiastic washing-up routine some years ago and banged a hole in the old one. To rectify that my ex put something which looked like a big gob of chewing gum over the hole to prevent leaks. Over time, of course, the \"chewing gum\" got dirtier and dirtier and was really looking disgusting, so I am pleased to see the back of it.Jordan (and the most spoilt kitten in town)!So if anyone needs a bilingual plumber, very conscientious (only a small commission payable to me) and highly recommended by yours truly just let me know!When I took the old sink and tap fittings down to the tip, the guy there nearly jumped on me and took it over to their little hut rather than dumping it in the bin. I don't see them being able to get much use out of the sink, to be honest, but I reckon they can probably salvage the tap fittings and make someone a few euros and/or very happy.  A win-win situation as far as I am concerned.In other news, where I live I have to cross the one-and-only bridge from our little town over a river up to the village. Well the \"good\" news is that that bridge is going to be undergoing major works shortly and will be closed for around a year! Bloody hell. Because of the layout of the surrounding area, crossing that bridge is pretty much the only way to get into town, to the train station and onto the highway to Geneva. It will entail quite a lot of traffic now having to go through backroads and tiny villages to get across the river. I'm sure no-one is going to be too happy about this dragging on for a year. It will be a royal pain in the butt. I was talking to one of my neighbours who is a hunter and he said you can actually go further up the mountains to get on the motorway to Geneva but it is not an easy road and in winter is pretty miserable anyway so I guess we will all have to put up with the inconvenience - like it or lump it so to speak.Last Monday night was my end-of-year dinner with my patchwork club, and very nice it was too. I have to admit I am still in awe of what these ladies (and one very talented gent) can do, and am looking forward to the time when I can take more of their courses and learn new techniques, but for the time being I am stuck with \"evenings only\" meet-ups.Moving seamlessly on, my friend sent me a link today to an article in the UK press which states that about 100,000 people over the age of 50 are set to receive the bad news that they will not be eligible for a UK state pension through not having contributed to the pension scheme for a minimum of 10 years. I'm not sure of all the facts but of course there were the usual \"outraged\" citizens mouthing off about how unfair it was (probably all the fault of the \"bloody immigrants\"). But one thing I don't get, assuming you are not disabled, or that you have not made the conscious decision not to work for whatever reason, I can't understand how you can get to your mid-fifties having actively looked to work and not managed to get 10 years of contributions in. Maybe I am missing something but really? (and that applies to me BTW - not enough years of contributory service).  I am now 57 (soon to be 58) and could technically take early retirement from my job here (full retirement for me is 62 but I could also stay till 65). However, having gotten divorced at age 53 and taken on a new mortgage I can't afford to retire until my mortgage is paid off. Now I reckon I can do that in another four years (so paying off a 17 year mortgage in 7) but without that I can't afford to retire. Even selling up would make no sense because I don't have enough equity in my house as yet to be able to buy a decent apartment for the money I would get from the house. Moreover I love where I live, my neighbours are great and I am not going to buy a pokey little apartment in exchange for my lovely house. So stay I will, and if that means carrying on working for another four years then so be it. Another reason for me to hope they vote \"in\" today in the UK is that if I do \"flip\" and get fed up of working my other thought might be moving to Spain where it is much cheaper and warmer than here - but then I need to be/remain an EU citizen. Catch 22 I suppose. I don't think I will actually end up moving to Spain even though I love the country but it is just something else to think about as to where my future lies.What the thought of retirement does do though is make me realize that lately I have been very, very busy at work and I really like it (my work is every cyclical). If I want to do other activities outside of working hours it means quite a bit of running around, but I love it. So it has really brought home to me that while I would like to quit work (I am so tired of the 3-hour commute each day) I want to have a retirement in place with quite a few activities/commitments scheduled or I think I would just get depressed. I haven't exactly worked out what all these \"activities\" will be but I do know I won't be stopping work before I have more concrete plans in place. One madcap idea is to get a dog when I retire, meaning a commitment and getting out walking every day, but I have to give serious thought to that before doing the deed, since I still want to travel.  Who knows. I guess only time will tell.Talking of \"busy\", this Friday I have the end-of-year dinner of my other sewing club (this is the one where all I do is yack)! They had planned to go up the mountains on the Saturday lunch time like last year but since I am off again to the market in Turin on Saturday they kindly brought it forward to Friday night. So that's out Friday night, up at the crack of dawn to head off to Turin Saturday, and then our annual \"clean up the lotissement\" (housing plan) followed by communal BBQ on Sunday! I will be on my knees. Then Monday after work back to sewing and Tuesday my final lesson in my once-a-month patchwork club. Goodness, I was saying I like to be busy - let's see if I am as keen after all this lot. (Oh, and I have to get my lawn cut tonight because I just won't have time before next weekend otherwise - great fun)!So there you have it, another chaotic but happy week. Can't wait to see what the referendum holds so until next time - à plus!"},

It is just so, so sad that people can be deemed acceptable targets by some lunatic just because he doesn't like what he believes they represent, whether it be homosexuality, \"westerners\", \"infidels\" or whatever these inadequate nutters use any excuse to justify their savagery. Who the hell gives you the right to take someone's life because you don't like who they are? Are they hurting you for God's sake? Good God alive, they are all somebody's child, somebody's loved one.My crazy ex posted on Facebook that he didn't think people in the US should be flying flags at half-mast because \"that should be reserved for the military\". Well I don't agree. If someone wants to show respect for those that were injured or lost their lives to some lunatic by flying the flag at half-mast that is their right, and if that gives a small iota of comfort to those left behind then surely it shouldn't be for my ex to criticize. It's easy to be an armchair pundit of course!So to those caught up in the slaughter and mayhem - wherever in the world that may be - you have my condolences.

{"title": "Food wastage", "date": "Friday 10 June 2016", "text": "There's not much new going on here at the moment, except for my being frantically busy and us getting yet more rain. I swear the rain has been on and off for six weeks - I'm kinda getting fed up of it now, I have to admit, even though I don't actually mind the rain. As for the \"frantically busy\" bit, well that is just the current work cycle. I prepare two large meetings a year (July and December) and four big reports (two for each meeting). Not that I actually write the reports - we have eggheads to do that - I just put it all together ready for translation/publication. So at this time of year it is pretty busy - not that I am complaining - I like to be busy and you do get a sense of achievement when the bl***dy things are published.Traffic is pretty bad (or maybe even getting worse) here in Geneva, what with the ongoing works to build the CEVA (the train that will link the local French area with the central train station in Geneva, thereby (hopefully) cutting down on thru-traffic in the city centre. Can't wait for that to go through, of course, but I fear it will probably be too late for me as I will, hopefully, be retired by the time that is completed.On top of that, the Swiss have just voted yes to building a bridge over Lake Geneva, also with the aim of easing traffic through the city, but this time I know it will be too late for me work-wise, though it should eventually have a positive impact on the city nevertheless. Geneva is, of course, stunningly beautiful but since it is located at the end of the lake, pretty much all the traffic wanting to get from the south bank to the north bank of the lake (i.e. ME) has to go across the Mont Blanc bridge, and that is a nightmare!I come in from France (to the south), and although I park at the border and catch the bus, I still spend at least 40 minutes each way on the bus to get over the lake. It is what it is, I suppose, and I (like everyone else) just have to put up with it.  It's worse in the winter of course or if there is an accident, but at least catching the bus allows me to get tons of reading done, which I would do anyway, so I'm thinking positive here.Which leads me to my next point. I was recently on the bus reading a local French magazine and an article on a new French law aimed at stopping food waste. I'm pretty sure this has already gone through, though I don't know the exact date. Under this law (and I am paraphrasing here) all grocery stores/supermarkets over 400 square metres in size have one year to come to an agreement with a local entity whereby any food near its sell-by date which they would otherwise throw out will be donated to that entity. Presumably a local charity or food bank.  Moreover, they are no longer allowed to pour bleach over it in the trash cans to render it unusable!I think this is a wonderful initiative, aimed at reducing food waste and helping out local food banks etc. in the process.Every week when I go shopping I pick up a couple of extra items of food, and when I have a box full I take it down to the local food bank. It is run by the Red Cross, who do a wonderful job with limited resources. They know me now and took me round their storage unit last time I was there. I have to admit it is pretty small and depending on the time of year they can come quite close to running out of supplies, since they are only allowed to collect outside the supermarkets once or twice a year. These people soldier on, however, and I have nothing but admiration for them.Since I got landed with a bunch of my ex' stuff when he upped sticks, I asked them last time if they needed clothing and it turns out they are indeed happy to take that too. They work with the local psychiatric hospital and were particularly keen to get hold of men's coats over the winter - men, it seems, being more likely than women to end up homeless and in dire need of warm outer clothing. I have been able to give them eight coats so far, which must be a win-win situation for everyone!Anyway, I think the French are to be commended for this initiative and can only hope that the UK and others will follow suit. In fact, in his recent programme on supermarket waste, the wonderful Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall went out one night \"dumpster diving\" with volunteers from a local soup kitchen, taking perfectly good food from supermarket bins that was being thrown away and lugging it back to the soup kitchens to make into dinner for those in need. The young man said that he had once been placed in the back of a police car and had begged the supermarket to file a complaint and the police to arrest him - but of course the supermarket wouldn't because of the bad press it would generate. Good on him, and good on France - let's hope it catches on!"},
{"title": "Don't let the facts get in the way there!", "date": "Wednesday 1 June 2016", "text": "You know how sometimes sh#t happens, well it happened to me last week. I got home on Tuesday evening and there were two messages on my answering machine. Usually I just ignore them because I get, on average, I would guess, three calls per day from telemarketers, which I just delete. They drive me nuts but, like most people I guess, I don't see how I can stop them. Moreover, I am now starting to get calls from Swiss as well as French numbers and at first I thought about calling back.  When I checked in the Swiss telephone directory, however, they actually have a note posted to the effect that this number is being used for unsolicited telemarketing!Anyway, back to the story line. I did listen to these messages and the one that jumped out at me was \"garble, garble, I swallowed my adenoids, Gendarmerie\"! So I listened again and got the same mangled message but just about made out the \"Gendarmerie\" bit in my local town. I called back immediately only to find an answering service. So then I called again the next day and told them I couldn't understand the name of the person who had left the message but here is my mobile number. Well nobody called back so I called yet again the next day. I ended up chasing my tail like this until this Friday when I got a \"convocation\" to attend the Gendarmerie on 30 May. Since I knew it was open on the Saturday I stopped in Saturday morning. The young man there was very pleasant and told me that it was to do with an incident in my local LIDL where I had apparently knocked over the pole where you punch in a code in order to get out of the parking lot.Well let's back up a bit. My local LIDL is opposite several apartment blocks and people from those apartments were using LIDL's parking lot so much that shoppers were turning away as they couldn't find parking. I have done this myself, preferring not to waste my time and going to another store. Very wisely LIDL began installing entrance and exit barriers, where you took the number off your LIDL receipt and punched it into the keypad on the pole at the exit to get out.Now I had pulled into LIDL on Saturday 7th May to do some shopping and as I drove past this pole it fell over. I didn't hit it - it had obviously been clobbered by someone previously, and in any case was only in the initial stages of being installed so I would guess not totally stable. Well someone must have taken down my number plate and reported it to LIDL, who, it turns out, then filed a complaint against me at the local Gendarmerie.Anyway, on the Saturday morning the young gendarme was very pleasant but couldn't help me. He told me to come back on the Monday morning to meet with the \"big boss\".  So that's what I did. Turns out the \"big boss\" obviously had a thing for himself in uniform (love yourself much mate?) and he began to spout off about how \"I had been filmed in my 4 x 4 on the evening of Friday 6th May knocking down this pole\".  It took a second to dawn on me but when I queried the time and date again he repeated what he had said. So I pointed out to him that it couldn't have been me as I was flying back from England from my mother's funeral (thank you mom!) and had landed in Geneva around 10 pm that evening, before picking up my car from the airport around 11 pm.Well that seemed to annoy the shit out of him so he said \"well it must have been your husband\". (To be fair, they knew my ex well since I had had to call them out on several occasions due to his violence and they actually arrested him at one point, but I digress). When I pointed out to him that I was divorced and that my ex was in the US he said \"well it must have been one of your kids\". By this time he was beginning to annoy me so I told him I didn't have any kids (I have two but what's a little white lie between friends). He was a real tw@t I can tell you and when he realized I had got him he basically said \"see you in court then\"!So I walked on down to LIDL (again) to try to speak to the lady who had filed the complaint and yet again she wasn't there. The young man in charge, however, agreed with me that it couldn't have been me because the film was definitely of a 4 x 4 in the parking lot on the Friday evening. I told him I drove a Ford Mondeo and outlined my story so he said he would take it up with the boss when she got in.In the meantime, I tried to call LIDL but they go through a centralized telephone unit and they refused to put me through!!!! When I explained my situation to the customer service agent she said to send her an email and she would forward it to the lady concerned.So I have fired off an email to them and put a copy of my letter, plus flight tickets, etc. in a registered letter to them, asking them \"for God's sake call me back\".  We'll see.I have to admit I don't usually have any problems with local officers. I cross the border every day and 99 times out of 100 the customs officers/police are only ever friendly and helpful.  Trust me to get a Rambo-wannabee!  Anyway, we'll see what happens next.  Watch this space!"},
{"title": "A weekend of celebrations", "date": "Tuesday 31 May 2016", "text": "My youngest son is 24 today, so I had asked them a while back if I could invite them over to dinner sometime to celebrate his birthday. I completely understood that they might want to be with their friends on the Saturday night (I mean, who wants to spend a Saturday night with your mom when you can be with friends right?) but he and his girlfriend sent me a message on Friday and said \"how about we go out tonight to celebrate his (upcoming) birthday and Mother's Day\"?  Mother's Day in France is always the last Sunday in May, while in Switzerland (where my other son lives) it usually falls mid-May.So on Friday night we went out to dinner at the one-and-only restaurant in the village where I live. The food is good, the people are friendly and the views are spectacular so what's not to like!The weather hasn't been great (indeed it was pretty rubbish all weekend), so that was excuse enough for me to order my absolute favourite dish \"tartiflette\".It's pure stodge really but eat it with a salad (to feel virtuous) and a selection of dried meats and for me it is pure heaven. Jordan is (finally) developing a taste for cheese and chose a lovely goat's cheese and honey salad and Jen had a burger, which is something new for this restaurant as they are not a \"burger joint\", but she said it was very good anyway.Jen and the (almost) birthday boy!I often just pop up to their place on a Sunday for a little while but it was really nice to spend an evening with them \"down here\". As Jen had lived with us for about three years anyway many of their friends are local to me, so after dinner they went and called in on some of their friends from the village - a nice bunch of kids I have to say.Since Sunday was Mother's Day they had brought me a present and I am absolutely thrilled with it! I sent a picture of \"Daisy\" the cow to OH and he came back saying he thought it was a clown. Bear with me, he is having his cateracts operated on in a couple of weeks!Isn't she lovely! I had nipped out to the garden centre and bought the thyme for my garden but I think Daisy looks rather great with her new haircut - something about her hair puts me in mind of James Brown, although I'm sure his hair didn't smell of thyme!On the Sunday it absolutely peed down but my friend and I did make the effort to trudge out to the garden centre and then on to another local vide-grenier. It was such a shame as a lot of effort goes into putting these events together and it really was pretty much rained out. We did treat ourselves to merguez and chips though and to be honest trudging round in the rain didn't really phase us too much as we are both Brits, but I did feel sorry for the event organizers all the same.And so, on to today, it really is Jordan's birthday. I can't believe he is 24 already.You know, I remember very much when he was a baby and toddler, but after that the years just seem to have flown by. If anyone knows how to make time slow down (or keep it in a bottle as the inimitable Jim Croce would say) please let me know how you do it. It is so lovely to look back over those times but they are gone before you know it.So happy birthday Jordan. Quarter of a century next year!We never did find those car keys! As a post script, I'll leave you with one of Jordan's little gems. I have shoulder length brown hair with a slight wave in it. No matter what I have tried to do with it over the years it always comes back to looking like \"shoulder length brown hair with a slight wave in it\", so in the end I just gave up. When Jordan was about 10 he suddenly looked at me one day and said: J     \"Oh mommy, you're so lucky, I really love your hair\"! Me     (stunned) \"Well thanks sweetheart, it's really nice of you to say that\". J     \"Yeah, I mean, you look just like Simba in the Lion King!\" While that may have burst my bubble, hey I'll take compliments wherever I can find them!﻿"},
{"title": "Belle and Sebastian", "date": "Thursday 26 May 2016", "text": "When I was a little girl I remember being entranced watching the French series \"Belle and Sebastian\" about a little boy and his Pyreneen mountain dog (Belle). I can't recall much more about it except the stunning scenery and the fact that it was French language with English sub-titles. I remember asking my mom if they really were speaking another language or was it just gobbledy gook, and she said \"oh gobbledy gook I expect\"!!! Anyway, from that day on, I wanted (a) Belle, and (b) to speak gobbledy gook.I did get to speak gobbley gook eventually, as much from my love of languages as from the fact that if we didn't go down the \"languages\" route, we would have to go down the \"sciences\" route, so it turned out to be the lesser of two evils, as you can see, 'cos me and sciences just didn't see eye to eye.Anyway, although at the time I never did get a \"Belle\", when I was a young teenager we somehow managed to twist our parents arms (by asking them when they were half asleep) and ended up with a lovely border collie mutt.Now border collies really are working sheep dogs, of course, not that ours ever had to work a day in his life, but we loved that old mutt anyway. But now, eventually, I have gotten to see my very own \"Belle\". Well it's not mine of course, but for the first time in the 27+ years I have lived in this house, the farmer has put sheep in the field behind the house. He initially had dairy cattle when we moved in and then alternately raised donkeys and horses (beautiful to see them running on a sunny day), but as of about a couple of weeks ago, we must have 100 sheep in the field behind us!And, they have got their very own \"Belle\"!They call them patou in French, but they are effectively Pyreneen mountain dogs. It has been lovely to watch how he protects his flock, but I was amazed to learn that these dogs are essentially nocturnal by nature. They are fiercely protective but incredibly gentle with the little ones. To watch how Belle herds the sheep up the mountains is a sight for sore eyes. And the weirdest thing happened the other day. While sheep of course bleat and baaaa, and they have their \"cowbells\" on them at all times, when Belle was herding them further up the mountain they made the strangest groaning noise, the likes of which I have never heard before. It was a really loud, spooky sound - a bit like the noise I make at the thought of another gym class, but multiply that by 100 sheep!I don't know how much longer they will be staying on the field behind the house, but 50 years later I am so glad that I finally got to see my very own \"Belle\"!"},
{"title": "Lazy weekend - well not really!", "date": "Tuesday 24 May 2016", "text": "Last weekend they had forecast nice weather for the Saturday and then \"iffy\" for Sunday. By the time I got back from England they had had tons of rain and not being able to cut my grass before, I swear it looked like I lived in the Serengeti! It gets to me when things look a mess so I was determined to get all caught up with the housework, washing, ironing, and so on and then decided that just in case it was going to pee down on Sunday I had better get the grass cut as well. I must be mad!I don't have a very big garden but the part at the end, which actually looks like it belongs to me, is in fact a fireman's access right of way. It runs round the back of all our houses to allow access to firecrew in the event of an emergency. It is also, supposedly, to be maintained by its owners, the local HLM bank, but who, in the 27 years I have lived here, have never set foot on it (nor indeed, ever set foot on it according to my neighbours). In order not to look like we live in a pigsty therefore, we homeowners have always maintained our respective parts of it. Actually, we are in the process of negotiating buying our individual plots off the HLM (ongoing as we speak) in order to prevent them from potentially putting in an access road to any future housing developments that might be built in the fields above us - but that will most likely be the subject of another post).Anyhoo, I nearly snuffed it cutting that bloody grass. It was so hot and so heavy once all that wet grass hit the lawnmower bag. Never again in that heat I can tell you although, like I said, I really wanted to get that crossed off my to-do list before it got any worse.So, having got everything I wanted done on the Saturday I decided to go up the mountains to visit my son and his girlfriend to drop off some paperwork. They bought the sweetest little kitten a couple of months ago, and while I am not a cat person, this kitten is absolutely bonkers.LeniUp until recently they had been keeping it in the house, but then he got adventurous and went out onto their rather large balcony, really curious to have a good look around. Anyway, Jen decided to throw some bread out for the donkeys in the field right next to them, at which point Leni pulled himself up to his full 8 inches and 5 ounces and took a flying leap off the balcony to try to catch the bread. My son said to imagine the song \"I believe I can fly\" being sung and Leni flying off in slow motion looking like this:He said it was sooooo cute - and then they had to dash off in hot pursuit! I'm not sure Leni will be content to stay around the house too much longer.After we had left them we decided to go down to a local vide-grenier (car boot, to all intents and purposes). The only difference is that they tend to be organized by the local communes so there are always food and drinks stands, and often much more (as this time, a bouncy castle etc.). It was being held in the local village of Arenthon. Arenthon vide-greniersIt's not the biggest nor the best but it was nice. Trouble is it was again scorching hot - the heat only being made bearable when the wind picked up - and boy did it pick up. It came in great gusts so people were having to hang onto their parasols and stuff and the men behind the bar were actually holding down its metal roof at one time, just in case it flew off - which obviously would have been very dangerous. We had just ordered sausage and fries when the wind caught mine and I ended up with a lap full of mustard and fries - not quite the look I was going for but I wasn't the only one that got caught out, I suspect.While I didn't actually need anything (do you ever?) and going totally against the grain of getting rid of stuff, I actually picked up a few sweet little bargains for the grand sum of €8 - four wine glasses, a bonbonnière and two water glasses. I am well pleased with them!Trouble is, the vide-greniers go on until October - oh dear, I guess I shall have to work a little harder on the decluttering - or we could just consider it \"recycling\" in that I borrow this stuff for a while for about eight euros before getting rid of it at the next vide-grenier. Well that's the plan anyway. Still, all-in-all quite a lot of fun can be had for a few euros don't you think? Better than mall shopping anyway!"},
{"title": "An evening at the theatre", "date": "Thursday 12 May 2016", "text": "A couple of weekends ago, after the recent sadness of my mom's passing, it was nice to spend a few hours \"getting away from it all\" at the theâtre. It was the Geneva Amateur Operatic Society (GAOS) who, yet again, put on an excellent performance - this time of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.My friend and I tend to go to the Saturday night performances as it is less of a rush for us than going during the week. I have to admit though that I wasn't overly enthusiastic about this one because I don't have particularly great memories of the film - I don't know what it was, but I found the film didn't make much of an impression on me as a youngster, though I have no idea why!We decided to go anyway, and I have to admit I was more than pleasantly surprised.They put on an excellent show as always and I found myself really enjoying the story. The children performed superbly and certainly held their own against the excellent performances from the adults. For me, the villainous Baron Bomburst, Ruler of Vulgaria, was just outstanding (picture a Mel Brooks kind of character on crack cocaine) and of course the role was an absolute dream for him.While I have no acting talents or ambitions, I couldn't help thinking what a gem of a role that was for someone to camp it up to the hilt - and he certainly did so!I have to say though, that I was also amazed at how \"Chitty\" performed! I have no idea how they managed to create a \"magic car\" but they certainly pulled off an extraordinary feat in the props department - it was amazing. I suppose if I wanted to get involved with something like this group it would be \"in the background\" as I think it would be just fascinating to see what goes on behind the scenes.Talking of \"behinds\", during the interval I went out to get a drink and one unfortunate lady walked passed me holding a young boy by the hand but with about two feet of toilet roll hanging from the back of her jeans! I went to call out to her to let her know but just at that moment there was a surge in the crowd and I lost sight of her. The poor thing - you can only imagine how mortifying that would be. A couple of minutes later, however, she came back in my direction and I was able to attract her attention to let her know. I mean, it wasn't just a little piece of toilet paper - it was almost reaching down to the ground! She of course was horrified (I guess it's like walking out of the ladies with your skirt tucked into your knickers), but, as I said to her, not to worry - if she's lucky she will probably never see me again!"},
{"title": "A lovely farewell!", "date": "Tuesday 10 May 2016", "text": "So now it's over and we all got to say our final goodbyes to mom - and what a lovely service it was!I flew back to the UK last Sunday in order to spend a couple of days with a friend who retired to the Cotswolds. I flew in to Bristol (a first - and a last for me, I think) because it is a smaller airport and closer to the Cotswolds. It's not that I have anything against Bristol of course but getting round the city - on the wrong side of the road for me!! - with all those bloody road works/diversions, etc. was a flaming nightmare. Go ahead, ask me anything you like about Bristol Cathedral - anything - I must have passed the bloody thing at least 10 times and while it is indeed beautiful I really wasn't there for the magical mystery tour! Eventually, however, I managed to make my escape from the city's tentacles and made the 90 minute drive to Lechlade where my friend lives. And again, just like in Wales previously, I had forgotten just how pretty it is.LechladeOf course it was lovely to see my friend and her husband again but the weather also cooperated fully and it really was quite stunning. Their home is a 300-year old cottage with all higgledy-piggledy walls and vertical stairs and absolutely lovely. They also have the daftest dog - a lurcher - who hasn't realized she is the size of a small bus but acts like she is the size of a small pug. But still, a lovely pup indeed. We took﻿ my one-and-only day in the Cotswolds to visit the lovely neighbouring town of Burford, and again it was absolutely charming - and not particularly crowded considering it was 1st May. BurfordU took me into her \"favourite\" shop, and I have to admit it was just like a rabbit warren - a never-ending maze of nooks and crannies. AND - get this - they also had an oldy-worldy sweety shop selling the old fashioned sweets that I remember from my childhood. Chocolate limes, butterscotch - oh it was just heaven, although I'm not sure my dentist will thank me for my indulgences later! On the Tuesday I drove down to Dorset for mom's funeral, which was to take place the following day. And you know, while it was sad, it really was all right! I mean, she hadn't been in ill health, she was 94 and happy, and she just sat down and went to sleep. Who wouldn't want to go like that? I know I would. All five children were there, with just two out of her 10 grandchildren not being able to make it from Denmark. My kids flew in from Geneva after work on the Tuesday night and made it to Dorset at 2 a.m. and then had to fly back out after the funeral on an 8 pm flight - but I am so glad they were able to make it. My sister, who had made all the arrangements, had chosen a semi-religious service as we are not a religious family, and the celebrant had taken the time to sit with my sister and her husband and write down some of their memories and stories. In a case like my mom's I personally don't think the aim is to make people cry, and I have to say that having the celebrant read out some of the silly stories during the service was lovely, and certainly cut the tension. I mean, how about when we went to visit Corfe Castle and my mom scrambled up the hill on all fours to get up to the castle, only for my dad to point out afterwards the pathway which she could have used (and was just out of sight) - I don't think she spoke to him all day after that!﻿Corfe Castle﻿After the ceremony, my other sister was telling us that when she was preparing to move to Denmark nearly 40 years ago mom had told her to buy a TV in England to take with her because that way \"she could get all the English channels too\"! I mean, how lovely is that! The music was also beautiful and I think the only thing that made any of us a bit wobbly was on the order of service they had put a picture of mom and dad in uniform during WWII and as we said our last goodbyes they played Vera Lynn singing \"We'll Meet Again\". What a lovely choice, but it caused a few tears I can tell you. Mom and dad in Blackpool  After that we went to the marina for refreshments and then those that could make it went back to my sister's house afterwards, although some had flights to catch and had to dash off. And there we spent several hours telling all the old stories (as you do) and laughing - which in a way is why I am writing this blog because I want those stories to remain for those that are left behind. Can there be a better tribute? Gwladys Myfanwy - \"mom\"  God bless!"},
{"title": "God bless", "date": "Tuesday 19 April 2016", "text": "My lovely mom died yesterday morning, totally unexpectedly. Well when I say \"totally unexpectedly\", I mean she had not been ill and seemed to be in fine fettle. That being said, she was 94 but you know, when someone has been as well as she had, I think you just don't expect them to die - I thought she was invincible. Sadly, that wasn't the case.Whichever way you look at it, I/we were very lucky to have had her in our lives for so long. She and dad didn't have it easy, but then I suppose most of their generation had it tough. Not a lot of money, large families (not necessarily by choice) and the horror and uncertainty of living through the second world war - something I hope future generations never have to face.We were a large family of seven kids (I am number seven) and they tragically had to cope with the loss of two of those children, one to heart problems and another to a brain tumour. Sadly, as mom once said, if they had been born today in all likelihood both of those children would have survived, but it wasn't to be.Having had a family of my own - but only two children - I wonder how they did it. You know, the days out fishing in Stratford, piling all the kids into the car, along with the fishing tackle, the deckchairs and the calor gas stove because of course we always had to have our bacon sandwiches while out fishing. Spending a day on the river with the men fishing, the women chatting and we kids playing seemed like something out of heaven. And of course it never rained (although I suspect I may have my rose tinted glasses on with that bit). Then stopping off at the pub on the way home for a packet of crisps and a glass of lemonade, or even an ice cream in Henley if we were really lucky!I was only little when we were all moved out of \"the old end\" because the houses were set to be demolished, but mom told me about the parties they would have and how the floor had to be reinforced because of all the dancing, and how, since they were the first in the yard to have a television set, all the men would come over to watch the match (it probably had one of those old circular, two-pronged aerials that someone had to hold aloft so that the others could watch the game)!But you know, without idealizing it, those were good times. Nobody had much of anything but everyone shared and looked out for each other. Our idea of heaven was jam sandwiches and a bottle of water down at the local park, and while we all came back looking like members of the ragbag gang, whenever we went anywhere as a family we were all spotlessly clean and scrubbed to within an inch of our lives.One of the enduring memories I have of my mom is when, as a child, they would take me with them when they went out dancing. I remember the sound of the shoes on the salt that was thrown on the dance floor and how everyone - both men and women - looked so elegant and how they could all dance - not like us today bopping around with no clue! And then we would go home and I would sit on my mom's lap in the front seat (no seatbelts - health and safety hadn't been invented yet) and I could smell the smell of her face powder. That to me will always be the smell of my mom.She outlived my dad by eleven years, and retained her sense of humour till the end. So while I am sad to lose her I count myself extremely lucky to have had her in my life for so long. At least now I know that she is at peace and back as the lovely, young woman she once was and with my dad in that great dance hall in the sky.God bless mom.  Love you always.  A"},
{"title": "The refugee crisis", "date": "Monday 11 April 2016", "text": "As I caught the bus from the border this morning, a colleague got on and we were lucky enough to get two seats together. She has just come back from a week volunteering in Lesbos, Greece, where many of the refugee boats have been running aground. I knew she was going beforehand as she said she wanted to do something that would put her own situation into perspective. So through the magic of the internet she was able to google \"Lesbos volunteers\" and managed to hook up with a very well run group of volunteers working there.She flew through Athens to Lesbos and had reserved a studio in an area which turned out not to be at all suitable for her work tasks so, after contacting one of the coordinators, she moved on to another area nearer to where she would be expected to work. The surreal thing is, during her week's stay there she never saw a single refugee, and only one boat arrived in all that time! The volunteers were of course on duty 24/7 just in case but she said that since 20 March when the EU began turning the boats around, only one boat had arrived on the island. From what she could understand, they were all massing at the land border with Macedonia.She said volunteers were arriving and departing every day but that the group was well organized and very motivated. One of the tasks assigned to her was to help out in the \"warehouse\". Apparently, at the beginning, when refugees arrived they were taken to changing rooms (women/children and a separate area for men) and their wet and dirty clothing was simply dumped in landfill. Now the volunteers were getting the clothing washed and dried in order to pass it back on to new arrivals. The amazing thing was though that when clean clothes were offered to some of the refugees they said that they \"didn't want that colour or that particular item\"! She was amazed. It turns out that some had paid people smugglers around $1,500 to make the journey and had been assured that they would be met upon arrival and taken care of. Sadly, that sounds eerily familiar doesn't it. Of course they had been taken in by the scumball people smugglers, who I suspect are the only ones benefiting from the current crisis.The refugees were told by the smugglers to puncture their boats when they got nearer to land because if it was sinking they would definitely be picked up, whereas a viable boat would be towed back in the direction it came from. She heard of one boat where two fathers had died because they were sitting in the middle of the boat, that, of course, being where the water pools the fastest once the boat is punctured.She said many of the volunteers were very \"idealistic\" in their views so she preferred to keep her own counsel. My feeling is that I feel so sorry for the genuine refugees, whose plight has been made worse by the economic migrants trying to sneak into Europe. Interestingly, many of those being sent back are Bangladeshis and Pakistanis and while I understand people's wish to better their lot in life, it has to be done through legal channels. Her take on that was that Bangladeshis have always come to Greece for seasonal work and so their plight was also being made worse by the current situation.She said that she had no idea what to expect but that it was an amazing experience and she hopes to go back to volunteer when she has more leave. When they weren't working at the warehouse they worked shifts cleaning up debris from the beaches and while it was hard physical work she would do it again in a heartbeat.I'm not sure how she would have reacted had she been there with boats arriving and people drowning, but I have to say I admire what she did (and what others continue to do) and I take my hat off to her."},
{"title": "A cunning business plan!", "date": "Thursday 7 April 2016", "text": "Yesterday I had one of my regular visits to the gynae - one of the joys of being a woman I guess! Still, I suppose you get used to it and while just like the dentist it is never fun, keeping up with your routine check-ups, to my mind, far outweighs the alternative of sticking your head in the sand.When I came back from St. Lucia I noticed a small, burn-like mark on my right inner thigh. At first I thought I had scratched myself but this \"blemish\" just didn't go away and almost looked like a blister. There had been nothing there before - no freckle, no birthmark, etc. - so after a while it began to bother me since I realized that you should be aware of what your skin looks like \"on a normal day\". On top of that, I had been daft enough to burn in St. Lucia so I decided to keep an eye on it.So while I was at the gynae's I'm lying there thinking \"well, he's a doctor and since his head is down that way anyway .....\" What do you do? Do you think \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" or do you stick to the job at hand? I guess one of the joys of getting older is that in the end you really don't give too much of a shit about what it looks like so eventually I asked him what he thought. He said he didn't think it was anything to worry about but since it had appeared suddenly and was not going away maybe it would be a good idea to check it out with a dermatologist.  When I got back to work, I got the name of a dermatologist from the phone book, called up and have an appointment in a couple of days time.The reason behind this rambling is because it got me to thinking how fortunate we are here in Geneva to call up to make an appointment to see a doctor and get an appointment in the next couple of days. It certainly isn't like that in France, I can tell you, and from what I understand it isn't like that in the U.K. either. I mean, in France you need to make your gynae or optician's appointment 6-9 months in advance and while that is probably ok if it is just routine stuff, what do you do if it is more urgent?Of course the reason it is easier in Switzerland is because it is privatized medicine; moreover it is far from cheap! We are very lucky to have excellent medical insurance through work and I was discussing this with my colleague afterwards. The cunning business plan that came to me while sitting on the bus was that say, for instance in the U.K., if you needed to see a doctor but could wait a week, well then that was fine and your visit should continue to be free. (Yes I know it's not free, it's paid through your taxes, but bear with me here). But say you were worried about something and really wanted to get in to see the doctor within the next 48 hours - how about proposing a small charge - say £10 for that \"speedy\" visit. The logic here being that the £10 charge might stop some people who really didn't need to see the doctor from clogging up the surgery time.So then we were on a roll. Now non-urgent visits would continue to be free and urgent visits would be charged a flat rate of £10. Then my colleague chipped in that, better still, if it turned out that you hadn't been wasting the doctor's valuable time and that you really did have something seriously wrong with you, well then you would get your £10 back.We both looked at each other and she said \"well there's good news and bad news. The good news is 'here's your £10 back', the bad news is .....\" and we both burst into fits of laughter (\"sorry mate but it's terminal\").Somehow I think our master business plan needs a little fine-tuning!"},
{"title": "Like mother like daughter - somewhat!", "date": "Wednesday 6 April 2016", "text": "As I mentioned in a previous post, I am a great rugby fan and love to watch the internationals in particular. For a while, my second son and I were members of the England Rugby Supporters Club and would travel to a match if possible. One particular match, in around 2003 I think, had England playing France in Marseille, so while it was a good trek to get down to Marseille, we were lucky enough to have friends who live in Cavaillon and who were kind enough to put us up the night before.The nice thing about rugby (apart from the game of course) is the atmosphere and camaraderie, so at a rugby match you never have supporters segregated like you would at a football match - which is the way it should be for heaven's sake - it's supposed to be sport! Anyway, Jordan was about 10 at the time, I would guess, and he and I went to the match in our England shirts but ended up sitting right in the middle of a huge group of French supporters. We could hear them ribbing us in French of course but it was all good natured and we didn't let on that we understood every word they were saying. The look on their faces when this little boy turned round and answered them back in perfect French was sheer bliss!Now the cockerel is the symbol of France, hence \"le coq sportif\", and at one particular break in play, when the trumpeters started up, the man sitting next to us pulled a live cockerel out of his backpack and it started crowing like crazy, probably relieved to be out of that bloody back pack.  Was it cruel - probably - but the cock didn't seem to be too much the worse for wear (unlike the French supporter), but it was indeed pretty funny.When Jordan was about eight he and his friends joined the local rugby club - Rugby Club le Môle, named after the local Môle mountain.Anyway, Jordan and his friends were only young and it was a great way for them to socialize and get plenty of exercise, and while the parents do end up running around like crazy to get the kids to matches and practice, the atmosphere is always great.One year, \"pap\" and \"ammie\" were over from the States and we took them down to watch Jordan training. It was a scorching hot afternoon so we tried to stay in the shade near the buvette (the little drinks stand). This being France, they didn't only sell coffee and soft drinks, but also wine, beer and probably a few other things hidden surreptitiously behind the counter! So my husband, \"pap\" and I had a couple of beers, much to the disapproval of \"ammie\". After a while, of course, I was bursting to pee, so I tootled all the way over to the other side of the grounds to get to the locker rooms, only to realize after I got there that they were locked - of course! So I had to tootle slightly faster back to the buvette to get the key off old pappy behind the bar. Again I tootled back, this time somewhat more urgently, key in hand, and began looking for the loo, only to be horrified at the sight of what are called \"toilettes turques\" here - I hate the bloody things. I mean I really cannot see any point to them at all and being a woman makes it even worse!Anyway, I was desperate so after a bit of acrobatic manoeuvering I managed to pee, keeping my feet relatively dry and not falling down the hole. As I got up I grabbed hold of the chain to flush it - and got completely soaked from top to toe! As you can imagine, I didn't really know what to do except trudge my way back to the stands to puzzled looks.When I told my son what had happened he burst out laughing - apparently I had peed in the main shower - the first shower that they go into fully clothed when they are really muddy to wash off as much crap as possible, before stripping and getting into the \"real\" showers! The toilets were off to the right!I said before that \"ammie\" didn't approve of us drinking beer - well she was even less impressed by the state of me when I got back from the loo, I can tell you. Perhaps one too many?Jordan eventually quit rugby after breaking his collar bone for the third time. His friend Daniel went on playing and is now a young man mountain playing professionally for a local club. I was lucky enough to watch him play on Sunday as the match was on TV and I have to say I am pretty impressed - but then I would be wouldn't I!Anyhoo, moving seemlssly on, I saw the sad news that comedian Ronnie Corbett had died last week, and while I can't say I was a particular fan, I will leave you with one of his \"one-liners\" that had me tittering.\"It has today been reported that a van carrying 10 prisoners has collided with a cement lorry on the M25. Police have been warning people to be on the on the look-out for 'hardened criminals'!"},
{"title": "Oh dear", "date": "Friday 18 March 2016", "text": "As I had posted earlier, my older brother lost his wife totally unexpectedly in January of this year. From what I can gather he is doing pretty well - there are good days and bad days of course but I always felt he would cope nevertheless. Previously he was big into swimming but, for the time being anyway, he didn't feel that he wanted to go back to swimming - maybe later. When I was in Wales for the funeral he mentioned that he felt like he wanted to join a walking group to get him out of the house, so I mentioned the Ramblers. I was talking to him this weekend and he had, indeed, joined the Ramblers and had been on his first walk on the previous Thursday. His description of that walk was hilarious. He said that even at 73 he thought he might have been the youngest of the group, and though he considered himself to be reasonably fit, they were all like \"*!**y mountain goats\" (his words, not mind)! He couldn't believe it! It was only supposed to be a 4 mile hike so he was thinking it would take just a couple of hours. But NOOOO, it turned into a 6 mile hike \"up and down the bloody Welsh mountains\". He said these \"oldies\" just shot off like mountain goats and while everyone was really nice he soon realized exactly how out of his depth he was (to put it politely).He described one lady as \"a Joyce Grenfell type\" - anyone who remembers Joyce will know exactly what he meant.Joyce GrenfellShe seemed to take a shine to him and walked along with him, all the while knitting as she went! He said she had a ball of wool in her pocket and knitted and yacked for the entire walk - not that he was complaining, because he couldn't catch his breath anyway. She was incredibly knowledgeable and explained all the different types of sheep's wool caught in the hedgerows and so on. He couldn't believe that she could walk, knit and talk without skipping a beat or dropping a stick, while he was on his hands and knees discreetly trying to avoid coughing up a lung.At one point they came across a small bay which he hadn't seen before, and were lucky enough to spot a mother seal and her pups splashing around in the water. Idyllic indeed. His intention was to \"pop into ASDA\" on the way home to get some groceries, but he ended up going straight home to a hot bath and a glass of whisky, while at the same time realizing how ill prepared he was - the wrong boots, the wrong rucksack, the wrong .... you name it .... and just how unfit he was. He said they were a nice group though, extremely well organized and very friendly and that he will go again, only better prepared!Funnily enough, when we landed in St. Lucia, waiting in the arrivals hall was a driver holding up a \"Ramblers\" sign. He was there to pick up a group of Ramblers from the UK who were in St. Lucia for a rambling holiday. Bloody hell, \"rambling\" in that heat - it was as much as I could do to stagger down to the beach in the mornings!On an only slightly related note, many, many years ago, when I was a little girl, we were on holiday \"down south\". We were driving round Dartmoor when my mom said that she was bursting for the loo. I mean, in the middle of Dartmoor all those years ago, what was she expecting? So my dad stopped the car and when she asked where the toilet was he said \"20 yards in any direction\".So mom scooted out and went behind a bush for a pee. Trouble was, when she pulled her knickers back up and got up to leave the bush got up at the same time - it was a bunch of soldiers on training exercise. I guess we can mark that exercise a success then!"},
{"title": "Spring is sprung!", "date": "Thursday 17 March 2016", "text": "Or at least I hope so after yesterday's burst of snow. As predicted the snow didn't stick so that's was a relief. I notice from the bus that the magnolias haven't even begun to blossom yet, which is weird because in St. Lucia they had well and truly blossomed. I know it's not exactly the same climate but to me seeing the magnolias in bloom is always a sign of spring. And because I live at 800 m altitude the local magnolias, crocuses, daffs etc. are always that little bit later to bloom than they are here in Geneva.As I didn't have any plans at lunchtime I thought I would take advantage of our lovely weather and just tootle over the road to the Botanic Gardens. I have to say we are extremely lucky to be located right on Lake Geneva and have the Botanic Gardens immediately opposite. The crocuses and daffs are on their way out and the tulips are trying their best to get in on the show, but aren't quite ready yet. Still it's a lovely spot to sit and read while enjoying this lovely spring weather. Bliss!"},
{"title": "Spoke too soon!", "date": "Wednesday 16 March 2016", "text": "Ha - and only yesterday I was saying I didn't mind coming back to France since the weather was so glorious. So what did it do? It started snowing again! Wasn't expecting that at all! When I woke up this morning and raised the black-out curtain in my room (covering the velux in the roof) it looked like it was all frosted over, but when I opened the bathroom shutters it was bucketing down snow. I couldn't believe it. I mean really, really thick snow. Damn! To be honest, I knew it wasn't going to stick and I'm pretty sure that when I get home tonight, while there may still be snow in the fields, there won't be any on the roads - at least that's the plan anyway. The good news is that glorious weather is again forecast for the foreseeable future. I hope so anyway, because I planted my first tomato seeds last weekend and while they are sitting contentedly in front of my living room window, getting more snow really does feel like taking a step backwards!Anyhooo, moving seamlessly on, one day after coming back from the beach in St. Lucia I realized that my iPad had gone bananas! I had it well wrapped up, inside a bag and sitting in the shade, but when I went to turn it on I got this kind of screen.I reckoned it must have either got sand in it or maybe had suffered from the heat. So I messed around with it for a bit but there was nothing doing. Bloody hell, there went my chance of taking more pictures etc. and I have to admit I do enjoy maintaining contact \"with the outside world\" when I am on holiday.  Not to mention the unappealing thought of having to shell out another wad of cash to get a new one on top of the obvious expenses of the holiday.By now I was resigned to my fate though and since I had a couple of days before I went back to work I thought I could run down to Annecy and pick up a new one. I don't know why but the night before I googled \"how to repair an iPad\" and there were various Youtube videos purporting to be able to fix it. The problem was, apparently, that there was a loose connection between an internal wire and the screen (or at least, that's the way I understood it) and in two different videos people were saying to \"tap gently here\" or \"tap gently there\". I tried both those solutions and it didn't work. Then another video suggested turning the iPad off and dropping it on the floor. Not exactly hurling it off a cliff in a fit of pique (that can always come later) but dropping it from a height of about a foot onto a carpeted floor. So thinking I had nothing to lose anyway that's exactly what I did - and guess what - it worked! I kid you not, the blooming thing is now working again. So you see, those Youtubers were right and I have them to thank for not having to shell out another small fortune for a new iPad. Thanks guys!"},
{"title": "Back to the grindstone", "date": "Tuesday 15 March 2016", "text": "Well it's back to work after two weeks off and time to get my nose back to the grindstone. Not that I am complaining as the weather here is beautiful, except maybe 30 degrees cooler than St. Lucia!March seems to be the best time of year for me to take time off, firstly from a personal point of view because it gives me a break from the winter and secondly, from a professional point of view, because work starts gearing up after March.Since it is the ski season here Easyjet do flights to Geneva from a larger number of U.K. airports so in the winter I am lucky enough to be able to get a flight Geneva/Bournemouth for a very reasonable price. Bournemouth airport being only about 30 minutes from my sister's home is therefore great for me. I got to see my 94-year-old mom a couple of times. The conversation is very repetitive of course and to be honest I'm not sure she even realizes I was there but it was good to see her and she looked well. On the Sunday we went down to Weymouth to watch quad bike racing, starting with the youngsters. It was fun to watch, although I suspect an expensive hobby. We were lucky with the weather, which was lovely and sunny although bitterly cold and windy - a great way to get a free facial peeling with all that sand being thrown around!On the Monday I caught the bus down to London in order to spend the night at Gatwick before an early morning flight to St. Lucia. Since I was the only passenger on the bus I got chatting to the driver. He was from Slovakia so we were discussing the upoming referendum on whether or not the U.K. should stay in the EU. With me living in France I would say we both have vested interests in the results of that referendum.When I got to Gatwick I checked into the Premier Inn at the north terminal and again I was impressed with the efficiency and the overall experience. Again food for thought was that at least 50 per cent of the staff there seemed to be Polish and both the Brits and the Poles really did hustle.The experience was a very positive one and for me at least a great counterbalance to all the negative \"anti-immigration\" articles you see in much of the gutter press. I have my own views and opinions on the \"in-out\" debate and will vote as I see fit, but feel that no-one can truly know what would happen in the event of an \"out\" vote until and if that happens, just as would have been the case with the Scottish referendum. I would be allowed to remain in France in any case and would most likely request French citizenship in the event of an \"out\" vote but I'm not so sure how things would work out, for instance, for the many British expats living in other EU countries. I guess only time will tell.On the Tuesday morning I got up and got showered to go to the airport in good time and thought I should just give my hair a burst of hairspray to try to maintain some sense of \"polish\" (ha - me?) for when I got to the other end. I grabbed a big can of hairspray that I had picked up at home - and proceeded to spray bright blue shaving cream all over myself and the bedspread. Bloody hell - I must have picked up my son's shaving cream by mistake. Cue a mad rush to get washed and showered again and dash over to the airport for my flight!Once again I travelled with a group of people travelling solo and was not disappointed. There are always a couple of people who you maybe don't gel with but the majority are always, if not fun to be with, at least interesting. Our tour guide Paula was an absolute gem. Not sure I could do that job personally as some people are just downright pains in the you-know-what, but she didn't let it phase her and she turned out to be a wonderful (and very thoughtful) person.On day two idiot-here spent too long in the Caribbean sun lolling in the sea and got burnt, which meant staying out of the sun for the remainder of the holiday. That'll learn ya! Or maybe not. It seems to be par for the course for me every time. Will I ever learn?We got to visit a Lucian rain forest and were entertained by a lovely lady called \"Mama\" who showed us some of the older remedies and traditional \"cures\", which I find fascinating.\"Mama\"I also got \"bullied\" by K to sign up for the helicopter tour and zip lining!!!!  I can't believe it.  I really didn't fancy the helicopter tour - or should I say I don't mind the idea of a helicopter ride as long as it doesn't take off! On top of that, I guess I was expecting a bloody Chinook that would seat 20 to 30 people so you can imagine how I felt when I saw the six-seater waiting for us! Yikes!  I have to say though that the ride was very smooth (thank God) and we did get a bird's eye view of the island, although for obvious reasons it was pretty expensive. Still, I guess you have to do it once in your life.The Pitons seen from the helicopterAs I said, mad K also bullied me into zip lining. I can't believe I let her do that to me. The night before I didn't sleep a wink as I had visions of throwing myself off something resembling the Empire State Building but it turned out to be nothing like that. When we got to the rain forest they made us put hair nets under our crash helmets to avoid anyone's hair getting tangled up in the zip line and effectively scalping them! Nice thought eh. So to be honest, when we went up in the gondola we actually looked more like flying dinner ladies than intrepid she-warriers. We were well harnessed up and the two young women leading the group did an excellent job. We went up to 1,200 feet and (I believe) the total zip was just over a kilometre long, spread out over eight zips - I'm not sure really as I had my eyes closed for the first three zips! But you know, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be and I ended up actually enjoying it. In fact, I think I would do that again rather than the helicopter ride, to be honest. Marigot Bay - where Dr. Doolittle was filmedSo all in all, yet again a lovely way to spend a vacation. The food was pretty good, if expensive, the island is beautiful and the people very friendly. On top of that I met some interesting and fun people, a couple of whom I think I will stay in touch with, as has been my experience on previous trips. So now I've got to knuckle down and get back to work - and dream of the next place I want to visit. You know, my bucket list of places to visit keeps getting longer with every trip I do - funny that.I spent a total of 35 hours start to finish getting back home (including a rather long layover in London) but hey, that's the way the cookie crumbles if you want to go on these far-flung holidays."},

And to think I dithered about \"shall I/shan't I?\" for so long and in the end all I had to do was start writing.I think I was a little bit intimidated by the thought of actually using blogging software since I am not particularly techno minded, but I have to admit blogger has been really easy to use, except for the occasional upside down or sideways photos.

{"title": "Food for thought", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2016", "text": "As I was on the bus going home on Friday night a young man got on at the station with his McDonald's takeaway and sat right next to me on the back seat, squashing me up against the window. I'm guessing he had already eaten the hamburger as he promptly stuffed a load of paper behind his seat and proceeded to devour his chips. Now he was quite a big lad so by the time he had spread his enormous thighs out in both directions and made his puffa jacket comfortable I was well and truly squashed in the corner. So now he is filling his face with chips, smacking his lips and occasionally burping out loud in my direction - and all the while I am getting madder and madder.When he had finally finished he wiped his hands back and forth across his jeans, at the same time managing to wipe some of the salt and grease on me too. I'm thinking \"keep your temper, keep your temper\". I'm a very placid person by nature. I mean, if some young kid walks around with his arse hanging out of his pants because he thinks it looks cool I don't have a problem with that. We were all young and stupid once and as long as it doesn't affect me I say go for it. But this young man was starting to really get on my t**ts. On top of that, I guess all the carbohydrates in his meal gave him that post-prandial slump because he spent the next 30 minutes yawning really, really loud, never covering his mouth and basically burping his shit straight into my face. He then proceeded to call his mom and tell her at least ten times that he was indeed on the number 25 bus.  From the way he talked I got to thinking that maybe he wasn't the full quid, to be honest, so all the more reason to just bite my tongue. However, when he finished his packet of chips and shoved that down the side of my seat I had to really debate what I was going to do. I guess the choices were (1) shut up and wimp out, or (2) confront him about it. So I decided I was going to (politely) do something about it, thinking all the while that he could give me a mouth full of abuse or become more threatening (at which point I had decided to just throw his rubbish at him). As it turns out he ended up getting off at my stop so I thought \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" and picked up his rubbish, tapped him on the shoulder and handed it to him saying I thought it would be better for everyone if he found a bin for his rubbish (all the while preparing to duck and weave just in case).Well I guess I caught him completely off guard because he actually turned round and said \"oh merci\" and proceeded to put his rubbish in the bin which was right at hand. One older man gave me the thumbs up and I have to admit I was pretty pleased with myself as I had been mulling it over all the while getting madder and madder and then half expecting to get thumped by his mom who would no doubt be waiting for him at the bus stop. So you see, you never know how things will work out, and hopefully he will be less of a slob next time he gets on the bus.On another note, did anyone see that Stephen Fry documentary that revisited the programme he made ten years ago dealing with his bi-polar? I thought it was firstly very brave of him but secondly very interesting, not least because my ex was invalided out of his job three years ago with bi-polar.Had we known more about it I guess the signs were there for anyone who knew what they were looking for, but of course we didn't. In the manic phases he was capable of staying up for three days or so without sleep, which of course meant that I wasn't allowed to sleep because he would be playing guitar, watching TV really loudly or, one time, cooking a full English breakfast for all of us at 4 a.m. on a school night, then going ape shit when no-one of wanted to eat it. There is also the issue of compulsive spending which again was a very typical trait of my ex. One time he went out (pissed) and ordered a € 40,000 car for himself, which of course I then had to pay for, although that was the only thing that I did insist was written into the divorce papers - that he had to take over all payments relating to his car. (Never mind the fact that he routinely trashed it drunk - at least from now on the problems were all his). In fact, I remember some time ago there was a programme on the lovely Frank Bruno and his issues with bi-polar. His daughter eventually had him sectioned for his own protection and she was explaining that though her dad had earned millions over the years, with his illness he was more than capable of going through the whole lot and being left penniless. In fact, she explained how one time he had flown to New York for the day, bought six suitcases and bought God knows how many identical tracksuits, filling the suitcases and then flown home again. Stephen Fry said pretty much the same thing - his obsession if I remember correctly was ipads and when he was \"manic\" he just had to have another one, despite the fact that he already had several. Of course (as he said) he was fortunate enough to be able to afford this financially but the compulsion was still there all the same.Having seen some of what my ex went through I felt very much for the people on the programme who explained their feelings of never been able to switch off. My ex once likened it to having flash bulbs going off in his brain but thousands of times a minute and not being able to turn them off.Rather pathetically a French colleague of mine, when I explained that he had been invalided out of his job with bi-polar, commented that it was just another one of those \"made-up\" illnesses! I asked her if she would like to live with my husband for a month and see how much sleep she got and then re-assess her judgement. (And to be honest, half of her compatriots seem to have many of the same \"made-up\" illnesses judging by some of the sick leave they account for at work - but I digress!)A few days later there was another programme which talked about a new law which was enacted in the UK in December 2015 regarding \"coercive control\". Basically, if I understood correctly, it means that under the law \"abuse\" can now be prosecuted not only when it is physical but any other form of abuse whereby the abuser effectively seeks to control the victim by coercion.Now overwhelmingly the numbers of victims are female, although there are of course many cases of female on male abuse, although they are in the minority. But since men are usually stronger than women, physical abuse is most often carried out by men - or at least that is my experience.This programme explained that under the new law, controlling behaviour such as as cutting people off from family and friends, controlling their access to money, deciding who they could see or speak to would now constitute possible cause for prosecution. While I tried for the longest time to help my ex, particularly once we realized he had this problem, his behaviour really was the ultimate in controlling or \"coercive control\". For instance, he would hide my handbag (which had my car keys, etc. in it) making me have to scramble just to get to work. Then when I made sure I had hidden my handbag somewhere else he would lock the bedroom door so I couldn't get at my clothes, or he would lock me out of the house when I came home from work by leaving the key in the door. I once took all the keys to one particular door so that he could no longer lock me out so what did he do? He took a different key and jammed that in the lock so I couldn't get my own key in the door. He also once locked me outside in my nightie at midnight for an hour in the month of February - how the hell do you fight that!A colleague and indeed family told me to move and make sure he didn't have my new address, but you know, you can't run from these people, you have to stand and fight. He knew where I worked and could and would follow me home if I had done that so there really is no choice but to stand your ground.I had wanted a divorce for many years but with him running up debts (that under French law I would also ultimately be responsible for) and trying to function on very little sleep, I wasn't in a position to even try to get my divorce, knowing that he would make my life extremely difficult (if not dangerous) and fight me for the kids.I admit I started drinking way too much and I'm not proud of it, but when you are so beaten down you just want some kind of anaesthetic to \"make it all go away\". Of course it doesn't go away but that doesn't stop you trying.And yet I was one of the lucky ones, as I have a strong character, a supportive family and employer and a good job. Heaven alone knows how those who don't have all that manage, if indeed they do. I never hid what was going on either thinking that the shame is on him not me, but even so it was incredibly difficult to get through - in fact I don't know how I did get through it, truth be told.Eventually he buggered off with some tart he met in the scummy bar in town and I could only think \"hallelujah\", although actually that was one of the hardest times because the idiot and the tart behaved like two overgrown schoolkids and would have a spat about once a month, at which point the idiot would move back in on the grounds that \"it's still my home\". That was pure hell I can tell you.Although I had called the police on him several times because of his violence, I always held back from making a formal complaint because as an American he needed a carte de séjour (green card) for France and I was afraid he would get kicked out of both his job and the county if he had a criminal conviction. What eventually did it for me though was when I came home one evening and he (having drunk 16 beers that day and started on the whiskey) claimed I had \"stolen\" his whiskey bottle because he couldn't find it (my youngest eventually found it stuffed down the sofa). That spiralled into a full-blown row and he pinned me to the bed by sitting on my chest and threatened me with his (now found) whiskey bottle, saying \"I can kill you and I don't mind doing the time for it\". At that point I knew enough was enough, so I shot off to the hospital to get a doctor's report and then on to the police station to file a complaint.He was eventually convicted of domestic assault and should (in reality) have done prison time, after taking into account his various drink-drive convictions. Somehow though he slipped through the cracks and never did go to prison.And eventually the divorce came through, I bought him out of the house and he has buggered off back to the States and is now living with some poor, unsuspecting sod over there.Why am I writing all this down? I guess because I want to get it out of my mind, on to paper and be done with it. There are so many, many incidents which, if you haven't lived through them would seem just unbelievable. Like him saying I was having an affair \"because you take too long to do the grocery shopping\", or the fact that I wore my apron to go fetch the mail on Saturday was proof that I was trying to show everyone that I was doing everything in the household! I mean, how do you counter insanity like that?The Stephen Fry documentary made me question whether I should have \"stuck it out\" because of his mental illness, but the second documentary about coercive control showed me just what I had been putting up with all these years and the fact that I had been using his illness to make excuses for him all along. I didn't love him - in fact I hated him - but I felt for so long that I \"should\" stick around because he wasn't well.  But you know what, there is never an acceptable excuse for violence. They don't change. Only inadequate men (or women) have to use violence or coercion, so if you are in that situation, for God's sake don't believe it is your fault or that it will get better - it won't. Get out before it is too late."},
{"title": "Getting rid of stuff", "date": "Thursday 18 February 2016", "text": "I was just reading (yet another) article on decluttering and while most of the articles are repetitive, for me at least getting rid of stuff is such a de-stressor. It's true what they say, getting rid of clutter also frees up your mind. I did read the majority of the ubiquitous Marie Kondo book on decluttering and while it makes sense I personally think she seems nuttier than a fruitcake, although she can't be that daft if she has made good money out of showing people how to fold clothes and declutter. I mean \"you have to thank your stuff for its service and then let it go\"! Maybe it's cultural but it seems a little over the top for me. That being said, I go with the basic premise of what she says.In the last 18 months I had started to (slowly) get rid of some of my stuff. I suppose with my divorce and His Nibs moving out and taking what he wanted I inevitably got left with a bunch of stuff that belonged to him but that neither I (nor seemingly he) had any use for. 30-year-old US-bought video camera the size of a small apartment building anyone? A 30-year-old music recording studio about the size of Pennsylvania? All very nice stuff in its day but positively Jurassic now.Then of course when he upped sticks and buggered off back to the States last June abandoning his three-bedroom rented farmhouse guess where the \"stuff\" went, on the premise that my youngest son might want said \"stuff\" some day?  If you ask me it was a good excuse to just lock the front door and leave it to the idiots left behind to clear up. Of course, all the stuff that didn't get taken to the tip was then stored in my rather large basement. My youngest did eventually move into a one-bedroom flat with his girlfriend last November and did indeed take whatever he wanted of his dad's, but of course that leaves all the other stuff still in my basement.That's not to say I don't have my own junk of course - I do - particularly given that my home is relatively large and of course having a large basement what do you do - you fill it with stuff. So the next massive job on the horizon is to get rid of more stuff before it becomes necessary to do so. I would find it very stressful to try to do something like that in a short amount of time, so I really want to get on with doing this slowly while there is no rush. I have some lovely stuff too of course and the main thing has to be finding a good home for that. I have offered stuff to friends and family and put stuff on Freecycle. I will also try a couple of vide-greniers (car boots to all  intents and purposes) this year and what doesn't get sold will go straight to the charity shops.The strange thing is, while you think you will miss all this stuff, once it is gone, for me at least, it is a case of out of sight, out of mind, and a feeling as though a great weight has been lifted. So now I guess all I need is one of these:"},
{"title": "Saving €100 - or not!", "date": "Tuesday 16 February 2016", "text": "The traffic on Thursday to get to work was just awful (for a change)). We have to go through a motorway toll and the border of course to get to work, and usually it is the border where the tail-back occurs, but not this time. My heart just sank when I saw \"traffic jam 7 km\" flashing overhead. It turned out it was the toll that was the cause of it - or should I say the volume of traffic at the toll. There must be eight different booths you can go through but for some reason the number of vehicles was horrendous on Thursday morning. Once we got to the border it was fine though. I can't figure it out so I guess you just have to go with the flow.Then on the bus from the border I had the \"good\" fortune to end up sitting next to someone who had brought his breakfast to eat on the bus. I have to admit this still shocks me as (I'm pretty sure) eating is not allowed on the bus in the UK. I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure that still applies. It probably goes back to the days of discarded fish and chip newspaper wrapping being strewn around willy-nilly. Not that Swiss buses are dirty though - quite the opposite in fact - but I still can't get used to the idea of somebody ploughing through their breakfast on the bus. Add to that I'm pretty sure it was tuna and egg mayonnaise sandwich so pardon me while I throw up.  Yuck.On Friday we had a helluva snow storm, I mean, it was really bucketing down so as I had finished my work my boss told me to leave early. Now the journey to and from work is bad enough under normal circumstances but with the snow and the arrival of the next \"zone\" of skiers/holiday-makers, traffic was expected to be pretty rough, and it didn't disappoint. The good thing, I suppose, is that since the weather was so rough people had to drive more carefully. That being said, there was an accident right next to me when I finally made it into my little town, which involved some poor bugger on a driving lesson - not that he was the cause of the accident. A white truck behind him couldn't stop and ended up causing a three-car fender bender, but luckily no-one was hurt and (even more luckily) I wasn't caught up in it!Then on Saturday, after getting the shopping in, I decided to take a couple of strimmers/weed-whackers down to our local DIY store to see if I could get them overhauled. My ex had two of them (what the hell for I don't know as he didn't have a garden and couldn't be buggered to use them on the five rose bushes that he did have). Anyway, I knew these cost over €250 each as he never bought anything cheap (and never looked after anything either but that's by the way), so I thought if I could get them overhauled I might be able to sell them with spring on the way as they are both too heavy for me. Unfortunately, they had been so neglected that they would easily have cost over €100 each to repair so frankly I thought it just wasn't worth the time and effort. Then I had the bright idea to put them on Freecycle to see if anyone had the skill and/or the inclination to repair them. But then, an even bigger inspiration - why not just take them to the tip, let the guys there know that they were still repairable and do without the hassle of getting rid of them on Freecycle. It really galls me to \"throw away\" this kind of stuff since they were bought when the ex still lived at home so effectively I paid for them but you know what, life's too short so now I have dropped them off at the tip and I guess someone might be able to get some use out of them. On top of that it's a saving in time and effort for me. Out of sight out of mind, as they say.Fat Fighters wasn't wonderful on Wednesday but as I had just come back from Wales and had made no effort to follow \"the Plan\" while I was there I was surprised to actually have lost a few hundred grams rather than put any on. We shall see what tomorrow holds I guess.On Saturday it was again bucketing down and as I wandered over to the market I saw and old lady struggling with what really was just a bunch of metal spikes that were trying to pass for an umbrella. I don't know what came over me but I walked over to her and offered her my umbrella, on the grounds that I had another three in my car (all of which I inherited from my ex of course). Well you would have thought I had given her the world, she was so thrilled. She then insisted on inviting me for coffee in the little café opposite and promptly told the world and his uncle what I had done. I was cringing with embarrassment by that time, of course, but I got a big kiss on the cheek from her and a promise to invite me for coffee next time she sees me. It's funny how little it can take to make someone's day isn't it?"},
{"title": "I had forgotten how pretty Wales is!", "date": "Tuesday 9 February 2016", "text": "While going to the funeral of a loved one is never a happy time of course, I have to admit how good it was to see North Wales again after - oh it must be almost 30 years! I can't believe it. I know I went when I was pregnant with my oldest and he will be 29 this year but I hadn't realized exactly how long ago it was, and just how pretty it is. Of course the weather was dreadful but - hey - you don't go to Wales for the weather and there is a reason it's so green.Luckily I was able to get on a flight to Liverpool at short notice and my nephew, who lives just 15 minutes from the airport, was able to meet me and drag me round the rail system. For someone who has travelled a lot, I hold my hand up to being pretty useless when it comes to trains in whichever country!My brother lives in Conwy and the view as we crossed the bridge of the castle and Conwy quai was just stunning.ConwyLater that day my older sister and her family arrived. We had a few emotional moments but all in all we held it together pretty well I thought. In order to leave my brother and his family in peace for a while, we then made our way to our B & B in Llandudno, and again I was amazed at how pretty it is.LlandudnoMy gran and my uncle owned boarding houses in Betws-y-Coed and, coming from Birmingham, I understand now why I always spent my summer holidays in either Betws or Conwy.BetwsOur B & B in Llandudno was very nice, although having to lug my suitcase up three floors (no lift you see) I realized, yet again, how unfit I am.  But the owners were very friendly and the full English breakfast an absolute treat - Weight Watchers be damned! Later that night we went out to dinner in a local restaurant, which had formerly found fame as a theatre - what a lovely place to have dinner.And I have to say, compared to prices over here, it felt like they were virtually giving the food away - and again it was of excellent quality!  After we decided to take a walk along Llandudno's promenade. We held up for about an hour but I think the prospect of losing our noses to frostbite finally got the better of us.Of course the next day we had the funeral. My brother had chosen very beautiful music (\"oh mio babbino caro\" - not sure of the spelling - and a lovely Maori song - which was also very beautiful). And while it was for all the wrong reasons, it was lovely to see how many friends and relatives had made the trip up to North Wales to pay their respects - some of whom I hadn't seen for 30 or 40 years. A fitting tribute to a lovely lady.Next day I had to head back to Liverpool for my flight back to Geneva. I wasn't too thrilled about flying in such windy weather but I have to admit it went well and I made it back late in the evening. It's strange how life can turn on a dime though - one minute all is well with the world and the next - well - all is no longer well!"},
{"title": "Another weekend come and gone", "date": "Tuesday 2 February 2016", "text": "Well my visitor Brian arrived from England on Friday night. Traffic getting home was awful and then I finally cottoned on that spring break is upon us in certain parts of France and the skiers are starting to arrive. For the schools they have three separate \"zones\" and each zone gets a different two-week break, hence we have the majority of our tourists arriving over the next six weeks. I guess that is good news for the resorts, who have finally had some snow, while for us it isn't too bad as long as we remember to take the back roads at the weekends and avoid the tailbacks on the motorways.We had dinner Friday night with a friend in the one and only restaurant in the village. This restaurant changed hands a few years ago and I have to say the quality has improved greatly. Dinner was good and the view from the restaurant is just stunning. Then on Saturday I had planned to take Brian to a hot springs around 150 km from here. By taking the \"north\" side of Lake Geneva you get the most amazing view as the motorway snakes up the mountain for a spectacular shot of the lake and Montreux taken from near Vevey (where Charlie Chaplin made his home). They have a little motorway cafe at the highest point so we stopped and ate there to take in the view. Considering it was a motorway cafe the food was bloody expensive (but good), so I guess in reality we were actually paying for the view more than anything.View from Vevey over MontreuxAnother half an hour and we were at the hot springs of Lavey les Bains.  I had discovered this place some years ago after a friend recommended it. In fact, when my family came out one New Year's we spent the evening of the 31st at the springs and then drove back along the south side of the lake, stopping in Evian for a drink and a wander before heading home.  It was actually one of my favourite New Year's ever, as it had turned cold and we all looked like sea monsters swimming through the mist created by the hot springs.Lavey les BainsThe thing is, you can spend a few hours in there relaxing and getting pummeled by the strong water jets and you end up feeling battered, bruised and very wobbly but supremely relaxed afterwards. I felt like I had been doing Jane Fonda's workout over and over again when in fact I had just been slouching around in the water for three hours.After that it was back home and dinner in our local town, again a real treat.The next day we weren't so lucky with the weather but since Brian wanted to go back to Annecy I was happy to oblige, despite the fact that it was pouring down and the wind was howling. I suppose on the positive side, Annecy doesn't get so crowded when the weather is bad!The old prison in the old town of AnnecyWe spent a few hours wandering round Annecy, stopping for a coffee (oh and a piece of cheesecake for me - Weight Watchers be damned for this week) before heading back home for a cup of tea and a chat and then heading back to the airport.We certainly managed to squeeze an awful lot into one short weekend but I know Brian enjoyed it and it was good for me to do something \"different\" from my normal weekend routine.Then it was back to sewing club number 1 last night, which is always nice, more so for the chatting than the sewing but hey, that's life.  I will miss Fat Fighters weigh-in this week as I am off to the UK tomorrow for my sister-in-law's funeral.  A flying visit - arrive in Wales on Wednesday and back to France on Friday.  Sad times."},
{"title": "More this and that", "date": "Thursday 28 January 2016", "text": "Don't forget to put your handbrake on! On Tuesday night I caught the bus from work back to the border to pick up my car at the Park and Ride. When I got to my car, I realized that the car behind me had parked literally up against my rear bumper. I took a photo on my phone and decided to pull my car forward to see if any damage had been done. So I pulled my car forward a few feet, put the handbrake on and immediately the car behind slammed into my car again. It was then that I realized that they must have forgotten to put their handbrake on and it was only my car that was stopping it from rolling forward. I had a course that night in Cluses (about an hour's drive away) and in any case I wasn't going to hang around until whatever time the other driver showed up, particularly as there was no damage to my car. As I pulled out of my parking spot I pulled over to put my seatbelt on and heard a terrific thud; when I looked round said car had rolled out of its spot, picked up speed and slammed straight into a Renault Espace, pushing it into the wall in front and had now come to a complete stop blocking one of the lanes round the parking lot (although there was another exit route). Bloody hell! Luckily there was no-one in the car's path. I didn't really know what to do so I buzzed the parking attendant on my way out and left my name with him just in case. On the way home I was, I suppose, feeling a bit superior thinking how I would never do something so stupid when a car on the motorway pulled in front of me and put his hazards on - I had forgotten to put my headlights on! What an idiot I am. But then, when you are in a lit up parking lot I suppose it is easy not to notice that you haven't got your headlights on - just like it might be easy to forget to put your handbrake on when you are in a hurry. I hope there wasn't too much damage to either car though.And talking of parking lots, a friend of mine had an appointment for medical treatment in Geneva last week, so she drove to the parking lot early afternoon in order to hop on the bus to go into town. Out of the blue a \"swarthy\" looking lady carrying a map tapped on her driver's window. Stupidly (her words, not mine) she rolled the window down, and at that point two \"swarthy\" looking men appeared at the passenger side, one jumped into her car and grabbed her handbag, which was on the passenger seat. When she yelled at him to get out, the two men held her down while they took her bag - which contained her wallet, her passport, her driving licence ..... you get the picture. Understandably she was very upset and frightened - as would I be - knowing that while these b@@@@stards were probably only interested in the money, they now had her home address (and most likely her house keys as well).Unfortunately (for us) we now have a large influx of Roma gypsies (hence the reference to \"swarthy\") and you can say what you like about tolerance, but they really are *!*!*!*! You see them begging all over town now, with \"begging\" being the least of their antics. I once spotted a woman with a baby in arms begging, only to see the same baby with a different woman the next day. And they can and do become aggressive. Again unfortunately, there isn't much the police or anyone else can do about them. A friend told me sometime ago that she always threaded the seatbelt through the handle of her bag when she was driving. I now do the same, or put it in the trunk and keep my doors locked. What a sad state of affairs we are having thrust upon us though.On another note, I have a friend coming over from the UK for the weekend. I met Brian on my first solos trip to Turkey a few years ago and we have remained in touch. When I sent him a message not to worry about snow gear as we have warm weather and sunshine he replied that he was disappointed as he had actually been looking forward to snow (me not so much!). It reminded me of the time many years ago when I was going to drive into town to go shopping after it had just snowed. My friend asked if she could come with me so we set about struggling to put snow chains on. Now in the advertising for snow chains at that time they always showed some bird in a pink sweater and manicured nails putting the bloody things on in about 10 minutes.The reality, however, was that after struggling for about an hour, we looked more like this (although maybe not as skinny):But get the bloody things on we did, only to turn a corner out of our housing plan and discover that the roads had been ploughed and gritted and there was no more snow! Never again I tell you, if I have to put chains on I ain't going.And finally, at Fat Fighters on Wednesday night, disappointment as I had lost nothing at all. Bugger it. I was disappointed because I felt I had actually been pretty good about following the programme and exercising ..... but apparently my body didn't agree. Since I consider myself to be pretty \"hormonal\", I noted the date and will watch out to see if there is a monthly pattern. Still, I'm not too discouraged. I will just have to try to get it down next time I go, which will be in two weeks' time as I am back to the UK next week for a funeral. Time will tell I guess."},
{"title": "Weigh in", "date": "Friday 22 January 2016", "text": "Well Wednesday was my second day at Fat Fighters and my first weigh-in.  I have to admit I wasn't too optimistic as although I had followed the programme pretty well I didn't feel as though I had lost any weight.  On top of that I tend to yo-yo with my weight quite substantially, which I put down to hormones/fluid retention for the most part.  I mean, I can go up or down 2-3 lbs in a couple of days, so I guess the moral of that story is \"do as the nice lady said and don't weigh yourself every day\"! Gotta get out of that habit.  So all-in-all I wasn't too optimistic, and when I got on the scales I read a loss of about 200g. Beeerrrrk!  As you can imagine I was therefore delighted when she said 1kg 200g!  I had misread my starting weight so had actually lost a decent amount (just over 2.6 lb). Wow. I am a now officially a happy bunny.I know it's quite normal to lose a fair amount the first week and then have the weight loss taper off afterwards but in any case I was pretty pleased with my first results.  And the programme was actually quite easy to follow since I am only cooking for myself at home and can make (or not make) whatever I feel like. In fact, the WW recipe for chicken with pak choi was pretty nice, so I will definitely make that again.Wearing my pedometre also brought home to me just how sedentary I am.  Even with hopping off the bus on the Mont Blanc bridge and walking along the lake for the half hour it takes to get to work, I am still not achieving 10,000 steps a day.  More like 7,000 if I leg it to work or walk into town at lunch time and obviously less when I don't.  Hopefully, with the weather again scheduled to be good next week I can get more exercise in. I did actually walk two days and go to the gym two days last week (and of course I always feel wonderful afterwards - all \"bendy\" and relaxed).  It makes you wonder why on earth you just don't keep going right?  Anyway, we will see what next week brings.  I am fully expecting a lower weight loss but if I can just keep it going, by summer I reckon I will be doing pretty well.  And you know what, the ladies at Fat Fighters are actually proof that the programme really does work if you follow it. Who wudda thunk!"},
{"title": "RIP my lovely sister-in-law", "date": "Thursday 21 January 2016", "text": "What a terrible shock we all had this week.  My lovely sister-in-law, Brenda, died totally unexpectedly on Tuesday.  We are all in shock, as she hadn't been ill and was, seemingly, in good health.  From what I can gather, she was taken ill while preparing dinner on Monday night with what turned out to be a stroke.  Luckily my brother was there with her and was able to get help immediately.  Unfortunately she then had a second, massive stroke on Tuesday morning and my brother was told that she wasn't going to make it.  Their sons were just able to make it to North Wales to be with her before the end, for which I thank God and hope that she realized they were all with her. She died without regaining consciousness on Tuesday evening.To say we are all in shock is really an understatement.  She was 69 and, like I said, seemingly in good health.Brenda and Phil in their younger daysBren had been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  My brother is 17 years older than me so he and Brenda were married while I was still very young.  I remember watching Bewitched as a child and thinking that Brenda looked so much like \"Samantha\" (Elizabeth Montgomery), except that she was dark and \"Samantha\" was blonde.She and my brother had raised their sons and, having both retired, were starting to travel and enjoy life to the full.  I guess that's why it seems so sad.  Some people seem to spend their lives in front of the TV watching actors living their fake lives, not realizing that life is there to be lived, not absorbed off the TV.I had another friend whose mom lived to be 101, still living on her own in central London. My friend really did live life to the full - in fact I have no idea where she got all her energy from.  But then this friend developed cancer and died also at the age of 69.  I always felt like she was \"cheated\" because she was someone who seized life with both hands and her \"good\" genes just didn't pan out.I know life isn't fair and never will be, so all I can say is carpe diem, or seize the day. You never know what tomorrow holds.  RIP Bren."},
{"title": "Winter drawers on!", "date": "Tuesday 19 January 2016", "text": "Well it has finally arrived - winter that is.  Actually we had about five inches of snow once in November, I think it was, but that melted overnight and we have had nothing but sunshine since then. Even the ski resorts were in trouble over Christmas as there was no snow but it seems that has now finally changed.  We got snow on Saturday and Sunday and then again last night with some sunshine in between flurries  I really don't like driving on the snow but once I'm over the first day I just get on with it.  And to be fair, the French really do maintain the roads well in winter.  I guess they have to as so much of the local economy depends on winter tourism and skiing.The view from my bedroom windowThis morning was pretty grim though.  Almost three hours to get to work, which is pretty weird because again the roads were ok but traffic was awful, lining up to get through customs.  I was so glad to finally make it to the border where I could hop on the bus, hunker down with a good book and leave everything else to the bus driver.  I don't mind the winter really (especially when it starts so late like it has this year) and I don't even mind the cold (prefer it to sweltering heat anyway) but I don't like the commute much in the snow.  In fact, a car passed me today on the motorway and I swear the car behind him was only about three metres from his rear bumper.  Madness.Geneva of course is pretty all year round but, like many places, particularly pretty in the snow.The view from my office on to the lakeIt's when I see views like these I'm reminded how lucky I am really.  Forget all the whingeing about wanting to retire (well I still want to retire of course but .....).  If I can blank out the thought of the journey home tonight it really is a winter wonderland."},
{"title": "Fat Fighters", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2016", "text": "Well last night was my first night at the local Fat Fighters meeting.  I pretty much knew what to expect as maaaaaany years ago, before I was married even, I went along to a WW meeting in Geneva.  I only had a couple of kilos to lose, truth be told - oh how I wish that were the case now. Anyway, down to the nitty gritty.  Fully dressed (of course) and with my boots on I weighed in at 81.1 kg (180 lb - yikes, it sounds even worse like that - or 12.7 stones according to Mr. Google). (Frankly I don't like any of those numbers much but I guess I have to go with the kg as that is what we will be working with here.)  She asked me what I would like to weigh and I told her I was comfortable at about 65 kg so we are looking to lose about 15 kg.Then I went and sat in on the cheerleading meeting, all the while thinking \"I'm never gonna stick this out for an hour\"!  But it turns out it was only 30 minutes so I guess anyone can sit still that long. After the meeting the other \"newbie\" and I - she actually gasped out loud when she was weighed - it was really funny - stuck around so that Chief Cheerleader could explain the points system to us.  I suppose I am being fascetious as the ladies were very nice but I have to admit I do feel like I was having to sit on the Naughty Stool because of letting myself go.  Still, the system doesn't seem that difficult really.  The only problem I have so far discovered is that having downloaded the French WW app onto my phone, it doesn't seem to recognize Swiss WW products, which is a bit weird.  But then again, it is only Day 1 (boy oh boy I hope I've lost 2 kg by tomorrow) so I have to give it time.I see that in among all the other stuff they were selling \"fitbits\", which I guess are pedometres, as Fat Fighters want to encourage you to \"get active\".  I already have a pedometre which I have started using again and to be honest it is quite shocking how little I actually move.So, thinking \"in for a penny, in for a pound\", I signed up on Ilona's blog with others who wanted to take the challenge of walking 1,000 miles in 2016.  I must be mad.  According to the Chief Cheerleader at Fat Fighters anything under 5,000 steps a day is considered \"sedentary\" (so that would be me), above that \"average\" and the real aim should be 10,000 steps a day.  Using my pedometre I am averaging only 6,000 steps a day so I guess I really have to up the ante.  Then, because on Ilona's blog they are talking about \"miles\" walked in 2016, I reckoned I had to convert my steps walked from km back into miles.  Not easy.  I don't use an app on my phone to calculate distance because, crossing the border from France into Switzerland every day I will be hit by data-roaming charges.  So I realized I had to simply use my pedometre.  First off, measure your stride - turns out to be only 40 cm (otherwise known as the short, fat, hairy leg syndrome).  Then calculate the number of steps taken daily, multiply by the length of my stride and convert those km back to miles.  (Honestly, I almost gave up there and then). But, I had to admit to feeling smugly superior when I worked out I was hitting about 20 miles a day! Of course my bubble soon burst when I realized I had put the decimal point in the wrong place and in reality was back in the \"mobile blob\" category.  Oh well, I guess I will have to go with what I've got and see what happens this week.  Fingers crossed."},
{"title": "This and that - oh and Fat Fighters", "date": "Tuesday 12 January 2016", "text": "It's a strange kind of atmosphere at work at the moment.  All the hustle and bustle of Christmas is over and work has not really started gearing up yet - kind of the lull before the storm I guess, although frankly I prefer it when I am busy.A funny thing happened on the bus on the way home yesterday.  As I have written before I drive to the Franco/Swiss border every day and then catch a bus for the 40-odd minute ride across Geneva. Since I am an avid reader I use this time to get quite a bit of reading in during the day.  You know, wedge yourself in at the back where you couldn't give up your seat for little old ladies even if you wanted to and Bob's your uncle.  Anyway, last night an older Chinese man got on at the station and ended up sitting next to me.  He absolutely reeked of garlic .... but I digress.  He looked over at my book and when he saw that I was reading in English he said \"I see you on here most days reading. In China we have a saying that you are chasing time\".  Now what the heck are you supposed to reply to that?  I took it to mean that I was \"chasing time in my busy life to find time to read\".  Not sure exactly.  So I just said \"well I am a prisoner of this time so I may as well use it wisely\".  (Can you feel a little \"Confucius says\" coming in to this conversation?)  He wasn't at all offensive (except for the garlic) and when he got off the bus my friend leaned over and said \"I think you're in there\".  But to be honest, I'm not sure if I understood what he was talking about or he understood what I was talking about - I guess we may find out in chapter two next time I bump into him.Another thing that made me laugh today was a story carried by that bastion of truth in journalism, the Daily Mail.  They had run a similar item previously but their \"journalism\" never ceases to amaze me. It was a story on reports of how fearless Kim Jong Whatsisname had supposedly climbed up a mountain almost 3,000 metres high recently. While I have no doubt that he did indeed succeed, I must admit whenever I go up into the mountains round here I have a rather different style of clothes. It could just be that I'm a scaredy cat but what do you think?  Am I being overcautious?  Time to break out the brand new fearless me do you think?And moving seamlessly on to other news, when I went to see my doctor six months ago it turns out that all of a sudden I had developed high cholesterol.  They did another test just before Christmas and it was still the same so she asked me if I had been under stress recently.  Hallooooo, doesn't everyone's ex just bugger off and leave his ex-wife and kids to sort out 26 years' worth of accumulated crap, empty a three-bedroomed farmhouse and get rid of the dog?  No? So it must just be me then. She also mentioned that I seemed to have put on quite a bit of weight lately and that that could also be the cause of my relatively sudden high cholesterol reading.  No kidding.  I think what probably gave the game away is that I am now at the exact weight I was when I gave birth to my second son - so the equivalent of 9-months' pregnant then.  Great.  Oh boy, time to do something about it I suspect, although in truth I had been feeling pretty uncomfortable for some time, especially this summer with the unseasonally hot weather.  So (drum roll please) I decided \"oh to hell with it\" and have signed up for Weight Watchers (affectionately known as Fat Fighters).  Actually I would have liked to go to Slimming World, but they don't have that here in France so Fat Fighters it is.  I have enrolled and will go to my first meeting tomorrow evening.  I suspect/hope it will be easier this time round (famous last words) since my kids have left home and I don't have to cook for anybody except myself.  So wish me luck and watch this space.  And now I'm off to shave my legs before the weigh-in."},

So I guess it is obvious why so many Swiss residents do their shopping over our side of the border! I also got to meet up with a friend of long-standing who had just come out of hospital and discovered a lovely new (to me) restaurant on \"her\" side of Lake Geneva.  On the way out we passed a realtor and I nearly fainted when I saw the prices over that side.  Crikey, because of the proximity to the international organizations, the banks and the big multinationals I would say prices are about two-thirds higher than over \"my\" side (i.e. south) of the lake.  What's more, prices were hit in the recession and have actually come down.  Jesus H. I looked at a couple of apartments (2, maybe 3 bedrooms) and they can run around €500-600,000 ($500-600,000)!  It's no wonder rents are high in Geneva.  And of course, I am still talking about France. To buy that same apartment in Geneva would set you back around CHF 1,500,000 ($1,600,000)!!!!!  I kid you not!  Prices over my side of the lake are considerably lower, although still not cheap by anybody's standards.  I guess I won't be moving anytime soon then (not that I want to anyway - I love it where I live).I didn't get to see my boys on Christmas Day, which was fine by me actually, because I hate having to do something just because it is a particular day, but they all came over on 29th December and it was really nice.  I happened to be sorting out old photos before they came and they had great fun looking through them (as you do) and it was lovely to be with them.  I only saw OH before Christmas as he was trying to be with his children, although it wasn't possible for him to see all of them unfortunately.  Something he said was quite interesting though.  He went to midnight mass in his local village on Christmas Eve and outside the small church there were two armed police officers. He happened to look up and in some kind of scaffolding/crane just next to the church and normally hidden from view was another police officer, also armed.  How sad is it that we have to have armed police at our churches now.New Year's Eve I spent quite happily on my own.  I usually like to stay up till 1 a.m. our time to watch the fireworks in the UK but didn't quite make it this time.  I think I was snoring my head off at 11.30!  But all in all it was a lovely break.So now it's back to work and time to take down the Christmas tree (I didn't get round to it before). Apparently the snow is on its way and we will have to knuckle down till the end of winter.  But, if winter only starts in January I can hardly complain - it's just when it drags on for months and months that it gets me down.  So on that note, I wish you all a happy and healthy new year.  Till the next time."},

Thankfully (for me), Geneva is French-speaking, as my German is \"iffy\" to say the least. But, with Swiss-German being so prominent, there are a lot of Germanic names, with lots of \"zeit\", \"stein\", \"hoch\", etc. in them.Recently my company held a large meeting with different \"interests\" being represented from all over the world.  One particular European company had recently changed its representative, and we were trying to find the name of the new person representing them so that the Chairman could have the name available, if necessary.  I started looking through lists and had to stifle the giggles. There was one person whose Germanic-sounding name - had I had to read it out loud - I would have pronounced as \"horse-shite\".  My colleague took one look at the name and immediately came up with \"oh shite\"! I don't know what we would have done if this had turned out to be the new rep - luckily for us, it wasn't him.  Phew.In a similar vein, many years ago I was on a training course in Geneva when I got talking to a woman who worked as an interpreter.  She told me that during meetings dealing with the Palestinian situation, the Palestinian peoples were referred to as the Palestinian population of the West Bank - forgive me if I got that wrong but it was quite some time ago.  Anyway, she explained that during simultaneous interpretation you simply don't have the time to refer to the \"Palestinian population of the West Bank\", so the interpreters had to shorten it to \"West Bankers\".  She was in the interpreters' both one day when one of her colleagues came out with the supreme Malapropism of \"Best Wankers\" - she said they didn't know where to put themselves but had to forge on and hope no-one noticed!And finally, as my mom is Welsh I spent most of my summers up in Betws-y-Coed with family, and it was fascinating (to me at least) to see things such as signs written out bilingually in English and Welsh.  Of course not everyone speaks Welsh so when information was available in English and they needed an official translation into Welsh the text would have to be sent off to the translation department.  The sign below made the news some years ago and certainly gave me a chuckle.The English text is self-evident.  The Welsh, however, apparently reads \"I am not in the office at the moment ....\".  Ha - lovely.  So it's not just me then!"},

{"title": "Why you should always wear your Sunday best!", "date": "Wednesday 2 December 2015", "text": "As I mentioned in a previous post, from a fairly young age my dad suffered from heart problems, having several heart attacks, numerous scares and two by-pass surgeries.  Indeed, as a young girl I remember lying in bed at night listening for the creak of the floorboards and just praying it wasn't mom running downstairs to call the ambulance again.  A horrible time for all of us of course but, in retrospect, it was funny on occasion too. Now while I know I probably shouldn't be talking about my dad's underwear here it is central to the story.  Dad - and most men of his generation I guess - wore boxer shorts, for comfort and probably because there wasn't much by way of choice anyway.  One particular day when he was at work, the elastic around the waistband of his boxers and the actual material separated company but the elastic didn't actually break.  So dad, not really knowing what else to do, just pulled the elastic up and put it over his head in order to keep his \"drawers\" from falling down. Well as (bad) luck would have it, that day he was taken ill at work.  They called the ambulance to take him to hospital and called my mom at her place of work to meet the ambulance at the hospital. Several hours later it was determined to be a false alarm and that dad had not suffered another heart attack.  That of course was when mom spotted his boxers in the little cupboard next to his bed.  Well she went somewhat \"ballistic\" - \"oh for God's sake, of all the decent pairs of underpants you have in the drawer you had to wear those!  I swear you do this just to embarrass me sometimes!\"  You get the gist of it. To be honest, I suspect it was mostly relief that he was all right and she was just letting off nervous energy, but poor old dad got it in the neck that day I can tell you.Of course, he made matters worse when he was explaining to her that after they admitted him and the young nurse was trying to undress him as he was lying on the bed, every time she tried to pull his underpants off he sat up!  We all cracked up laughing, but I'm pretty sure he had to dodge a few expletives from mom all the same.  Ahhh tales from another era I think. Picture by Dreamstime"},
{"title": "Organ donation", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2015", "text": "I just recently discovered that in Wales, as from today, people who die will be deemed to have consented to becoming organ donors, unless they have opted out of the scheme. I'm not quite sure of all the modalities of it but (as I understand it), anyone over the age of 18 and who has lived in Wales for at least 12 months will be deemed to have given their prior consent to organ donation unless they have specifically opted out.  From what I understand, in the event of someone's death, if there is no \"opt out\" or if no close relative can be found to \"opt out\" on the deceased person's behalf, then organs can be taken and used for transplant purposes.  While the scheme  currently only applies in Wales, any organs harvested can be made available to suitable recipients anywhere in the UK.And you know what, I think this is a wonderful initiative.  Of course people have every right to opt out for religious or whatever other reasons they may have, and I respect that, but for me personally making the assumption that organs can be taken in the absence of information to the contrary is a wonderful step forward to saving lives.  I know if my sons or someone else I loved were in danger of dying for lack of a donor kidney I would be so grateful to any grieving family who took the courageous and selfless decision to donate their loved one's organs, particularly at such a difficult time.Many years ago I signed an organ donor's card and carried it in my purse.  That must have been over 30 years ago I guess so I am pretty sure that card is now shredded beyond repair somewhere. Which makes me think I must get hold of another one and do the necessary, or at the very least make my wishes known to my family.  Nobody likes thinking of this stuff of course and I'm sure many of us think that as soon as we \"sign up\", we will then be killed and used as a donor.  Just like making a will - \"well if I make a will I'm sure I'm going to snuff it the week after\".  But I for one want to be cremated when I die and want my ashes scattered in the mountains, as I don't want a place where my family need to go to feel sad.  For me the dearly departed are all around us so I don't need to be buried anywhere in order for my family to show respect.Sadly in the last few days rugby great Jonah Lomu died suddenly of complications linked to kidney disease. He was only 40 and left behind two very young sons who now have to grow up without their dad.  Jonah did, I believe, get a kidney transplant but it failed and he died as a result of his illness.  I don't know if another transplant would have been possible for him or even if it would have done any good, but I personally believe that that option should be out there.  To be burying viable organs when our loved ones are dying for want of a transplant is somehow just wrong to me.  Of course I totally respect people's wishes not to be involved with organ donation, but in cases where people don't really have strong views one way or another, I for one praise the Welsh initiative and hope it will prove such a success that it can be rolled out UK-wide, thereby saving lives that otherwise would be lost.RIP Jonah Lomu!"},
{"title": "Say cheese!", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2015", "text": "My dad suffered from heart disease from a pretty young age.  I'm not exactly sure but I think he had his first heart attack around the age of 48, when I was in my early teens.  It was a very traumatic time for all concerned of course, all the more so since he then went on to have a triple by-pass in 1974, at a time when that operation was a really major intervention.  Horrible, horrible time, but thanks to the skill of the surgeon and the hospital staff he survived and even though he subsequently had more heart attacks and another by-pass he lived to the ripe old age of 85.Now all that is just the background to today's post really.  Around the time that he first got sick, it was decided that he should have all his teeth out since bacteria entering the body through the gums can infect the heart and do serious damage.  (To any medical personnel out there, please excuse the ah-hem paraphrasing here, but that is how I understood it).  So dad had to have all his teeth out and in those days false teeth was the only option, there either wasn't the possibility of implants or they were just way beyond his budget.  But dad hated those false teeth and to be honest, they spent more time wrapped in a hanky than in his mouth - and boy did the lack of teeth make him look old when he took them out.Anyway, one day he had been sitting on the sofa when his hanky/teeth fell out of his pocket and ended up down the back of the sofa.  Now we had an adorable mutt - border collie mixed with goodness knows what else - and said dog proceeded to jump up on the sofa and go \"fishing\" down the back of it - only to emerge from its inner depths with the most perfect set of knashers - courtesy of the NHS!  Not the same dog but he ended up something like this:Picture by Melissa HardyNow that really was hilarious!  Another time, dad got up to get ready to go to work and rather than put his teeth in he just grabbed them from the glass on the bathroom window sill where they were twinkling away adding to the posh feel of the bathroom and again put the teeth/hanky into his pocket and set off for work.  The only trouble was, by that time mom had also lost her teeth and had a complete set of matching false teeth twinkling away in the bathroom window.  And - you've guessed it - dad picked up the wrong teeth! Mom was furious as she had to go to work and of course as soon as she tried to put her teeth in they wouldn't fit - because they weren't hers obviously!  So she had to catch the bus into town (about a 30 minute ride) to get to my dad's place of work so they could exchange teeth.Image by PhotobucketI think dad was in the dog house for quite a while after that.  But at least we got a good giggle out of it!  And to be honest, I'm glad we now have the option (albeit a very expensive one) of having implants should we ever lose our teeth.  Running to the loo in the middle of the night to find someone's teeth staring at you in the darkness can do serious damage to an impressionable young mind I can tell you!"},
{"title": "Round Robin letters", "date": "Monday 23 November 2015", "text": "With Christmas nearly upon us I suppose it will soon be open season for the Round Robin letter-writers, in fact I have already received my first!  I used to get quite a few (I suppose being an expat your friends tend to be more widely dispersed) and while I don't get as many as I used to I still hate the bloody things.  I don't know why really, but I sense it is because I just got so sick of all the perfect friends, with the perfect spouses and the perfect kids who excel at everything.  You know the kind \"oh Hyacinth and Hortense are just coming along screamingly with their viola lessons, and Cuthbert's percussion teacher says he is a natural\".  Now don't get me wrong, I understand that if you want to send out a lot of letters to friends and family (particularly at Christmas), in this day and age it is probably a lot easier to write a basic text about what you and your family have been up to, but for goodness sake at least make some attempt to personalize it a bit.  One bland, bog-standard Round Robin letter about the perfect achievements of the perfect family just about does my head in.  I mean, am I the only one who doesn't have perfect kids who excel at everything they do?  I sincerely hope not. I love em to bits anyway but they are normal not over-achieving spawn!  In fact, I'm sure most of the kids mentioned in these letters are also happily far from perfect, it's just that the letter-writer feels somehow obliged to blow all their achievements up beyond recognition.And as for the perfect spouse with the perfect job - well I guess I should just roll over and concede defeat on that one right away.  Anyone who has read any of my previous posts knows where I stand on the \"perfect spouse\" bit - yeah, you got me - he was about as much use as a chocolate teapot but far less interesting.Maybe these letters don't bother other people, or maybe you don't all have perfect (long-distance) acquaintances like I do (you know, the ones you rarely see so you have no way of telling if Hyacinth really knows her viola from a hole in the ground), but just a little cri du coeur - for goodness sake personalize it so that the recipient at least knows you have given them some thought.And on that note, Mrs. Bah-Humbug here will get off her high horse and get back to contemplating Christmas with her less-than-perfect kids!"},
{"title": "Fake Britain", "date": "Friday 20 November 2015", "text": "Has anyone been watching the documentary series Fake Britain?  Along with other programmes like Hugh's War on Waste and Watchdog, I really enjoy this kind of programme.  Love Matt Allwright too, and his war on rogue traders.  I think he seems to have the perfect personality for this kind of programme and (in my opinion anyway) he is very watchable!Anyway, I watched Fake Britain this week and what an eye opener it was, not so much for what they were exposing as fake but the prices some people were (seemingly) willing to pay for the real McCoy. I mean, Customs had seized counterfeit cosmetics with a street value of around £12 million I believe. Some of the items seized were supposedly brand name cosmetics bags - you know Coco Channel, Yves St. Laurent stuff - small make-up pouches containing, say, a mascara, lipstick, some eye shadow, maybe some blusher - and the prices on these pouches, marked as though they were legit, were from £450 to £600!!!!  I mean, even if they were real who on earth pays out that kind of money for a couple of items of make-up?  I just could not get my head around the fact that if these goods hadn't been intercepted some fool might have been tempted to buy them at, say, a knock-off price of around £250 - for a couple of items of cosmetics.  I mean, what's wrong with Boots or Rimmel?  And even if they were legit, would they have been any better than the stuff from Boots, etc. to reflect their retail price?  I don't think so.  It was just amazing.When I was thinking about it, I thought maybe someone might not see anything wrong with paying a few pound for one these \"knock-off\" items - I mean, we all like a bargain right.  But one of the officers explained just why these goods are so dangerous.  The lipstick, for instance, contained paint stripper to make it run smoother!!! And the mascara contained some form of acid-like chemical to stop it from clogging! Can you imagine putting that near your eyes!They then went on to showcase knock-off batteries/chargers, for laptops, for instance. Now I'm not quite sure of all the \"technical\" terms but they said that while all batteries are capable of catching fire, the knock-off versions are so much more likely to catch fire and then proceeded to put several of them \"under stress\" to show the effect.  The last battery they did this to had flames leaping about 3 feet into the air.  The officer then went on to say that this exact scenario had happened a couple of years ago on a flight from Hong Kong to London (just after the flight had landed), and invited viewers to imagine what might have been the outcome if this had happened mid-flight. It really made me think I can tell you.I also got to see Matt in action last night on Watchdog where one of the scams they showed was a call centre purporting to help people find work, when in reality the aim of these scammers was to keep their poor victim on the line for a minimum of 14 minutes in order to rack up phone bills of almost £30 per time.  Just last week I got a message on my answering machine regarding a \"delivery they had pending for me\".  I actually did call the number back and it was some scheme where they wanted to send me a case for my mobile phone.  In fact the call automatically cost €3 to start with plus however long they could keep me on the phone I guess.  Luckily I hung up immediately and don't think I will be returning any calls again, but then it can sometimes be difficult if you are expecting some kind of delivery anyway.And you know, you and I may think we are smart enough not to be taken in by scams - and I'm sure we are for the most part - but very often these people are very practised in what they do and we will probably all fall for it sometimes, however street-smart we may think we are.  Hell, I was robbed by a gypsy in Barcelona right under my nose .... but then they don't come much more \"practised\" than them do they!"},
{"title": "Ups and downs", "date": "Wednesday 18 November 2015", "text": "Well the weather here continues to be amazing - it really has been a wonderful Indian summer - and so it seems strange to me that when I call my family in the UK they are up to their eyeballs in rain, wind and storms.  The latter, frankly, is more what I would be expecting, as it is our weather that really is oddball (although not to last much longer apparently).On Saturday I took myself off grocery shopping for the first time since my son and his girlfriend moved out and it was really weird.  I mean, I have so much foodstuff at home already that I actually didn't need anything, but I do enjoy going to the market.  I only spent a grand total of €5 - wow talk about Mrs. Rich (if you've got it flaunt it is my motto). I think the fruit and veg stallowner wondered what had hit him when I spent so little. After a quick tootle round the supermarket I stopped in at my friend, Stan's, little bar for a coffee, and if it is nearing 1.30 pm when he closes up for his siesta I usually hang around and give him a ride home if he doesn't have his car.  While we were chatting his wife, Martine, pulled in to let him know she was going mushroom \"hunting\", so I jumped at the chance to ask if I could go with her.  I have never been out mushrooming and had always wanted to give it a shot.  Now most people will only tell you where they go mushrooming with the proviso that they get to shoot you afterwards as they will never give away their \"secret\" spots, but Martine said \"sure, let's drop your groceries off at home and we can take my car\".As we left Stan called after her to take care when out mushrooming and not to forget to take a jacket!  Now city-slicker me thought \"how sweet, he wants her to take care and doesn't want her to catch cold\".  So while I had visions of us gracefully strolling through green fields in flowing dresses with our little \"mushroom baskets\" full to the brim, the reality was quite different.  Martine told me to put hiking boots on as although it was dry it would be wet up in the mountains because of the streams.  She then proceeded to put on her bright yellow \"high viz\" jacket, with me thinking \"well that's not going to keep her very warm is it\"! Of course the light bulb moment wasn't long coming - it's hunting season, we were in the woods and we needed to be seen (see what I mean about \"City Slickers\" or as Homer Simpson would say \"dohh\"!).  We did hear gunshot and while I was told later that they are not allowed to hunt on Saturdays they seemed to be ignoring that particular rule so it was better to be safe than sorry.Another thing about being a City Slicker is that I am unfit and know it, so while Martine gradually plodded her way uphill looking for mushrooms, I kept having to pretend I had found something interesting just so I could stop and catch my breath!!!!  In fact, for most of the time, all I could see ahead of me was Martine's backside and high viz jacket - see if you can spot her waaaay ahead!Then of course, another good \"trick\" is to stop and take photos of the mountains.I think she eventually rumbled me and slowed up a bit.  Well we didn't have much luck at all.  I know nothing about mushrooms and Martine wisely says she only picks what she knows well.  I don't know about elsewhere but here in France you can take any mushrooms you find into a pharmacy and they will tell you if they are edible or poisonous or whatever.  They are fascinating though and when our next \"mushroom\" exhibition rolls into town I shall have to go visit.As I mentioned previously, my son and his girlfriend have finally moved into a small place of their own but as I have been working late and not wanting to drive up those mountain roads in the dark, I waited until Sunday to drive up for my first visit, and it is lovely.  Only one bedroom but they don't need any more for the time being.  It has already served them well as my boys' band were playing in a concert in Lyon on the Friday night of the atrocities in Paris and since my oldest son lives in Switzerland and the borders were already starting to be battened down he spent the night on their sofa.This is the view from their rather nice balcony and while the mountain opposite may not look that high, we are already up at 800 metres on a plateau, so you can see it really is a very pleasant little village.Of course the downside was that the borders between France and Switzerland were really ramped up when I set off to work on Monday - two hours to get in to work and three to get home!  Not that anyone was complaining of course.  People were very good natured and the reinforced security was reassuring.As for the Indian summer, it is about to end, although we have had a good innings, I have to admit. This is a picture I took from my bedroom window on Saturday:and this is what is headed our way on Sunday:with a drop of 20 degrees, from 14 C today to -6 C on Sunday!!!    Brrrrhhh, glad I've already got my winter tyres on!  Winter drawers on everyone!"},

I hope so, as it truly was a work of art.Being of that generation, my dad and his brothers served in WW2.  In fact, my paternal grandma had 3 sons who (I believe) served in WW2 - my dad, my uncle George and my uncle Phil.  I'm not sure about uncle George's background, dad I know served in Europe and uncle Phil had part of his foot blown off in Singapore.  My dad's dad served in WW1 and was wounded in the Dardanelles, from where he was shipped back to England.  He died a few years later as a result of his injuries.  My grandma was then left a widowed mother of 6 children from a poor background, but was lucky enough to meet and marry a good man with whom she later had two more children.  As dad said, he was as good a father to me as I could ever have wished for - a compliment indeed, particularly in those awful times.Dad  This picture of my grandad is about 100 years old - printed on cardboard!Actually, I would like to get hold of duplicates of my dad's medals.  I have been told that I can get them through the British Legion, so I will have a shot at getting copies of both his and my grandad's medals.  I have a little bit of information regarding my grandad - a press clipping giving basic information about his service in WW1 - so if anyone knows how to go about doing this I would be very grateful for any info.On that note, I wish you all a safe and happy weekend, where we will hopefully all be able to show our gratitude and respect to those who went before and gave so much!"},

In 2007 (I think) Argentina made it to the semi-finals and they were all amateurs, you know, bank managers and accountants back home.  And this year, Uruguay also fielded a mostly-amateur team, but made it to the cup anyway. And I love the fact that it is fast and rough but that the giants of players who all tower over the ref actually listen to and respect the guy - who is - usually - only about 5 feet 4!New Zealand won this cup,The All Blacks hakaand very deservedly so, but even more impressive (for me at least) was the behaviour of Sonny Bill Williams during their victory parade.  For those that missed it, a young lad jumped over the fence and ran out to the team, only to be promptly decked by a security officer.  Sonny Bill went over and comforted the lad, walked over so that they could have pictures taken together, and then, amazingly, took off his medal and put it over the boy's head!  I think the pictures speak for themselves don't you?Lovely sportsmanship and the look on the young boy's face is priceless.  (Now in the unlikely event that I ever won a rugby world cup medal, I may just have magnanimously had my picture taken with the young lad, and may just have put my medal round his neck but then .... when reality set in .... I would probably have chased him down the field, tackled him with a flying scrum and got my medal back, but then maybe that's just me - selfish B that I am).  But what a lovely gesture by a gorgeous man (and that fact didn't go unnoticed either)!And talking of sportsmanship, I remember watching a match many years ago (I think it was South Africa against Wales), when a Welsh player was absolutely clobbered in a tackle by his South African opponent.  While play carried on towards the try line, the South African player turned and saw that the Welsh player was still down, so he left the play and ran back to him, took his gum shield out and turned him into the recovery position, staying with him until the medics got to him.  I believe the player was ok in the end but that display of sportsmanship has always stayed with me.The nice thing about rugby also is that, unlike at football matches, supporters are free to sit anywhere they want in the grounds, as there is no inter-fan violence.  When my younger son played we got tickets to see England/France in Marseille, and the two of us ended up sitting down the \"French\" end, the targets of much banter from the French fans. When my then 10-year-old son turned round and answered them in perfect French (despite us wearing our England shirts) they were absolutely gob-smacked - and the joke ended up being on them!The few years that he played were great for us as a family too.  Ok it was a lot of running around but the atmosphere - particularly at tournaments - was lovely and very family-oriented.  In fact, one of my son's friends, D, grew up to be a man-mountain and has just been signed for Oyonnax Club as a professional at the young age of 20!  I can't believe this was the little boy who used to come over to play with my son - I mean, he is just an absolute giant now.   Makes me feel very old.  D has already played for France against South Africa in SA as an under-21 so here's hoping he makes it to the big time.  They certainly deserve it for all the hard work they put in, I can tell you.Goooo D!!!"},
{"title": "This and that", "date": "Monday 26 October 2015", "text": "These past few weeks have just been absolutely glorious.  Hardly any rain (even though it is the season for it) but beautiful sunshine and glorious autumn colours.  Every time I drive past the village sign I think \"now I must stop someday and get a picture of that\" - you know, the mountains with all the leaves changing, and before I realize it I have driven out the other side of the village.  Oh well, I will get around to it someday, I guess.This weekend was lovely.  I am a rugby fan so got to watch a great game on Saturday (New Zealand/South Africa) and then again on Sunday (Australia/Argentina), and while I didn't have a preference for who won, both times the game could have been won in the last minutes by the \"underdog\" - in this case South Africa and Argentina.  That makes for a really thrilling match, I can tell you.On Sunday I went with a friend to an exhibition of \"hand-made creations\" and even though I say it every time, I really am stunned at just how much talent there is out there. Of course there is all the usual beautiful jewelry, leather work, art work, needlework and so on, but one young man really impressed me with his wonderful woodwork.  And when I say \"young\" I mean maybe early 20s. Such talent.  What really caught my eye was a beautiful coffee table that he had made principally out of old skis!!!  Very unusual indeed. Of course, given the amount of work and skill involved it was also pretty expensive.  Naturally I don't begrudge this at all because I cannot even begin to imagine how much time, skill and effort went into it - but a bit outside my price range all the same. But take a look at a lovely rocking chair and set of stools he had made.It's the kind of stuff that really does look good here in the mountains in a lovely wooden chalet (complete with log fire?).  If you are interested, he has a web site too.http://yohannchenelat.com/After that we headed out to a place called Sallanches where they were having their traditional foire froide (that is incredibly difficult for us anglo-saxons to say!) - or \"cold fair\".  They had the usual vide-greniers (car boots), craft stalls, local food market, plus cattle fair and small fun fair.  Lovely! I bought three different local cheeses, some Lebanese spices that are often difficult to get hold of here, and a lovely warm jacket.  I already have a very heavy jacket for the winter, but frankly unless I am going to be climbing Annapurna anytime soon (which I highly doubt) I find it too heavy as I prefer to wear less clothing underneath and have a warmer outer jacket.  I'm very pleased with that I can tell you.So what else is there?  Oh yes, this last Friday I made my first \"extra\" payment on my mortgage. Yipee.  Well \"yippee\" - that was a helluva lot of money to be going out of my bank account in one go, but I'm sure you know what I mean.  Under the terms of my mortgage the minimum additional payment I can make is 10% of the total initial amount of the mortgage.  As you can imagine, that takes some saving up for, but it was so nice to see my outstanding mortgage go down by the corresponding amount.  Now I just have to keep plodding away at it for a while longer, I suppose. Depending on how it works out, I'm pretty sure I can have it paid off in four years, which will mean paying off a 17-year mortgage in just seven, so I am well pleased with that I can tell you, and that's a great thought after going through a divorce at a later age.Other than that, the kids get the key to their apartment on Monday (2nd November) so I imagine we will be spending the next few week-ends moving them in to their own little \"nest\" - and very pleased I am for them too.  So I really will be a (very happy) empty nester.  Lovely.OH spent a few days working in China, arriving back on Saturday night, so hopefully I will get to see him this week too.  Absence really does make the heart grow fonder!  And I am off to my patchwork club tonight - only the second time I have been to this club - and a really nice, friendly bunch they are too.  We get just as much chin-wagging done as patchworking, so you can see I am a happy bunny at the moment.  So on that note,  will love you and leave you and wish you all a \"bonne semaine\".  Cheers."},
{"title": "Freedom!!!!!!", "date": "Thursday 15 October 2015", "text": "Well it looks like it is finally going to happen - my son and his girlfriend are moving out. They put in a dossier for a small apartment in a place called La Vallée Verte and it has been accepted. They sign tomorrow and can pick up the keys on 2 November.  So while they will take their time moving out, they will shortly be in their own place and for the first time in over 30 years, I will only have myself to think about! And I am delighted!!!Now the truth of course is that I have enjoyed having them at home, but there comes a time when they need to be out on their own and have a place of their own.  I remember how I flew out to Switzerland when I was 21 and got my first place.  I slept on the floor with a small lamp for what seemed like ages until I got enough money to buy my own stuff.  But you know what, I loved it (and I was obviously a lot younger).  The kids, on the other hand, have all my ex' stuff that he left behind when he went back to the States, so to say they have a flying start would probably be an understatement.  And even better, my basement (currently full of my ex' stuff) will shortly no longer look like this:The kids have got themselves a small 1-bedroomed apartment in a lovely little village near Habere Poche/Peillonex.I did wonder if they would like to move closer to town but neither of them do. My son was adamant that having grown up in the countryside he wanted to stay in the countryside. His girlfriend felt pretty much the same and since it is still close to work for both of them it shouldn't be a problem. It is, however, at 800 metres altitude and since they are predicting snow this weekend at 800 metres it's probably time to get the snow tyres on, but - what the heck - we do that every year anyway, as I live at 700 metres myself.I am really excited for them.  And guess what, I am REALLY excited for me to be totally footloose and fancy free after all these years.  Geez, if I don't look in the mirror I could be 21 again!  In reality I suspect I will see quite a bit of my son anyway (they are only moving 15 minutes away), as I don't see him making himself dinner when his girlfriend is on the late shift, so I'm not complaining, but for the day-to-day living I'll be FREEEEEEEEEE........And what an exciting thought that is!"},
{"title": "Do not try this at home!", "date": "Tuesday 6 October 2015", "text": "My oldest sister is eight years older than me, so was a teenager in the swinging '60s and '70s. Mini-skirts were all the rage and M was very fashionable.  I mean, it's only to be expected of a young girl earning her first salary while still living at home. She was always right up to the minute fashion-wise.As a family we got on well with our neighbours, so one day, as my sister was going out for the evening wearing yet another new outfit N, the husband from next door, decided to follow her down the road pointing out to everyone that she was wearing her new clothes. She was really embarrassed and furious with him so decided to get her own back.She was quite the joker and working in central Birmingham she had access to several joke shops in the city centre. So she bought some trick soap and climbed over the neighbours' fence (with his wife's blessing) and put the trick soap in the soap dish in their bathroom.  Now N had really short hair - he always kept it more or less crew cut - so didn't really bother with shampoo so much as just run a bar of soap over his head while showering. Problem was, the trick soap had blue ink in it and the more N slathered on the soap the faster his hair and face turned completely blue!As you can image, the women were all roaring laughing, including N's wife, despite the fact that they were supposed to be going out later that evening.  This all took place at the beginning of November and since 5 November is Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night it was one of the few nights of the year where people would have had fireworks in their homes ready for the Bonfire Night celebrations.So N leaped over the garden fence yelling for my sister.  She took off running as she could see by the look on his face that he was furious.  He caught her up at the top of the path near a lamp post and somehow managed to tie her to it with the rope that he had grabbed for the purpose.  Then, in an act of total madness, he ran into his house and got some fireworks (bangers we called them), put them down by her feet and lit them!  Total madness I know. Anything could have happened and she could have been hurt but I guess you have to remember that this was about 45 years ago and in all honestly the bangers probably weren't that great shakes - more of a slow fizzle and pop but nevertheless .....  Anyway, what happened happened. N died some years ago and my sister laughs about it to this day but I guess that taught her a lesson not to mess with N."},
{"title": "There's just so much talent around - I'm hoping it's contagious!", "date": "Monday 5 October 2015", "text": "I have always been drawn to crafts like sewing, patchwork, etc., especially when I see some of the amazing things people create.  Trouble is, I have never been particularly \"crafty\" or artistic.  It's just like I love salsa music but still dance like I have two left feet - even after a year of lessons.  No rhythm you see.  Still, one of the benefits of getting older (for me at least) is that I don't actually care what I look like when I'm dancing, although it's probably pretty rough on other people's eyes, I have to admit!Many years ago, as a singleton, I took sewing lessons in Geneva, and while I was the youngest by about - oh 50 years - I really enjoyed my evenings spent learning to sew (a little) with these older ladies.  I found it very therapeutic.  Even when I married and moved to the States, after leaving Washington, D.C. and having a baby, I still found time to take a sewing class one night a week.  The problem with that was, you know how very occasionally you meet someone who feels like he/she was just made to be your lifelong best friend - admittedly not very often - well the sewing teacher turned out to be just that.  J was lovely and I felt like I had known her all my life.  We used to yack so much that in the end I never really did learn how to sew, but man did my jaws ache at the end of each lesson.Then J moved to Florida with her new husband and we moved back to Switzerland, and even though we lost touch, we have skyped a couple of times (with a 20-odd year gap in between times) and it always turns out just like old times.  In fact, J skyped me one Saturday while she was at the hairdresser's and from not having seen her in over 20 years, she pops up on my screen complete with aluminium wraps in her hair while waiting for the colour to take, and neither of us batted an eyelid.Anyway, I digress.  Last year I spotted a flyer for a sewing class taking place in a local village on Monday evenings from 8-10 pm.  This was exactly what I was looking for because although Geneva has all this to offer it is usually about four times the price and means trekking back into Geneva in the evenings.  That gets old very quickly I can tell you, especially in the winter.  Moreover, while I love Geneva and everything it has to offer, many friendships can only be transitory at best because people move on, are transferred with their jobs etc. - it's the nature of the beast.  And since I am almost certainly planning to stay here in France when I retire - even though this area is expensive - I want the majority of my social life to revolve around France and not the international community in Geneva.So I went along to this sewing class on the first Monday and it proved to be lovely.  The classes are actually free, except that they ask for an annual contribution of €40 to put towards buying material and supplies etc.  People bring in whatever they want to make and the two or three volunteer teachers help whenever people need help.  The local commune gives us the use of the room for free (my only complaint would be that it feels like a sauna most of the time - but the others don't seem to notice it - must be my English blood).  The only proviso is that the sewing ladies agree to participate in the village carnival which takes place in March (bloody stupid time of year for a carnival if you ask me - but I digress).  The women decide what they want to dress up as and the fabric is again provided free of charge by the commune.  One year they went dressed up as colourful Caribbean women, something like this:But what did they decide to do last year - get this - sweets/candies/bonbons!  I kid you not.  Well I knew I wasn't going to have as much time as the others to make my costume as I was going to Cuba for two weeks at the beginning of March, but I ended up going dressed as an M & M (something like the picture below - sorry I don't have any pictures - thank God!).Bearing in mind I had flown back from Cuba on the Wednesday (34 degrees and beautiful) and then had to traipse round the local villages in the pouring rain and freezing cold dressed as an M & M four days later I showed, I thought, what must be the epitome of dedication!  I leave to your imagination what we all looked like, given that most of the ladies are even older than me, but what good sports they all are.Over the course of the year I was supposed to be making a dress but I bought the wrong sized pattern, bought the right sized pattern, put on weight and didn't like the dress anyway so didn't actually finish it, but in any case, what a lovely time I had over the course of the year, getting more yacking done than sewing of course (can you begin to see a pattern (pun intended) here).  At the end of the year in July, one of the ladies invited us all over to \"her place\" for an apéro - \"her place\" being a wholesale wine and beer outlet that she and her family run.  (It's not what you know but who you know that's important - obviously).  After the apéro we went up to a place called the Plateau de Solaison to have lunch in one of the four restaurants up there and it was lovely.  This was also paid for out of the €40 annual contribution, so you can see what a great little class this is.Plateau de SolaisonAt the same time I thought I would treat myself to a new sewing machine, my old one being over 35 years old and second-hand even when I bought it all those years ago (but still running sweet as a nut). The lady who sold my new machine to me told me it was \"the Michael Schumacher\" of the sewing world and indeed it does seem to have everything except GPS, although I fear I might need a PhD to figure it all out.  I mean, it is a \"self-threader\" - it only took me about six months to get that down pat!  This lady also gives patchwork lessons once a month so I jumped at that - once a month, in all honesty, being enough to allow some time during the week to get ahead.  Her husband also services and repairs sewing machines in their \"Aladdin's cave\" of a shop. To be honest, there just aren't the same number of outlets for crafts/patchworking as there are in the UK (or the States!!!) so you jump at everything you find here.First year she had us make a sampler in order to give us the basics of patchworking, appliqué etc. The course starts again tomorrow and while four of the ladies want to make a bag, I want to make a kit to carry my supplies.  We'll see what that turns out like in due course, I suppose.On top of that, I had spotted an advert for a patchwork and craft exhibition taking place this weekend in a small village about 15 minutes from me so I went along expecting to spend 15 minutes there at most.  Well, I was stunned. Considering it is such a small village, the quilters' club (which includes one very artistic man) produced such beautiful work and made us feel so welcome that we stayed over an hour-and-a-half.  I was taking photos saying \"oh this one's my favourite\", \"no sorry, this one's my favourite\" - and in the end couldn't decide. Everything was just so beautiful - judge for yourself (sorry if a few of the photos are a bit blurred).Actually I think this might be my favourite - a \"friendship\" quilt - each piece made by a different \"friend\"Well this small quilters' club meets twice during the weekday afternoons (no good for me) but once a week on a Monday night so I have signed up.  Again only €35 for the year and (so I'm told) it's a sew-a-bit, chat-a-bit kind of club (just my kind of club then) where the ladies chose what they want to make and everyone offers guidance and assistance freely.  I can't believe I have been lucky enough to find this club just down the road from me.  If I were in the UK I would probably know where to find these things but here in France it is not so obvious (to me at least) to locate these groups - but I'm so glad I kept looking. Unfortunately, being on a Monday night, it clashes with my sewing class so I think I will end up doing one week sewing, one week quilting.  Well, that's the plan anyway, but who knows.But you know, I think I'm really going to have to re-think this \"working full-time business\" - I mean, it is seriously interfering with my social life!"},
{"title": "Sad news", "date": "Friday 2 October 2015", "text": "When my kids were growing up there were always loads of other kids to hang around with.  Just a little further out of the village were two houses that were a little bit \"rough\". We were pretty sure they were dealing some form of illegal drugs out of the one - you know the kind - no visible sign of income but loads of big cars.  Not sure, but I think the police were well aware of this place.In the house next door were another family, and my kids were friendly with one of their sons - Jean-Michel.  Jean-Michel was a skinny little devil and I always had the feeling that he hung around with kids younger than himself (principally my oldest son's age group) in order to feel like he was \"the big guy\".  Still, he wasn't a bad lad, maybe a bit rough around the edges.  I'm not sure where the dad was - if indeed he was around - but mom seemed like a pretty decent lady.As time went by and our kids grew up we pretty much lost track of Jean-Michel. Occasionally you would see him on his scooter with this blooming great big dog sitting between his legs on the footrest of the scooter.  It was pretty comical to see (if probably rather dangerous).Anyway, about 3 years ago, Jean-Michel simply disappeared into thin air - or so it would seem - along with his dogs.  Nobody had any news of him or had any idea why he might have left or where he had gone to.Every morning I glance through the local Geneva newspaper, which also runs stories on the surrounding French area.  They had a short article last week where a hunter had stumbled across human remains in the mountains above a place called Cluses.  Well, my son came home last night and told me that the remains had been found to be those of Jean-Michel!!!  I still can't believe it! From what they can gather he had taken his dogs off walking up in the mountains and must have fallen. The area where he was found was pretty inaccessible and despite numerous searches he had never been spotted, nor have his dogs been found.How terribly sad to think that he has lain out in the mountains for these past three years. At least his mom can now give him a decent burial - but it breaks my heart to think about it."},
{"title": "Who says the art of romance is dead!", "date": "Thursday 1 October 2015", "text": "Last Thursday (24th September) was my 57th birthday. I got an sms from my oldest son who was at a wedding in Portugal and my younger son and his girlfriend surprised me with a lovely pair of earrings, a beautiful artisanal scarf and a lovely bouquet of flowers. Aren't they pretty!Then I got a message from OH suggesting that he take me to dinner.  Again a beautiful bouquet of flowers.  I mean, I really was spoilt.We discussed where we should go for dinner and I suggested a Canadian restaurant that had just opened up in town and which was getting pretty good reviews, to the point where you needed a reservation as they were generally pretty full.  So I googled them to get their phone number and on checking out Tripadvisor the reviews were indeed pretty good but there was more than one mention of slow service (probably because they are just starting up and trying to keep staff overheads low, I would think).  When I pointed this out to OH he said to forget it as he wouldn't be putting up with slow service.  I knew what would happen, he would get all snitty if he was not happy with the service and the evening would be ruined.  So rather than try this place (I can always go another time with a gi﻿rlfriend who has more patience than OH) I mentioned another of my favourite places and again OH wasn't sure so - rather sarcastically I thought - he said \"what about going to Stan's\"!!!Well Stan is a Nigerian friend of mine who has opened a \"bijou\" little place in the village.  In fact, in our village there was only one restaurant - no shops, no taxi rank, no bus stop even - nothing, nada, zilch - until Stan came along.  The existing restaurant in the village is very good but was not open on this particular evening.Stan is married to a French woman and our kids became firm friends when their family moved here.  Stan saw a need in the village and somehow or other managed to persuade the village council to let him rent a small piece of land and put up a couple of portacabin-style huts to house a little shop.  Part of the hut is indeed a small shop for basic necessities and the rest is given over to \"haute cuisine\".  Well not really \"haute cuisine\", more like plastic plates and a few non-chipped glasses.  But you know what, the place is working out.  It fills a need in the village to have a place where local people can get together for a chinwag and a glass of wine while putting the world to rights under Stan's eagle eye.Now Stan doesn't exactly move with the speed of a leopard or the grace of a gazelle.  More of a slow, steady plod and squelch.  In fact I'm not sure if it is his knees or his shoes but something makes a squelching sound with every step he takes (actually it's more of a loud farting sound but I am trying to keep this blog classy!).  \"Anna, what do you want with your fries?\" (please imagine this said with a strong Nigerian accent).  \"Mustard please Stan\" (this would be me - with a strong Brummie accent).  Squelch, squelch, squelch.  \"C, what do you want with your fries?\" (Nigerian accent again). \"Mayonnaise please Stan\" (OH - Dutch accent this time - are you keeping up - you will be tested later).  Squelch, squelch, squelch (not quite sure why he couldn't get the mustard and the mayo at the same time but I digress).  In any case, he has a simple menu (pizza, moules/frites, salad, burgers, etc.) and a friendly welcome so he is popular among the locals - I mean, some of the farmers just drive up on their tractors to buy a baguette and have a beer.  Another impressive thing is that the local kids actually respect and like Stan too - none of them would ever dream of giving him any trouble!Anyhoo (and moving seamlessly on), we decided that instead of going to some fancy-schmancy place in town we would go to Stan's so OH and Stan could put the world to rights, OH having travelled extensively in Nigeria for his work.  I ordered something Stan bills as \"nico-frites\" - which is basically a plate of fries with melted reblochon cheese on top.  Uuummmm!  OH said he didn't want anything.  Turned out that he knew I wouldn't finish what I had ordered which would leave him to finish the rest.  So all in all, my romantic, no-expense-spared birthday night out cost OH €13 for one plate of nico-frites and a couple of glasses of wine.  Don't tell me we don't know how to live!  But you know what, we both agreed we had had a lovely time.  Back home in time to watch the rugby, a good movie and a lovely evening all round.Next day a friend called to invite me out to lunch for my birthday.  When I explained to her that D and I had planned to go to a couple of vide-greniers (car boots - to all intents and purposes) she asked if she could come along.  We went to a first vide-grenier in a place called Scientrier.  Well actually they call it a \"vogue\" which is basically a funfair and car boot, where you get the added pleasure of watching little kids with candy floss in hand get chased around the fun fair by a swarm of wasps!I picked up a nice glass bottle and my friend, indeed treated me to a birthday lunch.  Another plate of fries but this time with a grilled sausage and mustard.  Ahh this is the life.  Then on to another car boot at a place called Nangy.  This was much bigger and quite the treasure trove.  I could have spent a small fortune (well one or two more euros) if I had been let loose.  As it was, for the grand total of €4, I did, indeed, pick up a few gems.  I realized afterwards that the big jar is actually a rumtopf - a jar to make rum punch in - the ingredients are shown on the outside - you simply add rum and sugar cane!  I shall have to give that a try!As I turned 57 on my birthday I am technically eligible for early retirement but since I had to take out a mortgage to buy my ex out of the house I won't be able to take advantage of this just yet.  Another 4-5 years I'm thinking.  In the meantime, I feel thoroughly spoilt, all those pretty presents for my birthday and one-and-a-half plates of chips all to myself.  Bliss indeed!﻿Well my goodness, I am happy to welcome Jennywren as my first follower.  What a nice surprise.  I honestly never thought anyone would be that interested in my ramblings but it is so nice to hear that someone can actually make sense of them.  So cheers Jennywren!I would join you for a glass of champagne but it's a little early for me....... oh who the hell am I kidding.  So cheers again.  Anna"},
{"title": "Internet dating - la suite", "date": "Wednesday 30 September 2015", "text": "The scammers!  Ahh the scammers. As I wrote yesterday, I have to admit that my brief foray into internet dating was pretty positive.  That of course, was after the contact I had with the scammers. Nevertheless, while they were indeed scammers, their tricks were so pathetic they actually succeeded in giving me a good belly laugh!Before I joined up on the Swiss site, I had been persuaded to try out an international site (you see it advertised on the TV all the time).  They were going to give me a free trial period.  So I put in my details, and a very brief profile.  I wasn't really that interested anyway so my profile on this site was probably about two lines long. Of course the site asks for your date of birth so without actually giving away your birthday it is possible for other members to know your age.Well I would say within 10 minutes of uploading my free profile I was contacted by \"General Mike Whadyamacallit\", US military.  And wouldn't you know, he was the same age as me and a pretty good looking guy in his military fatigues. Yep he even posted a photo. Turns out he was a widower with a 17-year old son and would be retiring from the military in 18 months time. Perfect if you think about it. Same age as me - check. Widower - so no ex-wife to worry about- check. 17-year-old son - soon be off his hands - check. And soon to be retiring - perfect for him to be able to travel freely and meet up with the woman who was shortly to become the love of his life (that's me by the way, in case you hadn't guessed) - double check.Anyway, we messaged back and forth for a little while and he asked me a bit about my background. I gave him the short, cleaned-up version (i.e. no bad language about my ex) and then I asked what his story was.  Well I tell you, quicker than you could say KAZINGAA, he shot back 3 pages giving his complete life story.  In fact I'm surprised my computer didn't crash with the size of the file. Born, blahhhhdy-blah, raised blahhhhdy-blah, studied - blahhhdy-blah.  Graduated from West Point in 1966.  Saw active service in blahhhdy-blah and so on. You get the gist.  You name it, this guy had done it all.  BUUUUUT one thing jumped out at me.  I was 51 at this time and he claimed to be the same age, but something about his profile didn't fit.Anyway, \"Mike\" and I chatted politely back and forth for a little while more when he said that much as he would love to, he wouldn't be able to speak on the phone for some time as he was currently serving in Afghanistan so they were restricted, for obvious security reasons.  Same for skype. Security issues.  So at that point he was going to have to love me and leave me as he had to get back out into the field to \"speak to his boys\"!  But, he couldn't wait until the next evening when he would get to chat to me again.So before I logged off I just said \"Hey Mike, wait a minute.  It has been so exciting to meet you but I just wanted to ask you one thing.\"  \"Sure anything, go ahead honey.\"  \"You said you were the same age as me right - 51?\" \"Yep\" came back the reply. \"So born in 1958 then?\" \"Yep\".  \"Hey, please, please don't hang up just yet I need to ask you something.  I am so looking forward to our chat tomorrow, but it's just that - well you know - I mean, it is just that I am so excited to be chatting to someone who graduated from West Point at the age of 8!!!!!!And before I could say \"now holdyacottonpickinsocksthere Jehosafat\", the jerk's profile page went KERPING!!!! and disappeared in about 10 seconds flat. And you know, the next night I had pretty much the same contact from \"Lieutenant Todd Thingemebob\" - US military.  I told him not to waste his time as I didn't get out of bed for anything less than a 5-star general (or should that be into bed? -  not sure).Needless to say I reported these two email addresses back to the abuse lines at their relevant email sites.  Of course they will be up and running with a new ID and other fake photos lifted off the internet in about 20 minutes so I hope others are careful.  But hey, I wonder what the weather is really like in Nigeria at the moment!Courtesy of Zestnow.com"},
{"title": "Internet dating", "date": "Tuesday 29 September 2015", "text": "Ha, what fun that is!  When my husband left me in January 2010, the first reaction was RELIEF.  It was so wonderful to have peace, quiet and calm in the house - no more yelling and screaming and throwing punches.  The thought of wanting to be with anyone ever again never crossed my mind. A few months later I still felt pretty much the same, but some of my girlfriends started egging me on to give internet dating a try.  What the f......!  I had been married 26 years by the time we divorced and we had met the \"old fashioned way\", so what the heck did I know about internet dating.  Anyway, after a lot of nagging I thought I would give it a shot.There is a pretty good site here in Switzerland (naming no names) so I took a look on that, and to be honest I didn't know whether to laugh or throw myself straight in the lake. I mean, all those people who are \"romantic, sensual, liking long walks on the beach\". What the hell! I am none of those things, nor do I know anyone who is.  So I thought, in for a penny, in for a pound, and drew up a non-photo profile.  Something along the lines of \"fat, 50 and menopausal, couldn't care less how much you earn, not interested in your car, can build my own white picket fence thank you very much, and if you really want to know what I like best in bed, it is complete control of the TV remote and a cheese and pickle sandwich\"!  (The reference to what I like in bed was after a complete weirdo contacted me asking if he could lick my feet while I was wearing high heels - at first I thought he was joking and then realized that this nutter was for real!!!!  Turns out I'm a \"lying, frigid b*tch\" - well whaddya know!)  I also did not put a photo because I had actually recognized a couple of work colleagues on the site!!!! and reading their profiles was, I thought, waaaaay too intimate.  But guess what, I had so many replies from men who loved my profile, it was unbelievable, thereby I believe, giving lie to the fact that men also feel they cannot just be \"normal men\" - but have to pretend to be some Brad Pitt lookalike.Courtesy Catfish and Online DatingSo I agreed to meet up with (in total) around 7 men, I think, for a drink somewhere public and, with 2 exceptions, they were really good company.  The 2 exceptions were (1) a very nice chappy who I couldn't understand in any language (he was Turkish) and (2) another Turk who frankly was on the wrong site - I mean, it was immediately \"so shall we go to your place or mine?\"  I told him wherever he wanted to go sling his hook.  I ended up having dinner twice with a charming Italian called Massimo, but there wasn't much spark there and frankly his ashtray breath was more than I could take, and then met up with a Panamanian/Swiss who remains a close friend to this day and briefly dated a Spanish lawyer who was an experience in itself, and with whom I also still remain in touch.Turns out the Spanish guy was a high-powered lawyer - the chief lawyer for a big multi-national in Switzerland with a penthouse overlooking the lake.  Some of my friends were pig sick that I had struck it \"so lucky\" to meet a guy like this but hey, he invited me out, not the other way round.  After a few dates he asked me if I would be his date at his company's annual black tie dinner (f......k!!!!). What the hell would someone like me wear to something like that - I mean, these women were dripping in jewels and designer clothes.  I suppose on the positive side, no-one else would be wearing a dress from H&M with plastic earrings from the kiddies shop in town - but I digress.  So I said ok, when would it be and when should I come over?  He said, oh not till May, and don't worry about driving here, it's in Monte Carlo for the Grand Prix (double f.....k!!!).  So I asked how would we be getting there - and you've got it - corporate jet!  Oh man, I felt soooooooooooooo sick.  I mean, what the hell?  I don't think I slept for about a month worrying about it.  It turned out in the end that he had to travel to Japan for an urgent meeting so he had to cancel.  To say my relief was palpable would be an understatement, but I didn't get off the loo for about a week.Dating him was actually great fun - he was so full of testosterone that it was a hoot (for a while).  I wasn't intimidated by him or his money, which I think is why we remain friends. But bloody hell. What an episode.  Eventually I deleted my profile from the site when a colleague of long-standing asked me out (and we have been seeing each other ever since, but do not, nor will we ever, live together).  We are just like a very comfortable pair of old slippers, happy in each other's company but leading our own lives totally independently.That being said, I have to say that my one-and-only experience of internet dating was a positive one. It's not for me and there were a couple of scammers (to be written about in \"internet dating bis\") but all-in-all I have to say that there really are some nice men out there - they're not all flesh-eating monsters and many/most of them just want a bit of company the same as we women do.  Just be sure to pick the right site."},

{"title": "Embarrassing or what?", "date": "Friday 18 September 2015", "text": "A few years ago I went home to England for a few days to see my family.  It was towards the end of September so the Hallowe'en decorations were already in the shops.  I LOVE all the ghouls and ghosts but here in France it hasn't really caught on that much - I'm not sure that I really want it to anyway because it would feel like a \"fake\" celebration (I mean, I know it's a \"fake\" celebration, I just mean as opposed to one I grew up with).  As I was walking round the big supermarket with my sister we could hear screams coming from over at the Hallowe'en aisle.  When we checked it out I have to admit I was in little piggy heaven - I love that stuff and it was so cheap.  Anyway, since I was going to be flying back home and not having a bottomless suitcase, I decided I had to restrain myself and only buy one \"ghoul in a coffin\" to bring back to France.When you walk past it, the ghoul leaps out of the coffin and screams really loudly - I just loved it!It was at the height of one of the more tense anti-terrorist periods so, being smart (or so I thought) I decided to take the batteries out of the ghoul and pack them separately.  The only thing was, the screw holding the batteries in place was really tiny and nothing I could do would get that damn thing out.  My sister, very helpfully (not), suggested wrapping the ghoul very tightly in my clothes before putting it in my suitcase assuring me that \"that should stop it from screaming\".  Yeah right!I then drove the 2 1/2 hours back to London to drop off my rental car and catch the plane.  But OH MY GOD, as soon as I put my suitcase down on the moving walkway into the airport the bloody thing started to scream in my suitcase!  People were looking around but couldn't figure out where the noise was coming from.  On top of that, I was flying with Easyjet and the check-in line was really long - you know, you go round and round the little rope barriers forever just like as if you are waiting to get on a ride at bloody Disneyland.  Or maybe it wasn't taking forever but it just felt like it with my suitcase constantly screaming.  Now I don't embarrass easily but I have to admit this one really did a number on me.When I got to the check-in desk I explained to the girl what was going on and asked her if she would like my ghoul as a present.  She said she wasn't allowed to accept anything so I decided I would throw the damn thing away - only to find out that all the litter bins had been sealed shut because of the security threat!  And I mean, the place was crawling with police officers armed with machine guns.  Bloody hell.  I wasn't sure what to do at that point so I decided to just break the back off the battery compartment, which, after much blood, sweat and tooth-gnashing I managed to do.  So I took the batteries out and stuffed them in another pocket in my suitcase and made my way red-faced but triumphant back to Geneva with my ghoulish trophy more or less intact.  And guess what, the bloody thing still works!  Great eh!"},
{"title": "Noise pollution", "date": "Wednesday 16 September 2015", "text": "Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that the only way it would seem to be possible to separate some people from their mobile phones would be to have it surgically removed! Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful to have a mobile phone for convenience sake, and I understand absolutely that people read on them, listen to music or use the internet, etc. I don't have a problem with that at all.  I don't use my phone for those purposes because I cross the border from France into Switzerland every day and in order to use the internet I would have to enable data roaming (and all the expense that would incur, so I just don't bother).  But what I cannot understand is some people's need to be constantly on the phone.  I mean, can you think of anyone you would want or need to talk to 24/7 (I mean, while sitting on the bus, standing in line at the bank, sitting on the john?).  I can't so I find it very difficult to understand.  I'm not talking about teenagers who seem to feel the need to send sms to their friends 10 minutes after they last saw them - we were all daft, lovesick teenagers at one point I guess. I am talking about the adults who seem to have them attached to their ears by skin grafts and constantly feel the need to yell into them.Every day I drive 28 km to the Franco/Swiss border, park my car and catch the bus for the 8 km ride across town to work.  Geneva being what it is, this usually takes about 40 minutes.  It gives me plenty of time to sit and read, daydream or whatever.  Many people listen to music under headphones, or read.  BUUT, there is always someone who gets on and has to have that oh-so-important conversation in the middle of a crowded bus while speaking at the top of their voice.  There is one man who sometimes gets on at the station and yells non-stop into his phone until he gets off about 30 minutes later.  I dread it when I see him get on.  Another is a Portuguese-speaking man who frankly doesn't need a phone as he could just as easily yell to whoever he was talking to - even if they were in Portugal.  And then another lady recently who had a really, really loud \"chat\" with someone for about 15 minutes.  When she hung up I'm sure I wasn't the only one who thought \"thank God for that\", but no, she then proceeded to have another really, really loud \"chat\" with another friend.  She is entitled to chat of course, but when you can't even think straight to read because someone is on the phone talking SOOOOO loud it is really bloody annoying.  I mean, if she at least put the damn thing on speaker-phone we could ALL hear the entire conversation, but NOOOO, we just get to hear her side.I know I wasn't the only one annoyed by this as people kept glaring at her and when we got off at the terminus a group of us just burst out laughing in relief.  But you know, it isn't funny - it is damn well rude and inconsiderate.  I would have loved to have a fake, loud, imaginary conversation right next to her to see how she liked it .... but who needs the hassle - life is too short.Then there are the people you are actually with who can never stop looking at their phones or texting. I got so fed up of this at a dinner recently that I asked the guy if he was waiting for a heart transplant! When he said \"no, why\" I said \"do you realize just how ignorant it is to be constantly looking at the phone when you have been invited to someone's place for dinner\"!  (I guess that means I'm off his Christmas card list now, eh).On an only slightly related subject, my house backs on to a farm.  The farmer sometimes keeps cattle, raises horses and/or donkeys.  The cattle have cowbells on since during the summer months they take them up to higher pastures and bring them down in the autumn (it's called la transhumance in French - now that is something beautiful to see).I have to admit when we first moved in and the farmer would call the cows down for milking the \"dunk, dunk, dunk\" drove me mad (but probably only because I wasn't used to it and 5 a.m. was just a bit early for me).  But I soon not only got used to it but began to love it (all the more so when they were further up the mountains and you could just hear a gentle thud, thud, thudding sound).  But, apparently someone complained.  Can you believe it.  I mean, if you live in the country that's what happens.  Donkeys, bulls, cows and cockerels make a noise (my vote goes to the donkey for being the noisiest bugger - just saying).  So for a while the farmer removed the bells!  All for the sake of some city-slicker who wanted the country without the inconvenience of the country!  I'm glad to say, however, that the bells were soon back (as Quasimodo might have said) and I love it.  Give me the bells over the mobile phone fiends any day!(And just as another \"by-the-way\", since I started doing the park and ride to get to work, I have to admit I had never realized how many people smoke.  I put it down to me sitting on the bus day-dreaming and then seeing people waiting at the bus stop taking that one last drag before hopping on the bus.  But it truly shocked me for a while.  We all know the health risks attached to smoking, as well as getting the occasional, really pungent whiff of bad breath from the hardened smoker.  I have never smoked and have no idea how hard it must be to give up so I'm not knocking them.  But what I will never get through my brain is how, in this day and age, anyone can actually afford to smoke. Good Lord - I hate to think how much of their money is literally \"going up in smoke\")."},

We would disappear out to play and come home god know's how many hours later filthy and starving, but we were never bored!Like my own parents, it's probably just as well we didn't know what our kids got up to during those long hours.  Now my sons talk of trekking miles into the woods dressed as soldiers and building dens and so on.  It makes me sad to think that so many people nowadays aren't comfortable letting their kids roam because of \"all the crazies about\"! That is probably true but I do wonder if there are more crazies about now than before or if we just hear about it now because of the availability of instant media coverage.  I mean, when I was a kid we would never have known about a child being abducted or murdered in the States because the coverage just wasn't there.  I really don't know the answer, and I know kids have to be watched, but it will be a sad day when our kids are no longer free to run and play!Anyhoo, one day my oldest had been out playing with Kevin and when he came home the front of his shorts were all wet.  So I asked him if he had had a little \"accident\" and he said \"no\"!  So then I asked him how come his shorts got all wet then.  He said he and Kevin had been having a competition to see who could pee the farthest.  They were standing opposite each other and Kevin won!  Somehow I wish I hadn't asked.Illustration by Dennis Cox"},
{"title": "Travelling solo", "date": "Friday 4 September 2015", "text": "For as long as I can remember, I have been passionate about travelling and seeing the world.  I have no idea why.  Maybe a few too many documentaries on TV when I was growing up about all the wonderful sights there are to see.  I left England at age 21 to work in Geneva, Switzerland.  Now that alone is a sight worth seeing. I have to admit I was a bit upset flying out because I had a job in the UK and a lovely boyfriend, but I had to put my money where my mouth was and take this job that had just been offered to me in Geneva - I mean it was only for five months right!  Well as you can imagine, it didn't quite work out the way I expected.  Over 30 years later and here I still am (with a few detours over the years).  I remember flying in over the mountains and all my sadness about leaving the UK (well the boyfriend really) just evaporated as the mountains were so beautiful, and again, more than 30 years later, I haven't changed my mind about that -they are still stunningly beautiful.When I first came to Geneva I had the money and the generous holidays to continue to travel (along with a new boyfriend who also wanted to travel!!!! Oh fickle heart).  But fast forward a few years and I ended up marrying someone else - oh double fickle heart).  We ended up moving to Washington, D.C., on to Pittsburgh and then had the chance to move BACK to Geneva and jumped at it.  Two children later (now grown), one ex-husband (now thankfully out of my life) and here I am, 35 years later again on my own and looking to travel.I must admit when the ex left I was 51 and while I couldn't have cared less about him shacking up with his tart, it felt a bit weird being \"fat, 50 and menopausal\" and suddenly on my own.  I thought that was it, I would end up like Psycho's mother, totally content in my own company, to be found dead in my rocking chair, book in hand and covered in cobwebs.  Well let me tell you, not a bit of it.My friends egged me on to try internet dating (what the f***!), which I did and had a very good experience despite my misgivings (but I suspect that is the subject of another blog post).  But what I did miss was travel.  I now had the kids off my hands, the time, the money (if I was careful) but no-one to travel with, and I was not really that thrilled about travelling alone.  That is, until a colleague mentioned that her mother had been going on \"solos\" trips, i.e. organized group trips for people who, for one reason or another, wanted to travel but had no-one to go with.  They could be single, widowed, divorced, or even happily married but their other half doesn't want to travel.Well I thought about looking for a Swiss group but in all honesty they would probably be flying out of Zurich and all speak Swiss-German.  Then I looked at French groups.  I was comfortable with that idea as I speak French, but then it occurred to me that if I was going to fly up to Paris to travel I may as well look for a UK group and fly out of London, and get to pop in and see family at the same time. And it was a GREAT idea, all the more so because the majority of the people on these trips are in fact Brits and having grown up with the same background we have the same sense of humour - I mean, everyone laughs immediately when someone mentions Morecambe and Wise and the André Previn sketch.So with some trepidation, I booked my first trip to a place called Kusadasi in Turkey in October 2012, flying via London.  Now I am not shy but I have to admit I was a little nervous about it, but I felt so much for some others (women mostly) who seemed really nervous.  But you know what, over the course of the next week they really came out of themselves and people always found someone to sit with on the coach, get along with and natter to.  Some were widows who had plucked up the courage to make this trip and I don't think a single one of them regretted it.  In fact, for me, I loved the older women who had so many stories to tell.  On the flight back, I sat next to one widowed lady who told me that while her son and daughter were wonderful, they both worked full-time and that she would sometimes go a whole week without speaking to anyone.  Now how sad is that!I am not a beach person (you can usually smell the bacon within about 15 minutes when I go on the beach) so Kusadasi was wonderful for me - all that culture, the fabulous food (and the glorious weather of course).  We got to visit Efes and Pamukkale which were just fascinating.  (As an aside, I am just so glad that the wonderful relics of Efes are safe from the mindless destruction of artefacts going on elsewhere).EfesPammukaleFor some reason, Machu Picchu in Peru held the strongest draw for me and I made it there in March 2013 - it truly was magical - that and the fascinating floating islands of the Uros, where the lovely ladies made us all dress up in their brightly-coloured clothes (with us looking like real idiots but it was fun anyway).I was also lucky enough to visit lovely Croatia, the only downside being that the weather was dreadful, so not as much fun as it might otherwise have been.  Then on to Cuba in March 2015 (I wrote about that in a previous blog post) and hopefully St. Lucia in the spotlight for next March.All this costs money of course, and it takes some saving up for.  But you know, that is my pleasure in life and I will happily do without other things in order to spend it on travel. In fact my ex once snarled asking how I could afford to travel like I did. I answered that firstly, it was none of his business as we were divorced (I didn't get a penny out of the divorce), secondly he earned as much as I did and thirdly, the €70 a week he spent on cigarettes and the small fortune he spent in the scumball bar he frequented probably made the difference between my being able to travel and him not being able to.Anyhoo, this long rambling post was really just to say to anyone who would love to travel but doesn't want to do it alone, if you can afford it, please try it.  I don't think you will regret it.  In fact, when we were in Cuba one of the men commented on a couple who were having dinner together.  We were all yacking away and he said \"look at that couple, they haven't said a word to each other all evening, and look at us\"!  It brought it all home to me right there and then.  Maybe that couple were just so comfortable in each other's company that they didn't need to talk.  Or maybe they had nothing to say to each other. Who knows.  Those of us travelling \"solo\" had common interests and so much to talk about - he was right you know.  Give it a shot."},
{"title": "What amazing talent!", "date": "Monday 31 August 2015", "text": "As I had mentioned in a previous post, one of the joys of being in a multicultural city like Geneva is the fact that you get the pleasure of being able to go to the theatre, concerts etc. in English, in addition to attending events in French.  While I do most of my interests/courses in French, it is also great to be able to see things in English from time to time.  So this weekend, a friend and I went to another show put on by the Geneva Amateur Operatic Society (GAOS), but this time by their off-shoot, the Really Youthful Group.  As the name suggests, the Really Youthful Group is an amateur group made up of young people up to the age of 18.  And what a wonderful job they did.  Of course, having such a classic comedy as Andrew Lippa's adaptation of the Addams Family really helps, but even given so, wonderful they were.It is a brilliant musical, very clever, and the kids more than did it justice.  I have never actually seen the film (starring Angelica Houston I think) and don't mind at all as it was all the more of a wonderful surprise.  They weren't just \"pretty good for kids\" - they were pretty darn good by anybody's standards.  Where on earth they get the talent from beats me (speaking as someone without an artistic bone in my body), and on top of that having the nerve to do it.  Wild horses wouldn't get me on stage doing that, I can tell you.What is really amazing is that these kids are, at a minimum, bilingual (English/French) and more often than not trilingual.  You can tell that just from the babble in the audience! Many of these kids are often temporary expats and are educated in international schools here in Geneva.  The majority are in the English section for that reason, with French lessons being intensive, although there are some of the longer-term Geneva residents who are educated in the French section, with intensive English.  On top of that Morticia was played by a beautiful Malaysian, Gomez was (I think) Spanish, and while I'm not sure of the other nationalities not many could be considered \"English mother tongue\".At the age of 18 the kids then have the option of auditioning to appear in the adult productions (where there are fewer roles for kids of course) but many of them will then have finished their high school education and be heading out farther afield for their higher education.  But what a great time they seem to have had in the meantime.All in all, I had a wonderful evening discovering a great musical comedy which was so well performed by truly talented young artists."},
{"title": "A quick hop and a skip back to dear old Blighty", "date": "Tuesday 18 August 2015", "text": "I try to get home to England as often as I can, particularly lately as my dear old mom isn't getting any younger (who is)?  She will be 94 in October so even though I only go for a few days I still try to take the time to get back to see her and (some) of the rest of my family in Dorset.I was able to take a long weekend at the beginning of August.  Flew on the Thursday night and back again to Geneva on the Monday.  But what a lovely weekend it was.  I had been nagging my kids to get over to see Nan because \"she isn't getting any younger you know\" and unbeknowns to me my eldest and his girlfriend (André and Lily) had also booked to go to the UK that weekend.  So I got to see them too, which was a nice surprise.  I stayed with my sister and her husband in their lovely home on Poole Bay and guess what, the weather was fantastic!! Who wudda thunk!  At least 10 degrees cooler than here in France so a really, really pleasant temperature compared to the heatwave we have been experiencing.  On the Friday my brother and I went to see mom in the wonderful care home where she lives (she has visitors every day and comes out as often as she likes - which is less and less often now strangely - but I guess she feels more secure there).  Well the conversation usually goes \"How are you doing mom?\"  \"Aye?\" \"How are you doing mom?\" \"OK\".  \"Errr, so what did you have for lunch?\" \"Aye?\" \"So, what did you have for lunch?\" \"I can't remember now but it was good!\"  You get the gist, rinse and repeat the next day.  Anyway, André and Lily arrived in London the following day and drove up to Dorset so the three of us went up to see mom on the Friday.  Cue - repeat same conversation as the previous day - but at least I am glad they got to see her.  I was also able to fit in an optician's appointment and order two new pairs of glasses that day for the grand sum of £155 (as opposed to about quadruple that price here, so definitely a good day). On the Saturday Lily stated that she wanted to visit \"Dumbledore\", which we eventually figured out was \"Durdle Door\" (it's about 30 minutes away).  Well what a lovely day we had.  The weather was superb and the Dorset coastline and countryside didn't d﻿isappoint.  In fact, Lily, who is Swiss, wants to move to England and buy a thatched cottage in Dorset (although she probably wouldn't be thrilled to have all that tourist traffic driving right past her living room window, to be honest)! Wow talk about pretty.  I have always loved that part of the coastline, of course, but rarely managed to get home in the good weather.  Yay me.  From there we went on to Corfe Castle, had a drink in a lovely old pub and André and Lily went off to visit the castle while I sat in the gardens listening to a wonderful, live band.  Bliss!  Corfe Castle, like many heritage places, is owned and run by the National Trust and if I lived in the UK I would definitely join up as they do wonderful work in preserving the natural beauty and heritage of the country.Then that evening six of us went and had a lovely (and VERY cheap by our French/Swiss standards) meal in a pub on the quay in Poole.  Wonderful.  The only down side was that, not being prepared for the warm weather and strong sun on the Saturday, guess who got sun-stroke!  I kid you not.  I spent the whole of the next day in bed, but looking on the positive side, at least I wasn't travelling back to Geneva until the following day.The kids did a lot of clothes shopping (again very cheap comparatively speaking), before heading off to spend the night exploring London where they and I flew out the next day (although from different airports).  So all in all a lovely way to spend a weekend.  Ahhh.  I love going home."},

{"title": "Epicurean delights!", "date": "Thursday 30 July 2015", "text": "I grew up in a large family (7 kids) in central Birmingham in a council house.  Dad was a sheet-metal worker by trade and my mom stayed at home with the kids until the youngest (me) was 11, when she went out to work part-time.  We were obviously not well off but certainly grew up with lots of love, a roof over our heads and food in our bellies.The food of course in those days was nothing fancy.  There was not the limitless supply of foreign goods and even if there were, there wasn't the money.  We seemed to grow up on endless variations of potatoes in some form or another - not that I am complaining - I love em.  (As an aside, you have to admit, the Italians and the Asians were smart having pasta and rice as their staples - they didn't have to peel em!)  I hate to imagine how many tons of spuds my mom has peeled over the years!  It's mind-boggling.Having all those mouths to feed and limited resources, needless to say mom was not an \"enthusiastic\" cook, and who can blame her, when that was added to the washing, ironing, cleaning and so on for a huge household with none of today's labour-saving devices.  In those early days there was also not much available in the way of fast-food - by which I mean frozen stuff.  I guess it was just starting to make its way into the shops when I was in my teens in the '70s, or thereabouts.  And while I really don't like ready-made stuff - partly because I love to cook and partly because I have the \"luxury\" of only having 2 kids to cater for - I can certainly understand when she took to it as a relief from the never-ending potato-peeling.Anway, one time she had been to the shops and came back with ready-made frozen chicken pies and frozen apple pies in plain plastic wrapping and just stuffed them in the freezer.  One night my older brother was eating his dinner of pie and chips when he asked \"what's in this pie mom?\" To which she replied \"chicken\".  So he said \"oh, it tastes like apple!\"  Well we all just burst out laughing - but he finished it anway.  Apple pie and chips with ketchup!  So I said \"well guess what you've got for desert - chicken pie and custard\"!  Can't remember but he probably ate that as well.  And you know what, it didn't kill any of us either did it?  So you see: +  does NOT equal"},
{"title": "It's so bloody hot!!!!", "date": "Friday 24 July 2015", "text": "According to my colleague, we had the hottest June in Geneva since records began (130 years ago apparently).  And the hottest March and the hottest April.  It hadn't rained for over a month until 2 nights ago when it bucketed down for about an hour then stopped.  But the ground was so parched it all drained away in the space of a few minutes.  I mean, my grass was so painful to walk on, it was like walking on razor blades.  A couple of weeks ago we hit 40 degrees and have been regularly up between 35 and 40 non-stop ever since.  Bloody hell.  Now I know many countries routinely get these temperatures but we don't, or at least not for such a prolonged period, and while most shops etc are air-conditioned homes are not so we have to try to make do with whatever cross breezes we can get.  I'm not sure how much longer this will go on for.  They are predicting down to 28 degrees for the next few days but then back up.  Anyway, I cracked at the weekend and bought myself a 3 metre diametre paddling pool which I will be assembling this weekend and then throwing myself in. (Watch out for the tidal wave)!Growing up in the UK I have to say I am accustomed to the cold and don't really mind the rain.  But the heat just about does me in.  And to think I even considered moving to Spain when I retire!  Much as I love Spain I think I will stay in France where I have made my life for many years now, and just tootle off to warmer climes in the winter for a few weeks.Talking of warmer climes, now that I am divorced and the kids are grown up I am again indulging in my life-long passion for travel.  As a single girl all my money was spent on travel.  Then along came marriage, two kids and a mortgage so that kinda slowed things down, but now, with careful planning (and saving), I am aiming to take a European break every autumn - if only for a week - (summer is lovely here so why go away) and (again hopefully) a long-haul break every winter.This March I was lucky enough to make it to Cuba for 2 weeks and what a beautiful country it is.  And while I woudn't presume to pontificate on the revolution, something definitely worked there.  The people are educated, cultivated and musically-inclined for the most part.  It really is quite amazing.  Our guide told us that higher education was mandatory (and free), as was training in music and the arts.  Add to that the free health care it was a complete eye-opener.  Of course, they are also desperately poor, something which I hope the easing of relations with the US will change.But what a lovely country.  We spent 4 nights in Havana. Visited an amazing cigar factory, a great musical show and beautiful old town Havana.We also visited the home that Hemmingway lived in for many years - so beautiful - I mean, I really want that life.  He split his time between his lovely home and a hotel room in central Havana.  Must have taken a few $$$$$$ but absolutely stunning all the same.We then spent 3 nights in a place called Cienfuegos.  Not the greatest of hotels but it was here that we got to swim with dolphins.  I have to say that that experience was the absolute highlight of our trip.  We were allowed in the sea with them for 30 minutes and got to play with them with very few restrictions.  One of the trainers was a vet and he told us that he had the best job in the world, and it was obvious that the trainers just loved them.  (I'm the one in the life jacket)!   Other people we met went on different \"dolphin trips\" and had nowhere near the experience that we had.  It was out of this world.  We then spent 7 lovely days at a beach hotel.  Now I'm not a beach person but it was so relaxing to potter around, read, take a siesta and then watch the entertainment in the evenings.  A great way to re-charge I have to say. I also got to meet up with a friend who had retired out there with her Cuban husband and they told me just how difficult it was with the embargo. Just trying to get her hands on her pension was a major feat.  I really really hope for everyone there that things ease up for them.  At the same time, I really hope that they can hold on to their wonderful culture and not lose it to the almighty dollar.  Who knows.  Good luck to them though. ﻿﻿"},
{"title": "Culturally diverse", "date": "Monday 13 July 2015", "text": "I work in Geneva, Switzerland, in an internationally diverse organization.  I love it.  It is so interesting to learn about different cultures and nationalities, not to mention the fact that everyone seems to plod along like they are at Babylon - I mean, you can't think of a word in one language, you just say it in another.  Well at least it seems to work out ok for the most part.One thing I do notice, however, is that the different nationalities' sense of humour is so varied.  I have come across this time and time again.  I mean, my ex-husband is American and you would think,  having a common(ish) language, that we would have a common sense of humour, but not a bit of it.Take this photo for example.  Someone posted it on Facebook and I thought it was so funny.  I showed it to my Irish colleague and she got a fit of the giggles.  So I showed it to my English colleague, and again a fit of the giggles.  Anway, I thought it was so funny I stuck a copy on the door to our little kitchenette and waited for reactions.  I have to say my German colleague, V, has a great sense of humour, but she stood there and looked at it and said \"so, what's funny about that?\"  My French colleague just said \"oh, so you mean people actually steal food out of the fridge?\"  In fact, their non-reactions were probably funnier than our reactions.  It is really strange and I have found it over and over again.  Humour (for the most part) just doesn't seem to translate. ﻿Having said that, some years ago I treated myself to two huge tomes of the complete works of Gary Larson and I LOVE it.  It was expensive but every time I take out one of the volumes and start flicking through it I get a fit of the giggles again.  I guess I just love visual humour and Gary Larson certainly does it for me."},
{"title": "Blind man's buff", "date": "Friday 10 July 2015", "text": "One of my favourite family stories is of \"us\" kids playing blind man's buff down by the river at Stratford-on-Avon.  When I say \"us\" I don't mean me, because I was as yet a twinkle in my dad's eye, but I mean \"the others\".My parents, like many of their generation, had a large family - seven kids.  Probably not by choice.  Well to be honest, absolutely not by choice but that was the way it was in those days.  Dad was from Birmingham and Mom from North Wales but they raised the family in central Birmingham because, as mom said, \"that was where the work was\".  We didn't have much money but never went without the essentials of food, warmth and love.Particularly in their younger days, my parents couldn't afford \"holidays\" as such but, along with various uncles, aunts and cousins, we would go off on a day trip for the men to go fishing, the women to have a good chinwag and the kids to all get together in one big group to run and play.  Happy days indeed, although frankly how they organized it all is beyond me.  In fact, I have wonderful memories of the women breaking out the old calor gas and making bacon sandwiches for everyone by the side of the river.  Ah that smell makes my mouth water even now and still brings back wonderful memories of times when it (obviously) never rained and we all had such fun.GranAnway, I was not yet born but my sister tells me of the time when the kids all got together on the banks of the River Avon to play blind man's buff.  Being typical kids they didn't see danger anywhere and so they blindfolded my sister, Gill, spun her around and then all the kids darted off in different directions.  The only problem was, Gill was dizzy (I mean, that was the point), and the river was right there, so of course within a few seconds Gill had gone straight into the River Avon blindfolded.As luck would have it, Gill was tiny and the reeds and lilies broke her fall.  The men flew over to where she had gone in and dad was able to fish her out with the help of his huge fishing net!!!!  No-one saw any danger at that age (well none of the kids at least) and thankfully all ended well.Sadly Gill died at age six, but like the little angel in the lilies, she is not forgotten.  Gill and dad﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿"},
{"title": "The famous St. S professional dance troop - or not!", "date": "Tuesday 7 July 2015", "text": "If you remember I wrote sometime ago about having a busy weekend, what with theatre on the Friday night, a day trip to Turin on the Saturday and our local neighbourhood clean-up/BBQ on the Sunday.  What an exhausting weekend that was, but very pleasurable indeed.As I said, after the clean-up of our little neighbourhood of around 25 houses, we got together to have a pot-luck BBQ.  In addition, just one week before my immediate neighbour's hedge had caught fire while his son was weed-whacking and about 10 families dashed out and for 30 minutes or so fought the fire until we brought it under control.  Man, hedges go up like - well tinder I guess.  It was and has been scorching hot (over 100 degrees) so I suppose we shouldn't have been surprised, but everyone pitched in and helped to get the fire out in the nick of time.So, this particular neighbour cracked out the champagne at the BBQ to thank everyone for their help.  Add to that, there was plenty of other booze, good food, noise and sunshine, so all in all a lovely day.However, I learnt to my cost that when said neighbour's wife mouths at you over the noise while doing a little jig, you must - on no account - nod your head in agreement!  Seemingly, what I had agreed to was to attend a lesson (stage in French) for tap-dancing on the evenings of 6th and 7th July for 2 and 1/2 hours a time!!!!  BUUUUUT I wasn't the only one.  All together we ended up being 6 \"budding artists\" who had agreed to go with her to a tap-dancing stage!!!  Now she has been taking tap lessons for the past year and loves it and, generously, thought we might too, so at the BBQ she took down names for the stage, signed us up and paid for it.  Bloody hell.  It has been consistently over 100 degrees for the past while here so who the hell wants to flail around for 150 minutes (non-stop) doing their dying swan impersonation in that?But since I secretly had visions of ending up like this:or even like this:I put my money where my mouth was and went along.WELL!  I don't know how I didn't snuff it.  But it wasn't just me.  It was SOOOOOOO hot, no air, and the teacher went SOOOOOOOOOOO fast and barely stopped to let us drink.  After a while I tried discreetly tap-dancing out the front door but he always caught up with us and hauled us back.  I did manage to grab my friend's 14-year old daughter and we tap-danced into a cupboard hoping he wouldn't notice, but no, we got dragged back in again.  I don't think I have ever sweated so much - none of us in fact.  But, I have to say, we had the greatest evening in fits of giggles, being a bunch of (mainly) middle-aged, overweight neighbours who all had our sense of rythmn amputated at birth!  We were in hysterics by the time we crawled walked back home.I have to admit we looked more like this:  Er not even actually. (That photo is taken from the Liza Minelli movie \"Stepping Out\" - which I can highly recommend btw).  To say the least, we were crap artistically challenged!!! But what a fun evening it was. However, I think the next time I'll stick to tiddlywinks.﻿"},
{"title": "And even busier - thanks for nothing!!!!", "date": "Friday 26 June 2015", "text": "I held off from posting about this for a while as I didn't want to post while my blood was at boiling point.  I thought somehow I might come over as a \"hysterical woman\" and have my rant put down to the \"time of life\".  Anyway, now that I am calmer, what do you think of this?In 2010, my f****-wit ex husband (let's call him P) stopped coming home in the evenings right after Christmas.  Not that I cared frankly because he was usually down town in one of those bars you see in Westerns where they all come crashing out through the windows at closing time (I mean, where-oh-where is John Wayne when you need him?).  Anyway mid-February 2010 he came home all dramatic and announced that he had something to tell me.  He had moved in with B (another bar habituée) and he would be filing for divorce.  (I tell you, I had to nail my feet to the floor to prevent myself from leaping ecstatically into the air - that would only provoke the little man).  So long story short, he moved out.  Then 3 weeks later he moved back in.  Then 2 days later moved out ..... can you see a pattern here?  Frankly she was/is as pathetic as him so every couple of weeks they would have a spat and he would move back in \"cos it's still half my house\".  Honestly, they were the worst months of my life, worse even than when he lived here full-time.  (I remember coming home from a lovely evening at the theatre one time and finding 2 suitcases AND A BLOODY GOLDFISH in the dining area - that was when I sat down and cried - sorely tempted to flush the goldfish down the loo - but I didn't!!)Anyway, eventually I  filed for divorce and it was finally granted but only after I agreed to take on all the debts AND pay his share of the notary's fees for him to allow me to buy him out of the house AND pay his lawyer's fees - for the divorce AND for his (latest) drink-driving case that was also going on.  Generous of him wasn't it - because if I didn't agree to it he was no longer going to sign the divorce papers.  And to think he goes round telling everyone how he gave me the house!So, moving seamlessly on, eventually Tweedledum and Tweedledee split up after she cheated on him with a \"friend\".  Then obviously he is devastated because there are obviously no more women in France and he hated being on his own.  SHAAAAME!Fast-forward a few years and I am deliriously happily divorced and he gets back in touch with an old friend from the US.  Oh, back up a bit.  In January of this year he gets himself what, according to my kids, is the sweetest dog.  Fast forward again and the new/old friend comes over from the States for three months and has a whale of a time with him throwing money around like it's going out of fashion (good job he didn't have to pay any lawyer's fees/notary's fees eh?)So then I get a phone call two Sundays ago asking if the kids had told me he was going to the States, so I said \"yes in August to see your mom\".  So he goes \"no, this Friday and I'm leaving definitively\"!  To make an ever-longer story shorter, he and the new gf (of three months) are buying a place together in the States.  When I asked about the dog he asked if I wanted it!!!! I told him if I had wanted one I would have gotten one, but since I am absent at work 12 hours a day I wisely didn't want one thank you very much.  So the poor dog gets shunted back to the dog's home and - get this - while he has given  notice on the 3-bedroomed farmhouse he was renting he hasn't emptied it \"in case the kids want anything\".  He just buggered off to the States on the Friday and left the house \"as is\".  I mean, he didn't even do the washing-up!I was furious.  I have enough to do without emptying out his shit and taking his rubbish to the tip.  And as for the garden, for a man who is retired and the garden consists of 5 rose bushes ONLY (I kid you not) I have never seen such a jungle which will take a good few hours to put right.Now I know you might think it's not my problem - which it isn't - but here in France responsibility for debts etc. goes on down the family line as far as the grandchildren so I don't want my kids to get into any hassle over this.  Add to that they can indeed take some of his stuff if they want it.  The rest, I will clean up and sell (thanks for the suggestion Sonya-Ann) but do I really, really want all this extra work right now?  I think not - but then again, if the good Lord now sees fit to put an ocean between me and him, maybe it will be worth it!!!Oh, and where are Steptoe and Son when you need them most?And you know what, this might seem like a bitter rant (I hope not) but it feels so good to write this down and see if other people think (a) I am just a bitter ex-wife (NOOOOOO), or (b) he has a few screws missing."},
{"title": "Busier than ever!", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2015", "text": "Crikey, I see it's been a while since I posted.  Trouble is I have been so frantically busy I haven't really known which way to turn.  My work is very cyclical (not sure that's a word) and the months of March - July are frantic and then October - December, with slightly less of a workload in between.  Not that I am complaining, I like to be busy and the time passes faster, but it does mean that some of the other \"stuff\" gets pushed to one side.On top of that are all the fun things I want to squeeze in so that I don't feel as though all I ever do is get up, go to work, come home, rinse and repeat.  Just lately though, the \"other things\" seem to be all happening at the same time.This weekend we went to see a very good production by the Geneva English Drama Society (GEDS) of Ben Elton's \"Popcorn\".  I'm not sure how Ben Elton would sum up his play but to me it was a very clever take on how nothing in current society is anyone's fault - it is always someone else's.  You have a Bonnie-and-Clyde﻿ type pair of murdering thugs who break into the home of a wealthy film director, famous for making very violent films.  While not wishing to spoil it for anyone who may want to see the play, the thugs blame the film director for making them kill people - it's never their fault you see - but according to the film director, nor is it his fault, so it must be society's fault .... and on and on.  I realized after a short while that I had actually read the book and while I tend always to prefer the book to the film/play, it was very well done, particularly given that they are all amateurs. I got home about 11.30 pm and then got stuff ready for the next day where I had to be up at 4.30 a.m. to get down into a local town for a trip to Turin in Italy.  The local bus services regularly put on trips to Turin as seemingly quite a few people like to go shopping there.  Turin itself is only about 250 km from here BUT they are 250 mountain km so not exactly a 2-hour jaunt, more of a 4-hour stomach-churning exercise. We went via Chamonix and the Mont Blanc tunnel - a very impressive feat of engineering I have to say, and then down through the Aosta valley and lovely Cormayeur.    I guess in total it took us 4 hours to get to Turin market.  The original plan had been to visit the cathedral but since the Pope was due to visit the next day all visits to the cathedral were cancelled for security reasons.  I can't say I minded though as we had a lovely time going round the market.  It is what I would call a \"working market\" as opposed to a \"tourist market\" - i.e. your fruit and veg market with a separate area for fish and meat and another large area for clothes.  Things were so much cheaper there than they are here in France and the fruit and veg stalls were wonderful. ﻿  (Cherries galore!!) Asparagus was €1 a kilo (as compared to between €5 and €8 per kilo here) and everything was so fresh and tasty.  I guess the Italians bring a lot of it up from the south in the earlier part of the year as it really does appear to be sun-ripened and not picked while it is still green and left to \"ripen\" (i.e. become tasteless) in transport trucks.  (As a side note, in 2003 a Turkish friend of ours organized a long weekend in Istanbul.  It was FABULOUS, all the more so because our friend was from Istanbul and obviously knew where to take us.  The food was so tasty and well prepared that apart from the tomatoes that I grow myself, I don't think I have eaten a shop-brought tomato since as there is just no taste to those perfectly-formed plastic monstrosities that they try to pass off as tomatoes in so many of the shops.) Anyway, I bought so much stuff I ended up having to buy myself a \"granny bag\".  Man are they great!  The only thing was, I wasn't sure if it was the wheels that were squeaking or my knees! ﻿ Top all that shopping off with a lovely (cheap) spaghetti carbonara in a local restaurant, and I felt like I had died and gone to heaven! On the way back we again stopped off in the Aosta valley at a hypermarket where many people wanted to stock up on wines, spirits and cigarettes etc.  I just bought some mozarella and parmesan, which was lovely and so much cheaper than round here.  So we got back around 9 pm tired but having spent a very pleasant day in Turin. I wouldn't do it often but I think I may take the trip again just before Christmas to go to their Christmas market.  Should be so pretty in the snow. Of course, just to add to the \"busy weekend\" the next day was our local \"neighbourhood clean-up\".  Once a year the group of about 25 houses in our little housing plan get together and spend a couple of hours cleaning up our own yards and common areas and then we all have pot-luck lunch together.  It really doesn't take long when you have maybe 30 people pitching in and the whole area looks so nice at the end of it. Our houses are built around a small island so that is where we all set up camp and ate together, and since the weather was great we had a lovely afternoon.  Time well spent indeed, although I was glad to get back to work for a rest!!"},

I spent a couple of hours wandering round Ikea (ok, trying to find my way out of Ikea) and then went straight to Arena, which is just next door.Well the concert was excellent.  Beautiful, powerful voices belonging to all these amazing people with so much rhythm and talent.  When I say \"rhythm\" I mean it quickly became obvious to me that I really am white once they started dancing around!  Just like it became obvious to me recently in Cuba when someone filmed me dancing salsa - I sure as hell ain't latina!!!  (To give you an idea of my \"rhythm\" picture Prince Charles in a dress and heels).  Anyway, I digress.  The choir were wonderful and had everyone up dancing and singing.  Since this was Geneva they even had the presenters trying to speak French - which went down very well I can tell you!Since I was already in Geneva I spent the night at a friend's house and when I took my boots off there was steam coming out of my boots - not to mention a very pungent odour!  Good Lord, thankfully I didn't try to kick my boots off at the show or no-one would have seen much through the steaming mist off my feet.So then last night we were back at Arena for the Harlem Globetrotters.  Now I have been a fan of the Globetrotters since I was a little girl and the Globetrotters 2015 didn't disappoint.  What a hoot they are - total professionals who made everything look so easy.  And again, this being Geneva they were having to try to speak French - much to the mirth of the little boy sitting next to me.  But honestly, they were great, and brought such joy to young and old alike.  In fact, I have just been sitting here watching old videos of the Meadowlark Lemon era and giggling away to myself.  Definitely worth going to see if they ever play near you.So tomorrow it's back to work to pay for my sins - but sins very much worth it.  It's good to have a binge-fest every now and again!"},

Well as you can imagine the boys weren't too thrilled about going to see Mary Poppins, but Lily (being the boss) insisted.  The boys later admitted it was absolutely amazing and said that they thoroughly enjoyed it (even taking into account the Italians sitting next to them laughing and clapping and loudly shouting out \"Bravo, Bravo, Bravissimo\"!)  They were delighted.  Taken outside the theatre on Broadway!﻿I'm not sure they have developed a taste for the theatre (boys being boys - or maybe just \"my boys being my boys\") but for me, it is a little piece of escapism that I thoroughly enjoy.  Who knows, one day when I have more time I may even get involved - I'm sure they need more people to help move the furniture around (that being the extent of my \"artistic\" talent!).  Strangely enough, it was only when I came to Geneva that I realized how \"weird\" we Brits must look at panto time.  But I mean, when the beautiful princess can't see that the handsome prince is really a young woman in knickerbockers, and the wicked stepmother is ALWAYS the one with the pointy nose with a wart on it, and nobody notices that the ugly sisters are actually men, despite an amazing tendency towards designer stubble, AND the actors can never see the plastic dragon that is always \"behind you\" - I mean, what's not to understand!  Maybe we Brits aren't weird - maybe it's \"them\"!    ﻿"},

{"title": "Benefits Britain", "date": "Wednesday 8 April 2015", "text": "Have any of you been watching the series on \"Benefits Britain\"?  I guess this is quite an inflammatory subject but this is my take on it.I feel that producing programmes like this is designed to rabble-rouse and set the country against these \"benefits scroungers\".  Goodness knows they certainly pick \"suitable\" candidates don't they?  I think it was Jane (I hope I got your name right) over at Shoestring Cottage who recently highlighted the case of an older disabled lady, unable to work, who by virtue of losing money due to the \"bedroom tax\" was in a very dire situation indeed.You know, I think the aim of these programmes is to pave the way for more cuts in the system and by highlighting some (though not all) \"benefits scroungers\" as foul-mouthed, beer-swilling, lazy, fat b***stards\" the powers that be are trying to make cutting all  benefits acceptable to the rest of us.Now while many of the people on these shows do need a bloody good kick up the backside, some, through no fault of their own, are caught in the benefits trap.  My own family lived for over 30 years in a 4-bedroomed council house while we kids were growing up (and all now working I would add).  If my mom and dad had not been able to buy it many years ago, my widowed mother might well have ended up in a position of having to move away from the neighbours and neighbourhood she had known for so many years because, (like the \"Shoestring\" lady), the council couldn't find her smaller accommodation.I realize of course that the country is in a mess and the issue of benefits is hugely controversial.  I had a friend staying with me one weekend last year when one of these programmes was on and he was getting more and more furious watching it.  But to my mind, the makers of these programmes were getting the reaction from him that they wanted in order to push through their own agenda.There are many foul-mouthed scroungers who have no intention of ever working - of course.  But conversely there are many, many people in seriously difficult situations often through no fault of their own.  Obviously when you look at the hundreds of \"refugees\" and \"asylum-seekers\" desperate to get through Calais to Britain you can see that there is something very wrong with a system that would encourage them to want to come to the UK and start claiming.  And while I feel for the people of Calais these refugees/asylum-seekers should indeed not make it further than their point of entry into Europe - which obviously will never be Calais.I don't know the answer but it seems the politicians don't either except maybe to make cuts for the weakest and most vulnerable members of society.  I recently read an excellent book called \"Chavs\" by Owen Jones.  It makes a great read if you are at all interested in this subject.  When did the working class go from being the salt of the earth to the scum of the earth?  Particularly while being robbed blind by certain people, for example those involved in the \"expenses scandal\", who will never know what it is to go cold and hungry.Anyway, not quite sure where this post came from but I felt I just had to get my thoughts down on paper to get it clearer in my mind.  Again, this isn't meant to be inflammatory but I'm buggered if I can figure it out.  A"},

{"title": "Financial independence", "date": "Monday 30 March 2015", "text": "I have been giving this a lot of thought lately.  \"Frugal in France\" mentioned it in one of her posts recently (sorry I don't know your name) and as far as I can see she is right - women need to have financial independence.  Now I don't mean to start a riot but financial independence makes so much sense - indeed I would see it as a necessity.Don't get me wrong, when my children were born I desperately wanted to stay at home to be with them and was actually jealous of my neighbours who got to do just that.  But circumstances being what they were I was obliged to work full-time and really felt that I missed out, especially when the kids were little.Fast forward 20-odd years and I am still working full-time.  BUUUUUT having got divorced after 26 years of marriage I am so eternally grateful to have financial independence.  My husband left me for another woman (that's the good bit) and both kids were still living at home (we'll ignore the fact that he wanted to come back 3 weeks later - yeah right, like that's gonna happen).  In the end I filed for divorce and it was having my job that allowed me to buy him out of the house (don't believe all the stuff you read about women taking men to the cleaners in divorce proceedings) and the kids and I were able to stay in the home we loved surrounded by friends and good neighbours.Now that I am no longer funding his spendthrift lifestyle and buying fancy clothes and cigarettes for the girlfriend I am actually saving money.  I reckon I cut my monthly bills by € 1,000 a month (yes you did read that right) after he left, and in that I don't include his phone bill, his car insurance etc.  Now I'm not some high-powered lawyer on a fantastic salary, I am a secretary.  The € 1,000 might seem incredibly high but living on the border with Geneva the cost of living is extremely high.My sister (in Denmark) and I were the first in our family to get divorced.  Not proud of it and there were the occasional \"we stuck it out and made a go of it\" comments (although not from family who knew the reality of our marriages).  But it was having an income of my own that allowed me to leave an abusive and violent relationship and keep the kids in the only home they had ever known.  I know everyone wants to believe that marriage to Mr. Right is just that and we will all sail off happily into the sunset but marriages do end, death happens and I have seen recent examples of ladies in their 50s who are in dire straits (sp?) due to divorce etc. and it breaks my heart to think of them in that situation with no prospect of retirement.I guess we always think the grass is greener on the other side.  However, and speaking only for myself, I have to say how glad I am that I still had my job all these years later.  And I now have a peace and contentment that I could never have known existed.A"},
{"title": "Wonky sheep", "date": "Friday 27 March 2015", "text": "Ted (my dad) was a funny man.  Not always intentionally, but funny nevertheless.  We called him dad of course but he never wanted to be called \"grandad\" so after the first (of 10) grandchildren, he ended up being called Ted.He had all these silly songs and sayings which we all remember to this day and they still make us laugh.  I was in Dorset to see my mom recently and my niece mentioned the \"wonky sheep\".  Mom is from North Wales where obviously there are loads of sheep, so Ted told my niece that sheep have legs shorter on one side to enable them to stand on the Welsh hillsides.  Said niece is now 35 and she was saying that she believed that baloney until she was at least 20!!!  I'm sure she's not the only one out there.  Score:  Ted: 1, niece: 0. Rachel taking care of Ted"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday 26 February 2015", "text": "This is my first time trying to set up a blog so goodness knows if this will even work but ......  So what to say first.  Well I am in my mid-fifties, divorced after 26 years with 2 grown sons and living in France.  I still, of necessity, work full-time (divorce was expensive) but I'm not complaining as I have a peace and contentment now which I haven't had for years.  This is MY TIME!  I'm sure that will resonate with so many of you.Why the blog?  Well a couple of years ago on a \"Solos\" trip to Turkey I met a lovely older lady who really inspired me.  She was 81 years old and had been widowed after 60 years.  She took up running in her 50s and ran her last marathon at 75.  Then she moved to Wales and was learning Welsh and belly-dancing.  She was an amazingly interesting lady and she encouraged me to \"write it down\" while I still could.  So that is what I am doing.For sometime I had meant to write down my random thoughts/memories from the past as my boys love the daft stories that still make us all laugh even today.  I had mentioned to my sister about starting a blog for that purpose so who knows she may well contribute too.  And my hope then (inspred by \"Cheerful Living\") is to maybe turn it into a book for my family's consumption later.What holds us together as a family is the ability to laugh and remember, so I am hoping this blog will be just that for my family.  A reminder of the fun from the past and hopefully the fun yet to come.  Cheers.  Anna"}
