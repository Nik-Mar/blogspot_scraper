Again, the fabrics are from those scraps my friend sent me.The exception is the center of the one below...See that fabric in the center?  It is more than 50 years old.  It is from the dress I made in Home Economics back in the day!  It is still good...not rotten.  I would love to have a yard or two of it now.  I still just love it.************Roger seems to have settled down.  He sleeps longer without getting up and is staying up later than he did there for a long while.I will leave you a shot of Jeremy with his new fashion accessory..."},

Buck, and Harold Bell Wright, and John Fox, Jr.  I doubt anyone here has heard of the last two.  I keep trying t get rid of things.  I wish I had the nerve to do a yard sale, but once I decide to get rid of things, I want them gone.************A video I came across...I think you will like it."},

I will make a quilt top of them, but just not sure how I will sew them together.    I wish I could stop making them but in times of stress, they are not precision based, can sew and then cut to fit.  They give my mind a rest from everything else.************Roger is feeling better.  I cannot say he is 100% better, but he is eating more normal, and looks so much better through his eyes.  According to some of the numbers from the labwork, he now has stage 3 kidney disease.  We see a dr. on Thursday.  I am hoping he will repeat the labs because one other time the numbers were bad when he was feeling real bad.  When he got to feeling better, we repeated the labs and the numbers were within the normal range.  I have had a cold...felt horrible for a while, but have come to the conclusion that I will live...LOL  So far Roger has not showed signs of getting it.  ***********The video today is long...it is not funny or heartwarming.  But I found it  interesting. I showed it to Roger and he enjoyed it.  I did not know chainsaws came with blades as long as the one used here for slicing the tree into thick boards.  Whoever thought of doing things this way is a genius...but it does make me think of something Roger would have come up with."},

She said I had done exactly right with the reduction in the oral medication and the insulin, and even reduced the insulin more.  And when she saw the cholesterol meds, she was almost what you would call upset.  Wanting to know why he was on so much.  He is on two different pills.  I told her it was from the cardiologists office.  She was going to have me eliminate one entirely, but I said how about cut back on the one.  So she said fine.  After doing that, in 24 hours he was some better.  Still he was not himself.  I gave it about 10 days or two weeks, and then cut it back to the original dose...that did the trick.  He is back to joking and teasing and being hungry.  ********I had MOH's surgery Friday...the first time showed no more cancer.  Hopefully it will not show up in that spot again.  This last time was just about exactly in the same place the first one was in years ago.  I am so thankful to God that there was no more.I have tried to get up the nerve to post a pic but it might gross you out...it is not a good pic but it sure is not fun to look at.  You look at it and say OUCH!  And maybe even 'ooooh, gross!'***********In the middle of this we had a major plumbing issue.  It is too long to go into.  Sarah came and got her day for a couple nights.  We had the drain back up late one evening.  I went to take the plug out of the sewage line to see if I could run the little snake and get anything to move.  When I went to twist the plug, the whole line broke!  They fixed it in about an hour the next night... a couple of good, decent working guys.  After dealing with the one company for all the hail damage a couple years ago, I am always so thankful for people that try to do a good job.I am not sure when or if I will be blogging again...I have to get stitches out either in a week or so.  Can go next Friday or else wait till Monday and I do dread it because the last stitch is so close to my eye.I am going to put a video here below...one that I came across just a few days ago:"},

You know how you stand something heavy one on a corner and move the other corner forward.  Anyway, I got it put together.  It has the heavy 'k-legs' and I forget what wood the top is made of but it is heavy.  It may partly be the metal inserts in it.  Anyway,  I feel like my machine is safe in it.  All of my machines are close to 30 lbs each.  I would not feel they were safe on a lot of the sewing tables that are made.  Besides the fact that they would vibrate bad.That is a long ramble....I am sorry to be that way.  I just could not think how to shorten it...even though I did leave out some details.*************Below is a video I may have shared before.  It cracks me up.  You got to follow the conversation...."},

If blood cells rupture while the technician is taking the blood sample or after he or she has obtained it, potassium can leak into the sample and cause a high reading. People with no other symptoms of high potassium should take a second blood test to ensure they are not treated for hyperkalemia if they do not have it.This sounds possible because the technician had trouble finding a vein.  And she could not even get it this afternoon.  She had to call in another lady to draw the blood.  The second lady got it first thing.I so hope that is all it is...the first time the labs said it was high, not a week before the Nurse Practitioner had had labs done and it was fine.  So it just never made any sense for it to be high.  His potassium level has always ran a bit low for the most part.So keep us in your prayers...."},

Some were given to me...some I do not recall from where they came.  Some were leftovers from other projects.Can you tell there is somewhat of hump in the middle...from about halfway on up.  There is an actual hump.  Two seams landed on each other and the backing is made of flannel and is thick and it just would not lay flat and stay flat no matter how much I ironed it!  I think quilting will help it, plus when it is washed the rest of it will fluff up and maybe it will lay flatter and be less noticeable.  Whatever happens it is no big deal because it is going to be a quilt to cuddle under  while watching TV.*******I got the above ready to post on Friday but wanted to add more.  Just did not get it done.  I came in here for something else and thought I might as well finish it.It has rained some today...not a lot, but enough for things to be damp.  And it is clouding back up like it might mean business this time.I am headed to the sewing room.  My older daughter was here this weekend and she played with my little Economy Blocks that are  made from solid fabrics.  I had wanted her to come help but hated to ask cause I know she works and has stuff to do on weekends.  And when we were over there last I did not think of taking them, and I don't think I had all of them made.Just a photo I hope will be pleasing to your eye..."},

But since it is going to hang on a wall somewhere, it doesn't really matter.  I am deciding what fabric I want to go between the blocks.  I am leaning strongly towards a gray fabric.  It will more than likely be a print...or at the least have texture.  White would not be bad, but I would need to make a couple or three replacements for some of the lightest blocks. I have did a couple loads of clothes today, vacuumed, and just a bit of this and that.  Plus tearing the foundation papers away from the backs of these little blocks and putting them on the design wall.  And I spent a LOT of time looking for a fabric I just had... probably less than two weeks ago.  Or at least it seems like less than two weeks ago.  I do not know why I did not put it back with the grays.I also just made up what I call roger's medicine packs.  I use what is called mini cups with lids and make up the morning meds in one group, and evening meds in another.  I do enough for 16 days...it is much simpler to do them several days at a time.  He takes about 5 or 6 that the drs. want that are OTC meds, and then maybe 12 that are prescriptions.  So, take a bit of time to get them made up.That is it for my day.  It is raining as I type this.  I hear a bit of thunder but nothing bad.  The rain comes for a few minutes, stops or else slows down to almost nothing.  Then it will sound heavy.  Good sleeping weather.*********This is an oldie I have shared before but it is worth listening to again...."},

When I took my glasses off and felt of my nose, it felt like it had been punched...was really sore for a couple days and then just stopped hurting.This one has bothered me more than any of them since the first one.  It bled a bit once when I was cleaning it...i have not had one bleed after removal till this one.  I always remember with my father-in-law that that was not good...but it does seem to be healing.I really don't know if there is any use of me staying out of the sun...but every time I am out doing something, I am wondering if I am causing more.  Part of me feels like now that I have had it, I will just keep getting it.  Well, friends if you are still reading...I hope you have a great week ahead.  We get our second shot on Thursday."},

Some were just small pieces that I totally cut up.  I tried to count the different fabrics and to the best of my ability I got 49, but I am thinking I probably missed at least one or two.***********On the fun side, how about a little synchronized chewing?It is funny, Copper does the same thing of acting like she just has to go out and gets Delta to thinking she has to go out too....then when Delta goes out, she runs and gets her bone or whatever chew toy she had that Copper wants.That is about it from my little corner of the world.  I hope you are having a great day."},

I could not turn the screw one little bit.  So I got WD-40 and sprayed them and decided to let them set and hopefully soak loose,  and then see if Roger would have any more strength. When he came up from the basement, I told him I needed his help.  This is what we ended up doing...he pushed in with all his might, and I used channel locks on the screw driver to turn it.  We got the one good screw off that way.  I went and got the Vise-grips and he got hold of the other screw it and got the vise-grips locked on and was able to get it that way.  But we have both laughed about it taking two adults to change the license plates.    I was thinking that I surely was not going to have to wait and have Jeremy do it.  *********The other thing is not so funny.  I ran to Walmart yesterday to pick up a few things, and came out and had locked my keys in the car...in the ignition no less.  Normally, I cannot lock the door with the keys in the ignition, unless I am sitting in the seat.   I tried to call Roger...to have him go get our neighbor to bring him with his key.  Well, since his stroke, he cannot answer the phone...too many buttons there.  He may get it right once in a dozen times.I tried to call our neighbor, but no answer.  Turns out I had one number wrong.  But he would have had a hard time getting Roger's attention to even get in and tell him what I needed.  So, I did not know who to call over there...in more ways than one.  A couple about our age was sitting waiting in the car beside me, so I motioned for her to roll down her window and told them I needed advice...and asked did they have anyone they would recommend to call to get my door open.There was a car dealership near us, so she ran and asked them...they called a wrecker service and they came right out and opened it.  But the lady and her husband would not leave until they were sure I was being helped.   And tried to get me to wait in the car with them.

When the car ahead went on, I just let her go...thought maybe she was running late.I got to the window, and she had paid for our breakfast, too!  That is it for this post....I am having a hard time concentrating.  Have not read a single line of a book since being here!  Just hard for me to settle in somehow.Hope you guys have a good weekend..."},

{"title": "Going to try explaining...", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2020", "text": "Joy, at Joyful Quilter asked me how I made the leaf.  I made another one yesterday and tried to take photos along the way.  I know I should have taken a couple more, but going to make do with the photos I took.  This post is photo heavy, and will may be boring to some of you...don't feel bad or feel like you have to comment...I tried to write how I did it without photos to email Joy, but it is just not the same as with pics.  (Please note, I forgot to change the copyright from Lorelei to my name...she did not take the pictures.)I used a piece of  paper and folded it in half, and cut out the leaf shape.  I opened the shape and cut in half from top to bottom, cutting a slightly curved edge down the middle.  As you can see I drew an angle on both pieces while they were laying face up, together.  This is a sort of guide/safety measure.  to give me a straight line to lay your first fabric strip against.  And also, this is to ensure I make halves that fit together when completed.Above we see first fabric pinned to the paper...it is lined up on one of those lines, though you don't see the line.  I will place another strip of fabric right sides down, along this piece and sew.  Then flip the fabric open and press.  Then place another fabric on top of that.  If I don't like how wide the fabric is, I can bring my next fabric back away from the edge and sew.  I continue on till the half leaf shape is completely covered by fabric strips.  I used a basic 1/4 inch seam through out, but this is one part that the seam does not have to be exact.  And in a case like above, I trimmed away the excess of the fabric on bottom but that is not absolutely necessary.I totally forgot to take a pic from the top of the piece...but as you can see, it looks a mess till trimmed.  I always prefer to lay on the cutting mat and trim with rotary cutter along the edge of the paper foundation.Next I choose a fabric for the stem.  I want it a bit longer at the top especially, and I should have left more room at the tip than this shows.  I lay the fabric RIGHT SIDE UP and then place one leaf half RIGHT SIDE UP on the chosen fabric.Again, use the rotary cutter and trim along the edge of the half leaf.  Now, remove the paper from the back of the leaf and place the leaf and the stemfabric right sides together and take to sewing machine and sew using a quarter inch seam.  They look like they can never be sewn together but you just sew a few stitches and manipulate the fabric.After sewing, use iron to press the fabric away from the leaf.  See how nice and flat it lays...Then take the other half of the leaf and place on top of the stem fabric.   Remember both should be RIGHT SIDES UP.   I usually start at the wide part a bit over an inch wide and then angle it till it gets narrower.    I don't really know if anyone will try this, but if anyone does, if you make the vein too narrow there can be a mess with the seams being too close together.  I don't mind the little bit at the tip, but not sure if it could be made to press flat if it was that narrow all along the vein.  Again, trim along edge of leaf half, remove paper, and place right sides together and take to sewing machine.A new leaf is born!"},

Partly cause I cannot remember if I have ever reposted it.***********************I debated on posting about this but I just want to share it, though I doubt if I can make you understand the way I feel about this place.Once upon a time, when my husband and I were young and had stars in our eyes and thought all things were possible, we decided to quit our jobs here in Terre Haute, Indiana and move to Tennessee, my home state. We moved to the little house/cabin in the top picture. I have no idea how old it is, but I have loved that place since I can remember. I still love it, and would move there in a heartbeat--though I don't know what I would do with all my sewing and my husbands things would not fit anywhere there. But there is no house on earth that I would trade that place for if it were mine.The other picture is one of the views we had from our front yard. And you go on up the holler past that barn to get to the place that Neal and all of us lived...where most of us were born.  (I was and one brother was born in the hospital.)When we lived up there, my mom's best friend lived at this house pictured here.In our case, my best friend/sister-in-law lived less than half a mile on down the road from us, and my mom a little bit farther. I visited with both daily, either by phone or actual face to face...and it took me forever to be broke from that when we moved back to Indiana. But it was so good while it lasted.Out by the barn, I had a garden that would be by most standards a big garden--I had potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, hickory cane corn with cornfield beans growing up those stalks, bush beans , cucumbers, and what all else I cannot remember. I canned beans, and sold beans, and canned sliced green tomatoes and made tomato juice. And canned whole tomatoes. We bought peaches and I canned those. My husband could shoot his guns off the front porch if he wanted, though he always got out in the front yard and used a picnic table as a rest. He could get in I think 500 yard shots to sight in his rifles....he could shoot his bows in the front yard as well...it was the ideal for us.I got to stay home while he first got a job at a local college, and from there a lumber yard, and then he got to go to a vocational school and learn to weld. Well, being a little older than the students out of high school, he got along real well with his teacher who was a wonderful man.There was also machine shop classes taught there--and it had a remedial course it taught two nights a week for people that needed refresher courses. Roger talked to that teacher and he agreed to let Roger come and set in on those...he would not get credit or anything but he would still have some knowledge of lathes, etc. So he really took advantage of everything he could there and it has served him well throughout his life. I do not know what the hold is that this place has over me...most of the time autumn makes me so homesick for it. And I dream about it...not as often as I used to, but often enough. And I don't like to wake from the dreams. I always try to go back to sleep and dream more. There is just a feel to the place...it has always had a hold over me.When we were kids, the owners of this place lived in Michigan and we mowed the yard for them. I loved having that excuse to go up there and go in the house. It never seemed to get hot enough to matter in the summer...about all we ever did when we lived there was open the window in our bedroom and open the back door. The cool air coming off that mountain cooled everything out.I am linking this to Timeless Thursdays...a bit late."},

{"title": "Etc....", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2020", "text": "First, before I get into this post, I want to apologize for the small print of yesterday's post.  I have no idea why it was that way.  I have had that post started for a long time.  I may have made a note in a draft email and copy and pasted it.  That is the only thing I can think of.When I notice it earlier tonight,  I tried to go fix it.  And had a heck of a time getting it to correct.  I highlighted the entire message, and increased the size, and clicked to publish.  But when I looked part of it was better and part wasn't.  I went back and redid the part that the size did not increase...again, part of it 'took' and part didn't.I just walked away for a couple hours, think we actually went on for a short drive through the strip pits and came home and finally got it fixed.  Again, I am sorry for it being such a pain to read.Peek-a-boo!  This is from the strip pit late this evening.  There is a better picture of one over on my Time Stand Still blog.I did not sleep a wink last night...but did sleep a couple hours after I gave Roger his meds this morn.  So today I had to stay busy  or I would have fell asleep if I sat down long enough to relax.  I was looking for a list I had just seen a bit back...but also wanting to get rid of some of the 'paper' stuff and I did get rid of a pretty good pile.We ran and got a hamburger, and then I went to the sewing room and actually cleared up a small area, and then got borders ready for the leaf quilt.  I have had the small border on for a few days, but was debating on if I had enough fabric for the wide border.  I have an app on my phone that tells you how much you need...and it was saying I needed more than I thought I did.  So since I didn't trust my mind I finally sat down with pen and paper and figured and I did have enough.So I got two of the borders cut to size and sewed on.  The other strips have been sewn together, but need to be cut to length.  I am hoping I can get that done tomorrow.  But I would also like to go for a longer drive, too.  And I need to get up and go to Walmart early.  But I might wait till Monday.  I don't really like to go on the weekend.I was going to show another pic or two from the strip pits, but will wait till another day.  I just wanted to apologize about yesterday's post.  Thank you for taking the time to comment...it was fun to read everyone's comments.I just remembered I had not showed these...I think if it was convenient, that I would buy myself cut flowers every now and then.  They brighten up a room so...why wait till someone dies to give flower************* I saw an interesting post on another blog, I have commented a time or two on the  blog but never got any kind of response*, never a return visit...never a reply through email...but I still go and read every now and then.  Her post was about finding books to read. Her topic was books to read and how she finds them.   1.  If you like to read,  how do you decide what to read?  2.  Do you have a certain genre of books you like to read or do you read two or three types or a wide variety? 3.  Do you still go to the library? 4.  I know at least one of you wants an actual book to read...one of my daughters is the same way.  I was the same way for a long time and resisted getting a kindle.  But then I started noticing all the old books I could get free.  So, I got it for those if nothing else.  Then found out it was so much easier on my eyes.  I could read a lot longer. Next, I found newsletters that give links to books that are on sale, or free, and have found some great books, completely free that I would never have bought. There is the other side of that coin though...some books I want both the hard copy and the digital. But there are some that I would never have found a hard copy.Another thing, do you still buy and/or read magazines?  I bought two quilt magazines last year, for the first time in years. I do still have a wide variety of quilt magazines here at home, and some I actually do go back and read or look at for inspiration.  Some I have given to one of my daughters.  But I never throw quilt magazines away.  If I don't want them, some quilter will."},

The very top one with the gold vine/leaves is a fabric I made pjs with, all the rest used for these are from those scraps I buy.  The mask is reversible?--not sure what the word is.  Each one takes two 6 inch by 9 inch pieces of fabric...so either side can go out.  And I use two different fabrics on each one.While I was picking out fabrics for these, I found two scraps of orange that I will use for leaves...and also found a scrap of orange fabric I used in a dress for Lorelei.  I was so happy to find it...I had been meaning to look for it but kept forgetting.************I am still waiting on fabric to finish my other project...the fabric is supposed to be here Saturday.  Hopefully when it comes I can get busy with that.  I hope all of you are okay while we stay home.   The staying home does not bother me too bad...though I would dearly love to get out for a slow, rambling drive.  For the most part, I have really enjoyed not getting up and getting ready to leave ever morn.Normally, I try to find a little something funny to post...but today I leave you with a 7 yr. old...Hope you enjoyed it...I hate to think what I would have sounded like at that age, not that it isn't even worse now."},

{"title": "Not so great image and video...", "date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2019", "text": "As usual we were headed to McDonald's this morn...a lot of morns we choose to go to one in a neighboring town...for a couple of reasons.  They remodeled ours and we neither one really like how it is now.  Not enough booths, and there is no color...everything is gray and black, except for a few light shades that are red.But that is not the point of the story.  We always like to go to the neighboring town and watch for hawks on the way, and we occasionally go through the end of the strip pit area.  As we were about to pass the road into that area, I noticed all the geese in the area and quickly turned down the road.  And soon as I did, down the road I saw two Bald Eagles fly across the road  at a very low altitude.So I spead down the way as fast as I could to get across from the snow geese and to look for the eagles.  I did spot one of the eagles all the way across the field in a tree beside the big strip pit.When my camera is as zoomed in as close as it will go, I never get good quality photos, but at least you can see him.  When looking without zoom, unless you are really looking you would never have seen it.  That is how far away he was.  I could just see little white dot...I had to get the binoculars out to really see. Then try to find him with my little P&S.All told today, we saw at least 6 eagles, and two more, but I really think one was one of the first two we seen cause I had focused on the one and did not see where the other went.  And then another one was where we later seen two more...so am assuming it stayed there a while.Below is a short clip of the snow geese...I recommend turning your sound down  or off...the wind was horrible.I could not hold the camera steady ....partly the wind.  Partly just me I guess.********I do have my tree up, and the lights on but that is as far as I have got.  I am thinking we will decorate it tonight...It is a pathetic tree...I bought it new last year, because it does not take up much room.  But you can see right through it.  But I am living with it again this year.  I hope I remember how much I hate it and next year soon as the trees come out, I want to go look for a new one."},

{"title": "Notes...", "date": "Wednesday, November 20, 2019", "text": "I just got home from Walmart a little bit ago and got unloaded.  Roger had the TV on and it was on the music channel and a concert.  It ends up it is a dukes mixture of artists.  First on was Joe Walsh, then I don't remember who was next.  Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  For one.  Then Michael Martin Murphy sang Wildfire, which was bad enough...Then Richie Furay sang this:I sat here with the tears streaming...it always makes me cry.  I do not know why.   Is anyone else like that with music...even the theme music to some of the shows we watch either brings tears or makes me feel like crying.  Run for the Roses was written by Dan Fogelberg.  If you don't like the song, shut sound off and watch the slide show of foals and horses.**************Anyway, for some good news.  I went to the dermatologist yesterday and she didn't see anything that concerned her.  She is going to watch one mole.  I refuse to worry about it most of the time in between visits, but come the day or two before and I really begin to dread going.    But I am thankful that I have the holidays free of that worry.***********My leaves are done, as well as the gutters are all clean for one more year.  The guy that we had mow our yard mulched the leaves, and got up and blew out the gutters.  I feel like a ten ton weight has been lifted from me.  It was just always there in my mind.  The gutters more than anything.  The leaves I could have eventually got done by myself.  But now that is nothing to worry about.  And the way the weather has been, it would have been hard to do.  *******************I had been looking at this book, then a blogger had this on her blog....I thought I knew who.  Well, I must be crazy cause I could not find it on her blog...so I thought maybe it was on this other blog...but no not there.  Anyway,  I have borrowed Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens from the library and I am really enjoying it.  I always enjoy seeing what other people are reading.I feel like I am forgetting something but going to go ahead and post this.  I hope you all are having a good week."},
{"title": "What's happening....", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2019", "text": "I got the binding sewn on my daughter's quilt...just the first round by machine, and have started the hand stitching part.  Normally I can whip through a full or queen in about 3 days, but have not touched this today.  And last night when I started it was no walk in the park.  the thread wanted to tangle, even after using beeswax on it.  It knotted up at every little stitch, and I even had to break it once, and take out stitches enough to thread the needle till I could finish off that bit of sewing till it would not come undone.I got this fabric panel in the hopes it will inspire a baby quilt...  The way things are going, it is questionable whether I will get anything done any time soon.  but isn't it cute?************I have been doing things in baby steps it seems.   Cannot seem to totally finish anything.  I got boxes broken down again...still have a few but they would not fit into the box I was using.   I  order some of the pet supplies from Chewy because it saves Roger and I from handling some of the heavier items so many times.   Then there are things we order from Amazon on a regular basis...so we always have quite a few boxes at the end of 4 or 5 months.I have had to let the leaves go but today got a few more raked up.  Roger kept coming to check on me...it is too hard on him to try to help, but he feels guilty if he don't.  So all I did was 4 big bags.   The leaves were still damp from the snow, and still some snow on the ground out behind the garage because it doesn't get much sun.   We saw ice still on a couple roads today.  I could not believe there was any left any where.**********Roger went to bed with a headache...any time he has one it still scares me so bad.  Specially right at first.  I can usually talk to myself and remember that this is to be expected...but it takes a while to settle down and not be on edge.  Lately he stumbles so easily.  I cannot tell you how many times I have thought sure he was going to fall.  Oh, it may not be every day,  but it probably is every other day.  Besides the fall in the bedroom two or three weeks ago, I think he has only fallen twice...and one of those he fell back on the bed.  So in ways not a fall, but if the bed had not been there, he would have been on the floor.************It is funny...at night, Bubbie always has to go over to him in his chair but he always comes back to me.  When he was young, Bubbie was all Roger's and our daughter's....I was only needed when he was hungry.  But boy has he changed to a mama's boy.I guess I will hush for this night....I hope you all have a good week ahead..."},
{"title": "memories....", "date": "Tuesday, November 12, 2019", "text": "I was washing dishes yesterday, and I got to thinking about my sister, Fran.  The above post card was one she sent in the 1960's...but that is not what I want to write about.  Though how I ended up with it is more than I know.  And it has been in my kitchen cabinet for a long time.  I get it out and touch it and read it every now and then.Of our family, I think she was the favorite of us all.  Here is one story about her...and I thought I would share another story that again shows how she was.For a few years when the kids were young, we were living pay check to pay check...I just had to plan every dollar.  Well, this one Christmas, I had to wait till the day before to buy groceries to do Christmas dinner.  I don't remember if I already had the ham or not, because I would buy it ahead if I could catch it on sale.  Well, Christmas Eve was my in-laws wedding anniversay and we had to go there to see them and take their anniversary gift.I was thinking we could visit with them and run by Kroger's there near them to pick up groceries.  I don't remember if I actually went and left Roger there with the kids, or if I called, or how I found out, but Krogers was closed!  I called our local grocery here in our town, and they were open but would be closed before we could get home.  So I called my sister.She made a list of what I needed and I told her how much I had to spend.  I don't remember the amount...but every penny was planned.  Well, we visit a bit more and then head home and stop by my sister's to pick up the groceries...I paid her the money and we loaded up and came on home.My, oh, my what had she done!  I cannot remember what all there was extra...there were mixed nuts, there was ribbon candy, and I don't remember what all else was in the bags.  But she had probably come close to spending twice what I told her.  Just getting things she thought we would enjoy.   And would not think of letting me pay her.Just such sweet memories.  I hope you have some to share...it would be fun to hear some good, heartwarming stories."},
{"title": "A little show and tell...", "date": "Sunday, November 10, 2019", "text": "This shows the block before I totally finished the applique...  The black basting line is basting the leaf shape to the freezer paper base.  The white stitching stitches the shape to the background fabric.Showing the stitching...the thread is more orange than it looks in the photo, but not as orange as I wish it were.Here you see the stitches on the back of the block...Above you see I have cut the background away from the behind the leaf and am removing the freezer paper.   One thing about this freezer paper, I don't think it is as good as what I used to get.  It does not feel as heavy and makes crinkling sounds.And here is what it looks like after the basting is all removed and the freezer paper removed.I have only finished the applique part of a few of them.  All the others I have finished still has the freezer paper and basting in them.  At the rate I am going, it is going to be a long time before I finish them all...have several things going and need to start another one...and yet I do so little.************I raked a bunch of leaves yesterday...well, 8 big garbage bags stuffed full as I could stuff them.  But that is nothing to what I used to rake at one go.  I had raked 4 a few days ago.  I still have quite a few to go, and keep waiting for the rest of the leaves to fall from a neighbor's tulip poplar and another neighbor's maple tree.  Bubbie was my constant companion through it all.*************I think I am warming up leftover meatloaf for supper...we need to eat on it.  Seems like at times, I love meatloaf and will have made one that is on the small side.  Then I make one a bit bigger, and we don't seem to enjoy it as much.  Anyway, I need to get in there and at least set it out.  I will actually probably put it in the oven later and let it warm up that way.  Most of the time we just warm up what we eat in the microwave.I should have been outside working in leaves...but I have sat here instead.  And I did sew a few stitches.I don't know if it was real bad allergies or what, but was sick a couple days this past week...but it passed quickly.  My throat was sore and I blew and blew and blew my nose the first morn.  Normally, Roger never volunteers to stay home for breakfast, but he looked at me and said, 'We don't have to go anywhere this morn....don't even worry about it.'  I don't know if it was how I sounded or how I looked or both.  LOL  I always sound and feel worse early in the morn.  I hope you all have a good week...I feel like I am forgetting something I wanted to ask but cannot think what it is for the life of me."},
{"title": "Deer season....a funny", "date": "Tuesday, November 5, 2019", "text": "Being that hunting season is here, and I have heard it mentioned elsewhere, it brought to mind this story.  It has been published a couple times before,  but whether you hunt or not, I think you might find this at least amusing...maybe even funny.  It is one of the stories that would only happen to my husband.  Or his cousin.************************A friend wrote a story about one of his hunting excursions. Being the wife of a hunter and sister to hunters before that, I could identify with a lot he said. About 5:00 being the witching hour for hunters, or for my husband when he is meeting fellow hunters it is sometimes even earlier. Also, unlike rotten apples to disguise the human smell, hunters now have doe urine. I wouldn't want to mistake that for my perfume, now would I, but that is besides the point.This is a story of one of my husband's hunting trips. A few years ago he decided to hunt out on property near the orchard where I worked. It actually belonged to the brother of my boss. A day or two before the planned hunting trip, he and his buddy went out to decide where they were going to put their tree stands, and in so doing had to hack out a path through some of the undergrowth.On the morning of the hunt, they met here before going out there...it is at the most 10 minutes from here. They get out of the truck out there and the farm cat greets them. It is young, not even a year old.  Roger pets it just a second and he and his buddy proceed down the path...they get to the 'y' in the path and his buddy goes one way while he goes they other. The cat follows my husband.He is hunting with bow and arrows, and hunting from a climbing tree stand. So he gets to the tree he has chosen to use, and gets his tree stand situated on it and climbs up the tree. I am not familiar enough with the process to paint a good picture, but it is a tree stand that he does the physical climbing with. It has two parts....one part is the actual seat and the other is the part he stands on....THIS is a video from you tube and does show how his works.When climbing up to a tree stand, he always ties his bow to a long rope and once he gets up as high as he is going to go, he pulls the bow up with the rope. He gets the bow up and gets situated...he hears this meow. It is still practically dark, so he kind of looks but doesn't see anything. He sits back, and he hears it again! And he can hear it so plain...he does not have the best of hearing. So he gets his flashlight out and bends way over the tree stand while shining it all around and still doesn't see anything.He sits back again and hears it again! And he felt something on his legs...he looks down at his feet and there sits the kitty! It had sat by his feet as he climbed up the tree. It proceeded to climb up into his arms, purring all the while, and doing the rubbing thing that cats do when they are happy to see you. He held it out at arm's length and dropped it!Did it run for home you might ask. The answer would be no. It played around the bottom of the tree my husband was in, chasing leaves or anything else that caught it's imagination. After a while of playing, it climbed out onto a dead log and went to sleep!This is an honest tale; I don't have the imagination to make something like this up. And this is only the tip of the iceberg--things like this continually happen to my husband, my older daughter, and my husband's cousin."},
{"title": "How sweet is he???", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2019", "text": "At some point almost every day, this guy snuggles in my lap...and sometimes two or three times a day if I set down.  He spends a lot of time outside, and comes to meet us when we come home.  He will walk in front of us and flop down on the sidewalk and squirms around.  He wants us to play with him.  If we walk around him and go on, he jumps up and runs back in front of us and does it again.When I am outside doing something, he is usually not far away.  As long as I don't have something that makes a lot of noise.   If I sit down to take a break, all I have to do is say his name or pat my leg and here he comes.The past year or two, he has started getting in behind the curtain like above.  I would love to know what goes through his mind.   We used to play hide and go seek.  I would run and there is a certain way/beat I pat my legs and call his name and it is Game ON.  Then I remain quiet and let him come hunt me....I jump out and scare him.  He is a jumpy cat...he is so easy to scare.  Anyway, I scare him and he takes off and I run to tag him.******************I raked a few leaves this afternoon...did a load of laundry... a tiny bit of housework...just this and that.  But felt good to accomplish a little.  Leftover chili for our evening meal.  Roger was even content with it.  I don't mind soup at any time but Roger is not crazy about soup in warmer weather.****************This is my current read...O Rugged Land of Gold by Martha Martin.   I saw it as a movie years ago and when it told it was based on this book I looked at the library and believe it or not, they had an old copy of it.  It was hard backed and well worn.  And I read it probably a couple times over the years.   And I told a blog friend about it as well as some of my other favorites.  So in talking to her, I decided I wanted to read it again, so I just ordered my own copy.  And it is as good as I remembered it."},

{"title": "Shhhhh--don't tell anybody", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2019", "text": "A year or two before Roger's stroke, I got a sewing machine to keep upstairs.   In the dining room.  Till I could look outside and see the sun when I sewed.  But I kept bring up stuff and adding more...I had all you see in these two photos stuffed in my dining room.  (To be honest, we seldom use it as a dining room these days.)    But still, when I get to working on stuff, it is a total mess.So today was the day...I had a bedroom I kept free of everything except a couple items...to have to spread my quilt sandwich out to pin baste.  But since I can no longer get down on my knees, I decided to move everything in there.  I cannot begin to tell you the chore that was.Roger was helping me move that tall shelving unit in the top photo...it is not heavy at all.  I had taken everything off and it was easy to carry.  I walked backwards till we got in there, and had Roger take his end around...and he started falling backwards and could not stop.  I have no idea why he fell...he knocked over a chair, knocked over the ironing board and my drying rack...he was not hurt.   He did not hit his head..it was almost like he went down in slow motion. He sent the iron flying, along with everything I had sitting on the ironing board.  I was thankful the iron fell away from him and did not flip back and hit him on the head.  In the photo above, a couple things are still on the floor.  I was texting with my daughter and sent her pics as I was cleaning up the mess.  Let me reword that...I was picking stuff up off the floor.  A lot of stuff still needs to find a home.********In trying to get to Roger when he was falling I did this...My little finger does not tip up that way normally.   I am not sure what I done...it does not want to bend down when it is flipped up like that but I can bend it down and if  I keep my hand half closed it will stay better.  If I open my fingers out, it flips up right away,  It is hurting a little now, and the least bump gets a big OUCH from me."},
{"title": "A bit of a start....", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2019", "text": "I did cut some squares this evening...as a start...that is what the orange leaves are going on.  The squares are all shades of gray/white...some have a real warm undertone others not so much.  Not sure how they will work together but I am using them all.I first fold the square to form diagonal lines...the one line I want to go all the way across, the other is just to give me a suggestion of where the middle is.I first place the leaf tips on the folded line...and I use one straight pin on top on one end to hold the leaf in place as shown in the above photo.I hold the other end in place with my hand, and continue to place pins to hold the leaf in place from the back.And I might or might not move the original first pin to the back.  The reason for doing it like this is till my basting thread will not catch on the pins as I baste the leaf down.After it is all basted, I remove the pins....All that is left now to applique it."},
{"title": "An Autumn report....", "date": "Saturday, October 19, 2019", "text": "Autumn is on its way....I am not sure how vivid it is going to be...but it is done better than what I feared.  So many leaves fell, and other trees just looked like they were just drying up, ready to fall.  Some I knew to be maple trees that usually have vivid color.See that bright spot of color in the photo above?This is what it looks like up close and personal!  For some reason when I take shots of trees from a distance, they appear much greener than they do in real life...even in that first photo, it does not appear near as saturated as it does in real life at that distance.  So I was very pleased to see the color of the leaves in my up close shots.They were beside this strip pit....it is an area known as Green Valley.  I did cast a few times but did not get a single hit...did not catch one single fish. Still was so nice to be out and hear the wind in the trees...and part of the time Blue Jays were flitting about in the trees.Roger went with me, but he did not get out and walk any.  I want to get back over there if I can before it gets cold.  It felt so good to be out and away from everything.  I could actually forget some of the other stuff going on here.I have been trying to get Roger's Cpap supplies and it is taken forever...it is too long for anyone to really want to read it...but I started back maybe the second week of September, but might have been earlier.  And just yesterday they finally told me oh, yes he needs a new prescription.  This in addition to other things they need.  I have been calling them and the other dr. office and it has not been fun.The one thing, the dr's office has always been so, so good...I am not criticizing them.  The Cpap place I have yet to form a real opinion....because the dr's office told me that the supply place is undergoing a big audit from someone.  So they probably have more than they can handle.  Prior to this, they have been very nice to deal with.I hope you guys are having a nice weekend...First a little video from youtube showing someone using a rotary cutter and how you use an acrylic ruler to cut the fabric.There was no way for me to photograph myself using the rotary cutter and I did not even think to take a photo of the rotary cutter itself.  This video is only 42 seconds long so it won't take long to watch.  The rotary blade is very sharp and will cut you in a heartbeat if you do not keep your fingers out of the way.  And it is very important to \"close' the rotary cutter when not in use.  Mine have a guard that I slide into place.  Some automatically close.  A self healing mat is needed because it would destroy the top of your table if you didn't use one.  *****************So last night I got to thinking about the binding I had just made.  I thought about it and things did not add up....and I realized I had made enough for three sides of the quilt...not the 400+ inches that I needed, so today I cut three more strips and got them added to what I already had made.  I took the opportunity to take a few photos.Above is just a portion the my acrylic ruler.  To being I place post-it notes on the underside at the exact desired width.  I usually use about 3 post-it notes per stack, and this is a 24 inch ruler so I have 4 stacks placed 4 or 5 inches apart.  I don't put right at the edge of either end.  I just leave my fabric folded in half like it comes off the bolt.  I use lines that also go across the width of the fabric to line up on the fold and then cut the end off enough to make sure the end is even.  From there, I can just measure so easily and cut my strips.I am floundering here...probably trying to tell you too much, and making everything about as clear as mud.  If you ever want to make something, be sure and watch some youtube videos, because there is more to this than what I have told.Anyway, I cut my strips...and next I get ready to sew them together.Batiks do not really have a wrong side....they are dyed, not printed.  But if these were printed, the right sides or pretty sides as some people call them would be facing each other.  Notice that one edge of each strip is lined up on one of the mats lines. forming a 90º angle.Next I use a ruler to draw a line across the strips.  This is my sewing line...I put my needle right in the very corner and sew across to the other corner...It then looks like the above before pressing and before trimming off the ends.Here it is trimmed and pressed open and then pressed in half...you have to look close to see the seam.I like to connect the pieces this way rather than just sewing straight across the ends...it just means less bulk in one spot  when sewing to the quilt.That is it for now...I am very weary and want to sit back and relax."},
{"title": "Fabric ", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2019", "text": "First I have to show you this Moda fabric I got the other day...it was the end of the bolt so got a bit over two yards for a pretty good price.  BTW, for those that don't know, Moda is a a brand of fabric....you know how jeans have makers such as Levi's, Wranglers, Lee Riders....you would not believe all the brands of fabric.  But Moda is one of my favorite brands...along with all the rest of them.  LOLGiving the second view to give you scale...the cutting mat it is laying on has lines every inch....but that first photo gives the real feel of the fabric.  I had gotten some of this in a bag of scraps and hated to even use it  I like it so well....and my daughter likes it, so one of us will find a use for it.  Right now, I just like admiring it.  LOL********I got the binding made for my daughter's Lotus Quilt...she had the top quilted by a shop with a long arm quilting machine.I just love the fabric daughter chose.  This is over 400 inches of binding.I wanted to show this view.  First I cut strips of fabric the width of the fabric.  In this case the strips are 2 1/4 inches wide, and sew them together--end to end.  If I had thought I would have taken pics to show how I do that.   But maybe you are not interested in that anyway.  Then I fold the fabric in half  and press, and fanfold it as I get enough pressed.  That way I can put it down by my right side and it does not become a tangled mess as I sew it to the quilt.Hope everyone is having a good week."},
{"title": "A peek at life", "date": "Tuesday, October 15, 2019", "text": "This is a scene from yesterday as we drove to Arthur, Illinois...I put other, different photos of these over on my other blog...this Amish buggy is heavily cropped.Someone I know is expecting a baby and I was hoping to get ideas for a baby quilt but had no success.   I was hoping to find a fabric to build one around.  The quilt shop I go to is for sale and though they get in  new fabrics they have a lot of empty spaces that used to be filled with fabric.  I so wish someone would buy it and keep it going strong.***************I made a few more 4-patches day before yesterday...I keep thinking I am going to get back to sewing a little bit every day but it just does not happen.********************I went out this afternoon and planted some bulbs I had picked up a few weeks ago...I took time to photograph a couple cottonwood leaves.I hope the bulbs live...I could not decide where to plant them so just found some space and stuck them in the ground.  I did use a shovel some and was able to handle it fine.  I had not used one since I broke my leg...it felt completely normal.  In fact, I think it would probably be good for me to use one a lot.**********On the reading front, I just finished listening to my one book, A Land More Kind than Home this evening while fixing supper and started listening to the Wesley the Owl one...I did not get to listen very long, but have done learned one fact.  It said that Barn owls are monogomous, and sometimes when their mate dies, they sort of lose the will to live and will die of grief.I also started reading All-American Murder:  The Rise and Fall of Aaron Hernandez, the Superstar Whose Life Ended on Murders' Row by James Patterson.  I tend to read true crime books every now and then.  I have no idea why.  I don't want a steady diet of them...just one or two here and there."},
{"title": "Do you ever...", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2019", "text": "Lorelei went to spend some time with her favorite aunt.  Delta loves her, but right now she is wanting her attention, wanting a skittle I believe.  What is funny, when Lorelei is around, Delta stays by her.  I don't know if it held true this time, but she usually stays by her till she gets up.  I told my daughter, Delta would go bonkers over a baby.When we are there, she barks at people walking by....but I feel like I can tell a difference in her bark when this one woman walks by with her baby in a stroller.**************Do you ever have a day you have so much to say, but no time to say it in?  Then when you get time, you can't get in the mood to say anything...nor remember what all you wanted to talk about before.The other day was one of those days when I was busy.  I cannot remember what all I did...the one thing was a file cabinet came that I had ordered from Amazon.  When I opened it, several pieces had bent edges...talk about disheartening.  I did contact the seller right away.  At first I was seriously thinking I would return it.  Partly because of all the 'damage' and partly because the instructions were not good... all on one page back and front.  They would have been fine if the sketches were not so small, but was so hard to see.  And it was only sketches...no words.  Which photos are what I need anyway...but they were such a struggle to see...I just had to guess at the details.I ended up leaving a piece out....thankfully it was unimportant to me and did not bother me, but would have been bad if I was planning on locking it.  That part was all bent and kinked around...not sure how good I would have been at getting it back in shape to use anyway.  So, the vendor had contacted me and asked if I wanted to return or replace it.  I had mulled it over in my mind, and thought I would just see if I could make it work.  So I told him we were going to work with what we had...but I did send him pics...the next day  he gave me a 20% discount on it.  Which was nice...he didn't have to.Yesterday and today, I have been about worthless as a human being.  Other than light cooking and dishes, I did not accomplish two cents worth of anything.  Maybe a load or two of clothes.I did get the checkbook balanced the other night, but that is not much of a job.  But it is one I do not like to let ride, and our bank is updating or redoing things and I was about two weeks late getting the statement.  I think I am one of the few people that actually go to the trouble of doing that, but I have had a bank make a fairly big mistake before so have just always set down and actually balance it since then.****************I have been reading a bit off and on.I finished The Far Family by Wilma Dykeman...it is a stand alone book but has characters from The Tall Woman.I also read Grass of the Earth by Aagot Raaen one more time.  It is one of those books that I have a hard copy, and also one on my kindle.  I never remove it from my kindle.Right now I am ready Small Town by Gloria Sarasin....it was a freebie.  It has been a pretty good read so far.I just spent time looking at the library.  Right now I am listening to A Land More Kind than Home by Wiley Cash...but I want something to look forward to once it is done.  One I got that I think will be next is Wesley the Owl: The Remarkable story of an Owl and His Girl by Stacy O'Brien.  It just sounds like a good light but heartwarming book to listen to.*******I was real surprised to wake up and look out and see a light frost this morning.  I don't know why, but I sure did not expect it.  I had finally turned the AC off last night, and this afternoon I had to kick the heat on and let the furnace run two or three times just to take the chill off.  I turned it off again for now.I best get off here...got to do a couple little jobs before bed....I hope you are having a nice weekend..."},
{"title": "While waiting...", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2019", "text": "Here it is after 5:00 and they are here doing the guttering...so going to be a while before they are done.  They were here yesterday and today taking care of the roof.  The one sunken down place did not have anything under it.  So they peeled it back and put wood under it.  Also replaced some shingles around the exhaust pipe of the furnace....it looks a lot better but they are not all laying down...I am hoping with heat that they will.  They at least look like that is a possibility.  After the way things have been done, I fear I will never trust anyone again with things like this.  They did come back and fix the drip edge......again, hoping the other shingles lay down good with warmth from the sun.***********I made these 4-patches yesterday....the first I had sewn in several days.  I wish I could get back to sewing some every day.And I have made more of these 'leaves' or whatever you want to call them.  It is about time to cut squares and start to applique.  I did these several days ago over a couple or three nights....**************A blogging friend posted a photo of a maple leaf that was completely white....I don't think I have ever seen one completely white.  But my memory is not so good at times.  But when walking out one morn, I notice all kinds of leaves in my yard turned white...we were leaving at the time so I did not take time to photograph them.About 3 days later, maybe 4, when I did think to go back and look, all I saw were these Tulip Poplar leaves ...but still you can see how white.  I think it is mold/fungus.*********That is it for now...I have more to say but too tired to type it.  Is that lazy or what?I hope you guys are having a good week..."},
{"title": "A little update...", "date": "Saturday, October 5, 2019", "text": "First, Roger got up and felt better yesterday.  I wanted to wait and see if he still felt better today before I posted an update.  He still stumbles easily.  It is sort of hard to explain.  If we are out somewhere, walking into the store or walking around in there, he doesn't do it.  It is just funny moments here at home....funny as in odd.  Not the ha-ha kind of funny.  And he is definitely not good bending over to do anything...here or anywhere.  But he has stayed up both yesterday and today.  So that is very good. **********The contractor sent the guy back out about the roof.  And the gutter part of the awning.  The hole in the gutter is old, and I agree with him about that.  But how it got there is more than I know.  I often sit on the porch if it rains, so I am positive that it had not been shooting back on the porch.  But he is going to try to stop it up with something.It was one of this guy's men that had did the roofing.  Anyway, he is going to raise up the bottom part of the shingles and slide in a piece to extend it past the drip edge.  And going to redo around the exhaust from the furnace and see why that one spot is sunken.So we shall see...but I do feel like he will try to do it right.   They are supposed to be out Monday to do it.********I hope you guys are having a good weekend...."},
{"title": "Life....", "date": "Thursday, October 3, 2019", "text": "I have not had the heart to post, and maybe still shouldn't.  I can do okay posting photos on my other blog and pretending everything is okay.In reality, my mood swings from one thing to another.  Part of the time, I can go on and be okay, and others I am beside myself with stress.  I cannot seem to let go the worry.The stress is with things with the hail damage and the repairs that have been done, plus two are still not done.  We did get rain, and look below...There is a hole in the guttering part of the awning.  When it rains pretty hard, it shoots a stream back on to the  porch.  It has never did that before.  I was so glad to be up when it rained, and could go out and check.  And there is more to this but I don't know how to explain it and could not get pics.Then, the side of the roof that needed done has been done a while...I do not know why I have not noticed things till last week.  I don't know if it was the way the light hit it or what that drew my attention.Just look at that roofing around the exhaust from the furnace.  I don't know what you call it when it is not a chimney...  expand the view to get a better look.It looks like someone has almost put a knee through a space up there.  I have sent these pics to our claims adjuster and also talked to the contractor and someone is coming back out tomorrow.Oh, I left out the part about the drip-edge.  I don't know who knows what they are and who doesn't.  But it is a metal piece the fits under the shingles at the edge of the roof, and one side fits flat against the fascia board.  Everyone I have ever known always says to extend the shingles out past the edge of the drip-edge, from a half inch to a an inch...with this, the shingles don't quite come to the edge of the drip-edge.I have been sitting mulling all this over in my mind, and wanted to post, but could not do it and be all bright and cheerful.  It just goes round and round in my head no matter what I am doing.I would like to get up there and look myself, at least at the edge.  I HAVE to do something with the guttering, cause during this, I noticed one side of the guttering did not have a bit of water coming down the downpout.  So it is clogged for sure.One of the guys comes tomorrow to talk to me about the roof, and I really don't know how to handle it.  If he tries to smooth it over and leave it like this, I do not know what I will do...Roger is having a bad day today,   He is in bed today...does not feel good.  He usually just lays in his chair and naps...but went back to bed this morn.  He just got up to get something for a headache...so he is not feeling good at all.  He has been being so shaky lately I did not dare ask him to help with out ladder.  And it is so heavy I cannot handle it by myself.  It was hard for me when I was in my 40's.  Now,  I just cannot do it.  And I would trust Roger's cousin, but he is not in the best of health either.  So it is like I am between a rock and a hard place.Sorry for such a whiny post...hopefully next one will be better."},
{"title": "A bit of the process....", "date": "Sunday, September 22, 2019", "text": "I was in there getting a few more shapes ready to baste and thought I would take a few pics of the process.I just realized I should have taken a couple more photos, but will make do with these.  The white in the above photo is freezer paper.  The same old freezer paper that has been around for years.  It has a shiny, slick side.  The slick side is placed against the back of the fabric.Use a hot iron and press the freezer paper to the back of the fabric.  It does not stain it, or do any harm to it.  But it will stick to it till you want it to come out.  (and once it is taken out, it can be used again and again.)Next I cut the fabric closer to the shape, leaving just enough to fold over the edge of the freezer paper and baste down  like in the photo below.I have made a heart quilt top using this method.....hopefully when I start to actually applique, I will try to think and take more photos.I did get a few more freezer paper shapes cut and ironed to the back of fabrics...eleven more in fact.  Still all different fabrics.  And I still haven't used all the ones I have.  (I have been collecting orange fabrics for a LONG time, and I still look for new ones)I did three more 4-patches, plus the one on top was from the other day.  I am hoping I can continue to do a little bit every day.  ************I am anxiously awaiting a new kindle.  I have this horrible habit of getting different newletters with a list of either free or almost free books.  I find more books than I can read or ever hope to read.  But I get them anyway.  Plus I buy a few along.  As well as there are probably a dozen  or two or more I have the actual book, but purchased them for my kindle, too, because I love them so much.Anyway, my current Kindle Paperwhite is so full, it will not hold any more...and it just does not want to function.  Their new basic Paperwhite kindle has twice the space mine does, and costs a less than what I paid for mine.  But I went ahead got one with 32GB of space.   It should last me for a life time. And I just checked, and it cost less than the Paperwhite I have now because I am a prime member...As to the free books, I will try stuff I get free that I would probably never purchase...well, I might pay a dollar or two to try something.  But I got Once Upon A Flock by Lauren Sheuer for free....and check that link out now!  I would never have paid that much on a whim, yet now that I have read it, I feel it would have been worth it.  It was just so fun to read...yet not the funny/haha kind of read.  I wish I could lend it to all of you that read...I think most of you would enjoy it.  If you follow the link, and I hope you do, go down and read the editorial review.I got The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony for $2  It was one of the best books I have read.  Again, one I would not have paid the asking price, but since reading it have seriously considered getting it for someone as a gift.   If you ever get the chance, read it.What we wouldn't have given for all these books when I was a kid....That is it for now...I think I might check a few blogs and/or do a little basting.  Hope you have a good week ahead."},

He does not pay attention to things like that now.  It would be a struggle for him to read, and even if he read it, he would be apt to forget what it said and/or forget to tell me.***********The above was started  last night but did not finish.  I lost track of what all I was going to tell.  And now, I need to get dressed now and take Roger to breakfast.  I pick up Lorelei after school today and she is spending the night.  Then, our daughter that lives in St Louis is coming to sew tomorrow.  I hope you all have a good weekend ahead ."},

Sorry about the quality...still you can see the second deer. **********I have not accomplished a lot today, but did clean out one cabinet....it had not been that long since I was in it so it was not bad.  But I did make the decision to put a pan and waffle iron in the donate bag.  I had not used the pan in a year or so, and it had been years since that waffle iron was used.  Maybe someone else will get some use out of it.I also got in my fabric and 'think' I have figured out what I want to work on.  At least part of the time. It is handwork.  It has been a long time since I did any, but I used to love to sit and work on something at night while I listened and half watched something on TV.It has not seemed like a holiday today for us since we saw the kids Friday and Saturday....but that is okay. I hope you have had a good weekend...and that the coming week is good to you."},

We stopped in the kitchen store...just because I always go there.Every so often I get in the mood to buy a slicer of some sort.  But I look at them and think they would just be something else to wash and store.  So I will continue to use a knife.  A knife is quick to wash and I already have them and a place for them.************I came across the video below by chance...being horses it caught my attention.  You just have to watch it...and notice all the time that she is setting while talking...notice the horse gathered close to her...and one reaches and nudges her every so often.  I think she is amazing..."},

A band saw rather than the chop saw...and acetylene torch and tanks.  Jeremy will use them and that is better than it setting there.Anyway, got three sides of the house washed as well as the north side of the garage...the other sides could use washing, but they are nothing compared to the sides washed.    I was worn to a frazzle by the time I did them and Roger felt like he had to be out there, and I did need him to start the power washer a couple times.  And he helped with the hose, etc. But the real fun began when we were taking the hose off.  I cannot tell and do it justice...but for something so simple to get us both so worked up and worn to a frazzle...it was one of the times I raged against my age, against what my body is doing.  But eventually we got the hose lose, I got the hose wound up and Roger got the power washer put away.Oh, I guess the photo looks like I feel and look....I have sure seen better days physically.  But I am still here....still moving.  And it feels so good to get something accomplished that has been worrying me in the back of my mind for such a long time."},

So curious to know your experience with that.  They have a much better rating at Consumer reports than the top loaders.  But their cycle time is so much longer...and then there are the stories of them having bad odors!Any and all thoughts will be very appreciated."},

So we sit and do some therapy.   We sit there for at least an hour, probably more often than not an hour and a half. Now he will say which one he wants to go to if he has a preference, other times he really doesn't care.Anyway, that is just a little glimpse...not a full disclosure."},

He cannot do that trimming, but he can shave, so am relieved he can do that. Anyway, another day will be the yard, and another day Roger has to go get allergy shot, but that doesn't take long.  Hoping that is all that we end up having to do.I hope you have a good week and that you find time to do the things you want to do."},

It had finally wore out to the point of it had to go.Before Roger's stroke I had been going to have him make either a wooden seat and back, or else go get metal and make the seat and back with it.  I just do not like fabric for outdoor furniture.  I have my reasons which I am not inclined to share at the moment.  Anyway, that was just one of many plans that the stroke put an end to.I found this one on Amazon, but it is from Walmart...it is inexpensive but the reviews were fairly good..   It has a nice smooth swing.  Hopefully I will get to try it out some in the next few days.  I always love to sit in the swing and read.************My Asiatic Lilies have started blooming...this being the first color.   So have them to look forward to.**********Sunday*********I have been to McDonald's with Roger this morn...can we say late morn?  I am home and trying to make up my mind to take the day and relax and do fun stuff.  Since my accident, doing just normal jobs takes more out of me and I am slow going.  Now my knee on my other legis messed up...I think something happened to it when I fell...I have been very careful with it ever since.  If I put even the slightest weight on that foot and twist I feel it.  Not sure what brought it on, but has been being very painful ever since we mowed the yard last Thursday.  I am wondering will I be able to mow again.Sandra was talking about why she blogs and ask the rest of us what are our reasons.  My reasons are varied.  I started this blog to try to encourage myself to take more photos and to share. And to share my love of quilting and sewing.  I also started it as a sort of daily record of my life.  But I have never found the courage or stupidity, depending on which viewpoint you take, to share the nitty, gritty of life.  I sometimes think of starting a separate blog for that.I do share some of the ups and downs, but not the minor frustrations that make me grit my teeth.  Or make me cry with frustrations.  For instance a while back I needed the hacksaw for something.  I thought Roger had one in the basement and one in the garage.  I went downstairs and no, not there.  I went to the garage and could not spot one for love nor money.  I was so very, very frustrated....and glanced down, and there it was hanging at the end of his big work table.  I did not share that....and these words do not my feelings justice.I really wish I could get back to writing the day to day boring stuff...That is it for now...think I am going to take my book and go to the swing and read....I am reading The Mother:  A Novel by Pearl S. Buck..."},

{"title": "Funny....Tool List....", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2019", "text": "While looking for something else, I thought of  this old post that had the list of tools and their descriptions.  Notice what the pan with the quenching fluid? is setting on...that is Roger's table saw.  Notice the description of it below.  I have had that exact experience.  You can adjust the angle of the blade to make a cut...and I was trimming off just this tiny corner off a board.  A short board I might add...maybe 2 foot.  If that.  Well, it was small, so Roger had this push stick we used to keep our hands away from the blade.  I was using it and standing a bit to the side. It was probably a good thing...when I finished the cut, the saw grabbed the part I trimmed off and flung it 6 or 8 ft behind me and drove it in the garage door!I won't tell of any other experience I have had, but I am very familiar with a few of them.Tools and their use:  DRILL PRESS: A   tall upright machine useful for suddenly snatching flat metal bar  stock  out of your hands so that it smacks you in the chest and flings  your  beer across the room, denting the freshly-painted vertical stabilizer which you had carefully set in the corner where nothing could get to it.   WIRE WHEEL: Cleans   paint off bolts and then throws them somewhere under the workbench  with  the speed of light. Also removes fingerprints and hard-earned  calluses  from fingers in about the time it takes you to say, ' Oh  sh--.... '   ELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning pop rivets in their holes until you die of old age.   SKILL SAW: A portable cutting tool used to make studs too short.   PLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads. Sometimes used in the creation of blood-blisters.   BELT SANDER: An electric sanding tool commonly used to convert minor touch-up jobs into major refinishing jobs.   HACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools   built on the Ouija board principle. It transforms human energy into a   crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence  its  course, the more dismal your future becomes.   VISE-GRIPS: Generally   used after pliers to completely round off bolt heads. If nothing else   is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to   the palm of your hand.   WELDING GLOVES: Heavy duty leather gloves used to prolong the conduction of intense welding heat to the palm of your hand.   OXYACETYLENE TORCH: Used   almost entirely for lighting various flammable objects in your shop on   fire. Also handy for igniting the grease inside the wheel hub out of   which you want to remove a bearing race.   TABLE SAW: A large stationary power tool commonly used to launch wood projectiles for testing wall integrity.   HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used   for lowering an automobile to the ground after you have installed your   new brake shoes, trapping the jack handle firmly under the bumper.   EIGHT-FOOT LONG YELLOW PINE 2X4: Used for levering an automobile upward off of a trapped hydraulic jack handle.   E-Z OUT BOLT AND STUD EXTRACTOR: A tool ten times harder than any known drill bit that snaps neatly off in bolt holes thereby ending any possible future use.   BAND SAW: A large stationary power saw primarily used by most shops to cut good aluminum sheet   into smaller pieces that more easily fit into the trash can after you   cut on the inside of the line instead of the outside edge.   TWO-TON ENGINE HOIST: A tool for testing the maximum tensile strength of everything you forgot to disconnect.   CRAFTSMAN 1/2 x 24-INCH SCREWDRIVER: A very large pry bar that inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end opposite the handle.   AVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw.   PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally   used to stab the vacuum seals under lids or for opening old-style   paper-and-tin oil cans and splashing oil on your shirt; but can also be   used, as the name implies, to strip out Phillips screw heads.   STRAIGHT SCREWDRIVER: A tool for opening paint cans. Sometimes used to convert common slotted screws into non-removable screws.   PRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.   HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to make hoses too short.   HAMMER: Originally   employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of   divining rod to locate the most expensive parts adjacent the object we   are trying to hit.   MECHANIC ' S KNIFE: Used   to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered   to your front door; works particularly well on contents such as seats,   vinyl records, liquids in plastic bottles, collector magazines , refund   checks, and rubber or plastic parts. Especially useful for slicing  work  clothes, but only while in use.   DAMMIT TOOL: Any   handy tool that you grab and throw across the garage while yelling '   DAMMIT ' at the top of your lungs. It is also, most often, the next tool   that you will need."},

So it felt wonderful to be able to do something.And our neighbor just would not take any money for the work...barely took enough to pay for the blade.   But how do you pay for time anyway...it is worth a fortune just cause we know he is completely trustworthy.  If he says he will do something, he will do it.  And honest as the day is long.***********My BFF, my sister (she is married to my brother) had told me about these clothespins and I had almost ordered some, and was planning on it while in St. Louis, but was waiting to time it so we would be home about the time they came.  Well, she up and ordered some for me, and they came yesterday!  I love them...they have a good strong grip.  They are pretty, too!I had planned on getting a load out early today, but it was so overcast the first half of the day, and I swore I felt a drip of rain a few times.  Finally the day started brightening up and I quick threw in this old blanket, and a throw for the couch, and what I call my 'neck towels.'  They are hand towels, but I keep them in my chair and roll them up to fit behind my neck.The wind was blowing so hard they stood straight out a big percentage of the time and the clothespins kept everything in place.  The towels had a bit of a damp feeling in the ends but both the big blanket and the couch throw were dry within two hours.  I just laid the towels on my drying rack...***************This month marked the 15th year since my brother had a brain tumor and had it removed.  He was given 6 months to a year to live...maybe a year and a half if lucky..but I think they stressed the 6 months to a year.  But God had other plans.  He is 10 years older than me, still raises a big garden, still climbs up and trims the trees back when they need it, still traps every winter....stays busy all the time.So it has been a good week..."},

Our neighbor saw us and came over and tried to pull start it and couldn't.  Today I looked at Amazon trying to decide on a new mower.  Even though I thought it was something simple with the old, it is just beyond Roger.  That is why I was thinking about a new one.  I set and looked at Amazon while we ate breakfast this morn, came home with the intentions of ordering a certain one.But it has a bag, and it is self propelled....I have not used a self propelled in years and years and years, but I didn't enjoy it when younger and was afraid I wouldn't now.  And it had the bag, and we had one one time with a bag and didn't like.  So, got to looking more.  I spent a good two hours looking, reading reviews, etc and still could not make up my mind.  Just so indecisive I drive my crazy.  But it actually might have been a good thing this time.This evening, I had given Roger his meds and we had set down for the night.   I thought I heard someone at the back door...went in there and it was our neighbor...he came to get the mower and is going to see if he can fix it.  And he is good at stuff like that so it will probably be fixed fairly soon.************Roger has his allergy shots tomorrow...Friday is a doctor's visit.  He has to go to get prescriptions renewed.  But also has nodules on his thyroid and we have to see our family doctor to see about getting them checked.  He had a CT scan a while back to check that the spot on his lung had not changed and they seen those nodules.Plus they seen 'something' on his kidney...the previous year's scan did not go far down enough to see it.  So we don't know how long it has been there.  It may just be a cyst.  And the girl said that 99% of the time the nodules on the thyroid are nothing to worry about.Monday I take him to have a CT scan without and with dye to check the kidney thing."},

In case you don't quilt,  this is something fabric companies do, and also some quilt shops will make their own sets of pre-cuts.  Pre-cuts come in 10 inch squares, often called a Layer Cake in that size.   A Charm Pack is 5-inch squares.  Mini-charm is 2 1/2 inch squares.  And the 2 1/2 inch strips of the width of fabric is called a jelly roll.  And they are rolled up.  Rachel had opened  mine when she got them to send pics to me.  Usually each precut pack has 40-42 pieces of fabric, and almost always have repeats.  But sometimes they come in like half a jelly roll, also think the Layer Cakes sometimes come with only 20 pieces of fabric, but I have only seen the Jelly Rolls come in half the number.Oh, I about forgot there are 1 1/2 inch strips in some fabrics, but not as often.  And I think there are one or two other precuts that I have never seen and that are not all that common. Also there are Fat Quarter bundles...they are pieces of fabric 18 x 21 inches.  The number of fabrics in a FQ bundle varies.Usually pre-cuts  are a line of fabric, maybe by a certain designer, and it will come in different color ways.  It is an easy way of having a wide variety of fabrics without trying to go through and pick out things that go together.  Plus it is quicker than standing and waiting to get them cut.I know this is boring to some of you, but some will find it informative maybe.

{"title": "Showing the process", "date": "Saturday, March 16, 2019", "text": "I thought I would take a few pics of the process I have used to make the diagonal string blocks I have been showing.  Keep in mind that there are other ways to achieve the blocks...this is just the process I chose this time.I start out with a foundation paper the size I want my blocks to be.  Next I chose a strip or string of fabric that will at the least cover the paper from corner to corner, put it on right side up.  I always tend to start somewhere near the center but you don't have to.  Wherever you start, make sure that your strip of fabric covers the paper, even when opened out.Take the next strip and place it against the first strip right sides together.  The thing about starting with the fabric covering center...from then on as long as your fabric is long enough at the line of stitching, it will be long enough when the fabric is opened up for the next line of stitching.I almost always use an iron and press the fabric open...Just continue adding additional strips of fabric...The purpose is to use whatever strip of fabric you come to...no picky matching....just a way to use little strips of leftover fabric that you couldn't use for much else.Keep adding strips till the foundation paper is covered.  One thing I do that not everyone is does is that last little corner piece that is added....I try to make sure to cut it till the bias is in the seam and the corner edges are with the grain.  I don't know why I bother...all the rest of the edges will be bias.I always turn over and use a ruler and rotary cutter to trim the blocks to size.Before rotary cutters and rulers, one used scissors and trimmed to the size of the foundation paper.Isn't it magic how it looks so neat with just four cuts.And one last photo of the paper starting to be torn off.   I have used phone book pages, but with them you have to worry about the newsprint transferring  to your fabric.  Supposedly, after so many years it is cured and won't transfer.  Well, on these blocks I used some that was as old as 'that magic number' and while it did not transfer to the fabric, it did rub off on my machine bed.  I switched to the paper above for the most part.  It is blank newsprint paper...I bought it from Amazon.  I have used printer paper, but it is hard to tear off, even with the shorter stitch length I use in making these blocks.I hope this was good enough to explain the process to those interested."},

When you walk in on in in normal daylight hours and look, you cannot tell if it is on or off.  It was on the other day and Roger walked in.  I was not sitting at it, so I asked him if he thought it was on or off.  He looked and said, 'Well, it's off.'  It was on!  Of course you can tell at night, when you turn the other lights off.Now Look!  I went ahead and got a strip of LED lighting that makes all the difference in the world.  I had bought a strip for my Juki years ago...so even though there are several that were cheaper than these, I went ahead and got the same ones because I knew they worked and worked well.**********I have not done much today.   A bit of housework....and spent some time tearing off the foundation papers of more of my string blocks.  And of course spent time rearranging them on the design wall.  I didn't take a pic of the latest arrangement. We are currently re-watching the Endeavour series....hopefully before too long our PBS will show the latest in that series...it is one of our favorites.I hope you all have a good weekend!"},

Service, never heard of this poem.  I felt like I had been there, and wanted to go back again.  I can never pick out a favorite verse...though I do know the first one sure is NOT it...LOL  Not that it is bad.  But they all paint such a vivid pictures...I hope some of you enjoy it.      The Spell of the Yukon  by Robert W. ServiceI wanted the gold, and I sought it,    I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.   Was it famine or scurvy — I fought it;    I hurled my youth into a grave.   I wanted the gold, and I got it —    Came out with a fortune last fall, —   Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,    And somehow the gold isn't all.   No!  There's the land.  (Have you seen it?)    It's the cussedest land that I know,   From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it    To the deep, deathlike valleys below.   Some say God was tired when He made it;    Some say it's a fine land to shun;   Maybe; but there's some as would trade it    For no land on earth — and I'm one.   You come to get rich (damned good reason);    You feel like an exile at first;   You hate it like hell for a season,    And then you are worse than the worst.   It grips you like some kinds of sinning;    It twists you from foe to a friend;   It seems it's been since the beginning;    It seems it will be to the end.   I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow    That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;   I've watched the big, husky sun wallow    In crimson and gold, and grow dim,   Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,    And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;   And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,    With the peace o' the world piled on top.   The summer — no sweeter was ever;    The sunshiny woods all athrill;   The grayling aleap in the river,    The bighorn asleep on the hill.   The strong life that never knows harness;    The wilds where the caribou call;   The freshness, the freedom, the farness —    O God! how I'm stuck on it all.   The winter! the brightness that blinds you,    The white land locked tight as a drum,   The cold fear that follows and finds you,    The silence that bludgeons you dumb.   The snows that are older than history,    The woods where the weird shadows slant;   The stillness, the  moonlight, the mystery,    I've bade 'em good-by — but I can't.   There's a land where the mountains are nameless,    And the rivers all run God knows where;   There are lives that are erring and aimless,    And deaths that just hang by a hair;   There are hardships that nobody reckons;    There are valleys unpeopled and still;   There's a land — oh, it beckons and beckons,    And I want to go back — and I will.   They're making my money diminish;    I'm sick of the taste of champagne.   Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish    I'll pike to the Yukon again.   I'll fight — and you bet it's no sham-fight;    It's hell! — but I've been there before;   And it's better than this by a damsite —    So me for the Yukon once more.   There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;    It's luring me on as of old;   Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting    So much as just finding the gold.   It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,    It's the forests where silence has lease;   It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,    It's the stillness that fills me with peace."},

This book is the result—an effort to picture that life truly and realistically. It is the story of an energetic and capable girl, the child of German immigrant parents, who at the age of seventeen married a young German farmer, and moved to a homestead on the wind-swept plains of Kansas, where she reared eleven of her twelve children, and remembering regretfully her own half-day in school, sent nine of them through college. It is a story of grim and tenacious devotion in the face of hardships and disappointments, devotion that never flagged until the long, hard task of near a lifetime was done.\"—John Ise (from the preface) Due to a question, I went to Findagrave to Look up Henry and Rosa Ise....if you will click on the link it takes you to Henry's page and from it you can find the pages for Rosa and their children.  Henry lived to the age of 59 and Rosa lived to the ripe old age of 91.It sure made me feel crazy not to remember any of it...though reading it for the umpteenth time, it is like meeting an old friend.  I seriously have read this book probably four or 5 times....I have it both in paperback and kindle.  There are a handful of books that I wanted both versions, and this is one of them.***********It has snowed all day.  A fine snow that did not amount to anything.  But it is bitter cold....or feels that way when the wind hits.  It goes right through and chills you to the bone. I made noodles today...and plan to make some chicken and noodles tomorrow if all goes as planned.  I sewed a few little lines late this evening...but no pics.  I did not think to take any.

The match stick being longer than the diameter of the spool, would help keep the spool pressed against the table, or whatever you set it on and it would roll along.I don't know why I did  not think to open this up and take photo of the needles...mom always liked betweens to quilt with.  She like a size 7 needle.Used to various places would give a little pack of needles...And somewhere there would be their name...these were always a nice bit of advertising to receive."},

My older daughter was at Lorelei's for Christmas...she was feeling bad and was sleeping on the couch because it felt better than laying flat in bed to sleep.  She had taken something to help her pain and was sleeping soundly.  Keep this in mind.I didn't know this but Otto likes to go up to the Christmas tree and rub his face in it.  I don't know why...maybe it scratches an itch.  Whatever the reason, daughter heard him.  Then realized she was hearing him over and over and said, \"Otto, stop it!\"  All this without her ever opening her eyes.Then she realized it was a constant noise and fully woke up, and there he was with the Christmas lights wrapped around him, and he was straining against them to get to her!  They still have not figured out how the tree did not fall over, but she jumped up and made him back up till she could get the lights worked down off him and he could step out and over them."},

{"title": "A bit of a review....", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2017", "text": "It has been a stressful week for us....if you don't feel like reading, just know that it was good news.  The new med for Roger did succeed in stopping the anxiety/panic attacks.  And the CT scan was done this past Monday.We both had appointments with dermatologists on Wednesday.  They are at the same place but with different doctors.  I stressed about how that was going to work out, since Roger does not have much short term memory.  But they are so kind and so good, she staggered them till I could be in the room with him.  He really isn't having much breaking out now.  Every now and then a little patch will pop up....but nothing terrible.  So, she told me how to use his meds...when he originally got them, I was not with him. He could not remember how they were supposed to be used.Then it was my turn.  I have had three spots of basal cell cancer on my face, so I get worried about things that don't heal.  I had a spot come, and it has been getting bigger...but keep in mind that it started as not much more than the head of straight pin, and grew to about a quarter of an inch.  And every time I washed my face, there would be a fresh bloody little scab come.Well, she looked at it and gave it a name, said she didn't think she needed to do a biopsy because it wasn't cancer, and froze it off plus a couple or three other places.  I was so relieved, and thankful I could have cried.  I had not told Roger I was worried, but with putting sunscreen on my face, I have to look at my face every day...and I just wish I could avoid it.  We then seen our nurse practitioner Friday and got the news about the scan--nothing had changed, no new bleeds nothing going on there.  So that was a relief.  So thankful for answered prayers.I don't get the fearful feelings quite like I used to...this one friend of Roger's always told me the Good Lord was not done with Roger yet...he seemed to have no doubt that Roger would make it through.Then I get to thinking about when I had him to the ER in February, the nurse that had him that day, had been there when he had the brain bleed.  And he told us that Somebody was on our side, because the helicopter had been in the area doing some training and they did not have to wait on it to get here.  So the Lord has been good to us...****************** A year ago Roger had a TIA(mini-stroke)...on our anniversary.  Technically that was yesterday.  He had the stroke August 2nd.  I try not to dwell on it....but oh, what a time that was.  I am so thankful to still have time with him.  When he was in the hospital I stayed some nights with my brother and then in his room; in rehab I would come home at night...I would often cry most of the way home...I would cry because it was a beautiful sunset, or beautiful sky and he couldn't be there to see it with me.  I wondered would we ever get to go on another drive together.  I wondered would I ever feel his arms around me....would he ever come to himself.  And he has....somethings are really slow coming, but little things keep improving.  At first he didn't have much interest in TV, then, he started watching it but couldn't quite use the remote....now he has it figured out and can turn the TV on and off, and find what he wants.  He still doesn't do much on the computer, but he does get on Youtube and find videos to watch while he rides the stationary bike.  So things keep improving...******************I heard these guys, Future Islands, on Austin City Limits tonight...they have a decidedly different sound.  And two or three of their songs really sound alike.  I almost changed channels but for some reason, I didn't.  I really like this song...the words to it are below the video.\"Ran\"Ingest, where it goes, nobody sees but meSo perfect and so sweetBut the rest, feels incompleteLike the rabbit's foot I keepIn the locket, with no keyAnd I can't take it, I can't take this world withoutThis world without youI can't take it, I can't take it on my ownOn my ownOn these roadsOut of love, so it goesHow it feels when we fall, when we foldHow we lose control, on these roadsHow it sings as it goesFlight of field, driving snowKnows the coldRan round the wailing worldAnd what's a song without you?When every song I write is about youWhen I can't hold myself without youAnd I can't change the day I found youOn these roadsOut of love, so it goesHow it feels when we fall, when we foldHow we lose control, on these roadsHow it sings as it goesFlight of field, driving snowKnows the coldOut of love, so it goesHow it feels when we fall, when we foldHow we lose control, on these roadsHow it sings as it goesFlight of field, driving snowKnows the coldRan round the wailing world"},

I am sure he was at mine...in the form of one of my sisters.  It is the Christmas I will never forget.  Though you would think I would remember how old I was I am not sure...I think I was about seven years old.It was late in the evening, either dark or almost dark.  I don't remember if I knew my sister, Fran was coming home or not.  Either way, in her and her husband came--and they had a big, big box full of stuff for all of us. I remember the box ripping apart.  It had toys and clothes--I can remember most of what I got, and it was wonderful.  But to just to have Fran home was joy beyond measure.  A ham was fixed for Christmas, and it is the first time I ever remember having ham.  I could not stop eating it....every time I could I would sneak in the fridge and get a piece of it.   My mom kept telling me I was going to be sick from eating too much. Oh, my, how I loved it.  That night I paid the piper though.  I started throwing up and don't remember how many times or how long it took to stop...Fran got up and took care of me.  It was almost worth it just to have her caring for me.  I can remember her telling mom to go on back to bed, that she would stay with me.  She would wring a wash rag out and wash my face with such loving care.Don't get me wrong, we all loved each other, but Fran is sort of the special one...I think special memories are attached to her by all of us.She would do anything on a dare, and not afraid of anyone or anything.  I can remember when she was in high school, her and the algebra teacher got in a big, big argument.  She was sure she was right, and he  just assumed the book was right.  I think he even came to our house talking to her...not sure how right all my memories are because I was maybe not even in school then.Anyway, I think they argued back and forth for a day or two or three, each working and reworking the problem.  He finally had to agree that Fran was right.  Anyway, that is just a sample of what she is/was made of.Back to that Christmas, she brought the game of Tripoly home...I was too young to actually play...so I just sat by her side.  I don't remember how the game is played, but a free hand is dealt.  Well, she  would look at her hand and whisper to me to see if there was this or that card in the free hand...and if there was, I would sneak it to her.  I would have did anything in the world for her.  Of course either her husband or one of my brothers caught her and put a stop to it.  But she was having fun just sneaking and getting by with it.All my sisters and my brother always came home, at least once a year after they moved away, and I always hated seeing any of them leave.  It was just always worse when Fran left..."},

I am not sure what all he lost the first time around. Anyway, he went in for the last visit to the doctor, and they found a small hole between the roof of his mouth and his nostril.   So, there was that hole...they scheduled surgery to repair it, and found more cancer.  that is when he lost the roof of his mouth, his eye, and part of his nose.  Well, that was the beginning of losing them.  I don't recall the exact sequence of it.  That was over 30 yrs. ago.******************So, I battle fears of my own.  Every evening I go through spells of what I call the fearfuls.  Sometimes they don't amount to a hill of beans...others I have such awful thoughts.  And so much of the time I feel so alone...like I have not told Roger that the mole was cancer...and he has not thought to ask.  It upset him so bad for me to have this cold...I just avoid worrying him.So that is just a touch of what has been going on.  We did go for a little drive today.  The first time we have just went for a leisurely drive in a while...and I am wanting to go for a few more.  And I think it would be good for both of us to get out and get in the woods and look for some mushrooms.    But even that holds fears.  But I think we will still get out and go."},

And the women were always willing to give you a start from theirs.  At one time I had a Swedish Ivy plant...that started from a leaf sprouted in water that a friend gave to me.I have had the Wondering Jew plant at different times...always started from a piece given to me and stuck in water till roots appear, then planted.  My mom always had at least one pot and sometimes a couple.  She would hang it from a hook in the ceiling...and it would grow almost all the way to the floor.At one time I had this plant...I do not know what it was called.  It was slick, shiny thick dark green leaves...and all along the edge of the leaves little baby plants would start.  If they dropped off into the soil, they would take root and grow.  I don't know recall for sure who gave it to me, but I think my mom's best friend...but I loved it and would love to know what it is called.  I am thinking Lorelei would find it fascinating.  I have googled but not seen one yet that looks quite like it.In my yard now I have a big bed of creamy white irises that are a result of a neighbor giving me some of her bulbs at least 30 years ago.  The neighbor no longer lives there but every time my irises bloom I think of her.  Do you have any flowers that were given to you as a start from friend?  And what are they/how long have you had them."},

{"title": "Questions...", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2017", "text": "When we went down to goose pond, we saw this hawk....I could not get a good capture of it.  However, I am showing you one I have played with in Picasa...Does anyone know what kind this one is?  I think it is the strangest marked hawk I have ever seen.  I tried to capture it when it looked away but didn't manage that.  The back of its head was white/dirty white.  A spot about an inch in diameter I am guessing.**********************I made another block yesterday....I knew I would not be real happy with that center block but used it anyway.  But then I really did not like it.  I let it lay for a couple of hours but could stand it no long and ripped it out.I replaced it with this...I do like it better.   It won't be my favorite block...I do know that much.My brother and his wife came down last summer, and we took a little drive to see a couple covered bridges.We drive down this same road numerous times every year and this was the first time to see these.On my other blog, Time Stand Still, I have a couple close-ups of some of the flowers.**********************Roger had therapy today...last week and this week, she had him work on filling out a form as if he was going to a doctor for the first time.  And he is doing it....just slow.  It is amazing how far he has come.  But she says she thinks she can go down to two times a month.  That gives me relief to know if I have concerns, I still can talk to her.I know each stroke is different....but until this happened I had no clue.  I know my boss had one, but his was worse than Roger's.  He couldn't talk, could not feed himself...had a feeding tube.  So when Roger's happened, I really expected that.Thankfully, it was not as bad.  But oh, at the things you probably don't even think about unless you have dealt with someone that had a stroke.  Where his brain bleed was on the left side affected Roger's speech/communication center.  He had trouble naming things, could not read...which was partly due vision problems. For the time he was in the rehab facility, he could not name things or read at all.  I think one time he figured out one word. Since coming home, he has had to learn to count change/money, and learn to tell time on a dial clock all over again.  He is learning to read and has come a long way, but still has work to do.  He has come so far from where he was.  I never would have dreamed that he would ever be able to fill out a form.  All the therapists he has had have been wonderful people.  The ones he has had week in and week out have been so, so good to us.  And I know they get paid, for doing it but they sure work for it.  I am sure that some of them take their work 'home with them.'  I know the couple that are married discuss how to help him.   We have not been back to the rehab facility that he spent time at in Terre Haute but we want to go there one of these days...hoping to see some of the same crew.I know this is rambling...but just felt like sharing a bit."},
{"title": "Another block...", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2017", "text": "Hopefully this is just another block in a long line of blocks.  Most people call this pattern Churn Dash, but for me it will forever  be Hole in the Barn Door since that was the name I seen it called the first time I saw it.  The name held the appeal for me.  I have made only one quilt using this pattern, but if I ever have one of the 'quilt blocks' made for the side of the garage, this is probably the pattern I would chose.   I am not sure what colors though.I really am hoping to make enough of these to make a quilt.  Though it and the other block I made have blues, I have not planned on just using blues. What is funny, I am trying to use up scraps.  But the local quilt shop has a bin of scraps...and I buy more.  To add variety to my scraps!  I think I am defeating myself by doing this.If my mom had had all the fabric I have and had had the time, she would never have stopped.  Specially when she was my age.  When she got up into her late 70's and right before she died in her early 80's...she didn't get as much done.  I would love to know how many quilts she made over the years and how many she gave away.  I bet it would amaze even me! There are still quilt tops down home that she left that has yet to be quilted, and I think one or two were in the process of being made.  I don't know if they will ever get done now."},

{"title": "Wringer washers", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2017", "text": "We saw these at a store in Shipshewana in 2015....I would have sworn that I posted them.  But have looked and looked and cannot find them.  I wish I had taken note of the price of these.  They were used and the price was high...or at least I thought so.  I think one of them was a bit over $1600 and the other was even higher.Someone posted a pic of one on Facebook the other day, a bit different to these.  When I grew up we used one most of the time.  I was in school before mom ever got an automatic washer and dryer.  and even after she got them, we almost always used the wringer and hung the clothes outside.Ours had the red release...like the one on the left.  If you were to catch your hand in the wringer, the idea was the push the red release....but I never knew anyone to get caught.  But many is the times my mom told me to be careful when she let me feed the clothes through.  Every now and then for some reason, I can remember having to press the release to get something 'untangled.'We had a pantry, I guess you would call it....we didn't call that though.  It had shelves at one end for the jellies mom made and for canned goods, and under the bottom shelf was this big tin can that mom kept sugar in.  A big chest stood on the other side...and in the middle we kept the wringer washer.  We didn't have a clothes hamper...we just threw our dirty clothes on top of the washer.  We never threw anything wet on the clothes...if it was wet, we hung it on a line to dry rather than pile it with the others and get them damp.We never had a certain day to wash that I remember.  When we washed, we just rolled the washer over to the sink.  We had a short hose that we could screw on to the faucet...and then ran it over to the washer and filled it with hot water.  Then add the detergent.  Mom placed a regular dining chair on the back side...behind the wringers. We didn't have clothes baskets.  We had metal dishpans...similar to the following.At least one was sort of shiny like this and one was a bit deeper and was aluminum.  I know we had two, and maybe a third one.  And I  know when we first washed clothes they were piled in them..rounded up.  But I still can't see three being enough, but for the life of me I cannot remember using anything else. We would always have to run the clothes through the wringer and guide them down and make sure they go in the pan.  (When I was real young, that was my job.)We started out washing sheets and towels, followed by underwear....next came shirts and dresses, and that was followed by jeans.  I don't remember how we did if we had a quilts or blankets to wash.  They would have been either before or after the jeans.Mom always had a different pan with bleach water in it,  had lye soap on hand, and a washboard and used it for tough stains.  I can only remember having to use it a time or two.  But mom always used it on some things.After everything was washed, we ran that water out into the sink, and rinsed the tub out.  We re-filled the tub and proceeded to run the clothes through the rinse water.  Now this time, soon as we got a load ran through and put the next load in, we took the clothes we just ran through outside and hung on the line.  When little, my job was to hand the clothes up to mom.  In the order that she wanted them.By the time we were done with a load, it was about time to run the next load through the wringers and put in another load and start the process over.I remember gathering the end of the sheets in my hands to start them through the wringers, and I remember trying to fold the shirts or anything with buttons till the buttons were to the inside.  But I don't know if mom did that or if that was just something I did.  I enjoyed laundry then, and I do now.Though I am thankful that I don't have to use a wringer washer all the time,  I sure wish I had one.  They would save so much water."},

{"title": "The word 'normal' speaks volumes", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2017", "text": "For a while this afternoon, from my point of view, things felt normal.  Normal is a big word now...there are times I don't think there is ever going to be even a new normal.  So many nights I get what I call the 'fearfuls.'  I don't know if I will ever take normal for granted...I learned just how easily and quickly life can take a turn.  And I get afraid of when it will happen again.  Cause even though Roger was not taken from me this time, I know that sooner or later, one of us will more than likely have to live without the other.But for that while this afternoon, you would never have known the upheaval we have had.  We were both in the basement.  I had laundry going, and spent at least a couple hours with my one of my sewing machines and quilting.  And Roger was working on things in his area.  I am not sure what all he was doing, but I heard tools.  And he was content. He did say he would have to stop and think to remember how to do things.  And he still had trouble telling me things when he needed to name things.  Even with that, he felt more normal than he has in a long while.  Then, after we came up from down there, he grilled some pork steak...just so normal.Through all this, he has not lost his sense of humor.  Sometimes it is a case of we either laugh or we cry, but a lot of times it is just his quick wit.  The other night we were watching Family Feud.  One of the questions that was ask of a hundred men, 'what is a word that you could use to describe a peach that you would also used to describe a woman.' One of the answers given by the hundred men was'fuzzy.'  And the family guessed it...when it was actually one of the answers, Roger says, 'Well, who would say that...nobody would say that.' Then he started laughing and said, 'I guess they do, remember your brother used to say Why, Hell-o Fuzzy!  And he did...he was not actually calling someone Fuzzy though...it was sort of a light way of swearing...If he was looking for something and finally found it, he might say 'WHy, Hell-o Fuzzy!  Here it is'  or if he and Roger were working or discussing how to do something, it might be, 'well, Hell-o fuzzy, that won't work!'  It was not hello...it was Hell-o. This is probably not funny to anyone else...I have ask both my other brothers if they remember this and neither of them do...but Roger and I sure do."},

I have a hard time zooming in and tracking with my little point & shoot camera.This is way down at the end of a pond...I was surprised this photo turned out even this good...again, trying to zoom in and track the two swans was difficult. I managed this capture as these swans passed over right in front of us. There were several Canada Geese...this group was near us on the north side of the road.This is the pond on the south side of the road...and this is showing just a small portion of the geese that were up on the bank.  I have never seen the quite like this before.  I have seen them in the fields near other ponds, though so guess it amounts to the same thing.**********************Roger's BP was fairly high again tonight.  I don't know why.  He had had a coughing spell right as I took it...I waited a couple minutes to take it and it was still 163/88.  In the hospital and rehab they wanted to keep the upper number 140 or below because of the fact that he had had the bleeds.  Again, I gave him a whole BP pill instead of the normal half a pill...it came down quickly tonight so maybe the whole pill was not needed.************I have told some of my blog friends of the things Roger is having to relearn but haven't shared them in detail on here.  Simple things we all take for granted.  Things like telling the time.  He can read a digital watch, though sometimes numbers pop out of his mouth that are not what he means to say.    It is almost as if he just has to say something...but I can say not it isn't 3:00...and he will look again and say, oh, it is 1:00. As for a clock with a dial...he is having to learn to tell time all over that way.  But is really improving with that.  As long as I don't ask him to do too many times in a short period. But don't ask him what year it is...he seldom gets that right.  He cannot just sit down and read...he has to spell out words and then can usually tell you what they are.   But what is funny, a lot of times he can read longer words.  He can write words a lot easier than he can print them, though he still has some trouble with a few letters in writing.  But nothing like when he prints.  And I have him print the alphabet most days. I won't put it all in this one post, but will continue to tell some of the things he deals with as time goes on.First this pic...again not a great photo, but still I like the subject.  There were about a dozen, maybe 14 swans out in this field...most were sleeping.  But two or three remained alert.  I assume on purpose.   To watch for danger.  They were too far out plus it being the middle of the day...didn't make for a great photo.******************Now, I want to share a site with you, it is called Sean of the South.  Well, let me go back in time a bit...he has a book out by the same name.  I found it through a newsletter of kindle books.  It was free.  I told my SIL about it, she bought an actual book for her brother.  And she read it.  Now I got the one for my kindle, but had not read it yet.So she reads it and discovers his website...and at the top of the page you can subscribe.  Except me...but that is another story.Anyway, so since I can't get the subsription to work, she forwards the stories to me...THIS one--The Big Thing....is the one that came this morning....if you read no other, read it. But I think some of you will enjoy all the stories.  At the first link I gave you, you can scroll and see the stories.  Just realize that down at the bottom of each story on the lower right side, you have to click  'more' to see the whole story.  The word 'more' is in light gray and barely noticeable for me.I hope you will read and tell me if you enjoy it/them as much as I do.  They are wonderful.*********Roger's blood pressure was up last night...I could not focus enough to blog after I discovered that.  He had eaten salty popcorn and I am assuming that did it.  I increased one of his BP meds and it finally came down by the time he went to bed about 4 hours later.  Don't worry, I am still not giving him as much as they originally said for him to take of this med. His BP is still down this morn, so things look brighter.  We have to run errands this morn...but hopefully I will get to visit some later..Love you guys!  And don't forget to read The Big Thing."},

And I had not mentioned this but he had an Upper GI yesterday.  And it didn't really show anything.  The reason it was ordered is that he has a chronic cough.  They wanted to rule out his acid reflux causing the cough.  And it did rule it out.  The doctor did take a couple biopsies.  There was a place in the wall of the stomach that looked a different color, so he took one from there and one from another spot.**********We had to come home today and had just a about 45 minutes before we had to go to therapy.  After we got home from there, I have not did a single thing.  Just totally wiped out.  This morn I was awake by 5:00 and could not sleep any more.  And the same thing yesterday morn, though yesterday I had lain back down and was going to at least try to sleep.  The hospital called to see if we could come in for the Upper GI right then, so we had to rush and get down there.  We were out of there by around noon-12:30ish.  It had been scheduled to begin at 1:00 so we were both happy to have gotten the call.Anyway, I have had no energy to blog...not sure if I will get back to it tomorrow or not.  But I did want to let you know that prayers have been answered."},

With one end having a sort of tack room...some corn was kept in there, some feed for old Bob, and his harness hung in there.  We had to have a latch that opened from the inside, because he was smart enough to get one on the outside open.I don't know how tobacco is hung in barns in other areas, but around our area, it was total physical work... there would be one person standing on the wagon reaching the tobacco to the first person standing on the bottom tier poles...he would reach it to the third person who stood on the second row of tier poles and he would hang it up on the 3rd row of poles.  (Notice the 3rd row is up where the roof meets the side of the barn.)  BTW, he could not just stand on one pole and hang tobacco..he had to spraddle two poles till once he got the tobacco hung, he could make sure there were spaces between the stalks on the stick of tobaco, plus make sure there was space between it and the one hung before.  And the same goes for the second row of tier poles. The tobacco had to have space for air to move around for it dry and cure.  Otherwise it would get moldy and rot.  When grading season came, it all had to be taken down, but by then it was just a fraction of the weight...I could even walk on one pole, hold on to the pole above with one hand and get tobacco with the other...but the only time mom would have let me do it is if it were just the two of us.*************I spent hours and hours in this barn as a kid...my niece and I played up there hours on end, read books, carried mud from the creek and made stuff with it...we had swings, and also played on those tier poles.  We thought no more of walking across that second row of tier poles than walking on the ground...we would go over to the side and hold on to the cracks and walk along that 2  x 6 all along the barn.  Other girls had playhouses....we had a barn!I often wonder if mom knew all we did...I think she must have.  I know she seen us do some of it...now I couldn't even walk across the first tier pole.  Heights really bother me now...another thing I never in my life expected to happen.  But I do enjoy remembering things we did."},

{"title": "Fabric", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2016", "text": "We made a run to Terre Haute, stopped by a fabric shop there which I won't name.  I made a couple fabric purchases.Fat quarter bundles.  The first time I have ever bought them for myself.  I think I have bought one or two as gifts, but never for myself.  People like them because the fabric choices are made for them.  These two were not laying together, but after I got home, I thought, wow, they almost go together.Just look at these solids...Aren't they beautiful?Now, as to why I am not mentioning the fabric shop by name.  I always check to see if I get the amount of fabric I pay for.  To me, good shops give just a tad bit over the amount...just to make up for if they cut crooked.  Of the ten of these, one solid measured a quarter inch over 18 inches in length, a bout three of them measured the 18 inches by tugging the fabric tight.  And the others all were about 1/8 inch shy of 18 inches.I won't say anything to them....it is not that much. I was thinking when I had bought a length of fabric they gave a bit extra, so will wait and see how it goes when I buy a length. I just think good fabric shops give at least a thumbs width extra.  It is good policy and makes for good will.  And some of my favorite shops give an inch or two.  Of all the quilt shops I have been to, most are the latter.  As I said, I think before when I have purchased from this shop, that I have gotten a tad bit extra.  So will try to withhold judgement.  I got these at a good price, so shouldn't complain now.I just have to show the prints individually.Maybe I should have taken more time with the photos,but if you click to expand the view, you will get a good feel for the fabric.This one almost has a Christmas feel to it...almost.So there you have them...if you are a quilter you will probably enjoy seeing these.  Otherwise you might find this boring."},

There was a purse, there was a necklace, there was a watch, and I cannot remember what all else.  But best of all, she was there.  Such joy!I don't remember a whole lot else about it other than being so happy she was there, but I do remember a couple incidents.  One night she, her husband, and my brothers were playing cards.  I think it was a game called Tripoly.  There were chips, and there was always an extra hand dealt.  Well, I was not playing...I was sitting as close to Fran as I could get.She started having me check the extra hand for cards she needed...and I would.  If it was there I would sneak it to her, and put the one she discarded back in the extra hand of cards.  I don't know how long this went on, she was winning, and her husband realized what she was doing.  No one got really mad, or anything, but they did quit playing.   I still laugh just thinking about it.I don't remember whether the next day was Christmas or if it was two or three days till Christmas, but whenever it was, mom cooked a ham.  According to my brothers, we had ham before but this is the first time I remember having it.  And I LOVED it....every time I passed, I was eating a bite of ham.  And I guess I just ate too much....that night I got sick and vomited and vomited.And I remember Fran getting up to take care of me, and telling mom to go on back to bed.  I remember her washing my face so gently with a cool wet wash rag.  And I knew everything would be okay.  Oh, how I miss that sister."},

He mentioned the Superman Song which is by Five for Fighting.  Well, that wasn't it but it did lead me to looking for artists similar to Five for Fighting.  And I found the mention Colin Hay, who was a member of Men at Work--are you old enough to remember them?  Anyway,  it led me back to this song:I don't remember how I originally found this song, but it is one of our favorites.  We have sat here and listened to it two or three times.Along the way I happened to bump into The One I love/David Gray,  which made me want to look up Shatter/o.a.r,..along with All I Want/Toad the Wet Sprocket.Then I found this...I think you will enjoy watching it.  One little boy is really shy, but the other end up having a good time.  I had not seen it before but am sitting here with a big old smile on my face:...so thanks to EG's post, we have had a really enjoyable evening.  I first saw her post at about 8:00 p.m.  and it was about 11:30 before I zeroed in on it.

(By the way, look closely at her back...it is almost as if it has a design on it besides the stripes.)5.  I love a photo where the road is inviting....there are always so many roads I want to travel down.  I can remember as a child always wondering what was down this or that road or around the bend.I showed one of these leaf potholders last time I joined WNF5, but it was not finished...so here is what they look like.That's it from this little corner of the world....We took Tootie to the park yesterday....She can always count on her papaw to play with her...Other times she entertains herself...and us to."},

(I just had to go on google earth and look up the name....The Gathering Place Restaurant is its name.) I there, there is the 'round table' that I assume is for the regulars that gather there for coffee and to visit.  I was half listening to some of them and talking to  Roger.  I heard this one guy mention someone coming to stay with them.  I did not catch the details of why...but part of what I had heard made me think they had people stay with first one family and then another.  I wondered was the person staying a itinerant preacher?  I couldn't think what else.So, I really started listening when I heard him telling that it was Christmas and his grandma had knitted him a hat and mittens.  I took it as that was her standard gift to him.  So he went on to tell that it was Christmas morn and they were opening their gifts, and the gentleman staying with them was sitting off to the side just watching everyone.He opened his mittens and looked over at the gentleman just sitting there.  He picked the other gift up from his grandma and knew that it was a hat.  So he took it to his grandmother and asked her if she minded him giving it to the gentleman staying with them.  Of course she told him to go ahead.So he took it over to him, and gave it to him and wished him Merry Christmas.  He said the tears just started streaming down the man's face....who said it was the first Christmas present he had had in 7 years!"},

Autumn is slowly approaching in our neck of the woods, just little spots here and there of brilliant color.  Too bad I don't have a single photo to prove it.  However, I did snap a photo or two of my wisteria's leaves.4.  Most of you are probably tired of seeing this spider, but I find it fascinating...I am wondering what it will do when we start to have hard frosts.  (This was taken today...I also told Roger I bet it gets tired of me coming and looking at it.)5.

Plus, it is easy to make my comment if I can have the post open behind the comment box.  I guess I am just lazy.Do you prefer blogging or Facebook?  I much prefer blogging...I have not been on Facebook in at least a couple days, maybe longer.  But I pop into blogs off and on all day if I am here. Well, that is it from my little corner of the world...its about time for a good snack...but I don't know what that will be."},

This one takes a whole big area at the front of their cemetery and covers it with little American flags to commemorate the innocent lives lost that day.  I hope you will take time to see the link...I always wonder how long it takes them to put all those little flags out.  And how do they get them lined up so precisely?I don't fly a flag, but I tell you since that day, I have often thought about it.  And I still may do it.  Or at least get one to fly at holidays.Even with that happening, people are willing to go to great lengths to live here.   *************Roger has  been working on plumbing all afternoon.  It ended up that one of the fixtures he got was torn up to begin with.  He ran down to our local hardware and the guys were already leaving, had locked the doors and were headed to their trucks, but turned around and let him in to get what he needed.  This time he paid, but another time, they just sent him home with whatever it was, and said pay the next day or whenever he was in.  What can I say...small town living can really be the way to go.  Since I have not had water all afternoon, I have dishes waiting on me, so guess I will go take care of them before the football game comes on!   Also The Voice starts...I am recording it...so can watch one then the other."},

I made a call our TV provider...had to make a 3rd call before I got a reduction in our price.  I really was ready to cancel.  I think we watch more Netflix and YouTube than we do TV.   Anyway, spend over an hour doing that.  The first call I made I was on the phone forever with the lady I was talking to.4.  I had hung out a load of clothes, and didn't really look at my shoes when I came in.  I tracked grass all in the kitchen...so had that mess to clean. 5.  I did iron a few shirts...am I the only one that irons things?  I don't all the time...but I do sometimes when I have hung certain shirts outside.  I don't hate to iron, but is sure not my favorite thing to do.  Unless it is fabric/quilt stuff.I'll leave you with a song..."},

I always smile when I see this photo of Lorelei and Otti....but that is not what I am thinking will make you smile.It is this...Lorelei has played in the bathtub every night she has been here.  Has enjoyed it more than usual.  Last night I went in there to check on her and she was pretending something with her toys, but for the life of me I cannot remember what.  I guess because of what she said to me just knocked it right out of my mind.She looked up at me and said, \"Mamaw, if you die before I have my babies, don't worry.  I will tell them all about their great grandma!\"And she and I both just laughed...I think she is thinking she would lay and tell her babies stories the way she makes me tell her stories every night.  She wants them about her mom, her aunt, herself, Papaw or me. This is not the first time me dying has come up, though it is the first time she has ever mentioned it and not been sort of tearful.  She used to really worry about it.  I don't know why.  Also, she has mentioned it before in relation to me getting to see her babies.I know beyond a doubt, I did not think of how many children I wanted at her age...oh, she has decided on two children, too.  She has always wanted babies, but this visit is the first time I think I have heard an exact number."},

{"title": "Couldn't think of anything soo...", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2015", "text": "A repeat photo, but they are doing this now. I could not think of anything to post about, and I had seen Jacqueline's post here --it is a post of 25 things about herself.  And I have been wondering ever since could I come up with 25 things about myself.1.  I have embarrassing moments I will never, ever share with anyone.  They are that embarrassing.2.  There's very little else you haven't heard about at one time or another.3.  My mom cooked on a wood stove till I was in 3rd or 4th grade.4.  I love to take a small spoon of peanut butter and dip it in sugar...it is soooo good.  But I have not had it in years and years and years.5.  I attempted to make my first skirt when I was probably 6 or 7 years old.  I can remember asking my mom if I could have this red material to play with.  We had company, and I don't know if she said yes without really thinking, or if she didn't care.  I tried to make a straight skirt...and it was so tight I could hardly walk in it, much less go up steps.  What I don't remember is how I made it...and I don't remember how I fit it around me.   I don't know if I used the treadle sewing machine but I think I must have.  I know I did not put a zipper in at that age.  I can remember clear as day trying to go up the back steps.  Again, I don't remember if I was able to or had to give up...but I do know I was embarrassed and no one was even noticing.  I took it off and I don't know what became of it.  I think I hid it when I took it off.6.  I am the youngest of 8 children, or as we say the baby of 8.7.  I am younger than one of my nephews.  Most of my nieces and nephews seems more like brothers and sisters since we are close to the same age.8.  I have the churn we used to make buttermilk and butter in when I was a kid.  And also the dash that my dad made.9.  I walked the railroad part way to and from school almost every day of my life.  First to elementary...I still had a couple blocks to go after I got off the railroad.  Then when high school started, I still walked it, only to catch the bus.  There were a couple different little stores that we could wait in out of the cold till the bus came.10.  When I graduated, I only sent invitations to my family.  But as I was getting off the bus one day, the bus driver said, \"Here, you didn't send an invitation, but I am not treating you any different than the rest of the kids.\"  And he gave me a card with money in it...that still touches my heart. And the wife of a man my brother worked for/with sent me a gift, even though she didn't know me. It was a lady's clutch billfold.  I kept it for years just in remembrance of her.11.  I love google earth!12.  In Jacqueline's post she has a random thing about the praying mantis...well, it quickly ran a bell with me.  When I was in high school, I had a young praying mantis in my bedroom and was leaving it there on purpose.  Well, when company came, my bedroom became the guest room and I slept on the couch.   My brother and his wife came in and he took my praying mantis outside and set it free, not realizing I wanted it left in there.  Then again, maybe he didn't care...and his wife at the time probably did not appreciate it at all.13.  I like mustard and onion sandwiches...it has been a while since I had one, though.14.  I had rather drive a truck as anything...I see a lot of cars I really, really like but if given a choice, I would take a truck any day of the week.  A truck was the first vehicle I bought myself...an F100 with 3 on the tree, as they say. 15.  I learned to drive a stick shift coming from Tennessee to Indiana...to make a long story short, my brother's leg was broke, he was staying with a sister up here, and wanted his truck for when he got well.  I don't remember all the details, but he had went home for a bit, and I went home, and he taught me how to shift gears, etc on that 400 mile trip home in a Ford F250.16.  I always think it so odd to go into a home that has no books visible.  And actually, I have been in some that I don't think had any books.  How does a person live without books?17.  Used to when I first met someone, I always liked to see their music selections.  I loved to see what albums they had.  Now, if given the chance, I would see what type of books they read. 18.  I worked at an apple orchard for 19 years...the first 5 years were mainly in the picking season.  Then I began working year round and did a little bit of everything.  It was the best place ever to work. 19.  I live with a lot of regrets...things I wish I had done different.  Things I wish I HAD done, or at least tried to do.20.  I/we seem to attract strays...be it animals or sometimes the two legged variety.  It is me with animals..and Rogere with people.  Roger went to the hardware store and met someone and came home with a really good, new friend. 21.  I met a good quilting friend through a quilt chat room back in the days of AOL.  We don't see each other much, but still she was a great friend.  She stopped quilting and switched back to crocheting and knitting.  But she sure made a lot of quilts!22. I am still friends with my childhood friends...23.  Every fall is when I miss Tennessee the most.  I have lived in Indiana far longer than the 19 years of growing up in Tennessee but Tennessee is still home!24.  As I grew up, it was a real treat to get to buy a pop of any kind an have a candy bar.  Money was scarce and we seldom bought pop, candy, or ice cream.25.  To this day my favorite ice cream for a float is butter-pecan!How is that for some random things...We came over to Sarah's...kind of spur of the moment and will be heading home in a little while!  With Lorelei."},

(It had one more wire than the old one.)So Ryan called someone from the local heating and cooling...and he swung by in less than half an hour and wired it...also filled it with freon since it was little low.  I cannot believe how quickly I could feel the difference in this house. After 3 days and 2 nights without AC, it feels wonderful.  The heating &AC guy just lives 3 or 4 blocks away, and Roger will be helping his son with his bow.3.  That leads me to say thank God for small towns...even if Roger had not heard Ryan order it, he could count on him doing it.  If Ryan says he will do it, he will do it.  And at our local grocery store...I don't know who does the hiring there but they have the best kids.  They are always so kind to the older people.  It is just good for the heart to see them. 4.  Last weekend we saw the first episode of The Crimson Field--it starts out with three young women arriving at a field hospital in France during World War I.  It is really, really good.  So we are looking forward to the rest of the series.  The series came out in 2014, but this was the first we had heard of it...it is on our PBS station.5.  I came across Northern Borders--we both really enjoyed it.  It had that feel of an older, well done movie.  Click here for some clips on Youtube.  You know if both of us says it is really good, it has got to be good.  We don't have the same taste--or maybe I should say Roger has a wider range of what he likes.  That is my 5, please share yours!"},

Cause guess what?In the wee hours of the morn when I was headed to bed, the AC started making a funny noise.    I got up and Roger was already up...I told him what was going on.  He could not hear it of course.  I checked outside, and it was definitely different sounding.  And not a neighbor's AC...not that I was wanting them to have bad luck, I just really was not wanting it to be ours.I had already noticed that it was not blowing cold air...so I wondered was it froze up....every now and then when it is so humid, moisture will gather and everything will be covered in ice.  I came in to get the flashlight, and Roger reminded me to check the basement.  Well, it was so loud down there...I say loud, but it is partly the tone that really got to me.  I turned it off, and went and looked for the lines to have frost/ice on them.  Nothing there.Checked the unit itself, nothing there.  So had to turn it off for the night.  Roger went and talked a buddy this morn to find who has the best heating and AC place here in town.   Came home and we were discussing calling them, and Roger said to wait a minute and let him check something.  Well, it ends up the fan motor was not working...he got it going and it ran and ran.  At first I didn't think it was cooling the house..but finally realized it was. So he took that motor off and took it down to the hardware store...they didn't have that one  in stock, but they ordered it while he was there and it is supposed to be here in the morn!  I hope they are right.  It is so hot and humid in here tonight...I would be tempted to go to a hotel."},

So thought I would copy and paste it here.****************************These photos were taken long before I even thought about a camera, and at least the top two maybe before I was born. But I am not sure about that. The top is our horse, Old Bob, and that is our dad. Neal nor I know who is on the horse...not any of us kids. And if you look close you see a little girl standing behind Bob. I have no idea who that is either. Bob looks like he is either getting ready to go to work, or coming in from working...notice the collar, etc.I did not think I had a picture of Bob, but my nephew reminded me of this one. And I had it...but I did not have the one I wanted and of all the photos I took once I got a camera, I cannot find one picture with him in it.The photos below are taken looking down the hollow from our old home place....all the fields you see plowed up were probably all the work of Bob...as Neal mentioned in his blog, Bob probably kept us from starving. And though these fields don't look very big, it is still a lot of work for one old work horse.I am sure my brothers could tell you much more about it than me.  Each year the ground would be turned over with a plow, which a friend did that had a team of horses, followed by Bob pulling the disc harrow, and maybe pulling a drag over it after that. I barely remember the drag...I don't even have a clear picture in my mind. So I hope Neal or George will pipe in here and explain it. I guess you would call it an implement to pull over the ground to level it out more and maybe to help get rid of the bigger clods of dirt....I know this picture I am painting is about as clear as mud, but still maybe you will feel some of the same feelings I have when I look at these old photos. It is a time gone by that will never be again. And especially for us that know this place, it does not even look like the same place today. It seemed so big back then, and now when we go up there, we wonder how they raised all the food that they did there.Plus there was tobacco to raise and field corn for the animals, and probably corn to raise to for cornmeal. I don't know if we raised hogs when we lived up there, but I think we did. When we moved to the new house...we raised and butchered 4 hogs every year...or at least most years. But I will save talking about that for another day.It is later....I wrote the above this morn and I have just got off the phone with my brother.  We were reminiscing.  He reminded me a bit back about how Old Bob did not like to be spit on...I don't know if anyone ever actually did.  But he got mad if you just made the sound like you were spitting.  You ask how do you know he got mad?  Make no mistake--he had body language.  His ears went back and you could tell as plain as day.  I can remember seeing him get mad at someone, but don't remember who or what for.  The funny thing about it, I told Neal I never had him get mad at me...I think he would have bit someone had he thought he could get by with it when he was mad.  But I tended to spoil him what little I could.  He was done getting age on him by the time I got very old.   I can remember riding on him a few times when I was very little to get from the old place to our new house and I can remember my older brother plowing the garden a time or two with him...but basically I remember him being retired for the most part since I was old enough to start remembering much."},

I started out to encourage myself to take more pictures to post, and also do more quilting to have to share on here.  Hence the name Pics & Pieces.  Photography and Quilting.  My mom and her friends called it quilt piecing...I don't hear that term any more.  If anyone says it, it is me.I also started it to have a record of my days...though I don't share everything on here.  I wish I had the nerve to share more.  Though I guess I share enough...maybe more than people want to hear when everyone is getting sick.I found people I love to visit...and when I have been away from blogging for a bit, I usually go back and see what they have posted in my absence. One or two blogs I have went back and looked at ALL their posts.  And there are more that I would love to do that with, but just don't have the time.I just simply love seeing everyone's world...there are blogs I visit for their photos.  There are blogs I visit to read.  Some blogs I would visit whether they have a photo or not...it is the reading material I go for though I do enjoy their photos--they are so interesting to me I would visit photos or not.  Some I go to for the reading, and the photos.  I would visit whether it was one or the other cause their photos are interesting without the stories behind them. And the words would stand alone, too.There are one or two that provide comedy relief... I also have a long list of quilty blogs I visit...two or three I visit almost daily to see if they have posted, but I do have a separate folder of quilt blogs I visit maybe once a month...and I just go back through till I come to a the blog post I seen last.  I seldom comment on these blogs...not even sure why.  I will come nearer commenting if they don't have many comments.************I not forget my granddaughter...her mom and I and Papaw love to click on the label Lorelei Rose and then just sit and go back through time and see how she has changed. We don't do it every week, maybe not every month...but we do do it now and again and enjoy it.  Sometimes we go back and just watch the videos.There are more reasons I blog, but right now these are the ones prominent in my mind."},

I cannot even think how many of these I have thrown away.  And I have a lot of spools of thread that are almost empty.  Some from quilting and some from making clothing.I wondered, does every woman keep thread and needles just for repairs?  Do you just keep a couple colors of thread or do you go buy the color as needed?  I cannot imagine not having a sewing machine, but I know a lot of people don't sew at all."},

I don't know what it is about a fire, but I don't think I know a single person that doesn't like to sit by a fire of any kind. We don't have a fireplace in our home, but I sure wouldn't mind if we did. Everyone else always thinks about the dirt and dust, but I could easily put up with that. I know I am one of the few people my age that can remember their mother cooking on a wood cookstove....We had linoleum on all the floors...and they were cold of the morning. Mom was the first one up, of course. And I would wake up next--I don't know if it was all the time or just some of it. But I distinctly remember hollering, \"Mommy, come and get me.\" She would come and carry me from the bed to a chair sitting at the end of the cookstove. There I would sit and stick small splinters of wood in through the draft at the end...while she made biscuits and cooked breakfast.The wood cookstove had a thermometer on the door but it was broken, however my mom could bake biscuits, bread and cakes and pies with no trouble. I recall seeing her open the oven door and sticking her hand in to get a feel for the temperature. And she never used a timer of any sort. (I cannot remember anything without a timer these days.)Our new house was heated with a coal stove for the first few years...not sure how many. Probably at least 3 or 4. I can remember sticking potatoes in the coals to bake as a snack. I think I was in 3rd or 4th grade when a coal furnace was installed. I am not sure what happened to that stove, but the old wood cookstove sits in the basement of the homeplace. At least it did the last time I checked....that has been a while ago.I do not know what it is that draws me to the old times...I cannot imagine doing all my mom had to do with as little as she had to do with. But at the same time, I think these days stuff almost owns us...I think there is medium that I have not achieved. I have more than I need but hold on to stuff because I feel like as soon as I get rid of it, I will need it.But looking at the bottom picture of the fire place--the utensils around it are probably all a lot of women had to cook with. And they made do with it fine. I for one, admire the women that came before."},

She has been sick off and on ever since she started school.  And really and truly a lot of the kids have been sick.  It seems to be normal.  But she has really had the ups and downs since Christmas.  She would seem to be over something, and then start again.So, Sarah asks me Monday can we come over to stay with her...sometimes it happens till her dad is off when she is sick through the week.  But he was heading back to work...so we got ready and headed over there.  Sarah had taken off half a day to get her to the doctor...they said it was viral when Sarah told them all that she had been sick...and she had talked to them on the phone on previous ocassions.Lo had got up feeling and acting better that morn, but to Roger and I she still looked sick.  And was just not quite herself.  That night she was up during the night crying cause she felt bad...I went in there and just stayed with her a few minutes.  she just wanted to hold my hand...when she let go, I thought aha, she is back asleep.  I started to ease out of the room...she pops up and says 'Nite, nite Mamaw.  Are you really going to stay tomorrow night?  Give papaw a hug and tell him I love him.  When you go home, hug Mama Cat, Bubbie and Puss Puss and tell them that I love them and miss them\".....these last were actually after I told her we were staying another night.  Such a child!It is so long to go into, lets just say she ended up back to the Dr. on Thursday and this time she got an antibiotic and she got up back to her old self today.  Though I won't fully believe it is over till she goes more than a couple days feeling good.********Now for some laughter....the following happened just a couple of hours ago...I swear to goodness I am not making this up.A little background is Roger takes his watch off fairly often and loses it for a short while...usually when he is working out in his shop, or sometimes when he showers. So tonight we were sitting here and out the corner of my eye, I saw him looking at his right wrist but I didn't think anything of it.  He looked at me and said, \"Well, Rosemary, (Mary is my middle name) I have lost my watch again.\"   He was totally serious...and he started to get up to go look for it and says, \"NO, I didn't it's right here...on my left wrist!\"Oh, how we have laughed...I can still see the look on his face.  He got up and went in the kitchen and yelled at me, Hey I found my feet--they are on the end of my legs...Hey, I bet I could find two new cars out in the garage.....and on and on."},

I was for sure never upstairs...and I don't even remember which room they had their visit in.  There was a farm pond not far from it.  I never fished in it, but mom's friend did.It is funny, I knew I had to behave at her house.  Mom's friend had only had one daughter...I never met that daughter.  She lived in another state I think.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because Mrs. H was older, or it was cause Mr. H. was sickly, I just knew to be quiet and behave.But if we went to the Jones, I could climb trees, and explore around the place and come in and out and nothing was thought about it.  And if there were kittens, someone would be sure to take me to them, or tell me where they were.  (My mom hated cats...)  Actually, it was one of the Jones that talked mom into letting me have my first cat.Anyway, any time I see any sort of a wrap-around porch, I think of Mrs. H...."},

He tends to watch random things...I tend to find series that I will watch till I watch them all...recently, it was All Creatures Great and Small, before that New Tricks, and Ballykissangel was somewhere in the mix.  At one time YouTube had all the Great British Sewing Bee shows on, then could only watch clips for a while.  Right now, there are 3 full length shows available from Season 3...below is the first one.2.  Do you ever pause and think how sewing is done everywhere.  Some out of necessity, but a lot is done by people just trying to make something beautiful.  How many of you have heard of  molas....click here to see a video showing some...they are made by hand.  So many stitches...adding and taking away layers of cloth.  Or click here to see the Siddis making quilts.  Again by hand...3.  How many of you have what you call guilty little pleasures?  Mine is the mini-powdered donuts that you get in a bag.  I LOVE them.  I don't especially care for the normal sized powdered donut, but give me a bag of the small ones and I am good to go.4.  I have not fed the birds in days...simply because of the number of cowbirds that come.  The last day I filled the feeder, it took them approximately 3 hrs to empty it...and the feeder holds close to a gallon of feed.  The little songbirds did not get to enjoy any of it.  I will eventually start  to feed them again...just waiting a bit in hopes that the cowbirds will have moved on.5.  We seen the doctor today...it was just a follow up to the test/procedure Roger had done.  The one biopsy they took was benign...did not show any pre-cancer cells.  So that is good.Linking to Tanya's Willy Nilly Friday 5"},

I did not even try to photo graph the rest of them as they were farther on down.   Then this photo is on the south side of the road....in years past we seldom saw anything on this one...oh, maybe a couple pairs of something.  But never in numbers like this.And of course we saw hawks...Deb identified another shot like this as a rough-legged hawk.  I swear you would think this is the same shot, but if you right click, and click open in a new window, you will see they have different image numbers.There also the usual Northern Harriers skimming over the ground. ************I did cut out a dress for Lorelei yesterday.  It will have a zipper...do you know how long it has been since I put a zipper in anything?  I cannot even remember the last time I did.  I am not sure if I will work on it today, but am hoping, too.  If it turns out half decent, I will show it on here sometime, but if it is a bust, I probably won't even mention it again."},

We are watching this show about owls.  This is only a short clip...I wish it was the entire show.  It is so interesting to watch.  Well, just wanted to let everyone know that things looked good today.  Will try to finish catching up on my visiting tonight and tomorrow.Oh, one additional thing...thanks to all who admitted they look in lighted windows at night.  I had always wondered if I were the only one.  I don't think Roger even thinks about making an effort to look in...I guess it is a woman thing."},

When we come home and it is night time, I always like peeping in lit windows as we pass.  Will anyone else admit to doing this or am I the only one?  I don't know why the night time makes me think about this more...but when I see the lit windows, I wonder do happy people live there, or are they going through heartaches and sicknesses.  Are they an older couple or are they young and just beginning life.  Just a million questions go through my mind, but the funny thing is, it leaves me feeling sort of sad.2.  This also leads me to thinking about all the living that goes on around us...just in our neighborhood even.  And we know nothing about it.  When we were younger, we knew our neighbors better, knew what was happening, what their worries were...what was good.  3.  I had Walk On by U2 in my head forever just a bit back...was there in my mind well over a week.  I had just stopped having it go round in my head and I saw this post by Lavender Dreams.  One of her last lines in the post is Walk on!  I am afraid it will get stuck again if I don't find something to replace it. It belongs to that list of songs I call Orchard Songs...songs I probably listened to a ga-zillion times when working at the orchard.4.  Maybe I will replace it with Good to Be Home by The Everybodyfields.  It is my all time favorite song...I know I have said it before but hoping someone new will see this.                          This video was made by my brother with pictures from in and around home....so much of the area you see in this video was my playground when I was a kid.  When I came Indiana, I think one of the very hardest things about it was not having the freedom to roam that I did there.5.  Roger has a test at the hospital tomorrow.  We have to be there at 8:30...say a prayer for all things to be okay.It will probably be tomorrow evening before I get to visit...Linking to:  Willy Nilly Friday 5"},

It is really good.  Wikipedia says:  Grantchester is a detective drama set in the 1950's Cambridgeshire village of Grantchester near Cambridge, where Local Anglican vica Sidny Chamgers develops a side line in sleuthing--withe the enitially reluctant help of grumpy Detective Inspector Geordie Keating. 5.  Do you like grilled cheese?  And what do you like with it?  When I was getting over the flu during the holidays, I think grilled cheeses saved my life...almost.  LOL  They were one of the few things that tasted good.  I generally use American cheese, but sometimes we get farmer's cheese and use rye bread.....and Sarah was making a grilled cheese and used pepperjack and it looked yummy.  I normally have either dill pickles or tomato soup with mine.  I will eat bread and butter pickles as a last resort."},

Penney store'--and 'the Belks'..I remember putting the 'the' in front of the name of the store...just had not thought about it in years.2.  I have spent literally hours this afternoon and night looking for a spool of thread.  I kid you not.  I will be making a quilt for one of my daughters in the future...she bought a lot of the fabric for it when she was here at Christmas, and she bought a spool of thread to quilt it with....I knew I would need at least two, but didn't say anything.  So, this afternoon, I had to order a second spool of thread for Lorelei's quilt.  I thought while I was at it I would order the second one for my daughter's quilt but I need to know the identification number...I ran downstairs to get it...it was not where I thought it would be.  Needless to say I have went through everything at least three times and still no thread.  King Tut thread has a number, plus they give it a name, and I cannot remember neither one!3.  I just cooked our Christmas ham last Sunday....we still have ham left.  I have frozen some to have for ham and beans later.  I had wanted to wait and cook it when we could be with Sarah and Jeremy, but with first one being sick and then another being sick, it has not happened.  So I cooked it for us.  It has been good.4.

I know I am not much too look at now but at one time I was the  answer to prayers.  I was loved.   Someone once saved and scrimped to have me, and was so happy when they could finally claim me as their own.  I was one of the high points of their life.  They worked and did all kinds of stuff just to have me.  They planted flowers and bushes for beauty to surround me.I had a family….I heard the laughter of the children along with their quiet talks with mom and dad.   I heard the children playing on my porch and in the yard. They had a swing in the old oak tree that used to stand out to the side here.  They caught lightening bugs in the dusk of summer evenings…finally, after growing tired they would settle on my front porch to plan for another day.I was home to them...I kept them warm in the winter and sheltered them from the storms of summer.  I was the place they took refuge in when life got hard.  I saw them through the Great Depression, I was here when the son came home from WWII.  I saw one daughter sneak her first kiss in the swing on my front porch.  Another left here to be the first to go to college.Meals were cooked in my kitchen, Thanksgiving and Christmases were celebrated, friends came and went.  I was at the center of their life.  My living room was a welcoming friend at the end of a long day's work.  I was the holder of their dreams.What led from then to now, happened so gradually I was hardly aware of it happening…the children grew up and married and had homes  of their own…after several years the dad died, and not too long after that the mom passed….you can sort of imagine the rest.  I was going through my own grieving and was hardly aware of time passing.    Now I am in this state and an eyesore to some, while a few others look at me and wonder what tales I could tell if I could talk. *********Some of you have read this--I hope you don't mind the repeat.  I am bringing it back to share with Linda's Wednesday Wit and Wisdom at Senior Adventures.  At least if I can remember.I remember taking the photos in the fog...almost as if it were yesterday.  This is only a couple or three miles from here on a country road.  I was pulled to the side as far as I could, but still felt I had to rush.I have probably posted one or both of these before, but still I like them.We ran to Walmart right before dark.  Of course it was dark by the time we came home...and the road was so slick we drove along about 25 or 30 miles per hour for most of the way.  Thankfully, there were few cars on that road, and the few we saw were creeping along, too.We saw where one had went down over the bank...we probably just missed seeing it happen.  And after we got home, we heard all kinds of ambulances.Anyway, it was trying to get foggy, and it reminded me of these."},

That is not a real pattern.  It is a sort of improvisational sewing and is fun.What is not fun:  I am never going to get rid of all the scraps in there!  I have worked with these same scraps and made I don't know how many things from them and the tote still seems full!************Today Roger needed to go to Menard's, the local home improvement store.  The one that is closest to us.  We had another stop or two, so we  were gone two or three hours.  When I walked in the back door, there was a smell.  Oh, a good smell. It smelled just like Mrs. Hayes' house used to smell.  It is hard to describe, and I have no idea why mine smelled like that.  It is a smell I have only ever smelled in her house, and I didn't know why hers smelled that way and I don't know why this one did either.Mrs. Hayes was one of my mom's best friends.  She was probably 10 yrs older than mom.  And for a while was a real close neighbor.  I am not sure if I had been born when they lived close to us, I think I was but not sure.  I just always remember that no matter where she moved to, we would go visit her once or twice a summer.  And between times, her and my mom would write each other.I don't remember what her husband called her, but she always called him MR. Hayes...I don't know if she did that when it was just them, but I never heard her call him anything else.  He was older than her, and when he died, to the best of my memory, she had a hard time finding a place to live.  She even tried living with another lady for a while....I am not sure if she just rented a room or if she shared the whole house.  (Or maybe she only talked about doing that)Then she finally got into some senior's housing, and had been living there a while when I started driving.  Then mom and I would stop by a few times a year.  And that is where I really remember the smell from. She and my mom talked quilting, and no matter if I had just been there the month before, I would still get her to get out her quilts till I could look at them.  I don't ever remember her getting tired of doing it...maybe she was just happy that I was interested."},

I talked to one of my friends the other day...I had not talked to her in a while, but had ran down to take her a couple of tomatoes from our garden.  It was late evening and she was so sound asleep she did not hear me when I knocked on the door two or three times, nor when I walked in and set the tomatoes down.She has two girl kitties.  Neither are lap cats...they won't let me near them.  Neither of them even like to sit in her lap, but one of them does come and get in bed with her when she goes to bed.She has a cat door for them till they can come and go as they please.  She was telling me that the other night before I was down there, she had went to bed and went to sleep.  About 3:00a.m. they woke her up coming in...they came to her bedroom just meowing to each other and went under the bed.  Which was weird.  Then they started growling at each other.So she rolled over, and I assume turned on a light.  They came out from under her bed and one of them had a bird.  Alive.  So she jumps up and takes it away from them...and while holding it in one hand, had to get her clothes on with the other.  Then took it out to behind her house to set it free.  (she shut their cat door till the kitties could not get back out.)  I got so tickled when she told  me all of that.She said they were always bringing her things...that this was the 7th bird this summer, besides, moths, butterflies and a dragonfly...."},

She was telling them to stop, but not enforcing it.  She talked a few minutes and said to the kids, 'come on, lets go home.'  I told the kids, \"Hold on, get all that stuff picked up!'  And she got in and helped them.  If I had not said anything, she would have just left it.  Scattered all over.Roger has had the garage open the past few days...had the bay doors open and all.  And I was out trying to clean up some other stuff, and if I told them once, I told them a dozen times between the two to stay out of the garage.  About the dozenth time, I had just told the 4 yr old to get out and stay out.and he come running back in before I even got gone.  Did I ever yell then...and his mom heard me.  In our part of the garage where we park, there is just too much they could knock down and get hurt.  I tried explaining that to the mom and she cannot even stay focused long enough to hear me out.  Then as far as Roger's shop is concerned, they are always barefoot, and there is metal shavings, and who knows what on the floor in there.  Besides the dangerous tools.  The bad thing is, I really would enjoy them if they were not so destructive...they just try to destroy my dogwood tree...the boy had broken one of my coneflowers...Roger does not even know about that one.  I have enough of them till I don't really miss it.  He likes to start digging in our yard.  Though I didn't see them do it, they got in our mail.  I know it was them, cause I can hardly keep the 4 yr old away from the mailbox.  Some of it was laying on the little table out there, an insurance statement had been opened but was stuck back in the mailbox.They come over here and are in our yard and on our porches...as if it were theirs.  We will be in the house, and they don't even know if we are home or gone.  Again, I wouldn't mind if they were not destructive.   But who lets their kids just roam around in other people's yards and on their porches.I have not seen them out since that happened yesterday....I was a case all day.  Was shaky for a long time...not from anger but just cause it is so upsetting.  And Lorelei has loved to play with them, but again, there is the destructive issue...and also, the older one can be kind of mean.  She will come over and then won't play with Lorelei.  And again, they won't listen as far as me telling them not to do something.  I tell them to stay in the front yard where I can see them, and they still want to take off to the back.  Or if we are in the back yard, they will want to go to the front.So, that is my current issue.  We should be heading out to get Lorelei here shortly!   If the kids ever come back out, and try to come over here, I am not sure how I will handle it.   I hate feeling this way towards kids...towards neighbors. Edited to add:  Ginny made the suggestion of being nice to them....well, we have did that from the time we met them.  Popsicles, drinks, whatever Lo has they have, and even when she is not here, I give them treats.  But no, not in the house.  Just too destructive."},

They have the taste that I remember from childhood.  I can close my eyes when eating one and almost feel like I am sitting on the front porch of my childhood home eating it.So, even though I was dreading it, I was all set for us to have to hunt far and wide to find them.  But we went out to our local greenhouse and there they were.  I don't know why I didn't take photos of them.  They have bigger leaves than most tomato plants...look much more like a potato plant.   Anyway, we got a dozen of them and I got four of Better Boys....I want to find some other tomatoes that I like besides the Brandywine.I love Supersonics, but the core of them just stays green for so long....so I have been trying to get away from getting them all the time.  But this will be the first year in probably over 15 or 20 years that we have not planted some of them.I did get the quilting done on the quilt, and I trimmed it...about half the time I put the binding on the first time around before I trim it, but I am starting to definitely like trimming it first and then putting the binding on.Anyway, always feel better when I accomplish something.And tomorrow Tootie will get here...Sarah says she done wants to spend more than one night....so untelling how long she will want to be here.  The bad thing is it is supposed to start raing on Sunday and be rainy for 3 or 4 days."},

Anyway, I ordered it Wednesday....from a place in Alabama.  Without ever seeing it in person.  Without ever test-driving it...I was going by the quality of my Juki 98Q...plus I posted a question on the Juki 98 group to see if others had this machine and what they thought of it.  The replies I got made me long for one even more.

I have also noticed with it, if the title of a book has the word 'thread' in it, I am going to at least look at it.4.  Has anyone besides me started enjoying some of the commercials just because of the music that takes you back to your youth.  There is one for Mazda that has Teenage Wasteland as the background music.  Another for Hyunda uses Evil Woman.  Another commercial, I don't remember what its for uses Three Dog Night's Shambala.There, I just could not resist posting it here.And there are even more old songs/commercials but can't recall them right at the moment.   Is there any that you have noticed?5.

{"title": "Cast iron pot...", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2014", "text": "Our mom had a big cast iron pot...I don't think it had a handle.  I also think hers was taller and not quite so wide in diameter as this one.  I don't remember where she kept it, or what has happened to it.  She only used it a couple times a year that I know of...well, maybe give or take a time or two.She made lye soap in it.  I don't know of anyone besides her that ever made lye soap.  And I think when she made a batch of it, a batch lasted longer than a year.  I don't even recall what she used it for.  I think I remember her using it for laundry occasionally.  Maybe rubbing on a stubborn spot and washing on the washboard.  I almost think she maybe added some to the regular wash water.  (We were washing with a wringer washer.)She also used this same pot to make lard in.  When I was growing up, we raised and butchered 4 hogs every year.  I say we...but I really didn't have much to do with it.  It was my mom and dad and brothers.  At least that I remember.  But the one thing I did do was help cut the fat into chunks for mom to make lard with.I can remember every thing just being coated with grease from us handling the fat and cutting it into chunks.  I can remember the feel of it on my hands.  To the best of my memory, we cut the fat into chunks an inch or so...we were not exact.   I don't know how long mom could wait till she made lard.  I would think she would have had to make it within a day or two because we had no place to refrigerate the pieces of fat.    Anyway, she used the cast iron pot.  She always built a small fire, and I think she used bricks to set the pot on over the fire.  And the pot was filled to the brim almost with the fat.She always used a small fire...didn't want to get it to hot.  I am not sure why.  Hoping one of my brother will maybe fill in the pieces for me.  For stirring, she had a stirrer similar to the one the woman is using in this picture.  I can remember mom making me stand and stir...I think the fire was kept small and we had to stir almost constantly to keep the lard/grease and cracklings from scorching.And she always made the lard outside, and sometimes did it for other neighbors.How I wish I had written stuff down back then....or had better memories.*************************************Sarah sent me the following conversation between Lorelei and her daddy this evening:Lorelei:  daddy, you're not the boss of me.Jeremy:  excuse me?Lorelei:  you're not the boss, God is.I don't know what they were talking about...I didn't think to ask. ***********************The house was just soooo quiet after we got back from taking her to meet her mom.   While she was here, one of the morns we were talking about what we were going to have for breakfast.  She says, \"I know what we could have!\"  I ask \"What?'  She says, \"Biscuits, gravy, and sausage!\"  Of course I fixed it the next morn.But that is not the point of the story...the point is on Sunday night she was talking to her mom and dad...she told them, \"I'm coming home tomorrow.\"  And I forget what they say...something along the lines of Oh, okay.  Then she pipes up, \"But I Got to Eat First!\"  I just figured she was saying that because I always tell her we have to have breakfast before we can leave.  She is fine the time she stays here, but usually on the day she says she is going home, she would like to get up and just leave.Anyway, that night as we were settling down for sleep, she was asking me if I had packed her stuffed toys, and did I have her dirty clothes, etc....and I said yes, I thought I had everything but we would check before we leave the next morn.  She says, OK, but I got To Eat First!  I figures she was leading to having biscuits and gravy a second timem or more of her papaw's pancakses, so I asked what she wanted.  She didn't know...she just knew she had to eat!"},

Had to take them completely off.And I swear I almost became dizzy if I did anything other than read or look at the computer and left them on.  I was trying to do a few things at once without taking them off, and boy if I turned my head quickly looking where they weren't focused, I'd get so dizzy just for a second.  Anyway, I knew my vision was worse, but not as bad as it apparently is.Thankfully, Roger was able to use epoxy and glue the lens back in.  And I have an appt. Monday to get new ones.    I have been looking at frames on line..I have no idea what I want.  So that is going to be the most time consuming part on Monday."},

{"title": "Fishing", "date": "Monday, January 27, 2014", "text": "Roger I don't know if there is a single person that reads my blog that likes to fish...well, other than some family members.  When the kids were young, we started wading the creeks and fishing with our ultra-light rod & reels...Roger and I would fish and the kids would fish and/or play.  There is not much that is more exciting than have a small mouth hit your lure...they jump out of the water and fight like crazy.  But as far as fight, if a blue gill got as big as a bass, they would be hard to land.  Some of them really fight.This is Sarah and one of her friends...But what I am leading to is, I want to go back and visit childhood.   Reading that exerpt from Where the Red Fern Grows the other night made me remember days gone by.  Especially fishing and how much fun we had. When we were kids and wanted to go fishing, we never even thought about fishing lures.  I don't even remember how old I was before I fished with a Zebco rod and reel.  Over by the creek that ran along the edge of our property, reeds grew.  We called them reeds, anyway.  They were like regular bamboo...only grew 8 or 10 feet tall and grew there wild.Whenever we wanted to go fishing, either we had one already cut, or if needed would go cut one and bring it home.  We would tie our fishing string to the little end and wind a few yards around the end, and tie a hook  and sinker to the other end.  I don't remember if we used a bobbin or not...I think we did.Then for bait, we would find some kind of can, put a couple inches of damp dirt in the bottom, and dig our own redworms.  (You night call them earthworms) I don't know why, but sometimes mom threw some water off the back porch...I don't recall why or if it was just something that happened every now and then.  I am almost positive our kitchen sink had a separate drain...rather than draining into our septic tank.  It drained out and went out under the porch and on down to a ditch.  It was buried, of course, but there was an access outside, out far enough not to be under the kitchen porch.  And when mom threw water out the back, it would be by that access...Well, right around that area, we could usually dig and find worms because of the dampness.  And another favorite place to look was under anything that had been laying in contact with the ground for a while.  We had clay ground, so it did not dry up quick, and usually if we could find a chunk of wood or board laying like that, we could find a few worms under it.We would find as many as we could in a short amount of time, and then go fishing.  Usually to this little tiny pond...Those days were such fun...we never caught anything big enough to eat...we didn't care.  It was fun way to spend a summer afternoon...and fishing just sounds like so much fun right now.  I guess in this bitter cold weather, even mowing the yard has some appeal value."},

The redbone has a homemade collar on, and scratched on it is the name Buddie.  He feeds Buddie and when night comes, Buddy becomes restless, so Billy lets him out the back gate to continue on his journey.My question is, wonder what happened to Buddy?  Did Wilson Rawls ever write Buddie's story?  I think it would have been every bit as good as the story of Old Dan and Little Ann.************And has anyone read The Last of the Breed by Louis L'Amour?  Everyone always thinks he wrote only westerns, and maybe most were but this one isn't.  And it is one I have always thought he planned to write a follow up book.

And it is another Juki that I want...but have been looking at some of the cheaper  Brother sewing machines.  I have been debating on getting a little sewing cabinet and bringing one of mine upstairs from the basement.  I know though that I would end up running up and down the steps half a dozen times every time I wanted to sit and sew.   Plus there would be the mess upstairs...so I never quite take the plunge to bring it up. *************I think it is supposed to get up to the freezing mark in the next day or two...and we are supposed to have snow tonight and tomorrow.  If it gets up that warm, and it does actually snow, I am wondering if it will be a heavy snow that lays on branches and sticks to fences...I hope it is.  For the first time I am really showing my age about snow...I really consider the fact that we might get in a wreck when going out for pics.  Even on the back roads.  I have never been a fan of being on main roads right after a snow, but on the back roads where there is hardly any traffic, I have always felt pretty secure.  So we shall see whether we get out even if we do get a nice snow."},
{"title": "Daughter's new Etsy shop...", "date": "Wednesday, December 11, 2013", "text": "Sarah, Lorelei's mom, has started BowTodayBowTomorrow....her new Etsy shop.What little girl wouldn't like some of these!  If you have a little girl in your life, check her shop out.  This is our Bubbie.  Some of you may not remember, but at the end of 2008, he ended up with a broken leg....he had to have a pin put in. It was left in for a period of time, then taken out.  I don't remember for how long.  The vet thought he had been hit by a car. That was his first close call.  The next one was probably within a year.  We don't know for sure what happened to him.  It was summer, I noticed he wanted inside so opened the door for him.  He came flying in, went in out bedroom and laid down and did not move for 24-36 hours...didn't get up to eat, to drink, or to go to the potty.He had no sign of anything on him...no blood, not roughed up fur.  Nothing.  He finally got up and drank a little, moved to another room and laid for several more hours.  Gradually came back to himself.  When he finally wanted back outside, he slunk out looking up and over his shoulder...like he expected something to grab him.  We wondered if a hawk had caught him....or almost caught him.  Though in all honesty, he didn't go much beyond our yard, and I have never seen a big hawk here.  But had seen a big owl.Anyway, I consider that Close Call #2.We got our Rav 4 near the end of 2007....we started out parking it on one side of the garage.  Roger has a shelf on the wall that is up out of the way...he puts some of his better boards there. It was on the passenger side. Can you guess what is coming?Roger was out working in his shop and had all the doors open.  Bubbie was in there messing around...he and Puss Puss have a habit on jumping on whatever vehicle they choose and getting up in the rafters and then walking over to where they are on top of the shop.  So, he is in the process of exploring. Roger seen it happen...Bubbie went to either jump up or jump down from that pile of boards and he hit them just right till the pile of boards fell, and Bubbie fell with them...and the pile ended up on top of him...only, they didn't really hit him.  Something was there to keep the weight of them from landing on him or he would have been either a dead kitty or hurt kitty.  (They did put a sharp little dent in the door of our Rav4.)  Roger could not believe that Bubbie walked away with not even a scratch.  Close Call#3We come to today...Roger and I were getting ready to go shopping.  I knew I had let Bubbie and Puss Puss out earlier...so I went to the door to let them in--only Puss was at the front door.  So I let her in.  I looked around for Bubbie but he is not in sight.  I went to the back door and he's not there either, so being that he has thick hair and doesn't seem to mind the cold, I thought he could just stay out.  I went out and pull the door closed behind me.Our storm door is hard to shut....the wind has caught it so many times, and we have fixed it a number of times...but it just will not close unless we give it a firm push.  Well, I just came out and put my back to the screen door and give it a push....I had a coke in one hand and my purse in the other is why I was pushing with my back.Anyway, I gave a push and it would not close...pushed again, and I was thinking what in the world is going on now...I thought the wreath had come down and was somehow caught between the doors.  No, it was Bubbie.  He had not made a sound...but he was scared of me!  It had to have hurt.  I unlocked the door, and held the screen open for him to go inside, but he would not risk going in till I went inside....and held the door open from there.  It really is a wonder I didn't hurt him.  So I call that Close Call #4....thought in reality I don't think he could have died from it."},

I use a 9 x 13 pan, and I do the crust layer, and the cream cheese/cool whip/powdered sugar layer.  Then I use aluminum foil and fold it at least half a dozen times till it kind of sturdy.  And I fold the ends in till it spans across the pan.  I then place it down in the cream cheese layer midway....for one end, I make instant chocolate pudding.  The folded foil holds it in that end.Then I make the instant lemon pudding and pour on the other end...then pull the folded foil out.   Then we can have either flavor.  I bet I have made at least 150 of these in my lifetime...maybe more.  Every now and then I make one just because!"},

So sometimes I have them already to paste into blogger, others I have to think of one or two.  Today, I have them all, plus a bonus! 1.  One positive thing about winter for me, it makes it easier for me to stay inside and sew.  When it is nice outside, I like to be out, or at least upstairs where I can see the sunshine.  I keep thinking I need to have a sewing table to set up on the porch so I can sew outside in nicer weather.2.  I have problems remembering things fully.  I remember just enough bits and pieces of things to drive myself crazy trying to remember the whole story.3.  I had a lot of nicknames when I was in grade school.  Two I will not tell.  The rest I loved and was right proud of...Spider, Cricket, Roadrunner, Briar Patch.  Not sure what that says about me that I loved them...but I did.  I suppose it was who gave them to me that made me like them....though I am not really sure who started the thing of calling me Roadrunner.  But it was because I made a made dash out the door, soon as we were dismissed from school of the evening.  4.  Can I say that I am having a real hard time making myself do anything.  Not even things I want to do.  Whether it is things I just want to do or things I need to do, there are so many I have a hard time making a decision what I want to do first.5.  I always either watch something on Netflix or something from YouTube...almost every single night.  In fact, I usually watch till I fall asleep while watching.  If I watch Netflix, it is usually some mystery with British characters...or an episode of All Creatures Great and Small.  If I watch YouTube, it is quilt related videos 90% of the time.Bonus:  Roger still calls Lorelei 'the baby' when talking about her.  I told him the other day, by the time she is 16, she is not going to like being called the baby.  But in reality, knowing her and her love for her Papaw, she probably won't mind it coming from him.Linking to Random 5..."},

Most of you have seen it, but you might enjoy it again.***************Another time, back when money was hard to come by, Roger built his own tree-stand.  It was heavy...and did not fold down, making it hard to carry through the woods.  Then he had to find a tree big enough, yet not too big.  He would place the platform against the tree.  There was two pieces of angle iron that reached back past the tree. One side had another piece of angle iron that was hinged.  He would swing it to the other piece that portruded past the tree and fasten it.  I do not remember how it fastened.Now, he had this webbing, something really strong.  He attached two 'loops' to the platform.  That is the best term I can think of to describe it.  He slid each foot into a loop and  he was ready.  He would reach up as high as he could...I don't recall if he just used his arms/hands or if he had something else that helped grip the tree, he would reach up as high as he could and then lift the tree stand with his feet.  This tipped it enough till the bar across the back did not bite into he tree any more, and he could pull the tree stand up a bit at a time.  Then when he stood on it to reach up again, his weight on the tree stand made the bar across the back bite into the tree and it could not slide down...One time, he came home and told me he had about tore  his arm out of its socket!  I don't remember if it occurred when he was climbing up, or coming down the tree, but the webbing his feet were in....one side pulled loose...or one of his feet came out of the loop..he happened to have hold a tree limb with one hand.  There he was hanging by one arm....all his weight plus the weight of the tree stand.  And the tree stand was heavy.  It  was hanging from the one foot all cockeyed.  I remember he talked about hanging there with one arm and trying to flip the tree stand with the one foot till he could get some kind of hold with his other foot.  I don't remember much else, but remember it was not so funny at the time, but later it is one of the tales that brings much laughter."},

There is nothing quite like music to take me back to my youth.  Been listening off and on all night to music...some of it old stuff from  our youth...Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Poco, Eagles, etc.  Dan Fogelberg's Run For the Roses...can anyone listen to it without crying?  If you have never heard it...you should go listen to it. I find the songs that touch me most brings a tear to my eyes.  5.  Did not do any sewing at all today...did mess some with fabric.  It ended up we had to run an errand or two, and of course, we took a round about way home on one of those.Linking to Random 5  This shot was taken October 22, 2009....And this one was taken today....Isn't digital photography wonderful!  For knowing the date the pics are taken? It has been overcast and the sidewalks and roads have been damp all day long, but I have not seen it actually raining.  It was warm enough to sit on the porch and read a while.  It is usually too cool to eat breakfast outside now....I miss that and miss sitting out there to read.Tomorrow they are saying we may get up to two inches of rain.  At least I have a good excuse to go down and fool with my sewing.  I did a bit of cleaning down there this evening, but only a drop in the bucket. Of all things I found some crumb blocks that I had started the other day--started but not finished-- and I have been fooling with them again.  I really don't want to get into making another quilt of them so not sure what I will do with these few blocks.  I am making the bigger than my usual 6½ inches...though I can see myself cutting them apart to go back together a different way."},

I have got to remember that one...it would probably be fun to do on drives.************It is a beautiful day here, today.  I am hoping to either get something done this coming week...hoping I can get my creative juices flowing.  And also I would not mind taking a day trip somewhere, but not sure where.  I guess a lot will depend on the weather."},
{"title": "Flea Market Cat", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "When we were at the flea market this past weekend, one of the first things we saw was this cat.  We had seen him last year and talked to a lady about him.  This time we talked to a gentleman.  Both told the same tale.  They have been coming and setting up at the flea market for about ten years, and each year when they get set up, here comes this kitty and it stays with them the whole time.It actually belongs to a home just two or three houses away from the flea market.  It comes and makes itself at home, and everyone stops to pet it.  The man said it is fine unless it is three or four little kids and then it gets up and moves.  Last year it was in an actual booth....How about you...do you like to see a cat or dog in a place of business?  I really think most people prefer it.  We had a dog at work that was the official greeter.  There was one woman from here in town that would complain about him...but she complained about simple stuff.  She had had heartache in her life, and I am sure that played a part in her attitude.Even though I was out picking apples, pruning, or some other type of work most of the time, I don't know how many times I would walk up to the house for lunch or for something else...I would see people stop, and one would get out to run inside and pick up something.  You could tell by the other's posture that they were planning on staying in the car.  But they would see the old dog, and either get out to go pet him, or else open the door and call him over.I think they are an ambassador of good will...be it cat or dog."},

And if I haven't started on a new one, something is wrong. Right now I am reading A Week In Winter by Maeve Binchy.  I am really enjoying it...I know I have read 3 or 4 others by her, but have no idea why I haven't read them all.Linking to A Rural Journal's Random 5.... Looking at the photos I have of old barns taken while we were in Tennessee, couple with the thought of every time Neal and I talk, we talk about things we ate as kids...and talk about what we wish we had now.  So thought I would give a partial list of some of my favorite foods I ate as a kid.Bacon and biscuits, biscuits and gravy, CocoaFried taters, fried green tomatoes,Soup beans and cornbreadFried chicken, chicken gravy,and mashed potatoes...Blackberry cobbler, fried apple pies,Stack cakes...What more could a person ask for...Fresh tenderloin, breaded and fried, with a hot biscuit,Biscuits and homemade jellyPotato soup, mustard greens, bacon and cornbread,Chicken-n-dumplings...Green beans and fried okra...Corn on the cob, or corn cut off the cob...anyway that is fresh from the garden...These  are just a few of my favorite memories, with most of them being things I  loved to eat....the exception being stack cakes.  I could eat it, but I  didn't love it, though I did love the dough, raw, as my mom made the  cakes.Of all the things listed, I would most dearly love to have my mom's chicken and dumplings and some of her bisuits.Edited to add...Blogger won't let me space this as I would like...this is my third try of trying to edit it.  If it does not 'take' this time, I will leave it however blogger does it."},

He also opened up a bee hive and pulled out one of the frames to show us the honey on it...I don't remember how close we were to it, but he did not put on any protective clothing that I can remember.  And he wasn't getting the honey...he was just showing it to us.Well those are my memories for today...they are vague but I think of that place fairly often.  I always wonder just how accurate I am remembering it.  I also wonder what else I did while I was there.  I remember it is being nestled in close to the side of the hill/mountain.  Woods were all around.  And seems like we looked out over a little overgrown bottom to the building where he build his beehives.  And I cannot remember the beehives....just remember him pulling a frame out of one and the bees buzzing around him, but not really mad.And one last thought--when was the last time you warned a child to watch out for snakes?"},

Even though I took a few things to the family reunion, I still have a little pile of stuff to give her.  we are always seeing little things we think she would like. Any time we think of her and talk about her, we are always laughing.  Her mom got to volunteer at her preschool a few weeks ago.  Now, keep in mind on her very first day of school, she asked her mom if the teachers would like hugs.  Sarah told her she was sure they probably would.So she absolutely loves preschool.  And her teacher told Sarah she is all about following the rules.  Mrs. W told Sarah it was so cute...she would see Lorelei raise her hand and have such a serious little face.  When Mrs. W asks Lo what she needs..Lo tells her she could sure use a hug!It is things like this keeps a smile on our face...even through rough times.2.  It has been a hard, hard month....I hope next month is better.3.  Even with the hard things, there has been joy, too.4. I had a decluttering day the other day....I told my husband it pays to declutter.  I was working in my kitchen and found $40!  I first found $20 up in with my cookbooks, Then there was another $20 bill I found.  I was cleaning off my fluorescent light.  It is mounted on the wall...it is a convenient place to set little things that I want to sit out of the way. It was weird, I had ran my dishrag over it and looked down, and there was that $20 and I had not even realized I had picked anything up other than a bit of dust.  And I think I had laid that $20 there a long time ago for something...thinking I would need to grab it to pay something but now I haven't a clue.  So not only did I come out free of some things that were cluttering up my cabinets, I came out $40 richer.5.  It is past midnight now....I really hope I can remember to link to Random Five when it opens...how's that for my last random thought?  Right now, I think I will go mop my kitchen and clean my bath till I don't have to do it in the morn.."},

It will be alright if you don't say this is pretty...I don't even think it is pretty.  But it is interesting...and it is fun to look and figure out how it all came together.  And the quilting is  nothing to brag about either.  I did loose quilting....oh, closer than the 10 inches apart that warm and white requires...but still really sparse to what I do normally.****************I made a big, big pot of vegetable soup yesterday...I make such a pig of myself when I make it.  I grab a bowl of it every time I pass through the kitchen.  I divided what was left into two containers.  I will freeze one, and the other we will have in a couple days.   That will mean I don't have to cook one time, only reheat.******************I have slept in the past two mornings and feel like I have wasted half my day.  I am just a person that needs to get up and get going.  How about you?  I really feel better all the way around if I am up and going by 6:30-7:30.  I know others get up earlier than that, but that is a good time frame for me.But I have been watching you tube videos at night after Roger goes to bed...Friday night I was up till after 3:00 a.m. watching sewing videos.  And had to make myself go to bed then...then last night it was quilting videos....Speaking of quilting, I think I am heading down in the basement with my latest.  I might even start with the binding."},

I think we would get maybe a couple or three per hill if we were lucky.  We never just dug up the whole plant....we left the smaller ones to grow. We would do a few hills of potatoes this way...enough to get a mess of potatoes.  And at each plant, we always pushed the dirt back over the remaining potatoes that were developing.  And it never seemed to really harm the plant to the best of my recall.For those of you who have never done this, the skin on young potatoes is paper thin...we would run water over them and then just scrap the skin away with a knife.  Then if they were just over an inch in diameter, mom left them whole, but if they were getting up close to two inches or so...she would cut them in half...and put them on the stove in a pot of water to cook that way a little while.Then she would take them out and fry them....leaving them whole or halved.  Talk about good food!  Oh, my mouth is watering now just thinking about it."},

I may not get there often, but you can bet I will be going back when I have the chance.  I have always thought Lori's Pins & Needles was the best quilt shop I had ever been in...but now I have found her equal.  They both have such a wide variety of fabrics....I think anyone could find fabric they like/need.  That is one of the important things about a quilt shop for me...I have been in a couple that  seems to only have subdued or dark colors; and I have been in one or two that seemed to mostly have bright, bold fabric.  I could go on and on about it, but it would probably bore people to tears that don't quilt.I might add that Roger found thread for sewing leather there!  He needs that when he makes a sheath for a knife.  So it was a good visit for us both.***********As Sarah was putting Lorelei to bed last night...she was saying she really wanted Papaw and me to come visit...she told Sarah if we came down 'maybe Mamaw will cook some food for me....Mamaw sure can cook!'  I could not help but wonder what she was thinking of when she said that...I have about 4 or 5 or 6 different things I fix that I know she will eat...but I would almost bet it was my biscuits and gravy that she was thinking about.  LOL*************It was late in the day yesterday when I realized I had not given the full recipe for the chuck roast...I should have realized sooner but I didn't.  In addition to the chuck roast, crushed red peppers, garlic powder and Italian seasonings, I add one 15/16 ounce can of tomato sauce and then the can about half or two thirds full of water.I think I have told about this before...my friend was telling me about making it...and the tomato sauce just did not sound good to me.  So I told her the next time she made it, I wanted to taste of it.  It is her own made up recipe....and I have been hooked on it ever since."},

It is a recipe a friend made up.   Nothing set in granite as far as amounts.  We take a chuck roast....I have made it with other cuts but love a nice chuck roast the best.  I cut it into chunks that go easily into the crock pot.Then, add garlic powder to taste, about a teaspoon of crushed red peppers, and Italian seasonings...add what you think you will like.  With me that is probably about half a teaspoon...maybe a little more.  I usually put this on around midnight on Lo Heat and it cooks at least 12 hours....till it just falls apart with a fork.  After it is done, I shred it and we always have Italian bread, or sometimes Roger likes it over a baked potato.We all love this....though I have had one person tell me they tried it and did not like it.  But I just felt they had to do something wrong....LOL***********Roger's computer gave up the ghost last week....I think the hard drive is shot so we have a new laptop coming for him.  The old computer is not that old....still may get a hard drive and see if we can get it to going again.  Just have a lot of questions about doing it. And I sat down and finally got some battings ordered.  Now I have got to get busy and make backings.  I would like to get some of these quilt tops made into finished quilts.  Not that I will ever catch up.  I have at least a dozen tops that I am not even worrying about."},

What fun. And off down to that road by the railroad.  And I might add a dirty old road.  They would come home with black splashes up their backs....dirty from head to toe.  But what fun that was. What is more, they would probably both be willing to do that today!  There is nothing like playing in the rain."},

{"title": "A repeat....", "date": "Sunday, August 4, 2013", "text": "Most of you know I love barns.  Maybe it is because I spent so many happy hours in the barn when I was a child.  It was one of my favorite places to play...going to the barn to milk the cow, feed the pigs, and feed the cows in general was never a chore for me.  And even though that has been over 30 years ago, the smell of cow or horse barn is a pleasant smell to me that takes me instantly back to my childhood.We were dirt poor in so many ways.  We raised almost all the food we ate...we raised and butchered four hogs every year, we almost always had a cow or two that we milked, and raised all our vegetables.  And we picked wild blackberries, as well as there was a couple old apple trees that my mom gathered apples from to make jelly with.  To this day my favorite job on earth is to pick blackberries.  Why I don't know...as a kid I always ended up with bunches of chiggers...if you have never had them you haven't missed anything other than misery!My mom filled every jar she had and also had a deep freezer that was always stuffed to the brim with food we raised.  And there would be guys bring truckloads of peaches up from Georgia and drive along the roads and stop and ask if you wanted to buy peaches...my mom always bought a couple bushels and we would freeze and can them.  It is so refreshing to come in from hoeing the garden and to have peaches that are just beginning to thaw--that are still in that crystallized state.  I am getting hungry just thinking about them.We had cornbread almost every day of our life, and my mom made biscuits every morning too...there were a few times when she got bronchitis that she didn't get up and make biscuits but I bet that was not five times a year.  And her biscuits were unlike anybody's I have ever seen.  But oh, so yummy good!  When grand kids were home, I have seen them have her make them a pan of biscuits after breakfast and they would eat every one of them.She didn't measure anything, just mixed them up by feel.  And she didn't roll them out and cut with a cookie cutter, she just pinched off a little bit of the dough, and worked it between her hands, and placed in the pan.  And every one was the same size!  I do not know how to explain what they were like...but I would give anything to have a pan of them  right now!Another thing I never hear of any where up here is shucked beans...or do not even hear them called dried beans.  We always took green beans and snapped the ends off them, and if need be we took the 'strings' off--I wonder if anyone that is reading this knows what I mean?  Anyway, then we would have just use regular string/or crocheting thread and a big needle and would run the beans on the strings and hang them to dry.  And everyone called them shucked beans down there...they had a sort of strong flavor, but I really liked them.  I think I have a picture somewhere of some...I will hunt for it after while and scan it in...Enough reminiscing for now...************This is a repeat post.  From December, 2007, thought I did substitute a photo.  I hope you don't mind and maybe even find a little enjoyment in reading it."},

I never give a quilt away without washing it first.  I used to have a fear one would fall apart, then I realized that was crazy cause I use good construction methods when I sew.  But the other thing, I want to wash them first time and throw in a Shout Color Catcher in case anything bleeds.  Some quilters always wash their fabric first thing...before making anything.  But I prefer not to...I like working with new fabric.  I also like the way the shrinkage makes the quilt look after it is washed.*************It is raining off and on this morn...so far nothing really hard.  Last night it just poured for a while--it was actually wonderful to here.  I think we have made up for last summer and am just hoping we don't have another like it.I just realized yesterday that I had not mentioned having breakfast on the front porch...we have actually eaten out there a time or two already.  It is just wonderful to be able to sit out there.  And we sat out there with Lorelei last weekend.  Of course she never just sits, but that is fine.  She never just sits...always doing something.Well, we are headed to Paris in a few minutes....Paris, Illinois that is.  So going to post this and be done with it."},

When I looked out, it had turned itself inside out and the only thing holding it on the line was the clothespins--in other words it was no longer draped OVER the clothesline.

(The yellow was not part of my dress...just the dark fabric.)And there is fabric from some of her dresses...I really loved this quilt from the minute she made it.  Just because of the memories associated with the fabric if nothing else.I have always planned for our girls to have them.  I wash them every so often then put them up.  They have never really been used.  I am planning on taking the star one to Sarah this weekend.  And one of these days will be mailing the bottom one to our other daughter."},

I remember the box ripping apart.  It had toys and clothes--I can remember most of what I got, and it was wonderful.  But to just to have Fran home was joy beyond measure.  A ham was fixed for Christmas, and it is the first time I ever remember having ham.  I could not stop eating it....every time I could I would sneak in the fridge and get a piece of it.   My mom kept telling me I was going to be sick from eating too much. Oh, my, how I loved it.  That night I paid the piper though.  I started throwing up and don't remember how many times or how long it took to stop...Fran got up and took care of me.  It was almost worth it just to have her caring for me.  I can remember her telling mom to go on back to bed, that she would stay with me.  She would wring a wash rag out and wash my face with such loving care.Don't get me wrong, we all loved each other, but Fran is sort of the special one...I think special memories are attached to her by all of us.She would do anything on a dare, and not afraid of anyone or anything.  I can remember when she was in high school, her and the algebra teacher got in a big, big argument.  She was sure she was right, and he  just assumed the book was right.  I think he even came to our house talking to her...not sure how right all my memories are because I was maybe not even in school then.Anyway, I think they argued back and forth for a day or two or three, each working and reworking the problem.  He finally had to agree that Fran was right.  Anyway, that is just a sample of what she is/was made of.Back to that Christmas, she brought the game of Tripoly home...I was too young to actually play...so I just sat by her side.  I don't remember how the game is played, but a free hand is dealt.  Well, she  would look at her hand and whisper to me to see if there was this or that card in the free hand...and if there was, I would sneak it to her.  I would have did anything in the world for her.  Of course either her husband or one of my brothers caught her and put a stop to it.  But she was having fun just sneaking and getting by with it.All my sisters and my brother always came home, at least once a year after they moved away, and I always hated seeing any of them leave.  It was just always worse when Fran left..."},

It wanted to be petted but was afraid at the same time.  It would jut meow when I would talk to it.  I finally gave up.  While I was messing with it, Roger caught a couple stripers... so I quit and returned to fishing.  It was just cold enough, or maybe it was that I was not dressed warm enough, till I decided to quit soon and went back to look for the kitty again.I could not see it anywhere, so returned to the car.  I sat there watching for it, and watching Roger fish...he decided to quit.  As he was putting his reel in behind me, I was trying to look back at him...and as I was doing that he saw the kitty cross the road again.  So off we go...we tried to sneak up to it, but it went back across the road.  Roger stayed back and I followed...her meowing and answering everything I said to her.Finally, she let me pet her...oh, she just absolutely loved to be touched.  But she did not want to be held.I picked her up twice...at least I think 'her' is the correct term.  Anyway, she would have none of it.  Oh, she didn't go wild or anything...just squirmed so much I didn't want to frighter her farther and let her go.You can see a better pic of her over on my Time Stand Still blog.  If she had been willing to be held, I might have been the owner of a new kitty.   Her face is so much like my last Cougar's...and her little meow will haunt me for a while.  If I lived close, she would at least have food.  But I need another cat about like I need another hole in my head.  But if she were close, I would probably have her.  I just cannot resist a face like that.  And it is not just the markings and colorings...it is the look in the eyes.BTW, those last photos were taken by my husband, not by me.  I forgot to change the watermark on them."},

(By the way,  both photos need to be clicked on to enjoy more.)  Anyway, they are gorgeous.   Then Sarah had us over Saturday and cooked dinner for us...she fixed this yummy dish called Melt in Your Mouth Chicken...and it did.  I am pretty sure this is the recipe she used...only she used chicken thighs.  Plus she got me a puzzle...and a big sack of sunflower seeds.And I got to see Tootie.  You would never guess she had been sick if you could see the sparkle in her eyes.  She is still coughing but it does not slow her down.  Sarah said she had to wear this pink dress for us.  As usual, it is fun to wake up over there to her smiling face looking into mine.  I will wake up and there she is right at my side, sometimes her elbows resting on the bed, and she will say 'Mamaw, its time to get up now!'"},

It is based on these memoirs of Jennifer Worth who left a comfortable home to become a nurse and midwife right after WWII...she moved into a convent to work with nuns and other nurses who were already doing the work.There is a housing shortage at that time and people live in ways UN-imagineable to us today. Just so crowded...and such squalor.  ***************In my opinion, PBS has some of the best shows on television...we have been hooked on it forever.  One that was a favorite with both of us is Foyle's War.  We are now re=watching the episodes through Netflix.I was going to try to list more of what we have watched and/or rewatch...and the list is endless.  We almost always watch Masterpiece Theater or Masterpiece Mystery....we are very seldom disappointed with those shows.  Let alone shows like Red Green...for fun, or The Joy of Painting, Quilting Arts, or Fons and Porter for instruction.I just wondered, are there shows you always watch...and what are they?"},

He leaves.  He comes back in a minute...the truck would not start.  Dead battery.  So he puts the charger on it and kills a bit of time.  Goes back out and it wouldn't start, but he ran the cables from the Rav to it and it started fine.Goes for a drive before heading to get the filter.  He gets the filter and comes back out...the battery is dead.  He tells me to go next door to get a neighbor to come give him a jump...and I hate to...and think of my girlfriend...we hang up and I do head over to the neighbor but he is not home.  Another neighbor would have gone, but he has a condition with his eyes where he is not supposed to drive...so I end up calling my girlfriend for her to go.Well, Roger makes it home..he had decided to just get a new battery...but Walmart didn't have one so it was a good thing my friend went...she took him to an auto parts store to buy one.I know I am leaving out something...maybe even more than one, but this is enough to share at the moment anyway.  I am just glad the day is done and I can mess around a while.We took a scenic route today coming home from meeting Lorelei's dad...oh, so much beauty.I did not do a good job of capturing the beauty, but I gave it a try.I will probably be doing several posts from this day alone...but can't wait to get out for more photos.It was just glorious to see."},

I was searching to find the album it was on, searched you tube...just anything.  I had all but given up, but every so often I would look for it again.Just a few minutes ago, thought I would try it again just for fun...did not find a digital version to buy but did find it on You Tube!!!! I still love it...after all these years.  I don't expect anyone else to love it...but let me tell you I was ecstatic to discover it there waiting for me."},

But the time it is thrown away, it will have provided hours and hours of entertainment.When our girls were little, we would go to the appliance store downtown and get them a box every so often.  They had more fun with them than about anything you could buy.  I am not sure  if all appliances have given up the cardboard boxes, but the last two or three appliances we have bought have come wrapped in plastic...*****************We got up to a definite chill in the air yesterday and today.  Today has gotten a bit warmer than yesterday.  I could at least be outside with just a long sleeved shirt...yesterday if I was going to be out for any length of time, I had to have on a jacket.I definitely feel winter closing in....I do know fall hasn't even officially begun.

I would get a little done then either not be able to work on it, or not be in the mood to work on it.  But at long last the top is finished....but I still have to decide what to use for the backing and get it made.It seems that no matter what I wanted to do to finish it...I would be lacking. I used the same fabric for the center of each block....And I used it for the inner border...and I wanted enough to use for the binding when done.  So ran over to Lori's Pins & Needles to get more.  They didn't have it, though I am just about positive that is where I got it.  So finally decided on a different fabric for the binding.I had decided to do one style of border but when I auditioned it, it didn't look right...but did like the look of a wide border around it from a single fabric.  The fabric I chose...I thought I had plenty of it for 6 1/2 inch strips...I needed 5 to go all the way around the quilt.  I didn't measure to see how much fabric I actually had...did not have enough for the fifth strip.  I did not want cornerstones, and actually could find the fabric on line.  But didn't want to wait for it to get here so took the last bit of fabric that was left...it was probably 4 or 5 inches wide...cut the lenght in half and sewed it to gether and got a 6.5 inch wide strip that was pieced together...21 and 1/8 inch long...I measured very carefully and it in half...then added each to the last two strips of fabric...And I first pinned them....I knew it was going to be close as to whether I had enough or not even then...but guess what?  The first one I pinned on fit exactly.  And so did the second.  Now sometimes I first measure and then cut the strips, but others I just sew them on and cut off the extra length.  I have not had problems doing it either way.Anyway, the top is done, now to decide on what material to use for the back...that may take some time."},

But at least they didn't fly completely away.I tried and tried to capture a Monarch with the wings open but just could not be quick enough to get one when they moved from one place to another.Even the Buckeyes flitted away almost every time I got near.Still, aren't they gorgeous!"},

Look back at this post.....that hill is the same hill in the background, just a hundred yards or so on north.The other side of the road is this weedy field...I happened to glance over and this is what I saw.Can you believe the rack on that thing...he was quite a ways away.  I had my lens out to 300mm...so I am thinking he was at least a 150 yards away...maybe more.  I am not a judge of distance.Here I cropped one of the photos till you can see the mass of the antlers.  That is one big boy!***************We messed around yesterday...we ended up driving through the strip pits and coming home.  Then later in the evening, we headed to Mansfield...to try fishing.

I caught two....but that was it.  Water is so low there.**************We have had a little rain this morn...everything looks fresh and green.  I am not sure what we are doing today.  Maybe nothing.

This after a night of crying out in her sleep and getting me up and she cried and cried and was mad at me.....then got up yesterday morn all giggles and smiles.  Just happy to be alive.  We think she has dreams/nightmares, but not sure.  She had did the same thing when her mom and dad were here and was screaming that she wanted her rocket.  She made no mention of a rocket the first night with me...Anyway, like I say she got up in a totally refreshed mood...we ended up taking her to the park for a couple hours.  I think it is the first time to ever have it completely to ourselves for any lenght of time. Then that afternoon, she was watching Tom & Jerry on the computer and playing with crayons.  I had given her paper to draw on.   I came back in and caught that she had been writing on the back of the chair with the crayons.  I told her not to be writing on Mamaw's things.  I can't remember exactly how it went...she said something like \"I'm not...it's my chair!  See it says so right here--Lorelei Rose T-----!\" and pretended to write on it.  And her eyes just gleamed.  I didn't crack up then, but I did later.  She is too smart for words."},

But just have to tell you that that is and always has been one of Lorelei's favorite things.  I cannot even think of all the ways she uses it. She gets under it and crawls around calling herself a turtle or a snail....or she hides under it.   We always used to pretend we couldn't find her. Or else she gets in it and wants a quilt or fleece blanket thrown over it to completely cover it and her.  Sometimes she takes a stuffed animal or doll with her and that is part of her make believe..other times she wants us to find her.Still others, she puts pillow in the bottom and gets in, stretches her legs out, and takes a fleece blanket and snuggles back to watch TV.  (It is one of the rectangle ones.)  Or she will turn it upside down and sit her dollhouse on it.Oh, and sometimes I turn it upside down and have her sit on it in front of me while I comb her hair.  Who would ever have dreamed a child would get so much fun out of something so ordinary.  It is due to her vivid imagination...you can just look at her sometimes and see the wheels turning.I just wondered if anyone else's grandchildren have something like this that they play with constantly that is not a toy."},

She wants to sew but does not have the control to press the foot peddle to sew slow, and it scares her when it sews so fast.  (I have control of the fabric when she is pressing on the foot peddle.)

Sarah and I were laughing so hard we could not catch our breath...and during the time of it, she dropped the phone and asked, \"did that hurt, Mamaw?\"  Oh, I think I will have to spend a month remembering all she said.*************I had been laughing off and on all day remembering when she was here, she had not had her hair combed....I think it was after her bath, but it might have been of the morn.  She has long hair that gets tangled...and dreads getting it combed.  Well, she was just ignoring and ignoring me when I told her to come sit down and let me comb it.So I walk over and pick her up and swat her bottom twice and tell her to come to me when I tell her...and I go sit down and tell her to come on.  She comes over to me, and  places her fingers on either side of my face and tells me, \"Mamaw, you are not supposed to spank me.\"  I told her then she is supposed to listen to me....but oh, how I wanted to laugh.I think it finally sunk in, that if she will come and be still and not jerk, that I can get her hair combed without it hurting.Needless to say, a visit is in order...how can you resist a voice like that.This is a scene from our drive Sunday...I so love rural scenes like this.  Do you notice the cow paths on the left side...don't you just love how cows will only take the direct route if it is easy. Sometimes I think we could take a lesson from animals.  If a cow has to climb to the top of the hill, she rambles around and around, gradually getting to the top....eating along the way.  Sort of what we call stopping to smell the roses. Of course if everyone behaved that way, we might not be sitting in our chairs at home conversing with people all over the world...may not even have been here had someone not cared enough to work against the odds to find medicines to cure and immunizations to prevent untimely deaths.Still, I like to think that there is a time to enjoy the journey.**********************We had rain, glorious rain off and on all day.  The weatherman said some in our area had as high as 2.82 inches.  This time I don't doubt it being us.  It was wonderful to hear the thunder and to see a bit of lightning, and to see big, huge mud puddles...and to feel it blowing in on the porches."},

I sure notice the days getting shorter.  My tomatoes are really slowing down.  I made 4 quarts and 1 pint of juice on Monday...I think that brings me to a total of 16 quarts and 2 pints from our 20+ plants. I am not going to have any bell peppers to freeze...don't get me wrong, there were peppers but with all the heat they would shrivel up while on the plant when they got up about 2 inches in diameter...maybe even before that.  We did use a few even though they were not what would normally consider grown.We have been having cool nights...last night when I went to bed Puss Puss was under the cover in my place and did not want to move.  She had left just barely enough room till I could lay down--but I am sure that was by accident.I am again attempting to get rid of some of the clutter here.  I worked on that his afternoon and did get rid of some stuff.  I saw other things I want to take to the auction house.  We have a couple big items we are taking soon as the weather starts being cooler all the time.  I think it will sell better then.So we shall see how this progresses...every time I think I am going to get to make a good start, something happens."},

We came to Big Pine Creek....and stopped two or three times to throw in our lines...but always from up on a bank.  Just couldn't find a good place to get down to the water.  I got two or three hits at one place...and Roger caught a small Small-mouthed bass there....Then we came to the place above...we stopped there.  We could see fish just laying everywhere out in the water...not sure what kind they were...but definitely NOT carp....I threw and threw and threw my line and got one hit from a fairly big fish.... I could see him.  And Roger had two or three hits.The first thing I noticed when we stopped and got out to look was this  old  rod & reel laying there...Roger told me to check it, but I was  too busy.  Then I saw the line move...but still just left it.  Well,  before we left, Roger reels it in....it had a nice sized catfish on it.   Since Roger could not get down to the water to wet his hands, he didn't  want to touch it.  Thinks it is unhealthy for the fish...he used my  needle nose pliers to release him and throw him back in the water.  We  left the rod, thinking some kid will remember it and come back to find  it."},
{"title": "Notes on Lorelei's visit", "date": "Monday, August 13, 2012", "text": "We had Lorelei for three nights....I don't know where to begin the Lorelei Tales. First, she is so anxious to get here...we meet her mom at a half-way point and pick Lorelei up there.  That way it is not a hard drive on either of us.  It is still a 40 mile trip home.  All the way home, in between her songs and comments, she asks every little bit if we are to our neighborhood.  Her mom had forgotten to pack her swimsuit and I said something to Roger about us stopping and seeing if Super Walmart had any left.  No, Mamaw, I just want to go to your house...so we just came on home.  (I let her wear a pair of her undies and a t-shirt to get in her wading pool.)The first thing she does when she get out of the car is run over to see the flowerbed, and exclaiming about how pretty everything is and telling us to look at this and that.  And she wants to know if she can have a flower, so I tell her yes, but to let Papaw cut it.  So that is done, and we put it in water, and at first she takes it everywhere she goes...The first night she was here, I found this video on Netflix that contained Rudolph, the Red-nosed Reindeer.  She wanted to watch it....it is a ritual to watch a movie/cartoon before she goes to bed.  So we sit and watch it...besides the Rudolph cartoon, there are several other Christmas ones, with the last one being a combination of animation with real people reciting Twas the Night Before Christmas....At the end Santa comes down the chimney...well, that starts her worrying about Santa coming here.  I told her not to worry, he will come to her house and she has a fireplace.  But no, she wants him to come to our house...she was so concerned about it.  As we were headed to brush her teeth and to go to bed...she told Papaw 'After we go to bed, you follow the lines and cut a hole for Santa...and make it level.'  By lines we think she was thinking about the mortar between bricks...and as she said the word level she made a motion with her hand to explain what she meant. I know I am forgetting things, but the one thing we have laughed about so much besides the hole for Santa, is Friday night I was in my chair and she was sitting on the arm, snacking with me.  Her Papaw had been busy, and came in and sat down in his chair.  She says something along the lines of 'Papaw, while you are resting, scratch my toes.\"  He told her no, scratch your own toes.  She stretched out her foot towards him and said, \"But Papaw, they're right there!\"  (Have you noticed she keeps him pretty busy?)Also, while she is here, I don't know if we had to let the cats in or out a single time, except while she is sleeping.  She opens the doors for them the minute she sees one wanting in or out. These are some of the highlights.  The time with her is precious...she still didn't want to go home...then on the way to meet Sarah, she told me over and over she wanted us to take her to her house, 'And Just Stay.'  I always dread leaving her...but the minute she sees her mommy she is fine with it.  And she be thrilled to see her dad when she gets home...**************We keep getting a little bit more rain...not any big amount but every little bit helps.  And it has cooled down a lot.  In the 80's at the hottest part of the day.  I suppose it will warm back up more than than that before the summer is over, but hopefully the 100 degree days are done."},

They were pretty.Then I just held the camera up, on autofocus and aimed towards her seat, or what I was hoping was her seat.  The above shot is the first shot...I just love it.  You might have to click it to see the gleam in her eye...She sang a big lot of the way home...the ABC song, Itsy, Bitsy spider, even made up  a version of the Mamaw Spider going up the water spout,  and and I love Mamaw With All My Heart little tune.Needless to say I will be pretty well occupied for two or three days.*************We actually had thunder and lightning about 3:00 a.m. and a little bit of rain.  There is actually a mud puddle across the street!  First time I have seen one of those things here in a long, long time.  I don't think we got a lot, I couldn't stay awake to listen, but at least we got some.This is another implement from Patton's Corner...Roger thinks it might have been a plow for digging potatoes and when I google the term for pictures, I think he just might be right.Still hot here, but not the 100 degrees....and supposed to fall down til the highs are in the low 80's by this weekend.  There is a chance for rain starting on Thursday night.  At least that is what they are saying right now.I got almost 4 quarts of tomato juice today...a complete surprise to get that much...but happy to have it."},

He stayed there the whole time we were there which was probably 45 minutes or so.********************We have been out and gone most of the day...running some errands and to Best Buy...and we stopped and ate.  It has just been one of those days where I did not accomplish a single thing.  At least in the work department.I have been reading a book called The Worst Hard Time by Timothy Egan.  It is about the Dust Bowl, concentrating on the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle area. This happened during the Great Depression, for those of you who aren't familiar with it.  I have enjoyed reading it...have wondered how I would have handled the living situation then.It was horrible living conditions.  No one could get away from the dust.  Even though people tried to cover up any little opening...dust found its way inside their homes.  Inside their bodies even.  So many people died with dust pneumonia.    Babies as well as adults. In that area, tons and tons and tons of top soil was blown away.  Some of it even made it to the east coast and even on out into the Atlantic Ocean.  If you want to see probably the worst dust storm of it all, click Black Sunday.  That is a page of images I got by googling Black Sunday dust bowl, and then clicking on images.As I read it I came across the name Arthur Rothstein....a photographer.  I first googled his name and then clicked images...which showed enough till I knew I wanted to find a collection of them.  And HERE is where I ended up at...have wasted a lot of time today just looking at the photos there and still not through them.Anyway, if you like B&W photography and old photos, it is a good place to go...it has more than just the Rothstein collection...but that was what I spent my spare minutes on."},

I trimmed it even more and it is sitting on the back of my sink...and it continues to open up. One thing, the package pictured them as deep, dark purple.  Imagine my surprise to get this color that is more pink than anything.  If all goes well, they will be a nice surprise for Lorelei later in the week.We got a sprinkle of rain this morn...not enough to really help.  Maybe one of these days it will hit here good.We went for a drive to the north of here...didn't see a lot of anything.  A marshy place that we drive through was totally dried up.  Not a drop of water anywhere.    It had apparently really stormed/the wind blew up north of there....it was around the Perrysville, Indiana area.  There were small limbs and twigs down everywhere...and we saw some bigger trees that had been uprooted, as well as some good sized limbs that had fallen."},

A long break.  But then I will end up looking up something on my blog, or know it is there if I take the time to look.  Or, we will click on the label Lorelei Rose, and I realize it is worth so much.  We can go back through some of her photos and the little videos and just have a blast listening and seeing how she has changed.Same with photographs.  I will be looking for a particular photograph...and in looking for it, I stir up so many other memories.  There are the pictures of the kids...not so many of those are on my computer...but I have, or rather had albums filled with their photos...Sarah took some of them home with her.  And that is okay.  At least they are cherished.I always want to photograph things to leave a record of our time.  Of how things are now.  For future generations.  And always I regret not having photographs of how things used to be...so guess I will continue to blog.**************Roger had patches put on this week....they were put on on Monday, and he could not get his back wet for 5 days.  The doctor took them off Wednesday, and we went back Friday for a final reading.  If you could call it that.  He had no reaction to anything.  So, right now it is just something he is going to have to live with.  The breaking out has not gotten real bad in a while...he will just have patches break out here and there, but not the whole body thing.  So that is one thing that has been going on this week.*************I made little batches of juice twice this week...today I had 3 quarts and 1 pint.  The other day I had 2 quarts and 1 pint.  Not much, but at least it is some.  Last week I got 3 quarts.  Every little bit helps.*************We were going to get Lorelei this weekend, but will get her later in the week if all goes well."},

I tell you, when we first turn the water on after the hose has been laying in the sun, we have to just let the water run out on the ground.  It is too hot to hold our hand in, so am sure it would not be good to put on the plants.We are watching a few of the Olympics...just bits here and there.  I am not sure if I have a favorite part...if I do it is either the parallel bars or the uneven parallel bars.  And would have loved to try pole vaulting as a kid.

I get them on both of mine, and just checked and do on some of the others.  Since I haven't had time to really do any blogging today, not sure if it holds true with all blogs.  But each Blogger blog I just clicked on, I received the warning:We tested this page and blocked content that came from potentially or suspicious sites...blah, blah, blah.I do know one blog that I visit regularly, half the time when I leave her page, it asks me if I am sure I want to leave the page and then takes me to another page.  Which right now for the life of me I cannot remember what it says.  But I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is not doing anything...so is it blogger/google?  The page it takes me to does not seem dangerous.So, if you have any idea about this, please chime in, or if you have had it happen to you.  As for my blog, I have not changed anything on it....so feel like it is the same with everyone else's blog...that it is just something with my computer.EDITED:  I just checked using the other computer, and it doesn't block anything.

I guess I  will wait till after it is washed to see how it feels before I make final judgement.On the other hand, I did drag out my serger to finish the edges.  I really don't have far to go...I need to turn the bias tape to the inside and sew it down then hem and it is finished.  It really is cute...at least in my opinion.

We drove through the strip pits on the way...the sun was already  gone by the time we got there.  We had to struggle to see anything.  And believe me, there was not much to see.  We saw about half a dozen deer....normally at that time of day it is not uncommon to see 20 or 30. We did see on Great Blue Heron in flight...and Roger spotten a pheasant out in a field.  Or we assume it was one.  It was too dark to see any color, but going by the profile that is what we thought it was. I am wanting to go out there sometime late and just drive around after dark....would just love to go and sit and see what I could hear and see.  A lot of the fields had been mowed....just wish they would mow them all for a change.  This one field has not been mowed in years and it is a mess of weeds, but I suppose that is good for the wildlife.***************Yesterday, our thermometer read 111º at one point.  I know that seems extreme but I really believe that our thermometer is right.  On a positive note, today was supposed to be another hot one, but instead the break in the extreme heat has come.  It is only 87º right now!"},

I suppose it is supposed to be the basket but it sure would look cute to plant flowers in it.****************The other day I read this Survivors post by Sandra..it reminded me to do this post about food.When I was a kid, to get a can of Vienna sausages was such a treat, or a can of Campbell's soup.  Bologna sandwiches were few and far between for the most part, and to have a fried bologna sandwich---well, now I still love fried bologna sandwiches.   The round steak of the south--who can beat it.Every now and then I just have to get a can of those vienna sausages, but they are just not near as good as I remember them.  I always cut one in half an then break a cracker in half and that is my sandwich.  You do know that there is a grain to crackers...usually you break it with the grain and it breaks without much mess but if you break it across the grain--well, if I break it across the grain I have a pile of crumbs and it is in pieces.And then there is crackers....I LOVED crackers as a kid...still do in fact.  But again, we did not always have crackers back then.  Most of the time we did, but at times they were scarce.  Do you remember they used to not come in tubes of the squares.  Instead they were left 4 squares together?  They were easily broken into 4 individual squares.  Anyway, I can remember taking a package of them every now and then and hiding them!  I didn't want to share I guess!  I don't know why...no one else ate them like I  did.I loved to just sit and spread butter on them and eat them that way...and still do that once in a blue moon.  And I loved crackers with jelly.  Now Roger still has crackers with butter and jelly every time we have chili.  He says that is what they always served together when he was a kid...I think at school.  And I still like crackers with butter and jelly, but I don't think about having them but once or twice a year.Then there is Campbell's soup...I never had tomato soup that I remember as a kid.  Actually we had very little of it, but the only two I remember for sure having was vegetable beef and cream of mushroom.  Every now and then when mom went to pick up a few groceries, she knew she would be getting home with no time to fix much dinner so she would bring home two or three cans of vegetable beef soup.Oh, how I loved it back then.  I would love to know if my brothers liked it as much as I did or if it was just something to fill their stomach.  Such a treat it was.  Now, I actually dislike the 'Healthy Request' version of it--I don't know what the did to it but it is some nasty stuff in my opinion.  Not that I still love the original...but every now and then would get a can and have it for old time's sake.And do they still make the little pizza kits?  I think they cost a dollar...or maybe a few cents over.  It came with the mixture for making the crust...I think all I had to do was add water.  And it had this little can of sauce....I don't remember what or if it had some kind of meat in it.  Then there was the cheese to spread on top.  We thought we were in heaven if mom got one of those for me to make.And almost ever night we popped a BIG pan of popcorn...we used a metal dishpan and it would be about half full...it was probably  18 or 20 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.  Mom would have her own little bowl, and I think one of my brothers would sometimes have one cause he laid in the floor to watch TV.  We would eat it all...none left except the grains that did not even begin to pop.Just every so often, we would make french fries for a snack...or if it was winter, before we got the furnace, we would put a potato in the heating stove...but I don't remember just how we done that.  I just remember that being real treat.***********Then there is the food that instantly transports you back to another time and place.  One of those for me is actual round steak breaded and fried, white rice with butter and salt and pepper, and green beans.  I only fix that once in a blue moon  now, but that instantly takes me back to when Roger and I lived in Tennessee.  It was a favorite meal back then.  And I still love it for the memories associated with it.If we go to pizza hut and get the chocolate dunking sticks, the chocolate syrup they give us to dip them in reminds me so much of the chocolate syrup my mom made for us to dip our biscuits in.Well, this is getting way too long...will close with telling you that it was 108ºF here yesterday afternoon, and it is expected to be almost that hot again today...one weather station predicts 105 and the other 107."},

We have had days on end of temps over 100º.   I thought one day that we were not going to break the 100 mark but it ended up not so.  One day was 108º!    Our yard is brown and crunchy and the only way the flowers and garden are living is because we water them.  Right now the above photo looks soooooo refreshing.We took Lorelei home day before yesterday, and the farms are really going to lose a lot this year I am afraid.  We saw cornfields with just big brown spots in them...and other places the corn was tasseling but no silks forming at all.  It was so curled up, it looked almost brittle.  I have heard people talk about crop insurance.  One guy the news interviewed said usually the crop insurance only pays just a bit over enough to cover the planting costs.  I don't know if that is true in all cases or not....and that is better than nothing.  But I still feel bad for them....**************Sarah and Lorelei came Saturday evening and Sarah spent two nights...Lorelei was not ready to go home so she stayed another night.  I do not know why, but sometimes it is so easy to get the camera out when she is here and other times just seem so busy that I can't.  Well, this was one of the times I couldn't so I don't have any new photos to show.  But I have tales to tell!When her mom left, we had to walk her out to the car of course...we just always do.  So Lorelei hugs her, and we give her a hug and she leaves...we had to stand there and watch till she was out of sight.  I set Lorelei down and we start to walk inside and she clouds up with big old tears in her eyes, and said \"Mamaw, I forgot to tell mommy I love her.\"  It would have broke your heart cause she was so sincere.I told her we could call her if she wanted....but I told her you mommy know you love her....and that seemed to ease her mind.We went to Walmart a bit after Sarah left to look for Lorelei a butterfly net.  We also looked at clothes...she found a dress she liked but it was not in her size.  She just was not interested in anything else.  Tuesday we head home...she goes to the potty before leaving.  But we get about 30 minutes from home, and we take back roads part of the way.  So we are out in the middle of no where and she needed to go to the potty....I asked her if she could wait...she says she can.So we head to the highway, and backtrack to a Walmart.  I take her in, and we make it in time...we come back out and she tells me \"Mamaw, lets go look at clothes.\"  This is a three year old wanting to look at clothes!  So we head back to them...and there are just no clothes to speak of her size, after wandering around a few minutes, I spied a rack with hardly anything on it but on the bottom is her dress...I grab it, it is the right size, and her eyes just gleam.  She told me, \"Mommy is going to love me in this dress!\""},

{"title": "Just think....", "date": "Saturday, June 30, 2012", "text": "What if we still had to cook our meal on a stove like this....in the heat we have been having.When I was a young girl, my mom cooked on stove much like the one above...you can see what is left of it HERE....I think I was in about the 3rd or 4th grade when my sister bought her an electric stove.We also heated with a coal stove, but not like this one.  In fact, I have looked for an image similar to the one we had with no luck at all.Anyway, these were at Patton's corner in the 'house'...and no not the shack showing on Time Stand still today.  I will post the 'house' another day....either here or over there.Remember before I mentioned that we all had to carry in wood and kindling for the stoves.  One time, my brother that is next to me in age was chopping kindling.  Apparently it was a piece of lumber...for he had it laying on the ground between his feet splitting it.  I don't know what/why it happened, but he chopped his foot instead and had a big gash in it.  He was using a hatchet instead of an axe....To the best of my memory....there was no visit to the doctor.  I bet today he would have gotten stitches.  I don't even remember him complaining afterwards.*************When we were kids, we were certainly not rich.  And I don't know how or where it came from, but there was always boards/old lumber in the woodshed.  If we wanted to do or make something, we could usually find what we needed.  And there was always nails...now if we needed bigger nails like size 12, 16, etc--we might have to go get them.  Though there would usually be a few.  But we typically had some #8's and maybe #10's on hand....And we even saved old nails if they weren't too bad and would straighten them out to re-use on occasion.  When have you heard of anyone doing that?"},
{"title": "I got ahead of myself....", "date": "Thursday, June 28, 2012", "text": "I should have did this post first, rather than the post from Patton's Corner that I did yesterday.  But better late than never.  When we started our drive, I asked Roger if he minded sticking close to home...I just did not feel like a long drive to get somewhere, then a long drive home.  So, most of our little drive day before yesterday took place in Parke County.  I had hopes of seeing an eagle...but that did not happen.Instead, one of the first things we came across when we got out to where I considered the drive beginning was this view!  And let me tell you, my photo does not do it justice.  It was just so pretty to come upon this view.  I had Roger pull over for me to take photos...If you click to enlarge the above photo, you will see a gentleman walking out to his garage.  I did not notice him when I took the photo.I was busy trying to figure a way to get a good close up view of the flowers.  I had take probably half a dozen shots when I looked up and here came someone riding up to me on a 4-wheeler.  I stood up and greeted him...and told him how beautiful I thought the flowers were...what a glorious view to have come into view.He and his wife had retired and moved back to this part of Parke County.  They had planted this strip of wildflowers, and plan to extend it all along the edge of this property in the coming years.We talked several minutes, and during the time I told him who I was, and told him where my husband had worked...don't know why I didn't tell him where I had worked.  Anyway, when I told him about Roger, he had to go down and talk to him and tell him a story about the place he retired from.  So I took a few more photos, and went back to the car...Well, they were having a good talk...and during that found out that besides having a great love for wildflowers, this gentleman loves black powder/muzzleloading/mountain man type of stuff.  This is stuff Roger loves.And he knew a lot of history...I did not ask him what he was retired from, but wondered if it was from being a teacher or something.....I sure would have loved to have had him for a history teacher.He told us some things about our area that we had never known.  For one there is a little bitty town not too far from here by the name of Mecca.  Roger asked him something about the name....and at one time the town had had a going concern making bricks and tiles, I think.  He said there had been about a 140 Arabs come and work there....and if you go to this cemetery near there, you will see in the back some headstones with Arabic writing on them.He also told us other things we didn't know, but would probably bore you to tears...but I could not leave out the part about Arabs living near here.  It is just hard to imagine and you have to wonder what they thought of this area.  And wonder why they left and where they went.********************Edited to add:I forgot I had this set to post.  I meant to wait and add the temperature high for the day.  The weather station reported 106.5º...here our thermometer said 108º...and I believe it.  It is like walking out into an oven here."},

I will be showing a few more shots from this place in days to come.  I could go back there today and enjoy it.  There was just more than I could take in.

But oh, you should have heard our Lorelei singing...she was shy, and didn't sing loud, but she knew the words and sang right along with it.  Just such a sweet little voice.

But I can't for the life of me think who it would have been, and I don't know why he picked up the other two boys.  But there were all of us in the cab of a pick-up.  I still remember laughing and giggling.Or there was the time he took at least three, if not four of us girls to our graduation....in the cab of a truck.  Giggling and laughing all the way.

One day a few months ago, we drove around down there looking for it...almost exclusively on the east side of Route 1.  Well, today we took a road going west, and just rambled around.  Almost all the way down to Robinson.I never did see any barn that was special...yet I don't even know what I am looking for.  Just from the way it is mentioned to me, I would instantly recognize it as what they are talking about.Either way, we were not out at a good time...so many of my photos were NOT GOOD.  I have not taken the time to see what I could do in photoshop.  I am not getting my hopes up.  But I sure would like to go back down that way on a better day, preferably one of those crisp, clear fall days....or one after a rain.

I am always ready for fall....it is my favorite season.  Don't get me wrong, I am always so glad to see spring, and I love somethings about summer...and I love to get out in the snow with camera in hand....but oh, I would love it if fall always lasted a little bit longer...with warm days right up into November.  And the leaves aglow with color.And windswept skies...and hearing the crickets start...and apples getting ripe...seeing the farmers out in the fields.  Hearing the corn rustle if the wind blows...that is just a wonderful sound. I will leave with the following video...even if the music sounds too--oh, I don't know the word...listen to the words.

Then we got started talking about going fishing and headed out to Mansfield...a family was there swimming.  So went to the tail waters of the dam on up the way.  We fished a little bit and then someone came and got right on top of us.  So, we left and went back by Mansfield to see if the family was there...they weren't but new people had come.So we headed to the iron bridge on up the creek from Bridgeton....not sure what time it was by the time we got there, but probably 5:30 or 6:00.  My first cast a nice small-mouthed bass hit, and I caught two or three more, each one smaller than the last...then I caught a creek chub...I absolutely cannot stand to handle those things.  I am embarrassed to admit this, but had Roger get it off the hook.  And I would have if he hadn't been there and always have in the past.  I will do any other fish and not mind, but those things are just creepy to me.Anyway, we waded and fished.  We have spent so many hours in that creek when the kids were young.  We would fish and they would play and catch anything that moved.  We could almost hear them last night, their memory lingers there.  And Roger was recalling them having a water snake cornered...I don't know if he made them leave it alone or if he let them go on...but either one of the girls would have caught it and not thought much about it.  Although, they are sort of aggressive, so not sure if it was very big if they would have.It has been a long time since I waded and fished...for a while it made me dizzy to look at the flowing water...then discovered if I put my bifocals on top of my head that it didn't bother me.  But I have to have them with me to change lures.Anyway, it was 9:00 when we got back to the bridge...at least a half hour to get home, then had to warm up supper.

This time his motor kicked on and he was purring so loudly.  He was a lonesome boy was his problem. He is totally entertaining...I will be in the bathroom putting up stuff, or cleaning, and here he will come and reach up and pull down the towels.  If they fall and cover him up, that is even better.  He will lay there forever.  And I cannot keep the throw rug straight in front of my chair.  He crawls under it and keeps it a mess all the time.

I heard our local weatherman say we are behind over 10 inchs of rain for the year so far...we really could use a good soaking rain.After running an errand or two yesterday morn, I settled down in the afternoon to finish the back for this small quilt.  I set a few minutes, then thought with the things I have to do today, that I best be busy getting it pin-basted because it sure would not happen today.  I wish I had timed the entire process. I first stretched the back on the floor, used t-pin to keep it stretched.  I spread the batting, using t-pins again to keep it spread out...then the top.  After crawling around doing all that it was time for a break.  I did time myself on doing just the pinning, and for that small quilt it took an hour.  It is approximately 64/65 inches long--I know this cause it is just a bit longer than I am tall.  And  I think it is around 48/50 wide.  I know that because I knew I needed more than a single width of fabric for the backing.***********It was up to 95ºF here yesterday...according to one thermometer.  The other said 99º!  The local TV station predicts it will be 97º today, while Weather Undergound predicts 102º.

It is pin-basted and just waiting on my decision.The backing I am making is not just an ordinary backing...it is nothing fancy but I am doing more than just a plain piece for fabric.  It is nothing planned...just throwing some fabrics together.  Probably when it is done I will wish I had planned it.  I have such a hard time in being spontaneous with things.

This is the other end of the flowerbed...I want to get enough to go across the front of it also.Now this is not in the new flowerbed...it is out behind the garage.  It is not near as huge as my others, but it has done so much better since I put the rocks around it.There you have it...nothing fancy....those are gladiolus bulbs coming up here and there.  It was so late in the season when we done this, that they were on sale at Walmart...25 in a bag for $3.  I figured if I got three or four good ones I would be happy.  Instead I got around 20!"},

Not sure how we got started with it, but it is one of many names we call her.Anyway, this is just a little simple dress...I got the pattern from this post at another blog.  As usual, I did not follow directions exactly.  It called for double fold bias binding around the sleeves.  I didn't have any so I 'lined' it .....just enough to cover the neck and armholes.  I like that better than I would have bias binding anyway.I should have decorated the front a little bit, but all the time I was making it I was wondering if it will fit her...I think it will after seeing her this weekend.  But I had it all made except for making the ties and a couple other little items...I had it the hem turned up and ready to sew down....and I needed to get the piece of elastic in the front and back.I am so tired--I have stood down in the basement playing with acrylic paints and muslin fabric.  I tell you I don't have one ounce of talent with a paint brush.  I don't know if I played around enough if I would gain any talent or if it would always be just a gloppy mess.  I would really like to play like this often for a while to see if I would ever get more comfortable. This is early posting for me, but going to post this because I have other things to do, and later on I want to watch Mountain Men on the History Channel.  So have a fun evening everyone...when I finally get to set down for the evening I will be around to visit everyone."},

So went on, turned around and came back by it.Route 1 is 4 lanes through there...and being that there was not traffic, Roger paused, then slowly proceeded and let me take these shots...before traffic appeared in his rear view mirror.I just could not believe the how these were painted on...the limps go across the windows, up on the ceiling of the porch....Notice how the tree wraps around the corner of the house...the one on the other corner did, too.Then glance on down the side of the house...that is a spruce/pine type of tree painted on.On the way home we glanced and back behind the house, is a small Quonset hut and it has a tree painted across the front of it. I just sat here and got on google earth and took the street view through here and could see this on there...so we have passed it before and not noticed it.I hope you will take the time to enlarge these and see the details...whoever did this did a wonderful job."},

But we saw blue herons today.We saw a few, but probably not as many as were there.  The waterlilies were so tall that once they landed in them, we could hardly see them.  And over on the other side of the road, we could see the heron  rookery...too far for my lens to be any good.  But Roger had his  spotting scope and could see real good through it.I am embarrassed to admit this, but it is the third time we have been there and each time I don't think to take a photo of the tower.  I guess I don't think because I am so focused on getting out on the boardwalk. It was just so pleasant today....low humidity, in the low 80's, and hardly anyone there.  One person came by on the boardwalk while we were on it and we were on at at least an hour I would say...and maybe more.I sure wouldn't mind living near a place like that."},

And she certainly is....I had a couple people ask if I had made the dress she was wearing in the post yesterday...yes, it was one I made last year.  I just bought a tank top, measured down so far and cut it off.  I cut the fabric for the skirt in a rectangle whose measurements I don't remember.  I think the width of it was at least about 4 times the width of the tank top...and I know I guessed at the lengths.  She could wear it last year, but it actually fits better now.As to the playhouse, she did play and play with it...that was the best $7 I ever spent.Well, this Mamaw is tired....I need to put this computer away and think about getting to bed.

And I also picked up a dollhouse at a yardsale...just like this one.  When you press the phone, it sounds like a real phone ringing...and if you raise the lid to the potty, it sounds as if it flushes.  It was like new...she has dollhouses at home and really likes them, so thought she would enjoy having one here.We have been busy today...Roger did the yard even though it only needed it in spots.  If it don't rain, it will be a long time before it needs it again.  It is brittle to walk on.  He also watered my new flowers for me while I tried to pick up and put up stuff inside.  I do not know why we have got in this awful habit of piling stuff on the dining room table.  I know part of the reason is we seldom eat at the table...from people I talk to it seems to be a common thing.Lots of times we eat on the front porch, but if we are real weary, we might just sit in here and watch TV.  Eating on the porch is one thing I really miss in the winter...Well, the Belmont stakes will be starting here shortly.  I am watching the pre-race part of the day.

{"title": "From the past...", "date": "Friday, June 8, 2012", "text": "I saw this in the Livery Stable Antique Barn I posted on Time Stand Still...*****************When I was growing up, we had one similar to this in our kitchen.  The one we had had the place for the flour on the left side....like the one shown here.  Mom kept her flour in it, and her pan she made biscuits in sat under it.  dishes and serving bowls were kept on the shelves in the upper right side, I think....glasses sat below behind the roll-up door.  Some, if not all the pots and pans sat behind the big door on the bottomI don't remember what were in the drawers when it was actually in use...Besides it, we had a big, metal kitchen sink...similar to this one.  Maybe some of you remember them...maybe not.  The whole thing is made of metal, there is only one basin.  We always used a metal dishpan to run water to wash dishes in, and just ran water a bit at a time to rinse with.Oh, being in the country, we had well water.  Which means we had an electric pump.  After so much water is ran, the pump kicks on.  Well, our pump was in the basement and we could hear it kick on.  I don't know what happened and don't remember if or how it was fixed, but there was a short in the wiring somehow.  And if we were running water, and the pump came on, when we touched the faucet to turn it off, we got shocked!  I can remember that as if it happened yesterday.Beside that sink, a homemade table sat that had the same height as the sink.  It fit between the sink and the wall.  Mom hung a curtain across the front of it, and behind it sat a big lard can...that is where she put her cornmeal.  What else was there, I don't remember, but it did have more room.  The top had linoleum on it to make washing it easy.For a long long time our kitchen table was a home made one...again the top had linoleum on it--and it had this metal trim that went all the way around the edge...it capped down over the linoleum and kept it from curling up or getting torn I suppose.  And we had a bench that two of us sat on...again, I am sure it was homemade, but I don't remember any details of how it was made.Mom saved and had kitchen cabinets made...this was probably before I was in high school.  She first got just the base...they were custom made by a cabinet maker.  They were simple made, but they were made well.   They filled the wall that the sink and other table were on and extended half way down another wall.   A while later, not sure how long, she was able to have upper cabinets made.Either when she had the base made or when she had the upper cabinets made, she also had a base made with two bins that tipped out...one for flour and one for cornmeal...I think I have talked before about how everyone down there used to always buy their flour and meal in 25lb sacks...so the bins were really used.It was just so exciting to have all that room....it probably more than doubled her storage room.  I really don't know how she made it before as far as space.    And all that counter space to work on.  Though we still used the table a lot...by then one of my sisters had given her a nice table with matching chairs."},

I do know why they even think about it...the cats are always out there.  The cardinals would just fuss at them or us if we came out...I heard a Carolina wren 3 or 4 morns, but did not see it.  I hung up a gourd, but no luck.  Actually hung up two gourds...but both are failures so far.I seen the hummingbird pass by my new flowers again today...it may have actually been there for more than passing by, but I didn't see it till it was flying away.*************I was busy today...hung out 3 loads of laundry...it dried in less than half the time it would have taken to dry in the dryer.  I cannot believe how quick it dries when the humidity is down.We are anxiously waiting for our tomatoes to grow and get ripe...we have little ones...almost the size of a marble.

Actually had a longer drive in mind, but did not make it as far as I planned.  But we did make it down to the Goose Pond area south of Linton, Indiana.First, we saw Great Egrets....this one circled over us several times.  He was not the only one there, but he was the only one close enough to get a shot.After it flew away, I walked to the water's edge and there sat this big fellow.  I tried to get closer but he hopped out into deeper water.Now take a look below...I am almost 100% sure these are Black-necked stilts.  When I looked here at All About Birds, we are not even in their migration range.  I couldn't remember what their name was but thought I had seen them somewhere else in blogland...actually I knew just where I had seen them.If you want to see some really GOOD photos, check here at Montanagirl's post.  Her photos are always super.We also saw lots of blue herons, but none close enough to photograph....but did not see much else.  I was in hopes of seeing an eagle, but nothing was in the air except for the herons and egrets moving from one area to another, and some red-winged blackbirds.We both threw our lines in the water here, and at another strip pit or two we passed on the way home, but did neither of us got a single hit.   I take that back, I did have a little bluegill--and I do mean little.  I could see it trying to get my lure and it wasn't a whole lot bigger than the lure...so it doesn't really count.  At one of the places, I did see a bass that was at least 18 inches long, but he was not interested in any lure I threw out."},

But after while I may just go makes something or decide on a different way.  I am usually pretty good at getting by.It has been a beautiful day here...not too hot to sit on the porch and would have been a beautiful day to go take photos.  We may go do that tomorrow...not sure.  In all the time I  have been away from blogging, I still have not been out much to take photos.

And since we have both started feeling better, been busy.  And were gone again for a couple days.It is just so wonderful to feel good again....to feel like doing something.   We finally made a new flowerbed that I have wanted for a while, and during the time I have not been blogging I have finally gotten Roger's quilt pin basted but still cannot decide how to quilt it.  I may just have to start on it, but it is one I really would like to have figured out before I start.Lorelei and her parents were gone for a week....I will show pictures of that tomorrow if I don't forget.  My world did not seem complete with her gone.  Just knowing our girls and our  granddaughter hours and hours away sure had us both feeling strange.

I love blackberry cobbler and blackberry jelly.  Mom always made both.When mom made blackberry jelly, she did not use pectin...I don't even know if she had heard of it.  She always used just sugar to add to the juice and boiled it till it would set up.  There was a ratio she used...I think one part sugar to 2 parts juice.  One time we had been out picking--I don't remember how many of us had been picking...it might have just been the two of us or it might have been one of my brothers with me. Anyway, we each had a 2 1/2 gallon bucket almost full.  Mom cleaned them and boiled them to get the juice....then proceeded to put 2 parts sugar to 1 part juice--totally opposite of what it was supposed to be...before she realized what she had done.  So off we headed to pick a LOT more berries...Mom was extra late that evening getting all that jelly made.Just another little memory I thought I would share."},

If I had them, I would not want anything else the rest of the day.  But I don't have them, so I wish for them.  At one time or another every day, I have the thought that I cannot wait to be able to walk out to the garden and pick a fresh tomato.Thinking of a BLT made with a home grown tomato makes my mouth water....or even just to sit out in the yard with a salt shaker and a tomato. We don't have any yet, but we did plant tomatoes and bell peppers today at the end of the day.  I chose a variety of tomato plants--a total of twenty.  And thinking I will try to stop tomorrow and get 4 more.And being that Roger got up feeling good again today, we did clean the gutters of the house.  He has extensions for our shop vac and does the majority from the ground normally.  Today, on one side the maple seeds were dry, with no weight to them and for some reason they stopped up the hose ever little bit.  So, he got the ladder to finish that side from it.We have a big awning over the front porch..it is a royal pain to clean the top of it...plus there is the actual guttering to the house over the top of it.  I told Roger I would get up there and get the guttering to the house if he would take the ladder to the other end...he did and I got up there.  I set on the edge of the house with my feet on the awning to clean the house gutter.I got the bright idea and told him to get me two pieces of plywood for me to put on the awing and distribute my weight.  Why two you ask?  Well, I could work from one and when I wanted to move forward, I could put the other one in front of me and crawl on to it, work from it, then bring the original to the front.  I did have Roger watch the awning the first time I put my full weight on it, but I did not seem to have an effect on it. The awning is at least 26 ft in length and I think it is 8 ft wide...so I got the guttering done, and then the awning also.  It fits up under the eave of the house and gets seeds and stuff back up under there...then on the outside edge, there is always gobs of stuff.While I did that, Roger got practically the rest of the house done...and did finish it while I just sat and watched.  That is one job we both dread...he usually does it all, with maybe a bit of help from me...but think we discovered a better way today.  He still has the garages to do, but they usually don't get a lot in their gutters.He has an appointment with the chiropractor tomorrow...probably a good thing after today.  I was so afraid he would get his back/sciatica   to hurting again, but so far it hasn't.*********I also did a little bit in my sewing early this morn...got the selvedge edge trimmed from the backing fabric for one of my quilts...now to get the time to go down there, make a decision and get it sewn together.  Its been a long time coming...when I got that top made I was hoping to have it done by now...quilting and all."},

He just cannot stand to lay around all the time...he told me one day if he wasn't the might warrior that he is, he would be sitting in the middle of the living room crying.  Even as bad as he feels, he can still make fun of stuff, himself included.Now if we can just keep his back in shape.  He was going hunting again today, but decided to stay home and clean the gutters...I wish he wouldn't even try that for a while.  Or would let me do it...***************I am hoping I can get back to blogging regularly...the kids were here over the weekend and I just don't do much when they are here.Lorelei, Sarah and I were sitting out back.  She kept telling me I had a small island on my roof.  I was thinking she was seeing the vent.  She kept repeating it to me over and over, till I got up and looked where she was looking....in the gutter was a about an 8 inch space where maple seeds had sprouted and were growing enough till she could see them.  I could plainly see why she would call it an island...just would not have thought she knew the word and what it meant."},

We know he has been cutting down hours, so knowing he might not even be in for a few days, I called another chiropractor that our oldest daughter has used and liked.He was able to get in yesterday.  After we got back from there, and it finally quit raining I ran to our Walmart to pick up a prescription.  While there, I figured I might as well stock up on catfood and a few other things.  When I got in a line to check out, I got behind a young man that had a couple kids with him, and he was actually in the process of paying. Something happened, and the cashier had to get the manager, who in turn had to do something that cancelled the whole transaction...so he had to take all the stuff out of the bags for them to be rescanned...so I was ready to be out of there by the time I got through.  After leaving there, stopped at the grocery for just a few items, then home.Well, we were thinking I needed new brake pads on the Rav4, so called the Toyota dealership and got an appointment with them for this morning...I was down there by 7:30 and had to wait between two and three hours...Roger just wasn't able to get in and out of the truck to pick me up....so just took my kindle and sat and read while I waited.It turns out it is not my brakes, but the water pump is going out...and it is still under warranty...thank God.

But let me be away from it for a while, and I cannot stand to sew until I have it somewhat under control.I still have to get the backing for Roger's quilt made...when he got those two weeks, I just lost all interest in doing anything and have found it hard to get back on track.  But the urge to sew is hitting me,  so I should make it, but I am also wanting to start something new.We are going to meet Lorelei and her mommy tomorrow evening, and bring her home to spend the night.  Then, depending on how she feels, may meet Sarah Sunday till neither of us has to make the real long drive...but if Lorelei wants to spend another night, we will try it again."},
{"title": "From yesterday's drive...", "date": "Thursday, April 26, 2012", "text": "I passed this yesterday...had someone coming behind me so didn't want to stop.  The next place I intersection I came to, I turned around and came back to get a couple shots.*******************I haven't did much of anything today...a little bit of regular cleaning....fixed burgers on the grill.  Oh, I did a load of laundry and hung it on the line.  I did spread some fertilize on the garden and Roger tilled it.  I need to get out and get tomato plants.  I just finished my last jar of juice and sure hope I have some good tomatoes this year.We also need to raise plenty of bell peppers; we have used almost all we had frozen.    Other than that, I want to try raising some horticulture beans again.  Last year I did not get them out till late in the season and they did not do much.  I think the first two year we were married plus one later on is the only years we have not at least raised tomatoes.  There is nothing like homegrown tomatoes.I don't remember quite how it happened, but when we were first married, we both worked at the same factory on the same shift...but for some reason here Roger came in from work and had a paper sack that had 8 or 10 tomatoes in it.  They were small to medium sized...I think someone had sent them to me, knowing I would like them.  I sat and ate every single one of them.When we were kids, I can remember coming in in the afternoon and getting one or two and sitting and eating them and loving every bite of them....nothing has changed.And my best friend/sister-in-law was talking today about cleaning out her jars and getting ready for another season.  It brought back memories of home....I think I have said before that our basement was not quite a dungeon, but it sure was not fixed up.  It was really not even quite half a basement.  There was a light at each end...a single bulb.  It more or less lit up enough till you could see where you were going, but it would have been very tiring to try to read anything down there. Across one end was we a set of shelves built to hold the canned goods.  To the best of my recollections, they were about two ft deep and probably at least 8 foot in lenght....and there was at least 5 if not 6 of the shelves...the top one was over my head.  Every season one of my jobs was to help go through and see if anything had gone bad, and mom would decide if some stuff was too old.We would pour the stuff out...and then there was jar washing to be done.  Plus I would have to wash down the shelves.  Before winter, at least 3 of those shelves would be completely full, and the others would probably be half full.  Most stuff was canned in quart jars...I don't remember if mom used pint jars for anything.But she did have a few half gallon jars...and she even had some that held 3 quarts.  I don't remember what she put in the 3-quart jars...can you imagine canning anything in an almost gallon jar?  I know she canned some of the dill pickles in the half gallon jars, and maybe soup stock. Oh, and I think she canned some peaches and pears in half gallon jars.  The dill pickles I remember for sure I can remember because certain visitors always wanted a jar of them when they came to visit once or twice a year.  And truth be told, a half gallon of pickles would not be too many sometimes for just me....or especially if I and my older daughter got started on one.Now, I don't think she had that many half gallon jars and even fewer of the ones that held 3 quarts, so she canned more pickles, etc in quart jars, too. What I wondered is are half gallon jars even available now.  I don't ever remember noticing them anywhere.  **************No rain at all last night or today, but I did see lightning last night.  Now there is a slight chance for tomorrow evening so we shall see.  I won't hold my breath though."},

I know there is a lot just as pretty--I guess it is in the eye of the beholder.**********I actually got out for a little drive today and will be showing some pics from it on Time Stand Still, and here, too.  I really did not go far, and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.  No eagles, no hawks, nothing but a few squirrels.    I did manage to find a road I had not been on before and I want to go back again.I came home and made spaghetti, thinking Roger would be home before I finished, but instead it was around 3:00 before he got home.  No turkey, though he 'almost' had one.  Turkeys are funny...when they are coming into his calling, a lot of times they won't cross water.  Well, today, it would not come across the fence.  And he did not have permission to hunt across the fence so couldn't shoot it over there.We are supposed to have to have storms, so probably no hunting tomorrow.  Not sure what we will do.

The top two came in a bag that was mixed colors....And the one below I just cannot remember. I cannot pick a favorite...just love their bright colors. *************Not much going on here.  Roger finished cutting the wood from the tree.  We saved some of it to have a bonfire some evening if we want.  I planted a few more Asiatic lilies...I have gradually grown to really love them. I am not sure what I am going to do where the crab apple tree grew.  Maybe nothing this summer.  I told Roger now I can look out the front window and watch for rainbows.  Always before I had to go outside to see around the tree.The cats did not know what to think yesterday...I am thinking they will miss it.  They like to climb the bushes when we are outside watching them.  I never notice them up them unless we are out there.  They are like a kid showing off.Tomorrow the turkey hunting season opens....if it is not storming Roger will go.  And of course there is a chance for storms.  I haven't tried to make any plans...so will see what the day holds...This is a road we traveled on yesterday...like so many other roads.  They always urge us on.  And I always have the urge to take photos of these roads...I have countless photos of this scene with slight variations.***********We did cut down the crab apple tree today.  Roger actually cut it down and I stacked the brush.  It brought back memories of working in the orchard.  Our chainsaw did not want to start...even for Roger.  It reminded me of these pruners we had for a while at the orchard.  They were ran by this portable air compressor.  It had either a 5 or 7 horsepower gasoline engine.  I am almost positive it was a 7 horsepower.In winter, I always had to wait for the boss...because when it was bitter cold I could not start anything that had a pull start, except for the chainsaw.  Well, that compressor was about the end of both of us.  I would pull and pull and pull and he would say, move, let me try it.  Then he would pull and pull and pull and then I would tell him to let me try....we would would both go through this several times before it would start.As a side note, the picker I worker from had a 13 horsepower engine and would almost always start on the second pull the first time it was started for the day.  Then later, one pull each time.The engine for the compressor and the engine for the picker were both made by Honda.Anyway, today brought back fond memories.  And it was fun, but tiring to be outside doing that type of work.  And when we were done, I even came inside and finished cleaning the kitchen cabinets. The rest of the day I spent being absolutely worthless."},

Not that I think that is out of the ordinary...I think it is normal.   However, most of mine did not open last year....A good part of the morning sun is blocked by my crab apple tree...but I think we are about to remedy that.  Roger hates the crab apples in the fall...I do not remember the ones on my mom's trees getting very big.  The ones on this tree grow to well over an inch in diameter--I would say close to an inch and a half in diameter.I have mentioned before that it seldom blooms pretty...this year turned out to be an exception.  But still I would rather have my wisteria's bloom all open as to have that tree with maybe a chance of pretty blooms.   So, we may cut it it down tomorrow.   And just maybe the wisteria blooms will open up.***************We went for a drive today... I was suffering from 'tiredness' too much to enjoy it.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I don't know if it is mental, or hormones off, or just plan laziness.  We came home and I sat down here for a few minutes...I decided to put on the music and start on a project that has been on my mind for longer than I wanted to admit.  I started washing down my kitchen cabinets,  taking down the knickknacks off the top and washing them as well as the top of the cabinets.  I will not describe to you how bad it was, but it was BAD. I don't know if it was actually doing something that helped, or just listening to music while I worked, but I did get quite a bit done before I stopped for the evening.  I did leave my stepladder inside till I will have to look at it till I do the rest of the cabinets.  I would like to get them done tomorrow but not sure how that will work out if we cut that tree down.**************Oh, and did it turn colder where you are?  It was so chilly I had on a fleece jacket today when we were on our drive.  We went south and east of where we lived.  I figured it would be warmer there, but got back here and it was at least 5, if not 10 degrees warmer here.  But it is chilly now.  I am wondering what it will do to my wisteria...nothing I am hoping."},

I hate to be so boring...I was thinking give it a couple days and he will be okay.But here I am mentioning it....he was sick for two weeks...fevers, chills, and sweats...with two visits to the doctor last week....he had his first night free of night sweats and feeling awful Monday night...this is after two trips to the doctor.  He had ended up really dehydrated and low on potassium and sodium....anyway, Tuesday I said something to him about did he feel like he was getting out of the twilight zone?  He said that described it exactly, but that he still felt boxed in....We missed Easter with Lorelei...have not seen her since April 1....I have not been to the strip pits since some time the week before that.  We did go for a short drive Sunday but I was too tired to enjoy it.   I suppose the stress of it all.  I was really thinking it was something besides flu.  I figured he would end up in the hospital....thank God he didn't.I have not accomplished anything I intended with my break from this blog...just could not settle in and work with worrying about Roger.  Instead I have been spending a lot of time on Google Earth looking at photos...yesterday I kind of started feeling the return to normal.

I would like it if it wasn't a barn I had photographed.I am thinking I will have Sarah mat it for me if she can find the time...she is talented that way.  And I will have Roger make a frame.  Maybe from a piece of wood that came from our own old barn.  It may be a while before it is done with the things coming up.*************Roger got the results of the blood work and the biopsy he had done last time at the doctor and they did not show anything at all out of the ordinary.  So week after next he goes and has the patches put on.  The only thing about them is he has got to keep them dry, so won't be able to get out and do anything and won't be able to take a shower.  He will be fit to be tied with both of those things.***************Has anyone else heard of the Kim Komando show on radio....she is the digital goddess.  I don't listen to her near all the time simply because I forget.  But I LOVE her show...she covers so many areas and helps people with problems, tells about new apps, new programs, talks about security issues...she just covers everything.  I really have thought about paying for a subscription till I can listen any time I want to.Sure not everything is something I am interested in, but almost every time I hear it I learn something new.  Or hear about a cool deal...some of which I have really regretted not grabbing.  Oh, not through her show...but about a year ago one of the camera companies had out a little point and shoot camera for $89 that was water proof or water resistant....I should have grabbed that too quick to talk about cause I am all the time wishing I had one.  Just to be out in the rain and snow sometimes...*******************The auction house came and picked up my daughter's stuff yesterday, along with a few items from our garage.  I wish we could have brought it here and sold it through Craigslist or something, but just too much of it and it was too heavy for Roger and I to deal with.  I still do not have strength in my left arm, so cannot do a lot of lifting.  Someone is going to be very lucky to get her washer and dryer....I think they had been used a year.*************************We are waiting on the kids to get here...they should be here in another hour or so.

It is basically a new TV...has been used about a year, but been sitting here for almost two years.  We looked and looked and looked some more.  All to no avail.So I get on the phone and start calling appliance places...I first call Countryside TV and Appliance here in town...their tech guy was out but she would ask him if they had it and then call me back.  I can never just sit so started calling other places...the one place told me to go to Radio Shack.  So I called them...he didn't know.  He told me to take a photo of where the cord plugs into the TV and take down the information about the power, etc.....so I took pictures of both and printed them out.We talked a minute and decided to head down there, but just to be polite we stopped by Countryside to check and to tell her we were headed on to Radio Shack.  Well, she had not checked, but her tech guy had just got back...she took the photos back and he had one!!!  Talk about relief.  I just did not feel like a trip to Terre Haute so that was one less thing we had to do.So, today is the day the auction place comes to pick up her furniture and washer and dryer, etc.  We will then have the fun of waiting to see how much it brings...."},

And this is the result.  (One row does not show in the photos...the quilt is actually square.)I never have a good place to photograph quilt tops or quilts...or at least not easy to get to so most times I just resort to the clothesline in the back yard.  The above photo looks different because it was also take while the wind was blowing it so hard and I was half looking up.  I think you will like all photos better if you click and enlarge.  This is a log cabin quilt with the blocks set in the barn raising style.After the weekend, I think I will try to get the backing made and the layers pin-basted together.  I suppose then it will set a while while I decide how to quilt it.  I just have no idea--I don't think I want to meander or stipple quilt...it will be machine quilted whatever I do.It would be so simple to send this out to be quilted, but I just cannot stand to have other hands finish my work.

But I will tell you this...the above photos do not do it justice.  I wish I had had a wide angle lens, but all I had was the little point&shoot.We did not stop at all though I would have loved to before it started to rain.****************Now to the fun part of this post...and I doubt if I can remember all Lorelei said that got our attention.  The first thing, when we got over there to get her, she wanted me to go play with her.  And she wanted me to help her get one of her dress up outfits on.  Something was said about kings....I said I thought women and girls were queens and princesses.Lorelei's response, \"Yes, We are.\"Well, all the time I am talking to her as she is dancing around, Roger and Sarah are looking at some knive she had and Roger is telling her something about them...Lorelei is still just dancing around.  None of us had the slightest clue she was paying any attention to them.Lorelei says, \"Papaw really likes knives.\"  Out of the mouths of babes....************The first night she was here...oh, you would have had to be here and be me to fully appreciate.  We went to bed--she and I sleep in the spare bed.  I read her a couple stories and turn off the light.  And then if I told one story, I told ten.  And I am NOT a good storyteller.  But she doesn't realize that.  Good thing.All the time she is wiggling--kicking a foot, moving an arm.  Anything to stay awake.  And during the time of it we heard what sounded like a minor crash in the kitchen/bath area and she is asking what it was.  I am trying to just shrug it off, till she will forget about it but in the back of my mind I am wondering what in the world the cats have found to get into now.So, she continues jabbering...probably for half an hour after that...now mind you, that we have been in bed for an hour and a half....after another half hour passed, she says, \"Mamaw--I have to go to the potty.\"  So out of bed we get...turn the bathroom light on and her potty training seat is no longer on the potty. Take the time to go look at it...it is important to look at the above link for the understanding of the rest of the story.I look beside the potty, I look in the tub...wondering if Roger has moved it.  About that time he emerges and starts talking about the noise and that he never could figure out what made it.  It hits me...you got to understand our Bubbie cat is a big boy...and not only do dogs drink from toilets, so does Bubbie cat.So I tell him the I am looking for Lorelei's potty seat, and I start telling him I bet Bubbie tried to get a drink from the potty and got stuck in it...he tells me he was sitting there in the living room and a cat came flying through and was just a blur it was moving so fast...Lorelei was just standing there listening...she started laughing so hard...I so wish I had taken the time to get the little camera to record her laugh...she laughed till she cried...or as she says, her eyes leaked.  She would start to quiet down then she would look at me and say something about Bubbie in her potty seat and start laughing all over again.  It is such a deep belly laugh...it is just contagious.So that was the first night...hard to get her to sleep, but once she asleep, don't get up till 8:30 the next morning.  We were busy all day Saturday....she blew bubbles, chased butterflies, played hopscotch, went to the park...just non stop action all day.  She would barely take the time to eat.  Then when night came, the last thing we did was watch The Fox and the Hound....she brushed her teeth and we went to bed.She asked me something, and I tried to answer it.  She says, \"mamaw, stop talking now--I am tired.\"  And was asleep in about 2 or 3 minutes.BUT, she woke up about 4:30....her nose was stuffy, her eyes were bothering her...I think it is the matter that gets in the corners...I gave her benedryl and took a warm wet washrag and washed her face and let her hold it against her closed eyes..and she made a true effort to go back to sleep....she lay there and had me rub her back...for several minutes.  I thought we had it made, and she sat up and started crying...said she wanted to go to her home now...she wanted to see her Mommy and her Daddy.So we were up and on the road by about 5:45...we did just got to the edge of town and she was asleep, but we went ahead and went on.  About half way there Roger stopped to get a coffee...while he was inside she woke up and started crying again...saying, \"I want to go to my house.\"  I thought for a minute she was really going to get wound up but she calmed down and went back to sleep...Now when we got there,  I got her out...and she latched herself to me and told me she wanted me to stay and play with her at her house.I know I am forgetting things but these were the highlights that I keep thinking of over and over.  And last night, she had her mom lay down with her in her bed...I don't know how long Sarah laid there, but she told her it was time for her to leave...she was tired.In case you are wondering, not a single picture was taken while she was here...she keeps me so busy I don't even think about getting the camera out when it is just her here."},

Well, we have our rod & reels in the Rav at least 75% of the time.  I had been wanting to throw a line in the water so I headed out to a strip pit out at Universal that is open to the public.  The first cast I caught a real nice bluegill.  I cast around for a bit and caught a large-mouthed bass...but it was probably no longer than the blue, if as long. By then this pair of geese had swam over so I went and got my camera and took a few shots.  I suppose it is that time of year...they spent most of the time cleaning themselves.  The big one, I suppose the male, would dip his head clear under the water and raise it up and the water would flow back over his back.  And one time he dove under and came up about 10 feet away.I left them, went to another spot on that strip pit to cast around a few more times....the first cast again hooked a bluegill, but not another single hit.So I left there and went to Green Valley, which is about 15 miles from here...it has a main lake and then a another one that just opened a few years ago.  Both are strip pits.  I cast quite a bit in the main one and did not get a single bite, so went to the newer lake and caught four crappie!  I did not want to come home....But I did.  And due to seeing Judy's post about finishing the binding on her quilt, I finally started sewing the block together that I made from the Civil War Reproduction fabrics.  It is now half sewn together...but the rest is going to have to wait because we plan to have Lorelei for the next couple of days if nothing happens."},

She was outside and Lorelei said, 'Mommy, it's picture time.\"  She turned around and the top scene was the first shot followed by the other.  That Otto is some special dog...he could not be any better to her.  My heart just melts everytime I see his patience with her.  His worst thing is he gets so excited if someone new comes, and if it is someone that likes dogs, he seems to sense it and gets that much more excited.***********We had to get to Terre Haute this morn...I don't remember if I have told but Roger has been seeing a dermatologist about the breaking out.  So far, have had some biopsies done, and did another today of an area that was NOT from the original breaking out but was infected and his knee still looks strange. The dermatologist is going to be done for a  week or two, and when she gets back she is going to run some more tests.  She really wants to get to the root of the problem.  I feel like he is in good hands.  The first biopsies did not show anything...the labs just said it was dermatitis.***************Another beautiful day here in the Wabash Valley....actually on the hot side.  Roger mowed the yard yesterday...it really needed it.  I think this is the earliest we have ever had to mow the yard.  Redbuds are now in bloom...we saw may apples up today and Roger said the trillium is up here  in our yard.  I had not thought to look for it...won't be long till the bluebells bloom if that is so."},

I hope I can get some sleep/rest the next few days, and maybe towards the end of the week go get her to come stay a couple days.....I think she will stay now with no problems.  She goes non-stop all the time she is here...just such a little busy body.  I wish I had half her energy.Oh, she sat on my lap at one of my sewing machines.  She discovered if she held in the needle up button that it would sew one stitch at a time...so she did some sewing while here.  I hope this is a sign of things to come."},

I just couldn't believe it...then as it turned to dusk...after the sun is gone yet not quite dark, there were swarms and swarms of mosquitoes!I ran out to the strip pits just to see if I would relax more...did not see much.  I first seen three deer in one of two spots I always see deer.  Then a little later, seen a couple more in the other spot....but as late as it was, I was wondering where they all were.  Usually see 4 or 5 here and 3 or 4 there.  Finally, I was leaving the strip pits and happened to glance back to my right over my shoulder and the scene below is what met my eyes.I have tried to lighten it...not sure how it will look on everyone's computer...it is not great on mine but I can see all the deer.  Well, my camera was at it highest ISO, and speed so low...I was amazed that it wasn't a totally blurry mess...I took two or three of this view...again click and enlarge.  Anyway, started easing on down the hill, and my eyes got adjusted to the light, or lack of, and I could see on down the side of the hill there were more deer here and there, and then on over farther away there was another group of deer...at least 5 or 6 or 7 in one cluster...so who knows how many were out there.**********Sarah and Lo are on their way here, so not sure if I will be blogging much this weekend.

{"title": "Ramblings...", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2012", "text": "A few weeks ago I had an artists contact me and ask to use the above photo for a rendering as he called it...he does pin and ink.  I felt honored that anyone would want to use one of mine.  My thoughts on this are that if he was there he could see it for himself...it isn't as if he is claiming the photo as his own.Another thing....does anyone do Pinterest?  I don't really participate/have not joined it, but every now and then will go and type in quilts to see what everyone has pinned.  Participants find pictures of things they like and 'pin' it to their wall...not sure if that is what they call it since I did not join.  Anyway, I had not thought of my photos being pinned till I saw it mentioned on another blog.All you have to do is type    http://pinterest.com/source/yourblogname.blogspot.com/in the browser window, hit enter and you will find whether any of your photos have been pinned.    When I typed in http://pinterest.com/source/rose-treadway.blogspot.com/, which is my Time Stand Still blog, I found that a few barns had been pinned.I have mixed feelings about it, but it does give a link back to your blog, and they are not claiming them as their own...they are just saying they like them...so again, a compliment in a way.  I have been checking it out, and the way it gives the link back is sort of quirky.  The first link it gives results in a page that says the Page Is Not Found, but on that error page is the correct link.Anyway, I wondered if anyone else had thoughts on either one?  I really don't mind that someone uses my photos as a basis for a painting or a drawing, and as long as there is a link back to my blog I don't really see any harm in people pinning my photos on Pinterest."},

I had seen them earlier...don't know where they were by the time I eased on down the road and came to this one.  You can see more pictures of them I have taken at the strip pits here and here.  Until I started seeing these short-eared owls out there, I can only remember seeing an owl two or three times in my life.***********************Spring seems to really have sprung around here...it has been so warm around here.  I have been in short sleeves all day long.  Still been busy with 'other stuff' and a phone call or two I had to make.  Got some info I needed.And I just opened another jar of home-canned tomato juice.  There is just nothing like it.  I really hope my tomatoes do good this year till I can can some more.  I am thinking about putting out a few more plants on the south side of our house till I will for sure have enough.  I guess I will wait till planting time comes before I make a final decision about that.I know I want more Brandywines...my best friend/sister-in-law suggested them to me 4 or 5 years ago...I think one year I could not find any, the first year I raised them, I loved them...they have that good old tomato flavor and texture....then I raised them and either weather or heat or something, none of my tomatoes tasted so good that year, then I planted some again last year and oh, they are just heavenly.  So it is worth the risk to plant them.I also picked up 4 more Asiatic Lily bulbs and need to get those planted.  I could go wild with flowers....and I am hoping I have a bunch of volunteer sunflowers sprout up around the bird feeder again this year.  I will be able to take better care of them.Well, I am just sitting here dreaming of spring...so I will leave you with another favorite song I happened across a few years ago..its called 'You Plant Your Fields.'\""},

She loves other kids so much.******************I have had other things on my mind the past few days, and by the time I sit down at night to really sit, I have been too tired to think about a real blog post.  My mind will be whirling with a zillion thoughts going through...not sure if I am back to blogging her normally or not...I am just going to take it one day at a time. I have not got to work any more on my kitchen...got side-tracked with that but hopefully will get back to it in a few days.  I really would like to have it everything gone through in there.  Just with the bottom cabinets and the one upper cabinet I have done, it done looks a whole lot better.After I get them done, I really need to get down in the basement and go through some totes and dispose of stuff from them.  I know that I probably have time, but I hate to think of what a job my girls would have if something happened to me.  It will be bad enough the best I can do.

In fact it can turn it into fun.   So, I went to the computer to Playlist, and started one of my playlists...started adding to it.

Then last week she started wanting to come spend the night with Mamaw and Papaw...we all wondered would she chicken out at the last minute.But Sarah and Otto brought her down Tuesday...due to other things she didn't make it down sooner.  Well, Sarah stuck around long enough to eat lunch with us...and afterwards we were sitting there and Lo had had two candy hearts but had been messing with one and dropped it.  Sarah made her throw it away, and told her not to ask for more. Lo asked me, and I told her just to wait a little while...she looked at her mom and said, \"You go home.\"  Just didn't skip a beat.  And when Sarah left it did not bother her in the least...we played outside and she giggled and giggled.  I do not not why I did not come get the camera...I guess I got caught up in watching her.She found dandelions, and then she noticed these tiny blue flowers that I had not even noticed.  She blew bubbles....she searched for rocks...she ran and hid behind the tree.And then a neighbor has a little dog...oh, not a real little breed...one about the size of a beagle.  I have tried to make friends with it but it just never trusts me enough.  It seen Lorelei and here it came...you could almost see it smiling.  It came to me--but its real object was Lorelei.  It went and got a stick and brought it to her...just so totally thrilled to have a child to play with.  Now I am wondering if the next time I see it if it will still be okay or will I need Lorelei to meet with approval.Anyway, back to the subject...Lorelei was fine all  night....and did not want to go home the next day.  If we had not had an appointment with a dermatologist yesterday morn, she could have stayed another night.  She might have had to take care of us by then, but she would have been willing."},

I wasn't that far away from him....but those twigs in front of him make it hard to focus.  I was slowly walking up closer to him when he took off....Talk about a big bird...he seemed huge....and when he took off, he was just gone.  We watched him go down the valley and then came back our way but off a ways to the side...and in the meantime I had noticed another one...a juvenile...and then there was another eagle, but all too far away.  I could have stood there forever watching the three of them....I had been complaining that it had been a while since we had seen an eagle and then to see them two days in a row!!!*************I had intentions to visit blogs today but instead last night I discovered a few of my photos were missing from a particular day.  I have my photos in folders by day taken...and part of the photos were there, but several weren't.  I first checked to see if they were just missing in Picasa and maybe were on the computer but could not find them anywhere.  I checked the external hard drive that I had used to transfer them....they were missing on it, also.So I had to start up the old laptop and transfer them from it.  And today in between other jobs I have been going through each folder for the XTi to try to make sure no more photos were missing...I found some that I thought were missing, and have gone through almost 11,000 photos and only found one that I cannot find anywhere...and with the folder it is in, it is nothing special.I am trying to decide if I am going to do the rest...I probably will but going to take a break from it.  I have close to another 10,000 photos from my original Rebel...I just cannot bear the thoughts of starting on those right away. *****************It was a beautiful day here....true shirt sleeve weather.

They had my attention so much that I did not even see the handsome fellow below till he ran out as I was getting ready to leave.Besides the 4 ladies and the gentleman above,  I saw two others at the opposite end of the strip pits.  No chance to photograph them though.  It was when I was entirely focused on the eagles.The one strip pit has lost a lot of water...I have never seen it so low.  I don't think it has ever been a deep strip pit like some, but in all the years I have been driving through there,  it has not been so low.  I am not sure what it means as there is lots of water standing in all the normal places.  Anyway, it is full of swans, other waterfowl,And if you enlarge the photo above and look closely you will see four sandhill cranes.  They blend in so well they are hard to s pot.  I am hoping this becomes a regular stopping place for them...I saw three out there a while back.In the photo above the cranes are almost close to the left edge...Besides the deer pictured above, I cannot say how many I saw.Oh, I also saw a skunk but by then it was too late to get a decent photo.********************I don't know where to begin...this past Sunday made two weeks that Roger had been sick.  Sinus/cold type of thing.  He would feel like he was getting better only to feel bad.  So got in to the doctor yesterday and he feels like a new man. And Lo and Sarah were here for the weekend.  Cannot remember all she has done lately.  On the way here, she asked Sarah \"will Mamaw still have the play-doh?\"  Not sure if she comes to see me or to play with play-doh.  haha  We were playing with it and she had a ball of it that she was calling the moon, so I asked her if she wanted to go to the moon...she say, \"Oh, Mamaw, I don't want to go into outer space!\"  That from a three year old."},

We bore everyone telling about it.Anyway, all of the following are cropped portions of photos...and in the first three, the eagle(s) are quite quite far away.  Anyway, I suggest you use the right  click and open in a new tab, at least for 4th shot.  It is really a great capture....I headed out for a drive this afternoon, with the intentions of just passing through the strip pits, but only just passing through.  I had almost passed through when up ahead I noticed  a couple of birds...one I was sure was a Northern Harrier.  But look what else was there.  This was from quite a distance...I wasn't sure it was an eagle till I extended my lens.He was really moving...in both the above photos...not just gliding but wings flapping like he had some place to go...He went a ways and then turned back towards me and I thought oh, boy, he is coming back to me but only came so far and turned around and continued on. Look closely at the photo above...you might even want to enlarge it to see better. What is funny, I did not see the eagle on top of the power line pole till I downloaded the photos...total surprise here.  And thrilled!This fellow above and below is the first one I actually saw and was in the  vacinity of the two adults....it is a juvenile bald eagle, at least I am pretty sure.  When it first took off, its tail feathers looked like they were trying to start to turn white...  And the photo above is the one I want you to right click on and then click open in new tab or new window...I was actually willing to trespass to get closer to it, but it took flight before I could even stepped off the road....The above was not near all I saw but it was the most thrilling...I think....yeah, it was.  But saw lots more which I will show another day.  Just had to focus on the eagles today."},

This is just one group of many that we saw.One of the next things I got to shoot was this pair of mallards...and TA-DA--here we have my first photo of a coyote from there.  I have seen one other but much too far away to photograph, and this one sure was in no mood to cooperate.  He just stood till we paused for me to try to get a shot and he was off.  I must say he was the most beautiful one I have ever seen.Just on a little ways and on the other side of the road was this pheasant...he was the only one we saw. And as we left the area, there was this deer...and two or three more had done crossed the road.  This is shot through the front windshield and not very good...We did see more deer, and then there were these crazy birds...not sure if they were the white fronted geese or some other waterbird...they fly so crazy I don't know what they are but I thought they looked too small to be the white fronted geese.  They will take off in a group and it is as if they are saying 'Which way do we go, which way do we go?'  They head one way and suddenly change directions.Before getting into anything else, thought you might enjoy a few pics of Lorelei...taken last weekend.She has a little CD player that has its own CDs...she would put one in and got to one certain song and dance and dance. She always has her eyes closed or at least half closed.She wore us out just watching, doing it over and over.She even changed outfits for us.Needless to say we had a ball....I cannot even think of all the cute stuff she has done recently....will try to sit down and write about that another time.******************I made up my mind what computer to get last Friday...I checked to see if it was available in Terre Haute.  It was.  I did not want to run get it before we left to go see Lorelei....I knew I would want to fool with it too much.  So, we went over there and had a nice visit.  We came home late Sunday afternoon....just came straight home instead of going to Best Buy....it is on the south end of Terre Haute and we just did not feel like going that far.That evening I was glancing at the computer one last time....knowing we had to go to the south end of Terre Haute the next day and I would just pick it up then....I had not bothered to buy it on line...thinking I would get there and look around a bit...see it in person before I bought it.   Well, I just happened to check availability...guess what?  Right--it was no longer in the store here....but it was available in Indy where we had just been.So, I got busy and ordered it...it said it would be here by the 29th and I was thinking well, shoot....but then I remembered the desktop.  I thought they had give me a date out way ahead like that and that it came sooner.  Sure enough, this one came Tuesday I think it was.  I have transferred most of my stuff...still have the music to go but sort of dread that part...not sure why.I had trouble getting Netflix to work, but finally got it operating.  Then last night I started to blog, and of course had trouble using IE, but installed Firefox and all is well with it.  I should have just installed it to begin with I guess.*********We had almost 60º weather yesterday, but cold again today with a chance of snow flurries.  Have heard howling winds this morn...I think it is only about the second time I have heard them this winter.  So very strange.  I don't think I have ever seen a winter this warm...will have to try to look into that.Anyway, going to slowly try to get back to blogging...Lo and her mommy are coming this weekend if Lorelei is well enough.  She started running a fever again a couple nights ago...and went to the doctor but he could  not see anything wrong.

Another did not even have one 3.0 usb port.  Always some little something that is not quite what I want.Then last night I really found what I thought was THE ONE...tried to order it and it was no go.  It said it was available for shipment to home, but did not give me an option to check that.  So, I got up and called this morn since they were closed last night...well, the girl said one store is supposed to have 4 of them.  I called and that store and the girl there finally pulled it up and said they are supposed to have two.  But she did not go and physcially look...so who knows.If Roger feels up to it, we may run by there tomorrow--it is in Indianapolis.  If they actually have one I may have found the one...but I don't want to get the one that the store has used as its display model.

Just can't say who.****************I am have been thinking about home a lot and thinking about our girls...I always wonder what memories they carry with them about home.  One thing for sure, both of them are so much better with kids than I was at their age.  I suppose I enjoy Lorelei so much because I am feel like I am more at ease...in fact I was more at ease with Sarah than I was her sister.  By then I learned not to stress about every little thing...I might not make the most perfect decision, but for sure wasn't going to be doing anything that would harm them.Small kids have always gravitated to my girls.  They have always loved both of them...in different ways.  I am not sure how to say this...they gravitated to my younger because she was more a kid, and I think they gravitated to my older daughter because they felt secure with her.  When she was in college, she worked at a mini-mart every night...there was a couple that had a young girl...I think between two and three.  If they stopped by to run in and get something, she had to go in and see my daughter...and my daughter had to hold her and talk to her.  The only way just one of the parents could come in was to hurry in and tell my daughter to stay out of her view.  And you might think this was some of my daughter's childhood friends but it wasn't.  It was just someone that came in and out there.And another time, a couple was in there with one even younger, and she had to go to my daughter, and the parents just kept saying she don't do this, she don't make friends like this...and when they left, she had to kiss my daughter good-bye...again totally surprising her parents.And with Sarah, all the little kids in the neighborhood always wanted to come and see her, and her sister too....  And kids love her now...and I tell you I have learned more about being a mom from watching her and even watching her sister with Lo than anyone else, except maybe one of my sisters.Then I tell myself, maybe I have not been too bad to have the girls as we have...**************Today I have been on the go the most of the day.  I had to go to Walmart, to Terre Haute, to the post office, back home...then to the bank and to pay a bill for someone else.The reason I had to go to the bank was I counted my change...I was wondering how much I had....and though I did not count all the pennies, we all know that it takes a whole bunch of those to add up.  I took $11 worth of pennies alone and left more than that here.  Altogether I had $321 in change.  And that is not as much as I have taken in at other times...at one time I took over $700!  Another time I cannot remember but I know it was in the hundreds...I really don't want to let it add up like that again...it is so heavy to take in.Then tonight the internet was flickering off and on till I couldn't do anything...so am late getting this ready to post..."},

I was going to post it over on my Time Stand Still blog, but decided to use it here.  It is a picture I took in Tennessee....it is not uncommon to see land with the rocks exposed in the area I am from.  If I run across land like this up here, it takes me back to so many places I have known...to what seems like another world, another time.I first thought this was some kind of outbuilding, but then I seen the curtain at the window and I wondered had it been someone's house many years ago...and that thought was followed by the remembrance of plastic curtains.  Does anyone else remember them?  I don't know if we had any, but I know some neighbors did.Can you imagine trying to grow anything here...down home, at least in two areas that I was very familiar with...cattle ran the fields.  And I could always count on finding the prickly pear cactus growing there.  And some of the best wild blackberries grew in those fields...and one of them had some big flat rocks that had ruts wore in them and mom always said they were from wagon wheels of early settlers/pioneers....Our school yard had some of these same old limestone rocks...not quite as many as above but they were there.  Out behind the school, which was the play ground for the first and second grades, I remember there was this one huge limestone rock, or it seemed huge to me then...I think the one I am referring to was almost flush with the ground.  At one end of it it had, it had I don't know what you would call them.  Almost as if someone had spun two tires side by side there until it wore it down.  Only it was completely natural.  I know we played and played on that rock, and I think we pretended that was where our babies slept...what I don't recall is if one of us pretended to be the baby or what.  I do not remember having dolls there.Then to the one end, where the rest of the grades could play at some time or other, was more rocks, one of these was not huge by any means,  the part that was above ground was maybe 4 or 5 foot long.... most of it was probably under the ground so really no telling how big it actually was.  It was flush with the ground on one side and then stuck out of the ground at least a foot or so on the other edge.Well, I think from 3rd or 4th grade on, we would take our jump rope to that rock.  Two of us would get in front of the side of that ledge of rock and hold the ends of the jump rope.  All the other kids, including the boys, would get in line back from the side of that rock that was flush with the ground.  The two holding the rope would hold the rope up and everyone would run and jump from the ledge over the rope....and as everyone had a turn, the rope would be raised higher.  I think some of us would eventually be jumping it when it was higher than our waist....we would get back and run as hard as we could and just leap as high as we could from that rock to try to go up and over.And I think sometimes we would use an old dry stick weed....just anything to have fun.   We didn't have supervision at recess...when we got mad about something we argued a little and got over it and went on with what we were doing.  I don't remember there ever being anyone that thought about a lawsuit over someone getting hurt...and don't remember anyone being seriously hurt.I do remember one time, one of the boys in the class ahead of us had a red hot jawbreaker and got choked on it....this was before I ever remember hearing of the Heimlich maneuver.  The teacher tried turning him upside down and shaking him, I think....and I don't know what all and nothing helped.  One of them stuck him in their car and headed out I assume to the doctor's office because it was closer than the hospital.They had to cross a railroad on the way--as they crossed over it the rough ride either made the jawbreaker come out or pass on down.  I don't remember which it did...gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'how to save a life.'"},

So this weekend her and her mommy came down to see us...I have play dough for her, and on the way or else before they left, she asked her mom if I still had the play dough....and believe it or not, she had not been here two minutes till she asked about it.Well, Sarah got a late start because of reasons beyond her control....so it was dark when they came.  On the way, Lorelei ask her if we would still be up...Sarah told her yes.  Then she asked if we would be in our pajamas.  Don't you like how their mind works?I cannot think which day/evening it was, but Sarah told her to come on...she was taking her to the potty or to change clothes...something.  Lorelei was sitting in the floor playing with something  and was just ignoring her.  So, Sarah, and me too, for that matter--we count to three and if she doesn't do what we ask, we swat her bottom. So, Sarah started to count, 'One.'  and Lorelei promptly says, ' Two.............three.'  By then Sarah is leaving the room expecting her to follow, and she says, \"lorelei, do you want me to spank your bottom?'  Lorelei, being Lorelei, turns and looks at her and says, 'NO, Not yet,' but she did get up and go with her mom.She is such a mischievous child...I have several puzzles that she works when she is here...she can work them just fine, but every now and then she will get a piece and try to put it in the wrong place, or should I say pretend to try to put it in the wrong place...she will hold it there and look at me and say 'Here????'  I know she is wanting an excited reaction from me....."},

I asked the Roger if he minded running through the strip pits on the way...even though it was snowing I was really hoping to see an eagle but no such luck.  Not even a hawk was out today.However, the the one pond we always stop at, I saw these swans.  From a distance back I thought whoopee! Whooping Cranes...I mean I could tell they were standing and not sitting in the water.  I just did not realize how shallow it was there...when we got close I could plainly see it was swans.  Still a joy to see....Then at the HUGE strip it, we have been seeing the above pair of water birds but they always take flight before I have a chance to snap a photo...however today I did get this one and one other fired off before they were out of the picture.  I think it is a Goldeneye, but not sure...there are two types of those so whoever wants...chime in and tell me which one, or if it is something totally different because I just am not familiar with them.This was taken after I left the strip pit area, I think it is the white fronted geese.  They were flying around there...and if you enlarge it you will see that one is white....is it a snow goose?  I have not had time to look any of these up on the web, and the girls will be here shortly so don't really have time now.  Everyone be sure to check the comments because someone will probably identify these and I may not get a chance to edit this tonight...It is snowing as I speak, but still not supposed to get any amount.  Still it was pretty before darkness fell. No sewing for me today....did manage to visit a few blogs.  Part of the time now pictures don't want to load on this computer.  I have been trying to narrow down my choice for a new laptop...and having a hard time in the matter.  There is one I really want, but would have to wait for it to be on sale...plus it is not Energy Star rated so now I am not even sure I want it.I have been using my little netbook just to browse with, but all my photos are on this one.  So, I use it to blog with and a little bit of other stuff just when I want to pop on and check email.  But for evenings sitting watching TV, I use the other.I have been sitting looking back through my photos for something to post.  I have not been on a good photo shoot in so long I wouldn't know how to act if I got to go.  That being said, I came across this one below, and I have posted it before.  Do you see anything funny about it?Look at the bird in the middle on the little limb to the left....it looks as if its head is on backwards.  I had not noticed that till tonight.  It made me laugh out loud to see it.  Okay...that had not been what I was looking for...though I didn't know just what I was looking for.  I think maybe I was looking for memories.Then I came across this...you can tell it is hot, but doesn't the tree just invite you to sit under it for a while.  It would make such a wonderful tree to have for kids to climb on.  If kids climb trees these days.  I was still climbing trees in college, but I cannot say when I have seen a kid climb a tree.  We always wanted to get up high till we could see farther.Or I was always climbing a tree to see how many eggs were in a bird nest...and I had been told if I breathed on the eggs that the mom would not come back to them, so I always got up there and held my breath while I looked.And there were these young trees we used to climb to the top and get them to swaying till they would bend over low enough for us to drop from...not birches.  They were in the the cedar thicket so I think it might have been young spindly cedar trees or something that would grow with them...and not much grows with them.*****************Did not do any sewing today thought I did trim my blocks till they were square.  Just the tiniest bit was all it took.  Lorelei and her mommy are coming tomorrow evening, and spending the weekend with us if all goes well.  So going to wait till next week to start the final stage getting the blocks sewn together.  It will be at least an afternoon of sewing if not more, providing I don't make any major mistakes."},

I saw I don't know how many hawks...and I don't know why butt they all seem dark.  Even the most of the Northern Harriers...and there is no mistaking the way they fly or their white rump patch.  But I have seen the fellow above fairly often and he is always on the dark side. I only saw these two deer out there....I don't know what scared them, but I had seen them start their run from a ways off.  I thought they would run a few feet and stop, but eventually here they came through the weeds and crossed in front of me.  They went on to the top of the hill, and looked back from the direction they came...so I wondered would coyotes gang up on them?    I definitely got the feeling something was after them....*********I finally finished my quilt blocks last night, but have yet to bring them up to arrange their layout.  For some reason I dread doing that.  Seems like even when I do it, once I get them sewn together, I always see two that should be separated.  Oh, well, the top at least is one step closer to being done.It is another dark and dreary day, and a little bit cooler than it was, though it is still not bad for February."},
{"title": "Is spring on the way.......", "date": "Tuesday, February 7, 2012", "text": "I am slowing getting back to normal, I told Roger today I felt like myself for the first time in what feels like ages.   Every evening, I have been watching the sunset and thinking how wonderful it would be to drive through the strip pits so tonight I was able to act upon the thought.  The first thing I noticed was that the red-winged blackbirds were back...not in great number but several here and there.My first photo opportunity was this short-eared owl....I spied him on the ground first.  Normally the first thing I do when I turn into the strip pits is to get my camera out and set to take pictures.  Tonight I was just so glad to be out that I didn't even think about it.  So, by the time I got it out and the iso set to 1600, and got out of the vehicle...I only snapped one on the ground plus a few of him in the air....this very first one being the best. Then on down at the main pond we see stuff at, I saw these three sandhill cranes...at least I am pretty sure that is what they were.  They down close to the far end, and it being late, I did not get a great shot....but when I enlarge the original shots, I am pretty sure that is what they are.Other than the red-wings, the single owl, the sandhill cranes, and a few waterbirds, I saw at least 18 deer.  All too far away for a decent shot with it getting as late as it was.You see, I had been sewing and lost track of time.  So I got out there later than I had meant to.  but it feels so wonderful to be feeling better....and to just be able to sleep.  And every time I am sick, I cannot help but think about people that have major illnesses to contend with every day of their life and here I whine about losing a few nights sleep, and and feel bad for a few days."},

I knew it had been warm, and that the days are getting longer, and we have had sunshine for a couple days in a row...but I was still surprised to see this.  It was the only one of its kind that I saw, and I did look for more.  I did see an iris bud...but it is real close to the house.  I hope no more pop up.****************The kids came down and spent Friday night, then Saturday after they went home I started feeling like I was getting sick...and did.  Sore throat, stuffy nose, all those lovely symptoms.  Sunday was the only day where I didn't know if I was going to live or not...haha....you know how you feel that first day?  Not really that bad, but still not fun.Each day since, I get up feeling kind bad, but feel pretty good by evening.  I actually got dressed and was out and about a  little bit today.  And even came home and sewed.  The first time I have touched my machine in almost a week.Anyway, that is why I haven't been blogging...still weary and starting 'the cough' now.  Everyone we talk to has either had it or knows someone that has had it, so I know I am not the only one. Not sure when I will be back to blogging regularly, but hopefully soon."},

I don't think it has completely quit raining for over 24 hours.  We drover over to the super Walmart in a nearby town, and took some back roads.  Water was every where.  It looked like regular little streams through some of the fields...fields that you would have thought was flat.***********I chickened out on my computer...I did take all the screws out of the back...and took some little panels off....but neither one gave access to the fan.  I have saw a video of how to clean the fan, but not one of how to get to the fan.  I have found instructions, but not one single picture is included.  And so many things have to be disconnected...if I was familiar with it all I could probably do it.  And could probably do it if I had pictures to see...but for now I am not that brave.  So far it hasn't quit on me again, so hoping it lasts a while longer.****************I did finish cutting the rest of the strips for Roger's quilt.  My friend was talking about pioneer women and what a job it was for them.  And wondering how they got enough fabric to make one.  I have wondered forever how they did it all.  I think back then beds were smaller...when I was young having queen and king sized beds was not the normal thing.  Not in our area anyway.Mom did save every scrap of fabric, and was tickled to death if anyone happened to give her a few.  I don't remember it taking her very long to cut out her pieces for a quilt top.  She always used a piece of cardboard to make her pattern, and would layer 3 or 4 pieces of her fabric...and she just held the pattern and the fabric together in one hand, and cut around it.It is a whole different world now...she never went to a quilt shop in her entire life...there wasn't even a good general fabric shop around down there then.  I think she only every had one thimble...I bet I have had at least 8 or 10 different styles.  I don't know that I ever saw her buy needles...except for me for Home Economics...and maybe some quilting needles.  She just kept up with her stuff like that. And I have said it before, but will say it again...I would love to know how many miles of sewing she has done...both by machine and by hand."},

Haven't had time to look...will explain that on farther down.There were a couple nuthatches to visit,chickadee/s...didn't see no more than one at a time so don't know if it was just one coming back or more than one.And there were three pair of cardinals out there at one time...not like we used to have at home by any means but it is the most I have ever seen together at one time here.*****************So, I couldn't sleep last night, went back down stairs and cut strips to length from about 2:00 a.m. to after 4:00 a.m., came up and went to bed at last...Have did laundry, dishes, etc and also been back down there a lot in the afternoon till about 8:00....came back up to sit down and rest.

{"title": "Images converted to B&W", "date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "text": "This old house above stands across the road from the bottom photo shown in this post.And the photo below is from right beside the cows in that same photo.It is a lonely place....but I imagine at one time this old two story home was full of kids....and that there was a lot of living going on here.   Did the children get tired of living so far from everything or did they simply want a different way of life than what they had?  Or is it possible there were no kids, and the old folks died...and some other farmer on down the road bought the place.   I would love to know just how long it has been since anyone lived lived here...I have been passing this place for at least 6 years, and no one has been there.At least it has not been sold and divided into lots to sell.  Yet.  I know people have got to live somewhere, but it sort of upsets me to see places that were farms sold and turned into a subdivision.I go home to Tennessee now, and the places I used to play have homes on them...oh, it is not a subdivision...I/we had a BIG playground.  We knew all the people that owned the neighboring farms and were free to roam their land as well as our own, plus the a national park bordered part of our property. We were not allowed to just run all the time.  We all had chores...from a fairly young age.  I think I started washing dishes in about 3rd grade...and of course for me there was making beds and sweeping and dusting...though mom was not big on dusting...but the beds were made every day, and the living room and kitchen were swept at least once, and I think the front porch was swept most days....but I cannot remember that for sure.My brothers all had chores, too...depending on the season....there was wood to cut, and wood and coal to be brought in--first for the stove, and later we had a wood/coal burning furnace.  When we got the furnace, I remember really feeling it was something to not have the stove standing in the middle of he living room....Also, I usually had about three pair of socks to last me a week in school...and I washed them out by hand at night and laid them over the vent from the furnace.  Back then everyone wore knee-highs...I don't know about anyone else but me and some of my friends used rubber bands to keep them from sliding back down our legs.  We would put the rubber band about an inch from the top...and fold the top down over the band.Back to the subject...there was work galore on a farm.  My brothers did the heavy work...and there was lots of it.  We didn't have all the equipment for baling hay, so my brothers always helped other neighbors/friends put up their hay and in return we could use their equipment to cut and put ours up.  Usually someone else would run the haybaler...not because my brothers weren't capable, but because their muscles were needed to load and haul the hay in.  I can remember one time I think my two older brothers along with someone, maybe my other brother, driving the tractor and wagon...I remember it as they put up 1500 bales in one evening/night..I am saying night also cause they didn't come in till about 10:00 or 11:00...they had worked long after dark. I am afraid I cannot imagine a 3 boys under 25 yrs. of age doing that this day and age...there are probably a few but sure none that I know.  I just remember even back then being so impressed by them doing that.  I don't think Neal remembers it, and not sure about George.  They had did the field there by home...and the field that belonged to my brothers...so I am pretty sure I have the number of bales right.Anyway, when we did have time, we were allowed to roam at will...and like I say we had a big area.  I was going to get a map from google, but in looking I just could not do it justice on here."},

The same crab apple tree I vow to cut down every year, but every year I let it to another year.  Yet it never gives me the blooms that my mom's always had, and even though it is never loaded down with blooms, there are still plenty of the apples to be a mess.We have two chainsaws and both are hard to start...so hard that I cannot start them.  Even Roger has trouble with them.  One is a dream to saw with once it is started...it is balanced just right.  The other was from Sears....and it was always so easy to start till we let someone borrow it.  Ever since then, I have had problems starting it.  Prior to that it was a darn good saw, too, and has cut a pile of wood in our younger years.Anyway, the point of the story is if I had a chainsaw that would start, that tree would have done been down.  I make up my mind to do it, but Roger won't be here when I come to that conclusion.  By the time he is available, I have put it on the back burner to think about a while longer."},

I got all the lights cut to length today...and got most of the 2 inch strips cut from the darks, plus as I cut them, I also cut one of the lengths.  Hopefully will get them cut to length in the next day or two.  I have to cut both the each one into 8 different lengths....so it is time consuming."},

But Roger  loved them and wanted a quilt from them....so I have been collecting  them for a while.  Oh, not all I see by any means but a yard here and  and a half yard there...and maybe a fat quarter or two the next time  around.   I have been looking at different quilt patterns and giving him choices of what he would like made...and today the cutting began.  I am using the log cabin block...but will not show what I am making with it till I am done.  I first began by cutting the 2 inch strips from my lighter fabrics....and even began cutting them to lengths.  But I have a ways to go before they are done.  But the majority of that work is done...at least for the lighter side of the first part of the quilt.Here is just a small sample from my darks...I have also have blues and a green or two and purple....I think I have more darks than I do lights.  But that is okay. It feels good to have the decisions made of what to make....and to have sat down and figured out the sizes I need to cut of everything.  Now if I can just keep from getting distracted and cutting wrong...it s so easy to do sometimes.   Especially when all three cats come down to see if they can help.  I usually use something and mark my ruler, and I very well may do that tomorrow if I get to go back down and work.It is supposed to start raining, so it will be a good day to work.  We are also lonesome for Lorelei...she called me night before last and wanted to come to my house.  Or us to come there.  You just cannot imagine how sweet it is to hear her little voice...and she will talk to her Papaw a minute but then she wants her Mamaw back...oh, and she is still dressing up every day as a pink princess.  I thought the newness of that might wear off but it hasn't.I guess we will see what tomorrow brings...."},

I had thought it was just a worn spot, but happened to catch it in just the right light and seen it is an actual spot that is worn down.  Does that mean the keypad is cheap or does it mean I use this keyboard a lot...I dare say it is the last option. (sorry it is so grainy...and not the best quality...the dent did not show with a flash and had the ISO at 1600, and the shutter speed real slow)***********It was another beautiful day...I just got our heat bill.  It gives the average daily temp or the month plus it gives it for this month last year.  Our average this year is 37ºF....last year it was 24ºF.  Quite a difference I think for this time of year.  If I was not too lazy I would go back and see how long it has been since we had temps like this.I had books to return to the library...I did not want to check any out so just ran them in.  (Kindles are wonderful--I never thought I would live to see the day when I didn't want to go to the library, but I don't now.)  Anyway, we left there and decided to drop by some family, but they were not home.  So we ran to Green Valley and even threw our fishing line in a few times.  No hits, though.  But so nice to be able to do that.It is supposed to change drastically Thursday....and supposed to have some snow.  I don't know if they expect some accumulation or not.  With the weather we have been having, it is hard to imagine any snow at all."},

Just because of the last few days I have spent oodles of time looking for a pattern, among other stuff.  I am talking serious looking time.  And I thought it so appropriate.Then, I realized how much time I was wasting looking for the pie chart.  I have used it before and it  is somewhere on my blog.  So decided to just get to the point and post something...I feel so strange if I don't post a picture of some kind, even if it is unrelated to the post.It is another pretty day here in west central Indiana...I have a quilt hanging on the line to dry.  It is one I keep hanging on a quilt rack, but a certain Bubbie cat goes over and pulls it down, then crawls under it.  I usually keep it pinned till he cannot do that, but for some reason had had it off there, and never put the pins back in.  It needed washed anyway, so took it down and threw it in the washer and put another little one up there.  He has done been over trying to pull it down, but I thought to pin it.I think I am going to go down and sew some spare blocks I have together and make him his own little quilt.  It needs to be big enough for him to crawl under. Well, I am headed down to sew, hopefully I won't get detoured into looking for something else!"},

Supposed to be close to 50º F. today...I had to wash my tennis shoes since I had walked along the sandbar and my feet sank above the top of my shoes.  So I always wash them with towels...figured it would be a good day to hang the out.The cats are wanting us to come outside and play and I am not joking.

So I hit the auto levels button and got the bottom photo...not your greatest photo but it shows the geese better. I always wonder what they have seen in their travels to get here.**************It is supposed to get up in the high 50's today...I am trying to make up my mind if I want to stay home or want to get out and go while the going is good.

Just so hilarious.And remember how I told you she wanted everything pink and wanted a pink princess Barbie...well, how about a pink princess Lorelei...oh, and by the way that is what she calls herself sometimes...Like any good princess, she loves chocolate!!!  I think it so funny, one little taste when she was maybe a year or so old, and she was hooked.  Notice her princess dress came off before she was given the chocolate.She was sick again over Christmas...I don't know if you can tell in these pics...well, the top one was taken January 2....but the other two were at Christmas...I still think it shows in her eyes in the one above.And the one of her in her princess outfit..she did not want me taking pictures--I took the one and she was like 'no more, Mamaw.'

It might have been closer to two years ago.  I had totally forgot making it....it was made with no baby in mind.  I did have a couple girls in mind that I thought might be starting a family sometime in the near future, though.I have a hard time getting a good overall view, so I took a couple pics of it.And here we have the small 4-patch quilt top I have been working on...over the past fall.  I have worked on it here and there...till last week I got serious about finishing it.  It is meant to be just a small quilt for the couch....or maybe a kid.  Who knows.  The 4-patches are 3 1/2 inches square when finished.  And the top itself is 49 inches x 59 inches.We won't tell about the fact that I tried a new pressure foot on my machine...and they were originally going to be 4 inches finished, but due to slight variation in size, I had to resize all the blocks I made.  And we won't tell about the hours I spent ripping out seams the last evening or two.  More ripping out than I normally do in a year...probably even in two or three years.  Not that I don't make mistakes...I usually just catch them before I compound them.I started making the 4-patches from scraps from other projects...then I got into cutting a few squares from older fabrics that I just want to use up.  Still, most of them are from scraps...however the background squares are about half and half.  I think I would have liked it better if I had used one main fabric as the background.  And I will say that I think the pictures make it look prettier than the actual top is.  But usually things grow on me when I quilt them.I need to get another batting or two...I have a queen sized and I have queen sized tops, but I want to quilt some of these small tops, plus I also have one or two that are skimpy full sized tops.After I got this last little top done, I have been working on cleaning up my sewing area, and even went so far as to organize some of my fabric by color.  I think I could spend all day working on getting my fabric organized.  I sure wish I had a place I could organize it all in one spot.  I guess I should consider myself lucky that I even have a place to leave my sewing machines set up."},

It is a finish used by the Navy Seal team....so it should stand up to a lot of wear.  As you can see the blade is approximately 5 inches long.Roger's name is etched in it but you can only see it at a certain angle.The handle is wrapped with parachute cord...it does not slip out of the hand.I think it is one of his best looking knives!**************I have been busy with other things...not sure if I am quite ready to get back to blogging, but thought I would give it a shot tonight.

I am hoping I have time tomorrow night.  But in case I don't, I hope all of you have a Merry Christmas.I also wanted to show a picture of the Christmas tree that I took without the flash...you can still see the Christmas tree skirt.  That is how Bubbie keeps it.  I straighten it and he manages to almost wad it up into a wad.  I straighten it out, and he messes with it again.  I have decided to let him have his way.  I almost put out presents, but have been so glad I didn't.I do not know what is going on with the cats...Bubbie wanted out Saturday sometime around dark.  He was gone for around 24 hours....he is never gone.  For sure not like that.  He will go next door, and every now and then he crosses the street...but he is never gone for long.  Not like his brother who was responsible for a lot of gray hairs.  I really thought something has happened to him.  He had a 'garage' smell when he came in...oh, not strong...I had to get down with my face in his fur to smell it....but feel sure he was locked in a neighbor's garage.  Just don't know which one.Before that he was picking on the other cats, almost tore the tree down.  He was even playing with one of the cat toys by himself, and usually the only time he plays with one is when we have it tied on the end of a fishing line and swing it around for him.Then the Puss Puss has just been into every single thing...and she cries...I honestly think she wants to be a mommy.  I don't know if it is possible for her to have that longing since is spayed, but she will get stuff and carry it around and cry part of the time.  And she has done that lately, but she has also just gotten into everything.  No matter what I am doing, she is there sticking her head in to see if she is missing anything.  I sure know where the saying 'curiosity killed the cat' came from.*************All this time away from blogging and I have not been doing much.  I have spent hours and hours yesterday evening and this evening/night looking for a pattern.  I feel like i am always looking for something.And I was  looking through a lot of my fabric....and I found a baby quilt top that I totally forgot about making.  And it has not been that long ago at all that I made it.  If I had not run across it I would never have remembered it.  I will have to take a picture of it next week if I can remember.Roger has made another knife...I will be showing it sometime in the near future.  It is one of the best looking so far.I need to get to bed...oldest daughter and I plan to make cookies tomorrow...just what I need.  Something I can't resist.  I think we are just making three or four kinds.  Anyway, I need to get to bed till I can get some sleep...***************Lorelei is wanting everything pink for Christmas.  We do not know where she came up with that....she wants a pink princess outfit, a pink Barbie, a pink car, and I don't remember what all else she wants.

We were gone at least an hour and a half or two and came back through there, and they were bedded down at the edge of the field.  There is a house that sits at one end of the field...I don't know if it is 100 yards away even....**************I got my living room windows washed today...actually I did the one the tree sits in front of before I put the tree up. However, I am in a pickle now.  The drapes I use, I washed...they are the type that has the rubbery white coating on the back...I cannot think of the word for that for the life of me.  Now, I have washed these drapes numerous times...and they are old.  But the ones in here in the dining room look good as new.  Two pair in the living room look basically new. Not the other set.  When I went to take it out of the washer...it was stuck to itself.  I don't know how to explain it other than that.  And when I pulled it apart it pulled the back coating off.  Just the one pair.  I have no idea why.  So, now I need to go find something new.  And have I told you how long I have been looking.  I even thought one time, well, I will just spend whatever it takes and get what I want.  I couldn't find anything I actually liked.So, I have put them back up for now, till no one can see in.

Her headdress is her own doing....and she was real proud of it.She loves to play pretend...sometimes she will play and play by herself...she will have the characters just chattering away to each other.Other times she wants one of us to pretend with her.  I have to admit, I do not have near the imagination that she does.This is her little smile she gives every time we tell her to smile.She ran to get her Barbie to show us some time after we got there...it is a Princess Barbie.  She told me the crown was broken.  Jeremy told her to tell me who broke it....she looked at me and told me, \"Papaw broke it.\"  As serious as she could be...and he said no I didn't and she argued and argued with him that he broke it and it was the first time he had seen it.Then, another time she was climbing in my lap, and I did not even touch her...she looked at me and told me \"You hurt me.\"  There were several other incidents of her saying things like that....so, I think her imagination is working over time.Oh, and she wants everything pink for Christmas...she wants a pink princess dress and pink shoes, and pink doll house, and I forget what all she wants, but it is a long list and everything has pink for the color.  She was first talking to me on the phone the night before we went...Sarah told her to tell me everything she wanted...so she started with pink car, pink princess, etc...and each time she said pink she changed her voice to this high sort of screaky voice.I am here to tell you, I have not laughed so much in so short of a time as the past couple of days.  She is like her mom was in that the more you laugh at her, the more she will try to make you laugh.*************Computer question now to any of you that might have a clue.I have a little netbook that I keep downstairs with my sewing, and it also goes with me to Sarah's now.  Does anyone have any idea why I cannot post to my blogs on it.  And more than half the time I cannot post a comment to blogs from Blogger...I can post okay to wordpress or typepad blogs...just most of the time not to Blogger blogs.  I think I can occasionally but it is so rare that I even wonder if I ever have...maybe I just thought it posted and click out of the window before realizing it didn't post.And when I try to do a post on it, I can usually save it...I just cannot publish from it....this is just so weird.  I thought the first time it happened that it was just instance of blogger being messed up, but now I think there is something about my computer to change, but I cannot think what.

When they got to them Jackson said, \"Ride 'em, Cowboy!\"This is not from tonight.  It is from another night we ran through the strip pits...but not a night I have shown.  Who cares either way...there is very seldom a night that isn't beautiful out there....if I will just have the patience to wait for it to come.********************So, we went Christmas shopping...got the majority of the rest of it done.  I done had Lorelei's done as well as her daddy's, but that was all.  Now the major portion of my shopping is done, and this is one tired gal. It is strange...I do have trouble knowing what to get for people, but still, I enjoy Christmas shopping.  The mall was not crowded today, and everyone I ran into or almost ran into, or who almost ran into me...we were all on our best behavior and smiled, apologized, and went on.  That is easier to do when it is not crowded.  Though, most times now, I make up my mind before I leave that that is how I am going to act.It seems to me, even if you treat an old grouch the way you want to be treated, that they will respond in kind. Now mind you I am not bragging....not by any means.  I still have to fight frustration when I get behind two people that manage to take up what is room for four-six people to walk.  People that are walking so slow but are weaving so bad you are afraid to try to pass....then you realize they are moving so slow that if you time it right you can zoom on through.You just know they are wondering along, thinking about who all they have left to buy for, and trying to make up their mind what to get.

But I didn't want to make The Bubbie get up, but Roger came in and it startled him so he jumped up on his own.  By the time I got out there a cloud or two was passing through and I missed some of the best light.  But at least I got some.The nuthatch flitted in and out so quick it was hard to get a photo of it at all...not sure if it is only one or if there are more than on.The tufted titmouse was slower showing up than the other birds...but eventually there were two or three of them at the feeder...I don't know if the cardinal had been there earlier and i missed him, or if this was taken on his first visit...he did not stay long.I sit at my computer and cannot do anything on it because I am so preoccupied with the birds.  The minute I put my camera down, the red-bellied woodpecker came but he flew with my slightest move.

But that is beside the point.I did manage to wash a couple windows today...we have the kind that flip in but with my shoulder I have not been able to do it.  I was just going to use a ladder today, but decided to give it the old college try just one more time.  With the advantage of standing on a step stool, I was able to get them flipped in and washed, got the curtains/drapes washed and put back up.  Now I should be able to photograph a few birds.  I did put out some birdseed for the first time in quite a while...a red- bellied woodpecker was out there in less than 10 minutes.  I expected the house sparrows, but was amazed when I looked out and saw him hanging upside down.  I hope that he is a sign of good things to come.I have did a couple other loads of laundry, and have made a few more little 4-patches.  I am getting ready to sit here and count how many I have if I can wrap my mind around it.  I am in the mood to get it done and move on to something else.

If we get sunshine, I will dance for joy....at least in my mind.I have not done much today...Roger had to run to Walmart so I ran with him and picked up a couple things...one of which was a sketchbook.  I cannot draw a straight line without a ruler, but I still wanted one to jot down ideas I have.  The only thing is, I need one that I keep near my chair, one near my desk, and one down in the basement. I also ran to the library to get some 'how to' books...that was all I got.  I do not need any other books to read.  I have enough on my kindle to last me a year.

We saw a couple of the owls right away...both not even close to being within distance for the camera.  We eased on along, not seeing anything for a bit...then we started seeing deer.By the time we had passed all the way through, I am sure we saw probably 25 deer, at least.  The last place we saw them was just as we left the place. I could determine some were bucks, but couldn't determine the size of their racks due to it being so late and almost dark and they happened to blend in with the background so well.I could see this fellow, though...but it was still too late for my camera to get a good capture...this was totally black till I hit the button 'auto levels' in photoshop elements.  With that being said, I hope he shows on your computer.These two country cats we saw while on a drive the other day...the black one ran across the road in front of us...he kept watching the one below.Soon, we were stopped to photograph a barn...and in front of that barn was a pasture.This horse was one of I don't know how many....I am not saying there was a lot...just saying all I saw at first was him and another one, but as we went on I saw at least a couple more.  I think they are all much loved horses, cause they kept nickering to me...and this one started up the hill two or three times, convinced that I had something for him.  How I wish I had...*******************I spent over three hours in the basement yesterday...doing laundry while I messed with my sewing.  I did some more cutting and sewing....so much fun.  It makes things feel back to normal for me.  I want to go down in a bit and see what else I can do....I have been cleaning off a desk...does anyone else have clutter control problems?  I sure do.  Seems like I have so much stuff I want to keep, or maybe just afraid I will need it. Then there is the problem of books...even though I have went through my books till I just have just kept my very favorites, I still have plenty.  I keep debating on whether I want to buy new books for my kindle or buy kindle editions of my favorites...I did buy the kindle edition of Giants in the Earth by Rolvaag.  When Roger and I got married, he had an old copy of it...I finally got around to reading it and it is one of  my favorite books of all time.  I read it every few years.I look at it as I can buy stuff I am not sure I will like, or I can buy old favorites that I know I will enjoy reading again."},
{"title": "Time for catching up...", "date": "Saturday, December 3, 2011", "text": "So, I have not been in a blogging mood here of late...just had things on my mind and things I wanted to do....and reading.  Not sure if the kindle was a wise gift or not.  I just want to read and read and read. Then, I really got thrown off track last weekend...Sunday night to be exact.  And I have debated on whether to tell this or to keep silent...but wanted to explain part of my absentness this week.I discovered a lump....yeah, one of those.  Quite by accident.  Sunday night, after Roger had gone to bed.  The lump was on the same side I had a stereotactic biopsy in 2007.  Which was negative for cancer, I might as well add.Well, we were heading to a hand to-shoulder doctor Monday morn for a knot that Roger had on the underside of his wrist...right where his hand joins to the wrist.  So, I did not say anything to him...just went on with him...it was just a ganglion cyst and the doctor drained it right there in the office, and we were on our way.  We did a couple stops, and came home, and I called to get a mammogram.  Got it set up for Thursday....still didn't tell Roger.  Stuff like that just really worries him...Then Tuesday morn, they call me about the mammogram...since I had had the biopsy, I had to see the doctor and get orders for a diagnostic mammogram.  So, I called the doctor's office and got in Wednesday....I did tell Roger what was going on then.   The nurse practitioner didn't really read me the riot act like I was afraid of...not when she remembered all that had been going on in the past year or two.They were able to reschedule me for the mammogram on Thursday, just an hour later than I had originally been scheduled...and scheduled an ultrasound at the same time.  They are over and done with...it is only cysts...the one I found is about the size of a quarter and there are at least a couple more about the size of a pea.I don't think I  will let anything slow me down from getting those mammograms now...I felt so dumb that I had put it off for so long.  It could have turned out so different.  I want to encourage all women to schedule their own mammogram.  And to follow through with whatever the doctor tells them.I am heading down to the basement to sew a little bit and try to get back to feeling normal...will probably try to catch up with everyone later tonight."},
{"title": "Strip pit report....", "date": "Thursday, December 1, 2011", "text": "I haven't been going to the strip pits as much as normal, and when I have, there hasn't been much to report.  Most times I have been lucky to see anything at all.  I think it has been due to the time I am out there...I have either hit it too early or too near dark.  Last night was different.I had barely got to the first pond that is right near the entrance, when on in the distance I saw a Northern Harrier...I raced down to try to catch it.  Then there were what I took to be three of them....they had moved on farther from the road and where swooping and circling...and just moving all the time.  It did cross my mind that one was definitely darker than the others, and bigger...but I didn't give it a thought that the two smaller ones were owls till I downloaded the photos.  You will probably have to enlarge this to even see the birds.The birds drifted even farther away--I headed on down the road, but no more than started, till I noticed the two deer above....they were too far away to get a good shot, and started retreating soon as I headed their way.  I passed a small pond that had swans on it, but they were too far away to get a good shot... I went on to the biggest pond near the road....water covered the road there and was a little deeper than I wanted to venture across, though I really think it would have been fine.  It isn't like it is flowing....it just gets up and stands in the road.I turned around, and headed back from the direction I came...when I got back to where I first saw the Northern Harrier and the other two birds,  there were the owls!  The short-eared owls--there was four right there, they swoop and fly low to the ground while they hunt.  Now two of these did light on the ground...not like they were catching something, but they just set and looked all around...I saw four right there, and then two more on down the way....so they are back in full force.  I did go back to the entrance, turned around and drove back to where the water was across the road in hopes of seeing one sitting on a fence post, but no such luck.  I did see more deer however....though I lost count.  Oh, it was not 20 or 30, or any number like that...but thinking along the lines of 10-12...There was actually a 3rd deer with these, but didn't get a good picture that showed it because it blended in so well with the background.  And I think these are the two that are in the other photo above of deer...they are in the same place where I saw them.There were also a few geese, and then there was flocks of some other type of duck...with as small as they were, they were too far away to get a decent picture of...there were about 3 different flocks in the air...each one probably having at least 100...and a few little groups of 6 or 8 or 10 'ducks.'It was sure good to see some wildlife once again..."},

She wanted us to come over or her to come here. Then her mom got on the phone talking to me...and she had to think.  She knew there was something else she wanted to tell me.  Something that Lorelei had done.  Finally she thought of it:  They have a friend visiting them...he had been gone.  Well, Sarah was doing laundry--she was sitting in the living room folding a basket when he came in.  Well, there is this step down into that room, so he just sat down there talking to her and Jeremy.Well, Sarah had a sports bra laying in the bottom of the basket...Lorelei ran and grabbed it and put it on, then turned around to their friend and called him by name, and said \"don't touch my boobies!\"  Told him that a couple times...which of course it set Sarah off to laughing and she just totally stunned her dad.

It was misting most of the time we were out, and I wonder how these will ever get dry.Speaking of laundry, I probably need to go do a load or two of my own.  And I have not touched my sewing today, so will either sew or cut some squares.  It is amazing how much can be done with just a few minutes here and there.  While talking to my brother last night, I cut quite a few squares...I cannot hear to talk on the phone while sewing, so cutting is all I can do.I may not be blogging much the next few days...have seriously been considering taking a long blog break just to try to concentrate on other things.  So, if I don't, don't worry, there is nothing wrong...just wanting to do other things."},
{"title": "Etc.", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2011", "text": "Tip:  The other day a friend wrote me that she was having trouble viewing the image of the scanned plover story.   So I told her to right click on the image, and then click to view in a new tab or view in a new window. She then made the comment in my comments about it working, and from the result I saw that that was a new tip for some. But, this not only works with pictures in blogger, if you are shopping on line, reading an article with a link somewhere else, and get tired of going back and forth between windows and having to wait for one to reload, you can always right click on any link, and click to view in another tab or another window.  If you have a slower internet connection, or a page has a lot of images to reload when you go back to it, this can really save time. ************************Since I keep talking about the 4-patches I have been making, I went down and took a few pictures..and yes you can right click and chose to view in a new window or tab if you want to see the full sized image.I think I have made 112 of them so far....they are 4 inch unfinished.  I was making them to be 4½ inches, but was trying out a new pressure foot on my machine.And though it is really operator error, enough of them were just a couple or three threads under the 4½ inches till I cut them all down to just 4 inches square..I have been playing and playing with my computer program, called Electric Quilt 6, or commonly called EQ.  It allows me to play with quilts before I ever even touch fabric.  But I am more apt to go down and start making a bunch of quilt blocks, then come up to play with the quilt program to decide how I want to arrange them. I started out using scraps of fabric left over from other projects, but have also been adding a few others.  I started out cutting 2½ inch squares from the scraps...I cut and cut and cut.  For each 4-patch it takes four of the little squares, and that makes over 400 I have cut just for the finished 4-patches.This is some that I still have to sew together.  And who knows, I may end up cutting out more s2½ in. squares...************It is rainy and dark and dreary here....just the perfect day to go down and sew.  The cats are all quiet, but you can bet money that Bubbie had me up before daylight.  I wish you could feel just how heavy he feels when he walks on me in the wee hours of the morn...it actually hurts enough till I am sort of amazed that I am not bruised."},

I was trying to visit a few blogs this morn, and ran into A Funny Deer Tale...I thought it was hilarious.  It remind me of the following post that I did in August of 2008.  Everyone that hears this story and knows Roger, gets a good laugh from it.  We even bring it up when it is just the two of us, and still laugh about it.  so surely between the link above and this one of mine, you will have a smile on your face.So here goes...and keep in mind that it is my husband that it happens to...it was originally calledA Hunting Story...Abraham Lincoln of the  Brookville Daily Photo  wrote a story about one of his hunting excursions.  Being the wife of a hunter and sister to hunters before that, I could identify with a lot he said.  About 5:00 being the witching hour for hunters, or for my husband when he is meeting fellow hunters it is sometimes even earlier.  Also, unlike rotten apples to disguise the human smell, hunters now have doe urine.  I wouldn't want to mistake that for my perfume, now would I, but that is beside the point.This is a story of one of my husband's hunting trips.  A few years ago he decided to hunt out on  property near the orchard where I worked.  It actually belonged to the brother of my boss.  A day or two before the planned hunting trip, he and his buddy went out to decide where they were going to put their tree stands, and in so doing had to hack out a path through some of the undergrowth.On the morning of the hunt, they met here before going out there...it is at the  most 10 minutes from here.  They get out of the truck out there and the farm cat greets them.  It is young, not even a year old.  Roger pets it just a second and he and his buddy proceed down the path...they get to the  'y' in the path and his buddy goes one way while he goes they other.  The cat follows my husband.He is hunting with bow and arrows, and hunting from a climbing tree stand.  So he gets to the tree he has chosen to use, and gets his tree stand situated on it and climbs up the tree.  I am not familiar enough with the process to paint a good picture, but it is a tree stand that he does the physical climbing with.  It has two parts....one part is the actual seat and the other is the part he stands on....THIS is a video from you tube and does show how his works.When climbing up to a tree stand, he always ties his bow to a long rope and once he gets up as high as he is going to go, he pulls the bow up with the rope.  He gets up and gets situated...he hears this meow.  It is still practically dark, so he kind of looks but doesn't see anything.  He sits back, and he hears it again!  And he can hear it so plain...he does not have the best of hearing.  So he gets his flashlight out and bends way over the tree stand while shining it all around and still doesn't see anything.He sits back again and hears it again!  And he felt something on his legs...he looks down at his feet and there sits the kitty!  It had sat by his feet as he climbed up the tree.  It proceeded to climb up into his arms, purring all the while, and doing the rubbing thing that cats do when they are happy to see you.  He held it out at arm's length and dropped it!Did it run for home you might ask.  The answer would be no.  It played around the bottom of the tree my husband was in, chasing leaves or anything else that caught it's imagination.  After a while of playing, it climbed out onto a dead log and went to sleep!This is an honest tale; I don't have the imagination to make something like this up.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg--things like this continually happen to my husband, my older daughter, and my husband's cousin."},

{"title": "For Jackson", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "text": "I have been waiting to show you the project I just finished a few days ago...I was sending it to my little nephew Jackson and wanted to wait till he got it before I posted it.I did not have plans to make this...in fact I had plans for something entirely different.  But in going through my fabric shelves, I ran across the animal flannels.  I had made Roger a rag quilt with them...which is another story entirely.The minute I saw the fabric, I knew I had to do something with it for Jackson.  He will be two years old next month, and gets so excited by anything to do with hunting, going 4-wheeling,  and Santa Claus.  I just had to throw the part in about Santa Claus.  But it is the truth....he L-O-V-E-S Santa.I knew it would be the frayed edge style, or rag quilt.  I first cut bunches of squares, paired them together with no batting between, and sewed them together.  A BIG bunch of them together.  I did not like that...thus I ended up sitting ripping out a LOT of stitching.I also decided sometime during all of it, that I didn't have near enough fabric...even for a toddler's quilt.  So, I ended up buying about three more yards of fabric.  I proceeded to cut it all up in 6½ inch squares.  As I cut I made the decisions of which fabrics I wanted to go to the back and which to the front.  after cutting the fabric, I cut batting in a smaller size...then paired a fabric for the front with a fabric for the back, sandwiched the batting in between, and sewed an 'x' across it.  I did them all at once.I sat and counted how many squares of each fabric I had...then set with graph paper and decided how to arrange the blocks.  Then the stitching the blocks together began....contrary to most sewing, the seams are supposed to be on the front with the rag quilts.  The first row of blocks I sew.ed, I sewed just the opposite of that...actually I sewed it twice.  Cause each of the seams from this point on are sewn double...for strength.After a couple evenings of concentrated sewing, the above is the result.  This is after it is washed and dried.  It is all soft and snugly.  And below is the back of the quilt...It finished about 44 x 55 inches....so hoping Jackson will get use from it.  I really think he will like all the animals. He has done been 'shooting' deer....when he was in the stores earlier last month I think it was, and he saw Santa's reindeer, he would 'shoot that', this after going through the store yelling  HO! ho! ho! and hollering for Santa throughout the store.  Then at Cracker Barrel where they have a deer head mounted, he 'shot that,' too.I finished it Tuesday I think it was, washed it twice with color catchers, and to fray the edges, dried it, and put it in the mail Wednesday...."},

Apple picking started at the end of August and ended the last of October, or first week of November, but there was still grading to be done. Part of it was that more trees matured and there was actually more work to do, so I had a reason to be tired.I have been looking at things for the toot....got one thing picked out but cannot decide about what else.  I have no idea what I am getting for anyone else, either.I did see something for my older daughter, but on closer inspection it was one of those special care deals....so I didn't get it.  Does anyone else get tired of those items of clothing that say hand wash and lay flat to dry...or even just the lay flat to dry part.  Who has room to lay everything out flat to dry anyway?So, what is on your Christmas wish list?"},

I have considered two or three options other than this.  And both of them are still possibilities.  But I went out to the strip pits this evening, and was leaving them by this one road I have only been on one time...and that was coming home from the opposite direction I was going tonight.So tonight, nothing at all was moving out at the area, so I thought I would head over into Illinois to see what I could see.  I had not more than started down the road and there was a sign for the Shirley Cemetery.  It almost looked like a long private drive, but down it I went and found this little cemetery. I have been telling Roger for a year now, at least, that out there at the strip pits is the only place I really want my bones to lay.  His cousin has property out there, that actually has a little cemetery on it...but they are old and just maybe a dozen or so graves there.  I did not want to ask him for such a big favor.These are some views...you just feel like you are away from everything.It was not deep woods by any means, but it was pleasant.This big old maple tree was out near the entrance  of the actual cemetery...not at the beginning of the lane.  I wish i had taken a shot looking down that lane...you would see why it looks so inviting.And there was this little chipmunk chirping because I was there.....I do not know who to get in touch with to find out who runs it, but I really want to find out if there are burial plots left!  It would be a weight off my mind to have that settled. Now some might think I am nuts to be worrying about this now, but it would be so nice to have it settled.  It sounds crazy, but I am just thrilled to have found this place."},

Literally nothing as far as accomplishments. Oh, wait, I did need check registers since the place we get our checks quit supplying them.  I had been playing on the computer beforehand, so when I realized I did not have one anywhere, I proceeded to find some on-line.  That led to e being at Amazon which is a real no-no for me.  I cannot go there without looking at books.  I always click on non-fiction, because I have a thing about buying nonfiction.  Not sure why....but I cannot remember the last time I bought a non-fiction book.  It was probably a Stephen King book for my older daughter.  So, looking at books sometimes leads me to looking at Kindles...which happened today.  I half way think about getting one, but then think do I really need it.  I decided to download the app for PCs.  Let me tell you, that may have been a BIG mistake...besides libraries starting to have some books for Kindles, there is the Project Gutenberg ....then there is Amazon itself.  I had glanced before at what they had available, but let me tell you, now that I have spent some time at it, I am in hog heaven.  And it is free stuff!   I probably could not find a lot of them in actual book form, and one I downloaded I noticed was $30 to buy.  And it is non-fiction stuff, which is even better.  First hand accounts of pioneers.    Oh, I have downloaded some fiction...but am afraid I will be tempted to look for books more than I read..***********Then a friend of mine, Carletta, almost lost a few month's worth of photos.  So we have been talking about online storage...I have thought about it for a long time but continue to put it off.   Has anyone else used on-line storage....for anything.  I would just want it for my photos..  I have looked at Carbonite and at Mozy...it is very tempting since I know that some of them do it automatically every time you are on the internet.  I would still want them backed up on my own external hard drives.  And that just now led me to remembering I can make a back-up copy of my blogs...maybe I should look into that. Anyway, one thing has led to another and I have not done much.  Oh, I did come down here to download the kindle app on my netbook, and I did sew a few lines..."},

The above photo was taken day before yesterday, but it looked just about the same yesterday and today.  Though it wasn't actually raining here when we left home this morn, by the time were up the road a few miles, it was misting rain.   It is the Covered Bridge Festival in Parke County this week...we have been to different places on three separate days.  The first day was a useless trip...I had a horrible headache when we left home and it did not improve, so we no more than got there till we just came home.  That was Monday and it was a pretty day...that was why we attempted to go that day. Tuesday we went to Rockville in the misting rain....they have a big tent set up with several vendors in it.  Among them was the gourd lady...I bought half a dozen from her.  I think I will make birdhouses out of one or two, and give the others to Sarah to paint.  The gourd lady is a fun lady to talk to.   We have been by her farm  numerous times but have never stopped...I am thinking the next time we will. But back to the focus of this post....we ventured farther north today to what is usually a big flea market.  As I said earlier, not raining here when we left, but did not get very far from home till it started misting.  We continued on, knowing that some would not be open.  The bottom line is that hardly any vendors were open....I found a couple books for light reading and Roger found a few little things he could use in his shop. I could not help but think how thankful I was to have a car that had heat, and how thankful to come home to a warm house with warm, running water.  I almost always think about these things when I am out in cold nasty weather...and think about what it must have been like to be traveling in covered wagons and no place to really get away from the cold and rain.     As we came home we stopped by the grocery and got the fixings for a big pot of vegetable soup....my house smells soooo good right now.  I wish we had scratch and sniff applications for our computers.  I think I am going to go up and have a bowl...then come back down to my sewing. I leave you with one of my favorite barns near here...I snapped this on the way home today."},

It has been rather chilly the entire day and I don't think it has stopped raining the one single time.  Everything is dripping water.  The cats want out, we open the door for them--sometimes they go on out and others they start out, pause and sniff and look and feel...they turn around and go back inside.  If they do go outside, they want back in before 20 minutes pass.  They have us so well trained...I have spent a big part of the day with fooling with fabric and with sewing.  I did sit with graph paper and started figuring on how to arrange the colors.  I was dreading that part, but don't know why.  It is just squares of fabric...but I am working with a limited amount.

When I was there last week, I also saw the Northern Harrier above.  Not a very good shot.  This is a cropped portion of the original.  He was all the way down at the other end of the pond...and seemed to be fishing.  He even sat perched on a dead tree for a while...one that stuck up out of the water.Then at the other end of the area...actually over in Illinois, I saw these three turkeys...this is a regular farm field.  I don't know if it was originally part of the mining area or not.  If it was, it has been back in regular use for a long while.  It always has soy beans or corn planted here.  And when the crops are down, or before they grow very tall, if we go by there in the evening, there is almost always deer or turkeys there.The two deer above were in the same field, only 2 or 3 weeks prior to the shot of the turkeys.  The past few times I have been out there, I have not been seeing near as many deer as I always have before.  Go Here and scroll down to see how numerous they were a couple years ago."},

I really have no idea what it was used for...but it reminded me of the little house I showed here.Even though the fence could have used some TLC, the barn was well taken care of.

The rest were taken at the strip pits this evening..Every fall I look forward to the birds gathering together...even though I look forward to it there is an element of sadness about it for me.  I don't know why.   And every time I see them, I think 'a gathering of spirits.' They also make me think of that Norman Rockwell's The Gossips....chattering back and forth and getting all excited over nothing.They came and went from this dead little tree as long as I sat there...which was only 5 minutes or so...but were still coming and go when I left.As I was about to leave the place,  down the road there was another gathering...a big gathering.  Even if you enlarge it, I don't know if you will realize they are having a great time in a mud puddle!  That is what the mist is....They would leave in waves and come back in waves...so much fun to watch.Now the photos below definitely have to be enlarged...not because they are so good, but because there were two bald eagles out there!  I saw one from a distance and flew down the road to try to arrive at the strip pit it was headed for but before I got there I saw another one fly up from the pond...and if you haven't guess by now I did not make it in time to get a shot while they were close to the road.   The one I first saw was not even flapping its wings....he was just gliding for the strip pit....I was flying down the road with the dust boiling behind me--I know I had to be going 50-60 mph...just thankful nobody else was out there.  Still, by the time I got there and got slowed down they were at the far end and circling and rising to move on out.But I did get proof that I saw them...I drove around a while hoping they would come back...I did see them way, far away but they never came back near me.

It now consists of over 9,000 acres and has over 120 lakes. I don't know why I chose to photograph this one...probably because it was all the dead trees, etc.  It had atmosphere.I bet in warmer weather it is teaming with wildlife...for some reason I imagine lots of turtles here.  We normally have our fishing poles in our vehicle at all times, but had taken them out when we went to Sarah's last weekend and had not put them back in.  I regretted that all day long.  We did not see near all the lakes, but we sure saw some pretty ones.  And lots of them looked like ideal places to fish.  I am thinking I will be wanting to head back down there before cold weather hits.**************Just a little note here...I bet I spent at least two hours ripping out sewing that I did.  It didn't have to be done....but I decided to do something different.  I think that is the most ripping out I have ever done.

My friend, Mary, had went to Goose pond and told me about her trip.  I had been anxious to go, so today was the day.We saw plenty, but all at a distance.  I saw a few frog's peeping up from the depths...but not a single one along the banks.We saw several egrets, with this being the only one within shooting distance.  I watched and watched for him to catch something all to no avail.  Plus we were watching for this bald eagle...and he came close, but not close enough for a good picture.  It was a juvenile.  Still, it was very exciting to see it.There were lots of blue herons, and a couple cormorants, and a couple other birds.  Just so frustrating that all except this egret were too far away.  I told Roger I would love to take his hunting blind down there and set it up and see if things would come close with us sitting in it.This is from today...I should have kept a copy of the original...to show you...I just hit auto levels to get this till you could see the milkweed seeds in flight.  I don't care how old I get to be, I will love shaking them loose to fly on the wind...in this case Roger shook them loose for me to try to capture.************The past couple days prior to today, I have spent a lot of time in my basement.  And should I admit that a lot of the time has been spent looking for things...namely two or three different fabrics?    I found one of them right where I first looked...it had just got squished down between two others...but I didn't find it till I had looked through every other place.  Does anyone else lose things like this?In finding the one fabric, I thought of another fabric that I had not seen in all the searching...I did not go back looking again.

Sarah had a job to go to on Saturday morn early, and didn't want to have to get Lo up early....plus they wanted to go out Saturday night. We just got home a bit ago...was a beautiful drive.  I haven't got everything even put away.  We had had a power outage while gone.  So have got the clocks reset...but that is about it.  The Colts are on, so we are just ignoring everything till it is over."},

We happened upon this fence...it brought a smile to my face immediately.   If you will look closely, down towards the barn, there are birdhouses on several of the fence posts.We are going to be busy Friday and Saturday so may not be making any comments...but should be back in action Sunday night I think."},
{"title": "Heron County Park", "date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2011", "text": "Heron County is the name of the place...not the county it is in.  It is in Vermilion County, Illinois..notice their Vermilion only has one 'l' and Indiana's Vermillion has two.  But that is beside the point.  We happened across this place quite by accident.  It has an eagle viewing tower and this wetland boardwalk.Much to our sorrow not a single thing was moving, but it was a beautiful day, and there was all these water lilies.  I think they look like they are saying 'take me to your leader.'I can't wait to go back there another day...it was so windy that day not even butterflies or dragonflies were moving.  I have a feeling in wetter times that it is teaming with wildlife.*********************I spent the day in the basement...made a pair of pillowcases to go with the quilt I posted yesterday.  Not sure, but may get it in the mail tomorrow.  I sent my daughter pics and she liked how it looks..I am looking for ideas for my next quilt...not that I don't have a million.  I am looking for ideas on how to use a specific fabric I have.  So far no luck...but I will force myself to keep looking."},
{"title": "Photo overload", "date": "Monday, October 3, 2011", "text": "I could not decide on just a couple photos so am giving you lots of choices...you can click and enlarge any of them.This is the quilt I have been working on forever it seems like...it is for my older daughter.  In fact, she bought the fabrics at least a couple years ago.  I thought the original plan was for her to come here and us work on one together...instead her life got awfully busy.  And ours was pretty full for a time, too.  So the fabric just sat.After designing a couple or three different quilts in Electric Quilt, and showing them to my daughter, she chose this design.  It is basically a Double Irish chain, only in a real Double Irish Chain, the blocks that are almost all tans here would be one fabric.    And there is a difference in the choice of dominant fabric placement....and a couple other differences that doesn't make much difference anyway.This quilt is machine pieced...and machine quilted.  Free-motion quilted.  That means I drop the feed dogs on my sewing machine, and put a special foot on the machine, and I feed and guide the quilt sandwich...I have to try to keep my foot pedal speed in sync with how fast I move the quilt under the needle, all while following the design.  If I move too fast, while sewing too slow, I will have long stitches.The reverse of this is if I move the fabric slow, but put the pedal to the medal, the stitches are one right on top of the other...and impossible to rip out.  There are not very many stitches that are too long, however it would be impossible to count the times  I sewed too fast for the speed I was moving the fabric under the needle...but at least those don't really hurt anything.I forget where I found the fleur de lis...I took it and had it enlarged, then used poster board to make a stiff pattern that I could lay on the quilt and trace around to mark the design on the quilt.  Let me tell you, that was time consuming, plus after it was done the markings were hard to see.If you will enlarge this and notice the fleur de lis on the edge, you will see it is a bit different from the others.  I had to redesign it to fit the space.  The other fleur de lis go into the adjoining blocks a little bit...The above photo is after it was washed and dried.  It started as 87 1/2  inches.  Quilting causes a little bit of shrinkage in size...but should have been much on this since there is not a lot of quilting.  But I washed and dried it in the dryer because that is how it will be dried from now on...and its final finished size was 82 inches square.  The batting said 3% shrinkage...but I don't prewash my fabrics either so some shrinkage there."},
{"title": "Possum grapes and grapevines....", "date": "Sunday, October 2, 2011", "text": "A week or two ago, coming home from the strip pits, I noticed these wild grapes.  We called them possum grapes when we were kids...they are about the size of a big pea...some might be a bit bigger but not by much.  I don't know about my brothers and sisters, but I always had to eat just a few of them.  Were they ever tart! I did not taste these, but I used to see them at the edge of the orchard and I would try them every now and then.  I don't know if they were filled with seeds when I was a kid and I didn't notice, or if I caught them earlier than the ones I tried a few years ago.  The ones at the orchard were so full of seeds that there was basically no taste to them.And then there are the vines they grow on...they will get huge if left alone.  At least 2-3 inches in diameter if not a little more.  When kids, we usually had one somewhere that we would go and swing on.  We would cut it off, and give a few test pulls on it to make sure it was not going to pull loose from the trees...almost always they were on the side of hill.Either before I was born, or before I was old enough to remember, one of my sisters swung out and the vine broke with her.  It swung way out and was long drop to the ground...it is a wonder she was not seriously injured.  Heck, come to think about it, with the things we done it is a miracle that at least one of us was not seriously hurt or killed by some fool stunt like that. Years later when I was probably 10 or 12, we had a grapevine swing just over from our house that swung out over the creek...a friend of the family was at our house...Leonard was about as close to family as you can get without there being a blood tie.  Anyway, it was up in the day and I still wonder what he and my brothers were doing over at the creek at that time of day since there was always work to be done.  Anyway, apparently I was following them.   He decided to swing out on that grapevine.  We had not tested it that summer....he swung out and it broke with him.  It wasn't a big creek and not a big drop, but I can still see him landing on the gravel bar and laying there just a second before getting up.Another summer when my nephew was spending the summer with us...the nephew that is the same age as me...we decided to go find a grapevine to make a grapevine swing.  Well, it was a ways to where we went...probably a mile, give or take a little bit.  It was up on the side of ridge...not all the way to the top.  We swung a few times I am sure...I don't remember if it started to rain or if we just suddenly knew it was going to rain.We headed home and before we even got close, it was pouring the rain....the way I remember it, it was one of those times it was raining so hard you couldn't see very far.  We were soaked to the bone before we even got close to home.  We had to cross a barbed-wire fence, then there was creek to cross.  Normally we walked this log across...not this time...we just hit the creek running.I don't know if there was thunder and lightening...I don't remember being afraid at all.  I just remember laughing and the water running off us.  And don't remember mom being upset at all."},

We did find an Illinois heron viewing station, but not one single thing was there...at least  not in the wildlife department.***************I was relieved to hear that several of you have the same troubles with followers posts not showing in your viewer....I thought I was the lone ranger in that department.  I am not glad you are having the same thing happen, yet I am glad I am not alone.Now to something new...as most of you know I have Time Stand Still on a totally separate account.  The other day I had posts scheduled and wanted to change the view date of a couple...I could not change that....I could access the post, but when I changed the post date, and clicked publish nothing happened.  I tried clicking 'Save' and nothing happened.  So, I thought it just a glitch...thought it was not that important.  I thought I would come back to it later, and everything work.Then night before last, I noticed I forgot to change the size of the photo to 640 x 427, and tried to change it...again I could access the editor, but could not change it.  I have tried it on two different computers...one with Vista and one with Windows 7, so I don't think it is my computer.   Any ideas???I have one post scheduled on it for tonight, but haven't had time to see if I can set up any more.  I am wondering will I be able to post anything after the one tonight."},

I was in here in the dining room and Roger said look at this.  I got up and walked over where I could see and here he was all curled around in the basket.  BTW, that is a pillow under him.  A bed pillow.  He is a big boy.Anyway, Roger started to pet him and I told him to wait a minute...he did not move when I took the photo.Then tonight the joke was on me...we have a fridge in the garage and we just put our cases of Coke in it and got get a few when we need them.  Well, I turned on the light out there and here came Bubbie to go out as I went out.  I did not really pay attention to where he went....just made sure he did not run in the garage ahead of me.I got the Cokes and came strolling back down the walk and he rushed out at me from hiding at the end of the garage...I did not drop the Cokes but I did squeal.  I had just totally forgot about him....********************I got the fleur de lis all quilted this afternoon/evening.  Now to think about what to do to fill up the blank spaces on the outside blocks.  I am wanting to get this done till my daughter can have it....plus she wants pillowcases  made. After that I have so much I want to do...and am really in the mood to start a new project.  I need to do more quilting, though.

{"title": "Another fall day...", "date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "text": "Another fall day here in our corner of the world...it has actually been on the cool side all day long.  It was overcast most of the day and even got a sprinkle of rain this evening.  I stayed inside...I think I was outside just a couple of times.Other than that and a friend stopping by, I have been quilting on my quilt.  Not one single fleur de lis is quilted perfectly...but I am hoping once it is washed the mistakes will not be so noticeable...and really, they don't glare at you now unless you look for them.    I have half of them quilted, but then there are 8 blocks that have only 3, and those 8 blocks have one side that I have to design something to fill up the space.This quilt is made up of two different blocks...and the way I am quilting the fleur de lis...the tip of each fleur de lis fits into the block next to it.  That is why only 3 will fit on the 8 blocks on the outside. I am getting anxious to finish the quilting.  I had help this evening...Bubbie came and laid on it the last one I quilted.  He was testing it to make sure it meets his approval.  It is usually Puss Puss that does the serous testing. I should go down and mark some more for me to do tomorrow.  I am pretty sure it takes as long to mark them as it doees to quilt them.****************So, is anyone going to try the Dynamic views with blogger.  I tried viewing my blogs with them, and the one thing I noticed was I did not like the comment form...it was the embedded form.   But maybe if we actually used one of them, that coudl be changed. There was so much about it that I had questions about I am waiting to see someone else use it.  But to be truthful, I was not crazy about any of the views. And does anyone else ever have times where they follow someone, but they don't get the new posts?  I have that happen every now and then with first one person and then another.  Then the other morning, I signed in and none of the blogs I followed were there!  Talk about having my heart sink for just a few seconds....but I hit the refresh button and they showed up.

It takes as long to mark the fleur de lis as it does to sew them..or almost.I am using a variegated/multicolored thread.  It is a personal choice.  I was not sure I would like it so did a sample first and I really like that it shows up.  Part of what shows here is the pencil marking...hoping it comes out in the wash as it always did for my mom.There are other markers out there, but am always afraid I won't get chalk out....plus, if it came off easy, then afraid it would get brushed off before I got the quilting done.  And there is a blue marker...kind of like a magic marker...you have to get it out with plain cold water first, but have heard some people say that the marks come back.  So, didn't want to try that for that reason, but sure would have liked it for others.  The pencil markings are so hard to see..."},

Roger had never tasted one but had heard me talk of them.  He has a new favorite apple now!  They are simply wonderful...sweet and tart and the juice just runs!  Not supposed to be good for baking, but who cares.  They are just a wonderful eating apple.  And yes, they are a cross between a Jonathan and a Red Delicious apple.  And no, I don't like Red Delicious...even when I worked at the orchard, I could not eat them.  If I was test tasting them, I took a bite to see if the sugar was coming in to them, but spit it out, most of the time.  And if I wanted an apple to eat, I would get down and go find another variety.TexWisGirl used the term flurry the other day to describe something...and since then I cannot get it out of my mind totally.  So, out at the strip pits the other day while I was looking through my camera lens trying to decide what kind of water fowl these were, they took flight and I snapped a photo.  It isn't the greatest but I like the feel of action that it gives.  And I love the yellow in the background.These yellow flowers are every place you look...I think they are a type of coreopsis...but please feel free to correct me.  I was hoping to find butterflies or dragonflies on my last vist but all that seemed to be stirring were some bee/bee type insects.  I saw one dragonfly and that was it.Anyway, the flowers blow in the wind till it is near impossible to get a really good shot of them.  That and the fact that I just cannot seem to capture their full beauty no matter what.And every time I see them, I think of a song by Coldplay and wonder if these yellow flowers everywhere are God's version of the song Yellow..."},

It could have been better of course, but but was not as bad as I was afraid it would be.  So, I proceeded to mark a few on the actual quilt.  The first three were along the edge of the quilt and not too bad. Then I did two more late...I decided to quit till I was not so tired.  Just a little bit disappointed in those but hoping once it is washed that they don't look so bad. And all the time I was trying to mark them, Puss Puss was trying her best to help.

Looking for photos from home.  Instead I kept pausing at all the kitty photos...especially the ones of Puss Puss and Cougar II....I have never seen any two cats closer than those two were.They were always piled up together, whether in playing or in rest and relaxation.I lost Cougar just a bit back...and I still really miss him.  So it has been bittersweet seeing all the photos of him.  It also made me wonder if Puss Puss misses him at all...when Bubbie and Mama Cat came to live with us, their closeness seemed to come to a halt....we would just occasionally catches glimpses of them being like they were the first few months we had only them.  But only on rare occasions.I wonder if anyone else feels as I do about photography...I know since digital cameras I take a gazillion pictures compared to what I took with film.  Just because of economical reasons.  Whether I blogged or not, I would still want to go on photography trips every chance I got.  I feel compelled to capture things...things as they are now as well as to capture things that are about to pass away.  I want to leave a record of our time.The one thing I have trouble doing is capturing people in an everyday environment.  That is the one thing I really need to focus on.

We have wanted to get together for along time, but things kept happening on my end that prevented it when it should have been so easy.So today, her husband had to be up this way...she emailed me to see if it was convenient, while apologizing for such short notice.  Well, for us, short notice is almost always best.We talked, and laughed, and showed each other our quilts....I even showed her the part of our basement where I do my sewing.  And let me tell you, that takes nerve, cause it isn't very pretty down there.But it serves its purpose.After that, we headed out to the strip pits...the first thing we saw an eagle up high.  The first time I glimpsed it, the way it turned I saw the sunlight reflect off the white tail feathers...I took pictures but I had forgot to reset my ISO and shutter speed so they are not good at all...see the photo below.  It will enlarge, but let me tell you, it is hardly worth it.Then right as we left the strip pits, we spotted the eagle in the first photo...we only had just a few seconds to snap a couple photos...as it was turning away from us.I think we are both hoping this is the first in a lot of visits..."},

I took this picture of this log cabin a few days ago.  And we are wondering what is going to happen to it...it has a new roof, but doesn't look too well cared for otherwise.  I would give anything to have it...I would love it so!*********Now to the story behind the title of this post.  I have a niece whose dad was in the Air Force...she is a few years younger than me, maybe 3-4 or 5 years younger...cannot really think and too lazy to go look it up.  Due to places her dad got stationed/things he had to do, there were a couple or three times in her life when she lived near us, and one time they even stayed with us a short while.  I think her dad was going to some sort of schooling at that time.Anyway, we were close back then.  We would roam the hills, play in the barn,  play I Spy,and she is the one that played in the hallway at home that I mentioned here...I cannot even think of all we done.  But we did a lot...Now my oldest brother was/is a coon hunter...so he had coon dogs.  I am not sure which dog it was, but he built him a heck of dog house.  It was probably at least 40 inches wide and even longer than that.  It was built for a dog to stay warm in.  It had a peak roof...from floor to peak of roof was probably at least 30-35 inches....and I think the walls were about 24.  You got to understand I am seeing this through a teen-ager's eyes...not real sure of the measurements. Anyway, he built it and for the longest time, none of the dogs would even use it.  They had rather lay on the ground.  So my niece and I used it.  We could just barely fit through the door...had to get down and crawl in....Well, I am not sure where we got the candles, but we would have a candle or two in there, and we would have crackers.  We would toast the crackers over the open flame and kind of scorch it.  At that time, I had a huge wart on my left hand...I would hold the candle till the hot, melted wax would drip and cover that wart.  Hoping to kill it I guess.  Or I would sit and pick at that wart and we would just talk...maybe even try to read.Well, we had made a trip to the neighbor's dump on his farm...I suppose he was trying to fill in that ravine.  It was just their own private place to throw junk.  We found a shiny, gold trophy.  We took that home with us.  We thought it was made of metal...to this day that is sort of embarrassing cause I was old enough to know better.Well, I don't know if it was that day, or another day, but of course we had the bright idea of using it as a candle holder in the dog house.  And we were in there, had the candle going, and just stuffing our mouth as full of crackers as we could...stuff you might expect from a boy but not from girls.The trophy was not made of metal---it was plastic.  The candle burned down to below the rim, and it caught on fire!  We could not blow it out because all we could blow was a few cracker crumbs.  No room for air in a mouth stuffed with crackers!  This was bad.  I grabbed it and headed out the door with it...of course I had to get down and crawl....I remember us bursting out of it and after we got out, we just died laughing....and of course we never told our moms.  I am not even sure if I ever told mine later in life.It is a wonder some of us weren't killed..."},

We decided to meet at Spring Mill State Park in southern Indiana...as you can see by the above photo there was a chance of rain.  Lucky for us, all we had was a few sprinkles.One brother and his wife came up from Tennessee, and the rest of us,  minus one met there before noon.  I got up and made enchiladas this  morn, while Roger loaded the Rav with the other goodies, and we were out the door by 8:30....but it was still close to noon  before we got down there.  We did get behind a tractor for a while in  the rolling hills down that way.  After a bit we were able to  pass and continue on our way.Sarah and Lorelei were able to come....and some other nieces and nephews....one niece I had not seen in years and years.  We all sat and talked and laughed...and talked some more...and discussed books and returned books, and laughed about things that had happened.Lorelei was a little shy at first...she would not even come with me after she seen all the others...she eventually got over it.  She wanted Sarah to come to Mamaw's house, but Sarah did not bring clothes for her....but I keep hearing 'want to go to Mamaw's house' over and over in my mind.

{"title": "Pulling fence posts....", "date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011", "text": "NOTE:  this is not us...just a you tube videoWe have been taking down a section of old fence between the house and the garage.  I think that was about 6 fence posts....and this is the method we used.  Our posts were in the ground farther, but it worked like a charm. The chain is wrapped around the post down close to the ground, the tire is placed in front of the post and the chained pulled up over it and over to the hitch on the truck.  Roger held the chain in place over the tire while I eased and took the slack out.  When it was tight on it, Roger moved away and I put the pedal to the medal and out they popped.One gave us trouble, and we had to leave it while we removed the rest of the posts...then when we could pull from a different direction it popped right out, too.  It was in the ground at least 3 feet. It was so heavy Roger had to use the chainsaw and cut it into pieces to load it in the truck.  When he started that chainsaw...you just cannot imagine how it was music to my ears.  And the smell!  Brought back so many happy memories of working at the orchard.  I remember at first being so afraid of cutting out stuff, afraid I was hurting the trees...then it got till I felt like an artist at work pruning and cutting out branches. Other than sometimes being out in the bitter cold, I did like pruning.  Actually I liked almost everything I did there...except making cider.  And even that was just the noise...the job itself was not bad.Anyway, we are glad to have it this job done...not sure what I am putting back, if anything.  It is another job for another day."},

I never tire of looking to see what is going on when the sky is like this.  I actually waste a lot of time going to the door to look out or looking out the windows.*********************To those of you who have asked about Lorelei, she is feeling better.  She is still on antibiotics...has a few more days of them left. She started feeling better just in a day or two after starting them.  As you read the following, keep in mind that she does not take naps now, and still will want to stay up till 9:00 sometimes.  I think it was about the second night after she started the antibiotics, she came and got her mom's hand and said 'Tickle my Back!' and started leading her down the hallway to her room.  Oh, I guess I should tell you, that we always rub/tickle her back just a few minutes when we put her to bed.Roger asked me who started that....I don't know if it was me or Sarah.  When Sarah was little and felt bad, she liked for me to do her face just real lightly with a finger or two...and I know I have always did Lorelei's face and back, but more her back....but I think her mommy has, too.Anyway, her daddy was up by then, but still had time before he had to work.  (he works nights--10:00 p.m/ -10:00 a.m.)  Anyway, she stopped to hug him  goodnight, and he told her she didn't have to go to bed yet.  It was not even dark!  She just insisted on Sarah going down the hallway with her, she got in her bed and had Sarah tickle her back about 10 seconds, and told her that was enough, and went on to sleep and slept till 8:30 the next morn, and was only up once during the night.So, she is doing better with rest also.************We ran out to the orchard and I got apples to make a  pie for Roger this evening...I have not even tasted it yet.  I really like to have vanilla ice cream to with pie...so I have been holding off.It was an absolutely glorious day here today...hoping we have several more of them to come."},

I would love to be able to get a photo from this side without all the wires, etc.  But this was just a drive-by on our way north.

I think we are headed for a short fall season, but hope I am wrong.  We had a little bit of rain night before last but not enough to make a difference.  I guess the farmers can use the dry weather to get their crops in.All the corn is either already turned brown or starting to turn...but the soy beans are still green for the most part.  I think because the rain in the spring slowed their planting. Here at home, the tomatoes are about at an end...there is enough to eat and that is about it.  The plus side of that is that they are still delicious.  In years past, at the end of some seasons they have been watery and flavorless.  I think it had to do with the amount of rain.  Whatever the reason, I am so glad to be able to enjoy them.  And I sort of wonder what I am going to do when they are gone. Yesterday I did the first round of sewing of the binding on the quilt...but did not start the hand sewing part of it.  I love to do that when I have good shows on TV to watch/listen to.  Lately, there are just so few things we like to watch.  Maybe tonight will be different....at least football season is starting soon!"},

Did Diesel appreciate the effort...not at all.  But he will sometimes sleep in a box that is laying on its side...but for the most part he still prefers Otto's bed.\r\rSo, Sarah gave me the basket...I put an old pillow in it and Bubbie and Puss Puss both love it....\rAbove is Sleeping Beauty sleeping Bubbie....\rahhhh, stretccchhhhhh.....that feels good....\rThen he gives me this look....what the heck are you staring at?\r\rWe took off on a rambling drive today looking for a barn a friend told us about...no luck with it but did find several other beauties.  They were not the highlight of our day though.\r\rOn our way home we decided to check out Wabashiki FWA in Vigo County...actually right on the edge of West Terre Haute.  I have  never seen so many blue herons and egrets in one place...all with no way to get close enough to get a decent photo.  I encourage you to click on the above just to see all the herons...but don't expect the quality of the photo itself to improve.\r\rThe photo above does not even begin to tell the whole story...this is right off a busy highway.  before we got to the spot to pull off, there were small ponds of water on either side of the highway and the birds were standing almost shoulder to shoulder.  On one side was more herons and on the other were more egrets.  And no place at all to pull off to take a photograph.  And back just a bit from these ponds of water....which actually could be backwaters from the Wabash River...but just a few hundred feet were some trees. In those we saw two juvenile bald eagles...we could tell by looking through Roger's spotter scope and my lens.\r\rWe drove around to find another entrance, and we did but seen a kid there who was from Texas but going to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.  We talked to him he thought there was something wrong with the place...he took us and showed us.  No herons or birds of any kind, and the stench was almost unbearable.  The pond of water was definitely more than mudhole, but still not great big.  Dead fish were all along the bank...and fish were hitting the top of the water  constantly.  Roger thinks they were dying from lack of oxygen. \r\rOh, well, what an end to the day....I could not get that smell out of my head till I came home and took a shower."},

Her temperature went up to 103ºF yesterday sometime and was still up this morning so Sarah took her to the doctor.  Keep in mind she has had her mommy up down the past two or three nights till she has not gotten  much sleep.  They pulled into the parking lot and Lorelei said, \"Mommy, I tired.\"  Sarah said, 'So you're tired?'  And Lorelei said, \"yes, I don't want to see the doctor.\"\r\rSo, Sarah said well, can we go in and tell him we are not going to see him...Lorelei says \"Oh, okay.\"  So he seen her and went ahead and give her an antibiotic since she still had the temperature this morn. \r\rThen this evening, well before dark, she wanted her mommy to come tickle her back...she likes that as she goes to sleep.  So, Sarah asks \"You want your back tickled...you don't want to eat a salad with me?\"  No, she wanted her back tickled.  She went and told her dad good-night, and went and got in her bed.  Sarah turned the light off and tickled her back about ten seconds and she told Sarah that was enough...\r\rIt isn't even dark yet...it wasn't dark by the time Sarah called me, even.  I am hoping they both get a good night's sleep.\r**************\rI have been sewing off and on all afternoon and evening.  I am doing some of the quilting on my oldest daughter quilt.  So far, so good.  I tried to stop and take breaks but it is hard to when things are going okay.  I did diagonal quilting...all the diagonal quilting I had planned, but not so sure about it now.  Almost thinking it might need more.  Though she don't want it quilted real close.\r\rI am thinking about putting the binding on next till I can trim the edges off and remove some of the bulk.  There isn't a lot to cut off, but every little bit will help.  And I love doing the binding anyway.  It is already made, so wouldn't take too terrible long to get it done.  I could do the first round of sewing in an hour or two...the part where I sew it on with the sewing machine.  The part where I flip it to the back and sew it down by hand will take several hours.\r\rIt feels so wonderful to be doing something a little bit creative...I need to make the effort do do something every day."},

{"title": "Yardage", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "text": "I took photos of the new fabric I picked up in Shipshewana...thought I would show it on here.  I have at least one blogger friend that will probably enjoy seeing it.\rThe two above are half yard pieces and the red doesn't show true on this computer...it is more of an orangy red.  So if that is what yours shows, it is showing it more true to color.  Reds with a hint of orange is hard to find and I always buy a piece if I find one.  This one happens to be a Christmas fabric but I did not notice that...and will ignore it when I use it.  The orange...well, I use a lot of brights in kids quilts and would love to someday make an orange quilt like THIS one.  The only thing is I can never hold on to orange fabrics...\rThe one above is a Kaffe Fassett fabric...and I LOVE it...I don't love very many of his designs, but then there are the ones that are just fabulous in my opinion.  I use a lot of yellows in my quilts, but going to be hard to use this one.  I just like to look at it.\rThe three above were from Little Bit of Lolly's...the others are all from Lolly's fabric.  Both are in Shipshewana...the ones above are on sale...the two outside ones I got because I always need lights. And the other is a bright that will look good in a child's quilt.  Quilters have a tendency to buy mediums and darks...they are the ones that are irresistible...the ones you just can't stop yourself from buying.  But I have been trying to make myself buy a few lights along.  That is one reason I use yellows in my quilts...yellow will brighten an otherwise drab quilt.\rThe two above are batiks....batiks are not printed...they really don't have a right side and a wrong side.  They are stamped with a resist and then dyed.  The resist blocks the dye from taking in the part that it covers.  Sometimes the resist is then removed and it is dyed again...giving us a range of colors.  I am building a huge selection of them...I find them hard to cut...\rAnd the two above also came from Little Bit of Lolly's...they are Civil War reproduction fabrics...I have a good collection of those.  Roger wants a quilt from them so that is one that is on my list of 'to do' quilts in the future.\r************\rEvery time I get in my fabric, I think of my mom...I don't think she was ever in a real quilt store.  And she would have thought me foolish to spend the money I do on fabric.  I bet there was never a year went by that she didn't make at least 4 or 5 quilts and probably more some years...with at least a couple being quilted by hand.  She tied some quilts, and gave a lot  of those away as gifts. \r\rShe had boxes of scraps...and I remember us hunting for scraps of a fabric...just to have enough to do blocks with.  Sometimes it was hard to come up with enough of one fabric to do a block...but it was fun to stir around in the scraps and try.  She never even thought about trying to get things on the straight of grain...there was just no way.\r\rAnd she would cut her pattern from a piece of cardboard...the kind like cereal boxes are made of..of the back of a composition book.  And she would just hold it and 3 or 4 layers of her fabric and cut around it with scissors...This is one of her quilts....as I told in that post, I do not know where she got all the red fabric.  She made another quilt with that red fabric and it was just one big lone star.  My brother Neal has that quilt I think...I know he was always meant to have it.  If he does, he should take a photo of it...anyway, just saying that any time I am messing with fabric I think of mom."},

The class was Thursday and Friday nights starting at 6:00 and ending at 10:00 pm, and her hubby had to work both nights so our babysitting services were requested.  It was a hard job but we were up to it....LOL\r\rWe stayed till this evening...not sure just what time we got in but well before dark.  I got a few little things done, sent Sarah a text that we had made it home okay, had to balance the checkbook...I don't think many people do that any more but I just do not trust myself enough not to do it.\r\rAbout the time I got done with chores and started to catch up with my blog friends, Roger lost this little spring of something he was working on.  He was sitting in front of the computer while doing it,  and let me tell you we looked and looked and looked.  Spent over an hour...I even got the vacuum out and put a knee high hose over the end of it and started vacuuming.  Nothing.\r\rRoger looked on every surface around, and I did, too.  I looked behind the monitor, and on the bottom shelf and looked at the printer, but didn't think a spring could get under it.  I honestly thought about having Roger lift it up, but thought no, no use.  So I finally decided to quit and take a break from it..and he looked behind the printer and there it was!    What Fun for a Saturday Night!\r*************\rI think I am going to have to invest in a router for Sarah's house...so I can take my own computer to be able to blog some.  I have time at night, although I might be too tired to do much.  But I could at least visit a few blogs.\r\rFor some reason, any time I visit this blog on her computer, it freezes up.  Totally freezes.  I can sit there for an hour and still not be able to do anything.  I got the bright idea to visit some other blogs via their comments in my email.  Up until now, I could visit a few blogs from there with no problems...now I cannot even visit any if I have a minute.  It freezes up for other people's blogs, also.\r\rWe have no idea what else to try....and I am so tired right at this moment I cannot even think of what we have tried so far.

I got up, got my shower;  Roger was up before I was done.  I fixed a bit of breakfast, spent a little time checking out some of the blogs, doing email, then headed to the basement.  Above you will see some of my rulers...they are thick acrylic rulers for cutting against with a rotary cutter which is laying below my scissors in the photo below.\rI first repaired a shirt of Rogers...one he had only worn a few times till a seam pulled loose. Up in the shoulder seam.  Well, it is dark green and black flannel...I have tried numerous times to see to take the stitches out.  Finally, I just stuck the raw edge back under and sewed it enough to hold it in place a bit...then I used some fusible web, got a scrap piece of dark fabric and fused over the seam and sewed it down.  That stitching is noticeable, but not bad...and for everyday, who cares.\rNext I started fiddling with these crumb blocks again...it is time consuming but satisfying at the same time...I use up scraps that I would not use up for anything else.  And when I am done, I will have enough for some kind of quilt...\rI had a couple of the ones above started so finished them, came up and we fixed lunch.  Then I have been back down there sewing and made two more.  Decided I wanted some fresh pictures so came up to get the camera and noticed that the rain had actually started.\rI forget how many of the blocks are here...I have just been messing with them in odd moments here and there.  When I want to sew a line but don't feel like really getting into a big project.  Or when I am too tired to think.  These are almost foolproof....\r\rI think I am headed down in a minute to get the binding made for my older daughter's quilt...I have not started the quilting of it yet but thinking after this next weekend that I will get started on it...I want to do it when I haven't got anything planned that is going to take me away from it for days at  time...and I love having the binding already made when I finish quilting...that way I can get right on to one of my favorite parts.\r\rSome people hate doing the binding, but I love it.

Roger replaced a toilet...nothing was broken or anything like that...we just wanted one of the tall ones.  Our bathroom is quite small so talk about a job!  It is so hard to work when you don't have room.  I am so thankful that he can do about anything.   I kind of wanted to do it now before we got any older...I knew someday we would probably really want/require one.  So just decided to do it while we had the time and was able. \r\rAnd today I have hung three loads of laundry out and have most of it put away.  Just have to bring in the towels and fold and put them way.  I feel like I have run a race the number of times I have been up and down the steps.

So it is left to us to entertain him sometimes.\r\rAlso, I have really avoided feeding hummingbirds because of the cats, but I keep seeing them looking till they almost make me feel guilty.  I guess I could rig one up high enough till the cats could not jump and get them.

A car met us not long after we entered the area, and whether due to them, or due to my timing I did not see much at all.  Not much was moving...not even birds.\r\rThere are areas out there that are bigger than your average mud puddle, but cannot be classified as a pond.  They are almost completely dry, so nothing moving in them.\r\rThe one above is definitely a strip pit, but I don't think it is too deep because I see moss over a big portion of it if looking from the right angle.\r\rWhen I got to this view point, I had to take a picture...it was trying to work up to a storm and had that weird cast of light.  There was lightning in the distance, and if I had not left my sewing machine plugged in, as well as my netbook....I would probably have stayed out there a while.  I have always wanted to be out there during a storm.\r\rAnyway, click on the picture above...it will get bigger and it is such a peaceful view to look at.\r************\rRoger spent a big portion of the day spreading some gravel we had delivered the other day.  I had some laundry on the line, which I always throw in the dryer for just a few minutes.  In that was a pair of old work shorts of Rogers that had a pocket with a hole in it.  I spent time replacing it this afternoon...I had replaced the other one a year or so ago.\r\rI am not quite sure how much sense that made...they are CHEAP shorts from Walmart...so not worth much considering their age.  But we fooled around and waited too long to buy any new ones for him...his size was no longer available when we began looking a while back.\r\rThis, and some comments a friend made about buying candles and house decorations led me to think about how each of us are.  I very seldom buy house decorations...the kind for the individual seasons....with the exception of Christmas.  I like the others...I do not know why I don't buy for them.  I love walking into her house and seeing what she has set out.  It gives a home such a welcoming feel.\r\rI have bought my share of candles...and still buy a few along.  I love candles....always have and always will.  I don't feel guilty about it.\r\rI don't know if any other women do this, but I used to feel guilty for spending money for things I wanted...and even some things I needed.  I have no idea why I was that way.  I can remember buying a can opener and feeling guilty and knowing how stupid I was.  That was when I was very young and first married.\r\rAnd no, the guilt didn't develop after I was married, it was there before.  A lot of women have tons of clothes and shoes....I have never been one for that.  I like to have a few things I like real well, and as long as I have three or four pair of jeans and maybe a pair of khakis, I am good to go.  Now, if I didn't have a problem with one of my feet, I might have a garage full of shoes by now....cause I always did love shoes and purses.\r\rI no longer feel guilty spending money on things I want...well, not much anyway.

I don't know what happened one year...I don't know if mom had a hard time getting to town or what, but when I was in second grade, I don't know how many days I had to borrow paper, and I think I got it all from one girl.  I always think of her and how kind that she never got mean about it.\rAnd when we were in the younger grades, I can remember all of us having our lessons returned to us, and we all used the back side of them and did another lesson on them.  It wasn't just me, but I think most of us.  We were 'green' before that was the in-thing to be.\r\rI remember standing and almost drooling over pencils and paper back then, and after I got older every now and then mom would let me splurge on a sketch book...and I am not an artist.  Don't have that gift at all as far as drawing and sketching...but I still liked to try.\r\rAnd does anyone remember that back in our day, there used to be binders which held the paper at the top.  And you could actually buy paper that had the holes at the top.  The front cover flipped over to the back...and it was not rings that held the paper but plastic posts.  And they had a little compartment to put a pencil or two.  You raised the 'lid' to put the paper on the posts, or to get to your pencil.\r\rI can still spend hours looking at these things...you don't want to take me to Staples or Office Max!  For me, they hold untold treasures.  I can never leave without buying some little something...even if it is just pens.  But you can bet I want to spend more, though, just I don't have the excuse to get it.  And in addition to the pens, paper, notebooks etc...there is also computer stuff to be picked up and looked at and read about..."},
{"title": "From Northern Indiana", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "text": "We got up to beautiful weather Monday, and Roger knew I would want to get out a little with the camera.  Where to go was the question of the day though.  I got on line and started checking weather...I cannot even remember why now.  I think to see what the days ahead would hold if we didn't go Monday.  I happened to check out Shipshewana and the weather sounded perfect.\r\rIt was too late in the day to head out then....well not really.  But had  a lot to do and did need tires on the Rav4...so, even though they could  have waited, we felt better getting them on.  And had errands to do in  Terre Haute.  So got all that done Monday, oh, and I had to make that  couple jars of juice before we left...didn't want to waste the tomatoes. \rAnyway, that is where I have been...the photo above is from out in the country near Shipshewana...look at that sky.  The whole time we were there, we had beautiful skies like that.  And the temps did not get above 80º while there...at least I don't think they did.    I did not suffer with heat at all.                         \rOn the way there we went through Nappanee, Indiana...another Amish community.  We saw these quilt blocks on the side of a building...I took them through Roger's window...he tried to stop long enough for me to get a good one, but people were turning right behind us so just had to be satisfied with what I got.\r\rI love murals...and thought this was a wonderful one, but could not get a better shot.  We actually tried to get in a better place, but it was just too busy, too many parked cars, too much traffic, AND they were working on the road going through town so that made it that much worse.\rWe wanted to go to the flea market at Shipshewana...I wanted to get a couple throw rugs there.  But next time we go, we don't want to even go to it.  It wasn't overly crowded and the weather was perfect, but just don't want to spend time there.  I did go to Lolly's Fabric Store and to her Little Bit of Lolly's in the basement...and will definitely go there again...but there is other stuff I want to do. \r********************\rRight now I have tomatoes on to make juice with, and have clothes on the line.  When I get the tomatoes done, I definitely need to mop....and just so many things calling to me.  I want to visit blogs...\r\rOh, and that is another thing...the first evening we got to our hotel, I was able to blog a little bit.  Even left a comment or two before we got out again.  I thought that was great, that I had a great wi-fi connection.  Instead, it became harder and harder to do stuff.  I think I did a bit more that night, such as uploaded pics for two or three days on my other blog, but after that I could not upload any photos, nor leave any comment on anyone's blog.\r\rSo, I will try to catch up with everyone over the next day or two.  Hope everyone is having a good weekend."},
{"title": "They just kept coming...", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "text": "Last week when Sarah and Lorelei spent a couple nights, we ran through the strip pits...first we saw what we thought were a couple hen pheasants, but on second thought for me, I am wondering if they were half grown pheasants.  I didn't get a chance to take any photos, they were just there and gone.  We went on a mile or two farther and saw this female and a young one crossing the road ahead of us...I took the above photo through the windshield.\rWe were paused and oops, there came another one!\rOh, and here are a couple more!  I was out of the Rav for the last two shots, but they are still nothing to brag about.  Yet I am happy to even have gotten them.  This is the first time we have seen young pheasants out there...I suppose they are called chicks but don't know for sure.\r*************\rI canned a couple more jars of tomato juice last night...brings my total to eight.  I am having a hard time not opening a jar....just so hard.  But I know I crave it so bad in the winter and the stuff you buy just does not do the trick for me.  Maybe because they are processed a little too much and made from concentrate.  I guess I should be thankful I am the only one that likes it.\r\rI also got the quilt sandwich made using the quilt top I showed two or three days back.  Getting everything stretched out on top of each other and then doing all that pinning is the part I don't like to do in quilting.  There is no easy way to do it at my house--I have to get down in the floor on hands and knees and then when it comes to the actual pin basting, I am on elbows and knees...I pin about every 5 or 6 inches....sometimes a little closer....talk about getting stiff.\r\rNormally, I take a break or two with a quilt that big, but there was a show on TV I wanted to see so I pinned for almost two (2!!!!) hours straight and just barely got done in time.  By the time I finished, I felt like head was right down between my shoulders....and have had a stiff neck since.  But it is done and I enjoy the quilting by machine.  I think I am doing diagonal lines through the blocks with the red, and then something else in the blocks that are made of tans....some kind of free-motion work.\r\rI do my quilting on a regular sewing machine...well, it is a Juki and has a little more space to the right of the needle than most.  Most people think quilting on a sewing machine is easy until they try it.  It is harder than it looks, specially when it comes to a big quilt.But I am going to wait a few days and get over some of this soreness."},

The song is Good To Be Home by The Everybodyfields...no not a spelled wrong...they spelled it all together.  Notice the past tense there...they have since broken up and went each gone their own way.  I love a lot of songs, but think that deep down this will always be my favorite one....SO GOOD TO BE HOME by The EverybodyfieldsI was sick about the time we hit Virginia,I had tombstones down both sides of my face.Driving all night home from Boston,I was so tired of being away.Thinking about summer time and heat wavesAnd a town, it hardly ever snows,Hitting apples with a baseball bat in August,That's where I want to go...So good to be home.Well sidewalks down here, they go foreverand they always seem to meet you with a smile.If they don't park the cars out where they shouldn't [??]I believe you can see clear for a mile.Well there's a tree on Maple St., it turns so yellow,it turns lose the leaves; the ground, it turns to gold.My car, it always knows what gear to be inand my feet can always take me home.So good to be home.Well the lights here, they can spin the head of a young maninto thinking that the whole town loves you.But your heart is not protected from the cityit might help to get you through.Well the downtown has given me some problemsand we've all had some growing up to do,walking on cars and across the tops of buildings,I think that God was probably laughing too.So good to be home...Down the street my neighbor's son is walking,the north side is getting bigger all the time.I owe the girl down at the library some money,she says she's just gonna let it slide.In my mind every single day is sunny,it's so bright it almost hurts my eyes to see.When the rain is pouring out over the gutters,thank the lord just to be here in Tennessee.So good to be home...Half a mile now from the border,half a mile just to roll my windows down.Sitting, staring at the windshield,telling myself \"not too much further now\".I call David up to see what he is doingand I pass him as he's getting in his car.Down the road and take a right down State of Franklinand we'll p__ the night away down at the bar.So good to be home...Anyway, my brother, Neal put his photos to the song...they are all pictures from around our childhood home...There is just so  much to this song...it is the mood of the song.....the words don't exactly fit my childhood but the mood fits me to a 't.' **********************************Just thinking about how every fall, before school started, mom and I would try to get done with canning and freezing soon enough to have a couple weeks to sew and make my dresses for school before it was time to cut tobacco.  About the only place that carried fabric back then was J.C. Penneys...at least in the little town we went shopping in...across the mountain in Middlesboro, Kentucky. Patterns and fabric were up on third floor I think...and I am almost thinking the bottom floor was the ground floor...not positive but thinking that up the first set of stairs was kids clothing..maybe just girls, and I think the next floor was women's...followed by the next floor having household goods and and fabric and patterns...but maybe the children's and women's was one floor, don't know for sure.There was an elevator, but I don't ever remember taking it a single time...we always went the stairs with mom telling me to slow down and don't fall, etc.  I don't think I listened to her for more than a second on that one...but most stuff one did not ignore when she told you not to do.But we would go up, and I would browse the patterns...McCall's and Simplicity...I don't think they offered Vogue or Butterick.  I don't know if I even heard of those till I was away from home...but I may have. Once I found the pattern, I looked for material...and I think I always chose the pattern first, then the fabric.  I think most times I chose a couple patterns and made a couple different versions of the dresses...and believe me I didn't get that many dresses.  Mom did most of the sewing, though I can remember her walking me through making a dress when I was probably in 5th grade, and I may have made some of my  dresses when I was in high school, but don't remember for sure. We sometimes spread things on the kitchen table to lay them out to be cut, other times the floor.  One thing, I know my mom never got as much fabric as the pattern said to get...she would look at it and decide how much less she needed than it called for and I don't ever remember her being short of material...lots of times we had buttons at home, but had to buy zippers if required.************The cicadas are calling here now, and if we sit on the porch at night, it sounds like autumn could be here in all its glory except maybe it is just a bit hotter than it will be later.  Hearing them the past few nights just made me think of the days of my youth, and getting ready for school.  And I can't think of fall, without thinking of that song...so thought I would throw them together for this post...and am sure I will probably do another in the weeks ahead.  I am hoping for long fall season."},
{"title": "With a thankful heart....", "date": "Saturday, August 6, 2011", "text": "Someone mentioned that I should show my sewing project(s)...well this is a quilt top that I finished a few months ago when my shoulder was still bothering me.  It is 87 inches square.  This was taken in harsh-middle of the day sunlit.  Actually it was overcast and sunny by turn...either way this does not render the true color....I happened to be out in harsh light. Anyway, I really had trouble when I sewed the long seams to put the quilt together because my shoulder/arm just ached.  Then it got worse...but you know what?  I sewed the lining for the backing today....with not a single pang.  And I am planning to pin baste it in the next few days if nothing happens.  Not so long ago, I could not have even thought about pin basting it...I could not even get down and reach back under the shelf to plug in the computer...it literally brought me to tears.  I am still careful with that one, but I can do it.  It is just it was such an unexpected thing, I will always remember it.I am so thankful to be back on my feet...at least once a week I do something and think 'That didn't hurt!'  When going to Sarah's it was getting into Roger's truck...it is an older Ford Ranger, but it is 4-wheel  drive and I actually have to grab the handle above the window to get in...plus step up first on what is the step board....not so long ago it was a real struggle to find a way to hold on and pull myself up on the passenger's side.And you women, you know how we grab the covers and flip it up in the air to spread it out better when we go to make the bed...I can do that with not a single twinge.I had to miss a lot of therapy when I was sick, and thought I would start it again when I got over whatever I had, but I am finding that just living my life and doing the things I do normally seem to be doing the trick.  When I quit therapy, I could not get in the truck without a struggle, I couldn't reach and hang clothes on a couple little clotheslines I have in the basement and I can now, and there are several other things that I can do that I couldn't do before I got sick.And I am just so happy to be able to do them....I don't know how many times I have told Roger 'Look, this doesn't hurt!' So many simple things I cannot think of all of them. There is not much I can't do, but still have a little range to get back...but I think it will come with living.  I can reach around behind my back with that side much farther than I could when I first got sick.  I can put a belt on after I put my jeans on, and don't have to think and put it through the loops before I put the jeans on.Well, this has been a self-centered post....I wanted to say a little about this but kept wanting to explain farther.  The point of the post was supposed to be about being thankful for what we have....especially good health."},

It was by a place that sold exotic fish and supplies....the entire situation had a strange feel to me.  It sort of had the feel of a home, yet it looks like an old store.I should have had Roger park somewhere till I could have gotten better shots, but like I say, I felt like it had the feel of a home. It seems to have a little bit of everything thrown on it for decoration...****************We have been to Sarah's for a couple days.  I figured with her seeing us the day before, that it would be no big deal when we walked in but she came running and jumped for me to grab her.  To just walk in and make someone that happy...there is no better feeling.I am not sure what I am going to be doing the next few days...got home so late I did not check my tomatoes.  I finally had a ripe tomato from the Brandywines and it was simply delicious, red and ripe all the way through--just the way I remember tomatoes.  So I am hoping I have some more of them ready to eat.  I may even end up taking a flashlight out there to check before the night is over.  Yes, I am that hungry for a home grown tomato.  I meant to take a few with us just to have....Sarah nor Jeremy likes fresh tomatoes but we would have enjoyed them.I also have some sewing ready to do, and would really like to get started on that.  And there is the never ending laundry...so I am sure I won't be bored.  Plus I want to get caught up on blogs that I have missed the past couple of days.  I hate getting a week behind...and I never can just simply start off and not go back and see what I have missed."},

The above is Cougar...and there is Puss Puss up there...notice her big eyes.  They are big in real life.Another view of Cougar--notice he is laying on a quilt.  A quilt never is made that is not tested by the cats.And of course this is Bubbie...she really captured him....notice he is under the quilt.  That is very typical of him.

On the way home, her papaw looked at me and said he had not stopped smiling since they got here.  And neither had I....and my mouth was almost hurting from smiling and laughing so hard at some of her actions and words.The first thing, when I looked out and saw their car, I went out the back door to meet them and here she came being a dragon.    Then Sarah told us she had asked her before they left if she wanted to go see Mamaw and Papaw and she just said 'No' in this real calm voice....and in a minute or two she again ask her if she wanted to come see us...that time she wanted to come see Mamaw and Papaw's toys!  and come see Mamaw's chair and Papaw's chair! I cannot remember all she has said and done....we came to this stop sign on the way home.  Her Papaw stopped at it of course...and she says \"GO! Go, Papaw!\"...so he really stepped on the gas and she said, \"Papaw, you're like my daddy!\"I try to keep Klondike bars here when she is going to be coming, and always when we are trying to get her settled for the night, I go get a Klondike bar and we share it.  I unwrap it and put it in a bowl and walk in.  She was sitting back in this little rocker thing.  I sat down and did not say anything...she was watching TV...all she had to do was turn her head to see me with the bowl. I rattled the spoon two or three times and she did not turn around....I was debating just getting up and walking across the room and Papaw walked in and bent down and said something to her.  She turned to say something back to him and saw me with the bowl.  I don't think I have ever seen her move as quick to get up out of the rocker!  Her mom and I cracked up..."},

If he didn't, why does it pop into my mind every time I see a crop duster?I posted a couple of good pics over on Time Stand Still, but saved these for here.  He was dusting a field and on one end of the field would turn around right over us...or practically over us.  Well, we were turning around to leave, and here he came again...this time he did a pass each way on the field right next to us.  I felt sure he was doing it just for me.  He was low enough to see me, have no doubt of that. (No, I could not see through his windows because of the glare of the sun!) I wish I could thank him/her for the pass.I feel like I wasted my opportunity because not a single one of those photos are as good as it should have been!  I wish I could thank him/her for at least giving me the chance to try.

He is reading Field & Stream...we believe in training our children early...he already loves going for rides on the 4-wheeler with his papaw.  He will ride with him as long as his papaw will take him.  It won't be long until he is fishing and hunting.I have to tell this cause I thought it was so cute.  First I will tell you a little history.  Jackson loves Santa Claus.  He got all excited over the holidays if he saw him on television...if someone was on television with a white beard, he thought they were Santa Claus.  And he would go around all day hollering for Santa Claus.  His mom and dad had him out one morn a while back, as they were leaving some place, this guy with a beard got out of his car and went in a restaurant...Jackson looked and said \"Santa.\"   Well, here just the other day, he was playing with his little phone, pretending to talk on it, then handed it to his Mamaw and so she ask him who it was, and he said \"Santa.\"***********This is my juice I made today...I will probably put that pint in the fridge and drink it since it needed just a bit more in it.  I didn't notice that when I canned it, but I was sort of hoping to have a reason to sample it.You might wonder how tomatoes ties in with early training...well, I helped my mom can and freeze stuff as long as I can remember.  And she taught me to love putting up food for the family.  I think she enjoyed canning and putting stuff in the freezer as much as she enjoyed anything.  That is some of my fondest memories from home...Also, one year my older daughter bought a bunch of sweet corn, and she called me to see if I wanted to help.  I forget how many dozen ears she got, but we had a regular assembly line going to get it blanched, cut off the cob, and frozen.  I know we stopped sometime during doing it to have big bowls of tomatoes cut up....I cannot remember if we had them salted or with Italian dressing.**************When we took Lo to the creek the other day, it was like going down memory lane for Roger and me.  We started taking the girls to the creek when they were young.  Not quite as young as Lorelei....but still they were not real old.  We would fish while they played...and sometimes they might fish a little bit...but most of the time they looked for crawdads, snakes, or anything else that moved...I watched Lorelei and I just know she is going to love it every bit as much as they did.  I am so glad to have been a part of introducing it to her."},

All winter long I have been waiting for them...we have been having them for a week or two now and I still am not tired of them.  And I have not ventured beyond having them with salt or on a sandwich...but look plan to have some soaked in Italian dressing one of these days.I also love to cut up other vegetables along with the tomateos and pour enough Italian dressing over it all and let it soak...my favorites are cucumbers, bell peppers, cauliflower, onions.

It is always busy, but I did wonder if people had come in there to keep cool.When I ran out to the strip pits, it felt at least ten degrees cooler, and the thermometer on the car said 88º.  It was nice to be out and hear the birds singing...and I saw several deer.  I did not see the owl again....next time I will either go a bit later or else stay just a bit later.

One of these days we want to go back up there...but that is not the point of the post.The rain just looks so appealing...today the temperature finally went up to over a 104º...I don't remember if it was 104.2 or 104.6º, but people that is hot.  I sat out in the swing for about 20 minutes this evening and the swing frame was hot to touch and it is in the shade all day.  Needless to say...rain sounds good right now.*********************A while back it crossed my mind that in Tennessee we could hear the rain coming....do any of you know what I am talking about.  It has something to do with being in the mountains....you could look back towards the mountain and tell it was raining and you could also hear it...even though it was mile or more away.  I guess the sound sort of echoed....or else it is sort of how you can cup your hand behind your ear and hear better...the mountains was wrapped around the rain and the sound was amplified.I do get tired of rain when it rains and rains and rains, but as a general rule, I love rain.  I loved it as a kid...if someone was available to play with, we would head to the barn to do something.  We could always find something to do there.  Whether it was swings, play with a calf, play in the hay if there was any--which we were definitely NOT supposed to do...but we did anyway.  And it wasn't that we did these only when it rained...I can remember my niece and I swinging on swings and trying to kick our flip flops high enough to hit the roof....and I can remember us taking grass string and looping it together to make a long line of it, and running it through a crack in the floor of the loft.   We would tie the end up there to something to keep it from falling on through....and then on the end hanging down below, we would tie an empty bleach jug or whatever kind of plastic jug we could find but I do believe it was usually a bleach jug....then we would take a baccerstick tobacco stick and bat it back and forth to each other. But we would hit it as hard as we could...and sometime strike it more in a downward motion which made it jump all crazy.  Laughter rang out with each hit....and now I am not even sure why it was so funny.  I just remember laughing till we cried sometimes...If no one was available, and sometimes even if there was, there was always a book calling my name.  Sometimes I sat on the porch and read, and sometimes headed to the barn and read.  At one time we had an old mattress up there...where it came from is more than I know.  And I don't know what ever happened to it.But my niece and I had it out across a couple of the tier poles we used to hang tobacco on...we would get out on it and read. I guess this and some of the other childhood posts explains why I love barns so much."},

I made a few more crumb blocks....that is where you use up little bits of fabric left over from other projects.  Some people seem to go a mile a minute while making them but mine are in such shape that it is slow going for me.I have also been cutting 2 1/2 inch blocks from pieces that are big enough for that....I am getting quite a few of those but it will take a LOT to make anything at all.  But it is still doing something creative.  I have so many things in mind to do...but some of it requires actual thinking.  I have yet to make the backing for Oldest Daughter's quilt top...I almost started it tonight but wanted to wait till I can stick with it long enough to make it.  It sounds simple, but I do have to make sure I make it big enough.It is so hot that Bubbie has been spending his nights inside, as well as most of the day.  (His normal thing to do is stay out all night and come in and sleep all day.)  He had went out this morn for a bit, and when I opened the door, he ran in and just flopped down on the tile floor in the kitchen and has not been back out till just now.  And I bet he does not stay out long."},

A quick run to the strip pits resulted in us spotting a the owl first thing....but the minute I got out of the Rav to take a photo, it took flight.Big thunderheads rolled in this evening and we ran out there...by the time we got out there it was so dark it felt like almost night.  After we drove through the strip pits, the sun was back and it felt like we were waking from a dream.**************************Talking about waking, does anyone realize just how good it is to be able to go to bed in your own bed every night....and to go to sleep?  I tell you it will be a while before I forget to feel thankful each night I can go to bed and go to sleep....There are just so many things we all take for granted.  With all the heat, I am so thankful to have AC....thinking how awful it would be without it.  And knowing that a lot of older people would really have trouble breathing without it.  I think about this several times a day now. It also brings to mind that not all that many years ago, air conditioning was not the norm.  When we were kids, we generally slept with the doors open and windows open....I remember laying my pillow in the window sill and sleeping with my head in the window when I was young.And the year and a half that Roger and I lived in Tennessee, we opened the back door, and had the window open in our bedroom and our little house cooled out just fine.  I don't even know if we used a fan.We never had AC regular till after we had children.  And I think our oldest daughter was at least in elementary school before we had a car with air conditioning.  Now, I can't stand to drive down the highway with the windows open....I would miss the air conditioning now, but what I really miss is being able to leave doors open.  Locking doors is relatively new to me...I guess I was not living in the real world.  But all the years my kids were growing up and in college, the doors were never locked unless we went totally away for over night.    Most of the kids that came here knew they were never locked...some of them knew where I kept a few dollars...in case it was needed for paper boy, etc. I really miss those days..."},

This is my entry for Tricia's Barn Charm Meme...click if you want to join or just see the rest of the barns that are entered.This barn comes from Tennessee....again.  But it also has a little story attached.  Everyone  that knows me, knows how much I love Tennessee and consider it home.  Even if I don't go down for years and years it is still home....and I still like the soft southern drawl of the people.  I still think they are some of the finest people to be found.  I guess everyone thinks that of their hometown or home state.Imagine my surprise when we stopped for me to take photos of this...I got yelled at for taking pictures!  Actually, I didn't know what they said....I was standing in the road on down from a house, and Roger was just pulled over to the side but still in the road.  So I walk back to see what the lady said...and it was one lady telling me that another lady said I did not have permission to take photos of the barn!The other lady came out then, an elderly lady I should add, and asked me why I was taking pictures...I just told her I take pictures of barns where ever I go...and walked away.  I was so upset I did not want to talk to her....if I had at that time I would probably have told her if she didn't want pictures of it taken, then she needed to build a privacy fence.  I just walked away....I could not believe someone down there would say anything about a picture being taken.I had to tell this little story.....I have taken a gazillion pictures and some of them right in peoples faces almost and no one has ever gotten upset.  It just goes to show there has to be an old grouch wherever you go."},

I had been having a scratchy throat off and on for 3 or 4 weeks, then last Wednesday evening it hit, and did not leave.  I cannot sleep for coughing...even  the cough syrup with codeine in it did not do the trick last night.  I would be so sleepy I could hardly hold my eyes open, but the minute I tried to lay down and sleep, I would start coughing.I did get a couple naps in last night, but woke each time coughing so hard I could not catch my breath.

I just brought them in and threw them in the dryer a few minutes....and hung another load out.Music is blaring....it takes me back to childhood.  I have always loved working to music.  When I was a kid, I liked to mop...still like to in fact.  Sometimes in the summer when we were busy canning and freezing garden stuff, and also picking blackberries and making jams and jellies...I can remember the kitchen floor just getting so dirty we felt like our feet almost stuck to it.  I couldn't wait till everyone went to bed....I would turn the music on...not loud of course...but I always got down on my hands and knees to mop back then.  And it was pure joy to work and listen to music...uninterrupted.Preparing food for winter was such fun.  We would gather beans and sit on the front porch talking while we broke them...and in between fixing meals...or sometimes after the last meal, we would can them.  And we always froze some.  Jars had to be filled and the freezer full, or we weren't done.Or we would be gathering corn to freeze...that is another job we would do that could cause a mess...we would 'shuck' it...not sure if you call it shucking when it is still green, and take the silks off and cut off any end with worms on them...and all that stuff that came off the corn, I would gather and take and throw across the fence to the cows...Then the corn was washed and then put on the stove on to blanch, and then cut off the cob.  We froze very little corn on the cob because it took up too much room in the freezer.We always bought peaches and canned them, and canned some of the blackberries for pies.  And there was an old apple tree we used to gather apples from...we peeled them and I think mom froze some, but we cut a lot and laid them in the sun to dry....******************************I am messing around with things here...trying to go through some things and choose what I want to keep and what I want to pass on.  Not having a lot of luck.  I need to stop with that and do the vacuuming and some  cleaning.It feels so good to be able to reach and do stuff...I think I am much farther along with the therapy than they thought I would be.  And it feels wonderful...I just have not felt like myself for the past month or two."},
{"title": "From the sunflowers...", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "I just have to show you these...there were several of the bumblebees and none were ever completely still....and most were rushing from sunflower to sunflower as if they were in a race for their life....I like the way this one looks beside the bird feeder...most of the sunflowers come to right below the bird feeders.  (I had Roger make the hanger for the bird feeders and he made it extra tall till the feeders would be out of reach of jumping cats.)When I was taking pictures of the bumblebees and sunflowers, I noticed this seed that had been caught in the sunflower's limbs...Well, that reminded me of working at the orchard.  I think I have told this before, but not sure.  Forgive me if it is a repeat.  Anyway, we had over 20 varieties of apples at that small orchard.  And I was always in on all the picking...very seldom did a variety get totally picked by anyone else.  So, I am speaking from a lot of experience. Fuji apples were some of the later varieties to be picked...and the Fuji variety we had had real long stems.  So, I always had a pair of clippers and as I picked each apple I had to cut the stem shorter...or else when they were being washed and bagged, the stems would poke holes in the other apples.I cannot tell you how many sunflower seeds I found hidden down in around the stem! It was not hulls, but whole seeds.  Another example of birds hiding food.  There is no other explanation for it.  There were no sunflowers near, other than what the owners put in bird feeders up by the house....and these would be up in apples in the top of trees.  And Fujis were the only apples they hid them in...at least that is all I ever seen.  And I think I would have noticed if they had been in others."},

{"title": "The view from Merom Bluff...", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "Yesterday we stopped at Merom Bluff to see what the Wabash River looked like from up there...as you can see it is full to the brim. I spotted these two flowers while up there...and I don't know the name of either.  I have seen the one below before but don't remember seeing the one above.  With my memory, that is not saying much...I could have seen it and forgotten it.If you know their name, feel free to chime in....I have did a little searching but no luck so far.  Whatever they are, I think they are beautiful, specially the blue/purple one.We went for a little drive today, and was gone 6 hours or so.  When we came home and I got out of the Rav, I heard this meow, meow.  Which is not really all that uncommon.  Puss Puss usually comes to greet us giving those quick little meows.  But I did not see her anywhere, till I  looked up and there she was on our roof.She started getting up there last summer....the first time or two we got the ladder and got her down.  But we didn't get her soon enough the next time and she got down by herself.  It took us a while to figure it out...she goes up and down the trellis at the end of the porch.Then here in the past month or two, Bubbie wanted in but I ignored him for a few minutes.  By the time I opened the door, he was no where to be seen....but I heard him on the awning over the porch.  I didn't know it was him till he came down the trellis/wisteria vine! And do you want to know what they are after?  Well, we could never figure it out....till just a couple weeks ago.  I was sitting out on the porch talking on the phone and a tree frog croaked...I think it was Puss Puss first there and boy did she zone in on it. She jumped up in a chair under the sound and put her feet on the back of it...   Then in a little bit, Bubbie was there, and when it croaked again he did the same thing...only instead of jumping on the chair he was reaching up the post...so there is not much doubt when they hear the tree frog over at the other end of the porch, they probably run up the trellis to try to get to them.I think we have the craziest cats....I have had cats all my life and have not had any to surpass these.On top of Puss Puss's greeting today....Cougar was acting kind of strange.  Roger went to his shop shortly after we got home.  I passed by the bathroom and Cougar was just laying in there.  He never lays in there. (Bubbie goes in there and pulls towels down, then crawls under them...but Cougar never goes in there unless we are in there.)  In a little bit, I was in the living room and heard this pitiful meowing..I went and looked down in the basement....only to realize he was still in the bathroom.  He was in the tub....so I went in and petted him a few seconds and gave offered him a fresh drink of water.  Still this meowing...but he followed me out and went to the door as if he wanted out.I let him out, and he went outside and immediately turned around, sat in front of the door and meowed as if he wanted back in.  I opened the door, he came over and meowed and turned away without coming in.So I continued on with the housework I was doing, stopping every little bit to open the door to see if he wanted to come on in.  He didn't....so when I came to a good place to take a break, I picked up my book, a glass of iced tea and some cheese and crackers and went out there.  Of course he got a couple bites of cheese, and I petted him and talked to him some more.  That was all he wanted...just a little bit of companionship.  He got up on top of the grill, and that was the last I heard from him."},

But he is still a gorgeous bird, no matter what.********************Before I left home, in the winter we always fed the birds.  No, we didn't buy birdseed.  I am not even sure if I had ever seen birdseed to buy.  And I for sure didn't know anyone that did. We took a milk jug and cut windows in the sides, leaving the bottom at least two or three inches deep, and would use a string to tie the handle to this trellis mom had at the end of the porch....plus someone, not me, would make some kind of flat 'tray' to nail to the top of a fence post. We would crumble up leftover cornbread as the main food, and I know we used other stuff but I cannot remember what else unless it was corn.  And the birds would just flock to both....there would be cardinals in abundance.  I can remember seeing 9 or 10 male cardinals at the same time.  Plus there would be different sparrows, chickadees, tufted titmice, and probably wrens, though in all honesty I can't think for sure.  But being that they were there all the other time, they just about had to be there then.  Mom would also save leftover fats and make a suet for them...Then come spring/early summer, when we were no longer feeding them...the cardinal would suddenly appear on the fence post, flitting his tail and almost like he was scolding us.  We took that as a sign he wanted food for babies...so I would crumble a little cornbread on the post.  Here he would come, grab a piece and take off back to the cedar thicket.  We never tried to follow, so did not know for sure if they did have babies, but always felt like they did."},

Anyway, see that line running there....that is the railroad.  And the railroad there is up above ground level I would say at least 3 or 4 feet...I am thinking maybe more than 5 feet.  I don't ever even remember the water reaching over to the railroad, much less going over that.It is just almost hard to believe even with seeing the pictures...you just never know.  It will probably be a while before all the damage is known.  Thankfully, they lived higher up than this got....It has gone down since these were taken...I am not sure if it is all the way down but the railroad crews are working on the railroad.  It washed out underneath and railroad ties are just sitting there.

Sarah made her crib into a little bed with the half side rail a couple days ago.  She spent the first night in it, and the next morn, she got up and did not cry for her mom.  Sarah heard her open the door...  Lorelei came down the hall and there is a corner there and you either go into their bedroom or on down the hallway a bit and into the living room, etc.Lorelei got to that corner and slapped the wall hard with her hand twice and yelled, \"STOP!!!!   STOP SWEEPing!\"  (sleeping)  We think she wanted the whole world awake.Well, we went over yesterday to help a little with a plumbing problem...well, Roger to help and me along for the ride.  So, she does go to bed in her bed, and she woke up crying this morn about 5:00 a.m....I forget what all she ask her mom for...she went through a whole list of stuff, but Sarah convinced her to go back to sleep.Then, when I woke up, I could hear her chattering away...I thought she was up with her mom in the living room already...soon as I stepped out in the hall she stopped so I didn't realize she was in her bedroom still.  I thought maybe Sarah had taken her to their bed.  Being that I was up, decided to do my exercises....About that time, I hear Sarah get her....she said Lorelei was just sitting on the edge of her bed kicking her feet saying \"mommy, mommy, mommy\" over and over, and when she walked in, Lorelei quick covered her own eyes with her hands, and said \"Surprise!\"  That kid has way too much fun...."},

The above is the Arthur Elementary School I attended for eight years....it had four rooms plus the entryway.  There were four teachers, each one teaching two grades.  Each of the four rooms had a stove in it...not a pretty coal burning stove, but just one of the plainer ones.  I think starting in the 3rd grade, the teachers would pick a couple students to go bring in a bucket of coal...everyone volunteered.  Maybe they did it in 1st and 2nd grade, but if they did I don't remember it.Notice all the windows....again I don't think we did it in first and second grades, but from about 3rd grade on up, the kids washed the windows.  At least the bottom three rows of window panes...maybe we did the fourth, but I for sure don't think we went any higher.  I only remember girls being chosen to do that job...but again all of us volunteered.  The teacher would choose two of us...one for the inside and one for the outside.And then there was the chalk boards...again students took care of them.  And we loved going outside to clean the erasers.  There was a pump house that was tacked on to the actual school, and we would beat the erasers on the walls of it...sometimes we would stand back and throw them at it.  Again, the teacher chose two....again everyone volunteered.And then there was the outhouses...all the students volunteered to clean them also!  All we had was cold water and a broom...and I suppose soap cause seems like I remember carrying buckets of water to rinse after we had scrubbed the outhouse. Again two kids were the lucky ones chosen for the job.I don't know if the teachers chose two because they knew we would enjoy doing the jobs more that way and volunteer more readily, or if they thought the jobs actually needed two people...and with all these jobs, remember the class size...there was 5-6 girls in my class most of those years, and not many in the class above or below our grade either.  And there were even fewer boys in our class.But all this is not really the memory I was planning to share.  The memory is about library books.  We didn't really have a library in the school...I know in the 5th and 6th grade room, there were a couple shelves with old, old books on them.  I don't even remember looking at them.  I have no idea if there was anything worth reading or not.I don't remember if I was in 3rd or 4th or 5th  grade, maybe even 6th grade when a car started coming and bringing children's books to school.  I think they were brought from another school, but I am not sure.  The hallway or entry way had a long bench in it and they would spread the books out there...you just cannot imagine the thrill of getting to go pick out books with shiny dust covers....it was a wonderful thing for us when they started doing that."},

Lorelei is no exception...we knew she liked it but did not know how much.  Roger first pours the popped corn in a big plastic bowl, adds the salt and butter...then gets smaller bowls to give one to me and one to Sarah....thinking Lorelei would just share with whoever.That was not quite how it went...Lorelei seen it and her eyes lit up....she had to have one of the small bowls.  We figured fine...Sarah and I will just share.  Still not how it went.  Here she came and wanted mine...I thought she wanted to trade.  No...she took it and her bowl and went and sat down in the living room. Her mom went and got one bowl and told her she had to share.  Here came Lorelei and she gave me her bowl...then went over to Sarah and got the other bowl.  Sarah and I are both thinking she is just going to take the one bowl.  NO...she came over to me and had this gleam in her eyes and took the bowl of popcorn I had.  Sarah and I are done laughing so hard it hurts...but Sarah tells her no...and she just starts crying...the big old tears just rolling down her cheeks.  I did not have the heart to not give it to her.She goes in the living room and sets down on a stool in front of Roger...she is eating her popcorn when she realizes Roger has a BIG bowl of popcorn.  Again her eyes just light up...she reaches into his and starts getting handfuls of corn to put in her bowl....Roger asks Sarah what is wrong....has she been abusing Lorelei by withholding popcorn.This by no means fully describes it..."},

Anyway,  I just happened to see the deer above...he was barely visible in that sea of grass.  After seeing him I started keeping a better lookout, and managed to see 7 before the evening was over.  But I bet there was at least double that number, and maybe more that saw me.  They were so hard to spot...most times I would see the ears first, then part of their head...but the grass/hay was so thick that was all I would see unless one ran.I also saw a couple of these frogs...I suppose this one was waiting for a meal to come by on wings...he was in almost the same position when I left the place.And I saw a few dickcissels but no good shots....I will have to go back later to see if I can get some earlier in the evening.

It is odd...when she first leaves, it don't hit me till a bit later just how far away she is.

That is going okay...only one of the exercises so far is really hard to do.  It really hurts to do it.  The others I have to really concentrate to do them right.  I don't know if it is because I have been sitting so tensely for so long, or why.  I do know now that this started sometime before February 3.

I had to be at the doctor's office this morn at 8:45.  I was dreading it so bad, but walked out full of hope.  First I had to have some more x-rays, and one position I had to hold hurt really bad.  Next I seen the doctor.  He was a young doctor...one I immediately had confidence in.He does not think I need surgery, and thinks I can get all movement back with therapy.  He did give me a steroid shot in the shoulder....not fun.  Oh, it wasn't horrible....just a bit more than a normal shot.   He said it would take a couple days to take effect and then I should not feel pain.I am going to have to focus on doing the therapy though and not have days like today where I cannot even take time to do them.*************After we got home from there, the girls got here in just a little while.  Oldest daughter and I had to go get her self-storage rented, then to get a lock for it....and from there they started loading the truck, trailer and cars.  They got the most of it in the first round....not too much at all left for the second round of loads...Now if it hails, we can put the truck in the garage, and IF I find a few more things of oldest daughter, I can take it and put it in storage.While they were doing that moving, I played with Lorelei....most of the time was spent playing with water/sprinkler/rocks.  She loves running water in a bucket and bowl and having smaller things to fill and pour it from here to there.  And she LOVES rocks...I may try to visit a few blogs now, but am so tired I don't know if I will get far.  and I may not get much done tomorrow as I plan on babysitting the toot while her mom tries to get some other stuff done."},

It has been there as long as I can remember and as far back as I can recall it has always been this color.  There is another building this color I am sure, and maybe even another...but it is in a place that has the feel of 'Now you see it, now it's gone....'  One of these days I am going to stop and take time to take a decent picture. Also, it always has a sign up about a flea market being there on the weekends...so would like to go for that also.  Then I could see inside!  Usually I don't link both my blogs to Tricia's Barn Charm meme, but I am this week because I want to show this...but don't consider it good enough for my Time Stand Still. *************Older daughter came home this weekend...we have been at Sarah's visiting with her there.  She will be here later in the week.  It is so wonderful to see her...seems like the time flies.  Lorelei was a tiny bit shy...for about two minutes.When her auntie was here at Christmas, she started sharing her lip gloss/chapstick with Lorelei.  Ever since then, if Lorelei spots your chapstick or lip gloss, she has to have some.  Well, the other day, she seen her mom's lip gloss, and wanted some.  I think Sarah had just put some on her a little while before so she told her no, she didn't need any. Lorelei started crying, but Sarah did not pay any attention to her.  Lorelei got her mom's attention and said, 'Mom, Look at ME!'  Sarah asked her why....she said 'Cause I crying!'"},

It struck a cord of lonesomeness in me...wondering about the lives that were lived there.  I wondered was it an old bachelor or was it a family.  It was probably at least half an hour to the nearest store with today's travel...let alone back then.I wondered how long they would stay on the place without seeing another soul to talk to.  That would be the time when a big family would really be a blessing...imagine being an only child living there.And with all the hills, hollers and rocks in the general area, I thought what a rough ride it would have been to go any where in a wagon.  It would have jarred your teeth loose if you weren't careful.  The field right around this house did not seem to have all the rocks sticking out of the ground that so much of the area had...but still they would have had to pass through it to get any where.I zoomed in for this view...don't you wish you knew its story?  And wouldn't you love to prowl around the area to see what you could find?*****************I went for my first session of physical therapy on my shoulder/arm.  It is not going to be rough...just time consuming.  And there is no danger of her making the tear in my rotator cuff worse.  She really made me feel reassured in that area.She could tell that I don't deal with stress well...told me I needed to learn better ways to deal with it.  I told her I come from a long line of worriers...LOL  It is easier said than done.  She gave me a couple little exercises to do to help loosen up the muscles in the arm, plus a breathing exercise to help me relax. It really works if I do it right...but the way I am I have/need to do it often.For now, I am signing off with the intent of laying down...she did say we should be able to have me sleeping better fairly soon.  Right now this 2/3:00 a.m to 5:00 and 6:00-6:30 a.m. thing is for the birds.  I get up then and feed the cats, then try to prop up on the couch or in the recliner for more sleep...and I do usually sleep some but it is not restful...I wake every little bit."},

I took fishing rods plus a book to read.  Roger took fishing rods and fly rod and his belly boat....he has had the belly boat for over a year and not had a chance to try it out.  So, while he took it out, I would fish a little while and read a little while.  After he got back, I was sitting back in my chair and looked up at the tree.I was farther back than from where this picture was taken, but I was thinking what looks funny about that tree?  So got up and walked up closer and seen what you see below.  I assume someone had lost them, and whoever came along next found them and put them on the tree in hopes that they would be found later.Or who knows?  Maybe someone put them up there and just forgot to get them.  Whatever the reason...we both thought of Lorelei.  She likes trying on sunglasses when we are out...and she loves to put on my glasses.  She thinks that is just the most fun."},

They never stay still long enough for a good photo, unless they are sleeping.  I just wondered if you could see the gleam of mischief in his eyes, and look at his smile....can you see how the corners of his mouth turn up.   We call that his smiley face. He likes to spend time outside, and when we come home, he comes out to the garage to meet us.  He tries to hide at the corner and jump out to grab us, but he just cannot hold still long enough...so he comes out and comes to meet us then races to the house ahead of us.Or if I am out, he likes for me to chase him...then he will turn around and chase me and jump up and pretend to grab me.  Like a big cat hunting...*********************We are still working on getting stuff transferred to the basement.  I got my shelves moved down today...and a filing cabinet.  I got some of the stuff put back on the shelves, but not near all. And during it all, the cats were up and down with me/us.  If they only had thumbs, they could help carry stuff..."},
{"title": "Notes on migration", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2011", "text": "No, not migration of birds.  Migration of stuff.  Books to be more specific.  When our older daughter moved out, I took over her bedroom with my books and desk and file cabinets.  I never dreamed she would be moving so far away.  I didn't even think Sarah would be moving far enough away to want to spend the night ever again.Being that they have both moved, and return home from time to time....we are slowly trying to clear out that bedroom till we can set up a spare bed for them when they come home.  I don't have a lot of books...I try my best not to buy too many.   I try to find the ones I want to read at the library.  Yet I have several books that I consider among my treasures.  Most of the ones that are fiction, I don't mind moving downstairs.However, even some of those I want up here.  Plus there are the non-fiction books such as Sod & Stubble, and Grass of the Earth and several other books that are letters, or diaries about settling the prairie and the west, diaries of covered wagon women...I just cannot bare to put those where I cannot get to them.  So, a slow migration of stuff has begun....I am trying to take my time and enjoy looking at the books and making decisions...I see books that I think, oh, I want to read that again, or this one will remind me so much of home...just never enough hours in the day to read all I want and to blog all I want...so it is back to the job for me...But I will leave you with this little video....And no, it is not Lorelei...if you can believe that.  It is a video my nephew sent me.  I think it is so  much fun to watch."},
{"title": "Post about blogging;  totally unrelated to photo", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "text": "This is from Cumberland Gap, Tennessee...it is the Regimental Headquarters for the 63 TN Vol In....what is bad is I did not notice or read the sign when I took the photo.  I was just admiring the logs and windows, etc.  I would love to own this place!*********************What I have been meaning to blog about for a long time is blogging.  Specifically comments.  I love getting comments, and I love leaving comments.  But I don't always have time to do all I want to do.  I may get behind for days, and then will have a day or two where I try to catch up on all the blogs I read/look at. I like a variety of blogs...some I go to for friendship.   Some I love for the photos.  Then there are quilt blogs I visit for inspiration.  A few are a combination of those listed above.I have a favor to ask some of you...you can set how your comment form appears.  It can come up as a full page, as a little pop up window, or embedded below the post.  I definitely prefer for the comment form to be in the form of the little pop up window....that way I can still refer back to what I wanted to comment on.  Specially if I get interrupted.  How many times does the phone ring, or hubby ask me something, or Lorelei wants me, or a cat wants in...sometimes I get right back to the computer, others it may be hours.Even the full page is not bad, because there is a link to click and at least see what was said in the post...The one comment form that I really hate is the form that is embedded below the post. First I type the comment, then I have to choose what type of profile I have;  then I hit submit.  It disappears as if I'm done, but then if I happen to pause, it comes up again, this time with my name...then I hit submit again.  Again it disappears, only to reappear with word verification.  What is more, with this type of comment form, I have to turn my 3rd party cookies on, which I normally keep turned off.  Not to mention, I hate to think of how many times I have commented and thought I was done, only to discover that I had clicked to another page before the word verification came up.  Therefore, I just wasted my time and that blog got one less comment than it would have.I used to use word verification, then read a post by Betsy about how she has her comment form set...I forget just how she had hers set...but I set mine similar to hers.  I turned off word verification and will probably never use it again.  I do not accept anonymous comments, though I do have the option of rejecting or publishing them, I also have mine set to moderate any comment on a post older than a few days...I know there are a lot of us that really have/or have had trouble with the embedded comment form...so if you want to change yours, and don't know how....it is under the settings tab on your blogger dashboard...click on the tab comments and go from there.  I for one would really appreciate it.I will probably still visit your blog, even if you don't...but it would really be a help if that is changed..."},
{"title": "Sawtooth Star, Double 4-patch", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2011", "text": "The above photo is a cropped portion of the barn below. Again, this is a barn in Tennessee...on one of the roads less traveled.  I would say we were driving for 2 or 3 hours and maybe passed a dozen cars....if even that.  Of course, it was a weekday and people were probably at work.  Still, that is not many cars...specially if you consider all the area we covered.And I keep forgetting to tell this little tidbit...we were way back in the hills.  Now, almost all the roads we were on were paved...but a lot of them only had just enough room for one vehicle.  If you are meeting someone, you have to look for a place to pull off to the side..Anyway, picture a road like that, and green, green hills on either side.  And we come across a couple guys working on a fence...we stopped to talk a minute.  The one guy turns around  and guess what?  He has a Colts t-shirt on....Roger introduced himself to them, and they did the same...well, the one in the t-shirt was the son-in-law of the other guy...and that son-in-law was from Franklin, Indiana!It just goes to show how small the world is.  One time several years ago, one of my boss's daughters was in Switzerland...she got on a train and sat down beside someone.  They realized they were both American.  So they each inquired of the other about what state they were from.  Imagine, both are from Indiana.  Of course, the next question is...what city....and both answer oh, a small town you have never heard of....guess what...they were both from Rosedale (population 725 in 2010)...well, at least that is their mailing address.  Just imagine meeting each other for the first time thousands of miles from home...across an ocean, in fact."},

I was able to get out of the vehicle and walk fairly close to get these...You can click on each one to enlarge it...it was an overcast day so they are kind of grainy. I have a hard time focusing in normal conditions so an overcast day is really tricky for me. *********************My MRI showed I had a tear in my rotator cuff...plus there was a thinning of it and also it showed some calcification.  I see a specialist June 1, if all goes well.  I have no idea what to expect.**************The toot and her mommy came down Thursday and spent the night...we did not make it a creek because we figured they were all still too high...and today in our rambling drive we did confirm that the ones close to here are way too high.   There is one that is about half way between here and her house that would have been okay...so maybe next time we can meet there."},
{"title": "Look me in the eye...", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2011", "text": "This little fellow was just outside the kitchen door yesterday...he is not the same one that used to come here but I wonder if he is one of her offspring.  It did not seem to bother him when I was right down in his face almost to take his picture.  It was an overcast day so had shallow depth of field.  I can only say I hope he stays around...and I hope Lorelei gets to see him.If she is anything like our girls, and I am pretty sure she is going to be, she will love almost all wild things.  Speaking of her, they went to Lowe's for something yesterday, and they had a water fountain set up...she looked at her mom and asked her where the rocks were...I did tell you that she loved throwing rocks in the creek in Tennessee, didn't I?Sarah and I are anxiously waiting for the creeks to go down enough to take her to one here and let her play all she wants to.    It would be fun if it was when her Aunt comes home towards the end of the month or first of June...I can't wait to see her and can't wait to see Lorelei's reaction to her.  Cause Lorelei still mentions her occasionally.  I sure hope someday not too terrible far in the future, her aunt gets to move closer to home.I wonder if one ever gets totally used to their children living far away...sometimes I am okay with it, but sometimes I get so lonesome for her...we passed the turn off for her apartment one day last week and I thought if only...but would rather her to be where she is and doing what she wants to do than to be back here in her old job....and I never go to Terre Haute that I don't wish Lorelei still lived there.  That way if her mom wanted to go back to work, she would have a built in babysitter..."},
{"title": "My irises are starting to bloom...", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2011", "text": "This is a new iris to me...it was in a mixed bag I got a couple years ago.  I think this is the first time it has bloomed.  It is a beauty. Some of the others are blooming, but I have not taken photos of them....I don't know why.  I guess I have been in a kind of funk.I haven't wanted to bore everyone with things...but hopefully one of them is over with.  Roger had another spell of being broken out in this rash.  I am not even sure how long it took to get over it, but probably at least 8 weeks, with three trips to the doctor.  Maybe even longer.  It just seemed like he was never going to get over it.  He was in a lot of misery...even while we were in Tennessee.  It was the nights down there....soon as we tried to go to bed, he would start itching.When we came home he saw our doctor....he had just seen the nurse practitioners prior to this.  And I am not saying anything against them...I really like both of them.  A lot.  But our doctor is older than both of them ...I am sure she has been a doctor longer than either of them has been a nurse practitioner.  She ran a couple tests this time...which told her it was not lupus and not an allergic reaction.Then there is me.  My shoulder has been bothering me for months now.  Started out kind of stiff...then there were certain things I would do that would hurt so bad.  I kept thinking it would disappear just as mysteriously as it appeared.  No such luck.  I am not in constant unbearable pain with it....but moments of excruciating pain when I try to do certain things.  And it is getting hard to find ways to sleep that it doesn't hurt slightly.  Just enough to not be able to sleep.Anyway, I  had x-rays a couple weeks ago, then an MRI today...so will find out if anything is going on.  We are hoping that therapy will do the trick.  The doctor gave me a medicine to reduce swelling and pain, plus a topical ointment....and a couple exercises to do in the meantime.  I think the medicine is already reducing the pain and I think I am getting more movement back...Through this with the both of us, I hope we have learned to go to our regular Dr. when it is something like this...I bet she would have had Roger over his rash long ago, and if not would have  been working on finding out what it is.  She says if it comes back again, she is going to run more tests."},

{"title": "What is left behind...", "date": "Saturday, May 7, 2011", "text": "That stove there in the corner...that is the stove our mom cooked thousands of meals on.  Hard to believe that someone my age remembers their mom cooking on a wood burning cook stove.  My brother and I often talk about how we were raised. It was as if we were from an older generation....I doubt that there are many people our age that actually remembers and grew up using stoves like this.I am pretty sure that all of us at one time or another carried in wood and kindling for this stove...and probably at one time or another, all of us sat by it to get warm while we waited for breakfast.Our mom was not perfect....but I won't go into that.  Probably never will on here.  But I will say there are 8 of us children and not one of us thinks the other is making up stuff...we all have good memories made up of things we done with each other...for that I am very thankful.  I really don't know how we would have made it without each other.But along with that, I know that some of us  think about how our mom lived and worked and never really had any of the normal things we take for granted.  Just so many little things we  don't even give a second thought....As far as I know, my mom did not have her hair cut by a beautician till after I left home, in 1975.  I think some of my sisters would give her a home perm when they were home for a visit.  And she may have had a sister that gave her one every now and then, but I am not sure about that.Mom did not drive, so she was lucky to get to town once a month when I was young, but as us kids got older and got our driver's license, we took her.  I am not sure how often my brothers took her, it still may have just been once every two or three weeks....why go when you don't have money to spend?  I do think once I got my license, we went more often.Mom wasted very little money.  About the only thing we ever spent extra was if we found a paperback western by Zane Grey....and every now and then one by Grace Livingston Hill or Emile Loring...but mainly the only ones we bought new were Zane Grey.  You just cannot imagine how excited we were when we found one.  I don't recall how it was decided who got to read it first...cause my mom and I and my oldest brother read every one we could get our hands on...not sure about Neal back then.  I know he has since read them.Also, once in a blue moon there would be a magazine with a picture of a quilt in it, or even an article about quilting. Before she died, there were at least a couple quilting magazines, but I don't know what she would think now with all the different magazines dedicated to nothing but quilting.  (And talking about quilting, I would be afraid to hear her reaction to my stash of quilting fabric.)When I have company coming, I can easily run to the store for anything I need.  And I really don't have to worry about how I am going to pay for it.  Mom would usually try to get to the store if she knew one of my siblings was coming home for a visit, but she couldn't just go and buy whatever she wanted...she had to sit down and decide just what she basically had to have.  For the life of me, I don't recall what those things were...probably eggs, and maybe bacon...depending on if we were milking at the time, she might have had to buy milk and butter, also she would probably have bought chicken to fry and ground beef for a meatloaf.Other than that, she could come up with a meal from all the stuff she canned and stuff she put in the freezer.  And probably even some of the bacon she used was from hogs we butchered.  She was quick and efficient in the kitchen...and cooked three full meals every day that we had company.When it was just us, she cooked breakfast...but not always a big breakfast.  That being said, she always made a pan of biscuits.  And she cooked a full meal at lunch, which we always called dinner....and she always made at least one pan of cornbread.  When I was young, she usually made two pans.Then when supper rolled around, she warmed up what was left from dinner, and if more was needed she would cook little bit something extra....fried okra, fried green tomatoes, or whatever.  But mostly, she cooked enough for both dinner and supper when she fixed the noon meal.These are just a few of the most obvious things...I will hush about it now...just wanted to spend a bit of time thinking about the positive things about mom.So, being that Mother's Day is tomorrow, I hope all of you have a wonderful day and that you get to be with the ones you love...."},

This is Lorelei playing in water, of course!And here we have Jackson on his slide, with Lorelei peaking out.  I think you can tell by the smiling face how much she enjoyed him.....I love the look in Lorelei's eyes as she looks at her daddy....and you all know who this is....They are sitting on upstream from the mill in Cumberland Gap--that is the headwaters for Gap Creek....it goes by home.  By the time it gets the few miles down there, it is wide enough to flood fields when we have a lot of rain...and also floods the road in two places by home.  There is a way out through another farm...but the average person would not be able to do that. There were two or three summers that we played in that creek almost every single day....and it was always so cold....but George mentioned that when they were at the Gap last summer that it was warm....that totally surprised me.  My brother said that now when the water level gets real low, that it does get warmer. In recent years, since they put the tunnel through the mountain for the road, Gap Creek gets lower than we have ever seen it.  Plus there is a spring up near our old place that almost goes dry....and that is something else we had never seen until the Cumberland Gap Tunnel was built."},
{"title": "What memories are made of....", "date": "Saturday, April 30, 2011", "text": "Give me some grass string bailing twine and it is the thing of memories for me. This is the old walnut tree down home...it has swung more children and provided more hours of entertainment than any store bought item ever could. It is in poor health now, and covered with ivy.  It seemed a giant when I was a kid...we almost always had 3 or 4 swings in it.  We all played on them...played tag if you can believe that.  All the grandchildren swung in that tree at one time or another.  Any cousins that came swung in them.  Or any other kid....you could swing as high as possible and never have to worry about a swing set turning over.Of course, they were made of grass string...usually the first few feet around the tree limb was a piece of chain.    And not just light-weight chain either.  It was stuff that had weight to it....I don't remember how they were attached to the limb.  Then we would double or triple the length of grass string, I think sometimes we braided it, and tied it to the end of the chain. I do remember playing in one one time, by myself, and the chain came loose and hit me in the head.  I do remember crying, but I don't remember if I told mom or dad. Our seat was a length of board, with notches cut in each end....Now when I am out, I cannot help but see trees and think what a great place to put swings, or a tree house.  Some are just made for children...but swings in trees are very seldom seen these days.   They are there in the corner of my mind though...just one of those thoughts that are a pleasant to think on."},

I did managed to capture a couple of the main ones--the mockingbird and the cardinal.  I thought the above photo a catbird, but not so sure.Even though this one of the cardinal is blurred, I still like it.   It is a cropped portion of the original photo.I did not manage to capture the wrens though, and I think they were the most vocal of all.  They had babies somewhere but I could not find the nest...even though I was close to it.  The first night there one was really scolding me....but after that no matter where I looked I got no reaction.  But I did see it come from around the house carrying the messes from its nest....I also saw a couple chickadees, indigo buntings, bluebirds, and two or three types of sparrows.  Oh, and what I assume was a swallow of some kind had a nest under the eave of the garage.  I could never see it for more than a few seconds.***********Roger and I have both been exhausted since getting home.  Yesterday  and today has been sunny and beautiful with bright blue skies.  There is a chance of thunderstorms moving back in Saturday night...which is the last thing we need.  I heard on our local news that farmers are so far behind in their planting because the ground is so saturated.I also have a flip side to the piece I posted for yesterday, but it is so negative I just haven't had the heart to write it.  One of these days I will though...just not now.  I have for the most part put it behind me and would just as soon forget it, but feel like I would not be truthful if I didn't tell that side."},

With no sun, the mountains are a richer green than they might appear  otherwise....and in distant places there is a mist.There is a mental mist that settles over me.  Tears come to my eyes, but  I blame them on my bangs getting in my eyes.  It has been almost four  years since I have been embraced by these green, green mountains of my  youth.I wonder what makes us the way we are.  Of us children, I think I still  feel a part of this land more than any of my other siblings that have  moved away.  For sure of the girls....my brother that lives close to  Sarah feels much the same as me, but I am not sure it claims him as much  as it does me.  At other times, I think it is even more so with him.So much has changed in some ways....in physical ways.  The road by home  has been paved....even the old rocky hill is paved.  That is almost a  miracle.  Prior to paving, it was almost like trying to a car up a set  of steps.  No exaggeration.  And if your car wasn't dirty when you turned  down the road, by the time you drive a mile...it would have a thick coat  of dust on it.There are homes built in fields that I once played in...barns have  burned down...fences have been removed.  Other places have been taken  over by a wild growth of weeds, bushes, and briars.But the things that matter have not changed.  People are still good  neighbors, they are glad to see you, and willing to give a  helping hand.I must admit I hate seeing houses in fields I once was free to roam, but I still love the good hearted people that make up the majority of the population.****************************We have been in Tennessee the past few days....I wrote the above and took those pictures the day I got there.

Night before last, I just unplugged both the surge protectors that the computers, etc were on.  I like having surge protectors in case we aren't here and it storms, but even with them if it is storming bad, I unplug anyway.  I am lost without the computer, even for a few hours and cannot imagine if I had to wait days to replace them.I have been busy the past couple of days and not been blogging...I plan to try to visit everyone tonight but going to be pretty busy the next few days.

Well, it was under a dozen but still seeing 6 or 8 is a lot for me.  And the minute they see me, in my Rav4, they take off at a fast walk.  When I get near, they first duck down till it is almost impossible to see them.  BUT, if I just pause a few seconds their heads come back off and they take off running again.There were several killdeer....they must have nests the way they act.  Or else are very close to nesting.  I think they are such a pretty little bird.Every night for the past week, at least on the nights we were home, the lower the sun has gotten, the more stunning the sunset has been.  That is why I ran out there tonight...but this right here was as pretty as it got.  Mind you, I do think this is beautiful....but usually if I am out there it is like watching a picture show with the sky changing dramatically over the last half hour or so.  It just didn't happen tonight.It was worth going though....I saw deer, geese, blue herons, and one of the swans...Oh, and I saw the American Bittern but only got a quick shot of it as it flew away.  I saw from behind sitting at the edge of the water from several feet back....so I pulled up with the clump of grass between us, and got out of the car and walked over within 5 feet of the clump of grass and could not spot it. I forgot and had on nice shoes, and Roger had cleaned the Rav so I really did not want to get real muddy.  I turned around and headed back the Rav...and turned around to look one more time and up it flew right from where I knew it was but could not see.  That shows how well camouflaged they are."},

I don't know why....I very seldom go back and read it...but sometimes if I want to know when something happened, I can do a word search of my email and have the answer.  Cause I share most of the happenings in our life with my best buddies.I have a couple friends that I grew up with...that we email back and forth.  One more than the other most of the time...but still the one that is more like once a week still knows what is going on.  I would be lost without email now.  Before email, there was snail mail. I didn't save  a lot of snail mail....but above you see a collection of letters from my younger days.  Before our first child was born, even. I was not quite 25 at the time I received most of the letters above.I have been thinking about getting them out and reading them for a while now, so tonight while going through emails and re-reading them, I thought about these old letters and thought it a good time to drag them out.  I only read a snitch here and there while I was taking these pictures, but oh, were we ever young then!  Now keep in mind that this best friend also became my sister-in-law.In one of the paragraphs I read, my niece who was not a year old, had had them up most of the night, and at 5:30 was yelling Mommy! Bottle! Daddy!....so that was how their day began.  When I start to read them in earnest, I am thinking I will laugh and I will cry...I will probably need kleenexes...there will be more memories than my heart can hold."},

I should get up and go to the strip pits...I have not been out there at sunset in a while...but I am not going.  So I am showing this photo that was taken from my back door the other night.I haven't did a whole lot today, but did get the chairs on my front porch scrubbed, and washed the side of the house that is under the awning.  You just would not believe how dirty it was.  BUT, I did not scrub the porch itself.  Maybe I will do that tomorrow.This got me to thinking....does anyone do spring house cleaning like they used to do?  I know one woman that still does...she literally goes over each room in her house with a fine tooth comb.    Other than this lady, I don't know of anyone that really does a thorough job.  I know I sure don't, even if it does need it.We used to always go through the house each spring.  I don't know that we did it all my life every spring, but I do remember taking the mattress and box springs down and I think we took them out to have them in the sun while we cleaned the rest of the room.  And the old box springs used to not be covered...so they would need to be dusted.I remember washing walls...I think mainly in the kitchen....I don't know how often we painted.  For sure not every year...probably not even every other year. I think now my spring cleaning is when I scrub the lawn/porch chairs...and I do usually wash windows and curtains.  Then the rest is hit or miss..."},

She finally just gave up and turned back into their neighborhood and Lorelei said, \"No, Mommy!  Go, go, go!'  So, Sarah just passed through and she went on to sleep in just a few miles."},
{"title": "A sure sign that spring has arrived....", "date": "Saturday, April 9, 2011", "text": "We got up to thunderstorms this morn...they rolled around, left and then came back a time or two.  Everything got a good soaking...in fact, some places still have puddles of water even though the sun was out before noon.You might think the sure sign of spring I was talking about is the thunderstorms, but in fact, I meant that the buzzards are back in full force.  Roger worked around in his shop all morn, while I fooled in here...playing on the computer and making a meatloaf...about the time we got done with lunch a friend of mine stopped by.  I ask her if she wanted a bite to eat, but she didn't care for anything.  We took our Cokes and sat on the front porch in the shade and visited for a few minutes.After she left, Roger and I decided to go for a drive.  Any direction we looked, we saw buzzards circling.  I do not know what about this area draws them, but there are just so many of them.  Last year they were like this, and we went down south of Terre Haute at least a couple of different times, and hardly saw any.  We both just could not believe the difference in the number.Now, I saw a few along all winter on the way to Sarah's house...but it would be like one or two.  And only that...oh, and speaking of Sarah's house....here is a little video that she sent me of a new singing star.  Enjoy!"},
{"title": "Hanging around....", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2011", "text": "Though I really don't see a lot of people hanging out clothes these days, other than the Amish, most times if I see clothespins on a line, they are like the single one  above...that one that is pinched on the clothesline....not the ones hanging upside down.  Then, this morning I was blog hopping...actually looking at quilting blogs for a few minutes....just trying to get a little inspiration and one of the girls had a picture of clothespins on the line, and they were hanging upside down...like mine below.I have just spent 30 minutes trying to find that blog again, and cannot for the life of me find where I seen it.  But I had been meaning to do a post about clothespins for a while now, and being that Roger re-set my clotheslines posts this week, I thought now would be a good time to do it.Anyway, there is a method to my madness....I always keep mine hanging upside down, their 'jaws' around the line for the simple reason they are easy to slide along as I need them.  You know how sometimes you hang out socks and need one every 3 or 4 inches, then other times it is towels and you need one every couple of feet....if the clothespins are just hanging there like above, it is a simple matter to just slide them along in front of the towels.  Or if you need a lot and they are more scattered....you can just walk along sliding them back to where you need them.Now my mom, nor my BFF's mom never, ever left their clothespins on the line....I don't know why.  I think because of how weathered they become...they wear out quicker.  Back then, they did not have money just to throw away...they took care of what they had.  A few cents here and a few cents there really adds up.I went to plastic for outside because of the organic nature of wood...if I leave them out, they get really, really nasty.  I think because of all the traffic, being that we are in a small town...it stirs up more dust that settles on the clothespins and they get just black and gritty.  But even the plastic ones wear out quicker being in all the extreme temps....I will go to hang something up one side of the pin will simply break.And notice the size of the  clothespins above...I needed some new plastic ones, so one day Roger was headed to the store.  I told him to pick me up a new bag of plastic clothespins...those huge ones are what he came home with!  Our local Wal-mart does not carry the small ones any more.  The big ones do not have as strong of a spring and are not as good.  No matter how I pinch them over the clothes on the line...if it is windy, it seems like they slide together.So, I was looking at Wal-mart at the wooden ones....all they had were the ones made in China.  I have been that route before, and if things have not changed, they are not worth carrying home.  They come apart at the spring at the least little thing.  Several years ago, I either read it in Heloise's hints or heard Martha Stewart tell to make sure to get the ones Made In MAINE...mind you not the Main Stay brand that Walmart carries.  So, that was what I done several years ago, and I am still using those down in the basement.When we went over to Arthur, Illinois at the beginning of the week, we went to this Miller's Dry Goods that is out in the country...I found two packages of the wooden ones made in Maine and I grabbed them up too quick to talk about.There now...isn't that the longest thing you have ever read on clothespins????"},

It is located where it is not very convenient to stop....and there were several cars.  And even yesterday on first going by, there was too much traffic but on my way home I wound my way back by and got a couple of hurried pics.These are not the best...the only little, little lamb I captured is in that black one in the last pic....but on farther in a corner were these little, woolly bundles....just so little.  I have never been around sheep, but I think I would really enjoy them.  I just love to hear their little bleating calls.It has been another nice day here...with the clouds gathering a few times but dispersing for the sun to shine again.  Now, I think they have returned to stay.  We are supposed to be getting rain over the next few days.  I am not sure about the percentage of chances but I do know thunderstorms are predicted over the next several days.  Hopefully I won't complain too much.Does anyone besides us watch American Idol?  Is is one of the few shows we like to watch...and some years are not as good as others.  Read that as some years I really, really get into it and others I just watch it cause it is better than anything else.  Well, this year, in my opinion, they have a group of really talented contestants...there is only one I really don't like but I won't say his name.  And there is a girl I am not crazy about, but it is more her personality than her singing ability. Anyway, it is one year, that is sort of hard to choose who I want to win.  I think this makes the fourth season we have watched it...I think I know who I want to win though I sort of waver between a couple of them, but if he don't so long as the one guy does not win I won't be mad."},

I won't get right in their face with the camera either...and have gotten permission to take photos at one of their places. I would have been just as happy with this photo if it had not had the kid in it....************This was going to be a photoless day, but went ahead and uploaded the one above.  I really need to go on a good drive to see what I can find.  I am about out of things to post, unless I do repeats.We have been to Wally World as we call Wal-mart.  Just to pick up a few items...then we came home and Roger has been moving my clotheslines over.  The posts had to be reset, so he moved them over.  We had put them up long before we built our garage.  When we built the garage, it took my gardening spot, and the only place that was left was under the clothesline.  Well actually right beside the clothesline...but we have gradually widened the little strip till one of the lines was actually over the garden.While he has been doing that, I have gotten a load of stuff together for the Light House Mission.  Roger dropped it off when he had to run pick up some concrete mix....but I need to go make some more decisions about what to get rid of.  There is just so much stuff crammed into this little house.  I am amazed it does not burst at the seams.I have several year's worth of a couple quilting magazines....I think about getting rid of them, but I hate to.  I do look back through them...and more than once a year.  Usually a couple times;-)  I do not receive any magazines at all now...I figure I can find what I need on line....whether it be inspiration or instructions.Well, I need to get busy with something...the sun is shining and the wind is blowing.

Not any flying across the road...I crept along for a couple or three more miles...the only things stirring were red-winged blackbirds and robins...I was about ready to leave when I spotted this little lady out of the corner of my eye.  I was almost past her, so backed up.  All the time I am backing up, she is running away.  I finally paused and tried to capture her....she was moving so fast I could not focus on her.  You can still tell what she is, but that is about all.  There was also a male ring-necked pheasant but he was on the far side...to far for my poor lens.After the pheasant, this strip pit was just a few feet farther...it was teaming with life.  I first noticed these two blue herons.  Again, they are too far for a very good photo, but at least this are a record of what I saw.  And I witnessed both of them catching and eating a fish, but was not quick enough to capture them eating them.Next I noticed this little wading bird...I am not sure what he is.  I think a sandpiper of some sort.There were several of them, but this one was the only one close enough to capture.There were these diving birds, but my photos are too poor to even show on here..but they will dive completely under the water for several seconds and come up several feet away...you never know where they are going to pop up....I also showed another prized capture on my Time Stand Still blog...besides that, on the way out there was a herd of 10 deer....and I saw four more male pheasants.Edited to add:  Thanks go to Montanagirl who suggested this might be a common snipe...after googling it, I do believe she is right."},

I have read though where the day is set by the particular order one belongs to...********************I plan to have some clothes flapping in the wind in a bit...it is cloudy and cold, but I don't think we are going to get any rain or light rain and snow mix as was predicted!  This is kind of hard to take after having several days of shirt-sleeve weather.  But as long as warm days are just around the corner, I will deal with it.  The house was 64º this morn, so had to kick the heat back on.We haven't had breakfast yet...just coffee.  Much of the time we are not hungry when we first get up and will fool around an hour or two before we even think about eating;  looks like today it is going to be even longer.ETA:  Just hung up my clothes and there were just  few little snowflakes.

I love sitting outside and having a cup of coffee or a coke, but having breakfast out there is even better.  Or brunch might be a better word.  We had a BLT minus the L this morn....Often when I make BLTs it brings to mind a neighbor and his son.  The son was grown...in his 20's at least but a little bit mentally challenged.  The dad had a garage in back where he worked on vehicles...Eric helped.  Well, the dad was going to be gone and ask Roger to keep an eye on things and ask if we would fix lunch for Eric.I decided to fix BLTs and when we fix BLTs we are not skimpy with the bacon.  I really piled it on...he ate the first one...he ate another just as loaded, and I think another...and looked to me for more.  By then I was out of bacon and he had to make do with what he had had.  He was content, but had just really liked them.  It made me wonder if he had ever had them before."},

I also felt the urge to go for a drive, again, didn't want to get out and it rain.  So, I fooled around, cooked a late lunch, and finally decided it was not going to rain.  I first went by West Union Bridge looking for the eagles that we have seen near there a couple times but no luck.  I rambled around, only seeing wild turkeys in the wildlife department.I saw calves at several places...and little bitty lambs.  The lambs were always in a place I was afraid to stop for more than a second.  I was on the final jog home...meaning I actually knew where I was at....and got the shot above.This was at a farm where we actually know the owner...I had just waved as I passed him, and just on down the road a bit there in their pasture was this sight...I quick shot this shot...it is a bit out of focus but it still is probably my favorite of the day.  I wish I had went back and asked Jim the story but they looked busy, plus I was thinking Roger probably wondered where in the world I was at.  So I just took the one shot and headed on home..."},

I thought his one had a cute little face, too.This farm did have 3 horses, for the longest time.  But I have not seen any of them in a long time so don't know what happened to them.

And tonight's sky was so beautiful.I am not proud of any of these pics, but they at least give you a feel for what is out there...I only saw the single pair of swans.  The last time I was out there there was at least a dozen on this pond.  That is a beaver's home they are by in the photo...beavers are one thing I have not yet seen.I saw this single Northern Harrier; this is the only shot I got of him...it is a cropped portion of the original.  I am hoping he stays the whole summer.This is the only pheasant that was anyway near close enough for me to try to photograph, and it was running almost the entire time...I think he actually paused just a minute in the photo above.*******************It was overcast almost the entire day, with rain all afternoon...off and on.  Not a steady downpour or anything like that. I was totally surprised when the sun popped out and the sky cleared.I spent an hour or more of the day getting our printer installed on the new computer; I don't care what I do with a computer, it is never simple.  I guess this could be expected...the printer is 6 years old so definitely needed different drivers, etc.  Once I got them installed, I tried to print something and couldn't because one of the print cartridges was out of date.  Always before I could over-ride that...but not this time.  I had to stop and run to Walmart to get one...after that and after jumping through a couple more hoops, it now works fine.Tomorrow is a new day...hopefully I will get more done than I did today."},

So far, other than Lorelei's birthday there has been nothing I wanted to show.  I lucked out today and found this baby quilt that I was just finishing for a neighbor's first granddaughter.The back of it is pieced...among some of us quilters we call it back art.  I love having something out of the ordinary for the back.  It is an added little surprise.I am almost positive this quilt was 60 inches long, give or take an inch or  two.  And I know it was between 40 and 45 inches wide.  It is all  machine quilted and pieced and was probably the last quilt I quilted on  my Pfaff before I got my Juki.  And even though it was baby quilt size, I  struggled with quilting it.  Now, with my Juki 98Q, I think nothing of  one 90 inches square.***************I should have mentioned last  night that Lorelei and family lives not that terrible far from the Indianapolis International Airport, so she sees lots of planes, down low.  I don't know if that is what has got her so intrigued with them or if she would have found them fascinating anyway.And I wanted to let everyone know that Roger is on the mend...I suppose it is going to take a while for it all to disappear and to completely stop itching.  His swelling is down, also.  So things are definitely looking up.It has been a gorgeous day here, and I did hang out a couple loads of clothes.  I will be going to bed on sheets that have hung all day in the wind and sunshine...Other than that we got a new computer, and I spent the afternoon getting the old one taken down and the new one hooked up...I only made one phone call to my brother...with what else but a dumb, dumb question.  And I scared myself a time or two after that.  With those, I think it was more a thing of just being really tired and not thinking straight, and they were more like a little pause before I saw what I where I was wrong."},

We think it turned out quite well.*********************I have not been tell all that is going on, now wish I had or wish I had at least been writing in my journal.  Over a week ago, my husband had this big splotch of stuff come up on his leg...not sure if it came up before he scratched it or if scratching caused it.  He calls it psoriasis but I am not sure what it was.It was not getting any better, so he went to the doctor last Friday...she put him on antibiotics to help prevent infections, and gave him one medicine to take orally to help give him relief from itching as well as a creme.I am here to tell you, it has gradually gotten worse and worse...his whole body is broken out...his feet and legs have been swelling.  The big splotch is gone, but now it is raised bumps and some blisters just everywhere.So we went back to the doctor today...she could not believe the difference....just really couldn't believe what he looked like now.  Told him to stop the antibiotic immediately, gave him a shot of cortisone, lasix for water retention, plus another one....and she wanted blood to test his liver functions since he has a history of problems with it.We had to wait to have the blood drawn, so was sent back to the waiting room...soon as we sat down he said he felt like he was going to pass out...and I was trying to tell him to bend over and put his head between his knees but he passed out before I could even get it said....I was trying to get him to wake up and one of the staff yelled for Doc and he came, they got him in the floor and raised his legs, and he came too in just a second...and his blood  pressure went to normal and his pupils started reacting normal....I am here to tell you I have had enough excitement to last a lifetime...just not a fun way to spend the day...he is now trying to rest some since he did not sleep at all last night."},

Roger and I came home Friday night, only for me to go back Saturday morn to Sarah's.  The flu or whatever it was did not want to give up the hold it had on her.Lorelei is over the runny nose...poor little girl.  It is a wonder her nose was not sore as a boil with the number of times she had to blow it.  But at least she knew how to blow.How that little girl is changing...every time I tell a few things about her I realize later I forgot other things.  So realize with what I am telling now, I am still probably leaving out something.She got her wand and started telling her Papaw to 'freeze'--where she learned that is more than we know.  She would tell him freeze and he would make a crazy face and freeze and she would just giggle and think it so funny.And when I was back over there she was playing hide and go seek with me...she does not count of course but she understands the concept of hiding.....again, she giggles the entire time.  (I should say she counts, she does not understand the concept of counting before coming to find me.)They came by here yesterday....well, I have a china cabinet that is full of treasures.  She wanted to look at them and was standing in the chair.  Her mommy told her to sit down or she was going to be spanked...Lorelei tells her no.  In the end Sarah swatted her bottom once and set her down.  Well, in a bit she got back up, and her dad is in here by then..and he tells her to sit down and she won't, so he swats her bottom and sits her down.  Now the swatting is just symbolic..it is not hard enough to hurt...but she has all these big old tears, and comes crying to me and says \"Daddy spank\", trying to get her daddy in trouble.And sometime during the time of their visit, she was playing with the 'seat belts' in this child's rocker chair we have for her.  And she was getting furious...really showing her temper....and let out a scream and her daddy really got on to her about it....and he explained to her to just be patient, etc...she calmed down and was able to do what she wanted which is play with the clips...and as she fastens them, and she says in this weak, tear-filled voice '\"Thank-you daddy.\""},

She started jumping up and down and yelling Mamaw! Papaw! over and over.I cannot believe how she has changed...yet it is hard to explain it in mere words.  She has such an active imagination...when she was here last time she was pretending to be dragon.  She growls and holds her hands up like they are claws and she is going to attack.  She has also been pretending to cook for a while.  And she has the tea parties.  But she has now started to pretend to pick up 'stuff' and give it to each of us.And she was getting behind stuff and popping up and saying Surprise!!! and we would laugh and that would just make her do  it more.Her daddy got down in the floor, first laying on his belly, then on his back.  Both ways she sat on him on his lower back/belly and would raise his tee-shirt up and stick her feet and legs in it.  And set there with this smug smile on her face.

Almost every time I am out there I see several male pheasants but not females...last night that streak of luck changed.  I spotted these four hens together.  As you can tell by the photo they were skedaddling away the minute I slowed down.  Not a great picture but at least proof that I saw some....and I saw some more in the distance.Then there were the swans....these were at the pond the geese in the previous post were attempting to land in. And there were a couple Northern Harriers...I was surprised to see them.  What is so strange in regards to them is this though.  When we first started noticing them, it was not uncommon to see a dozen in the air at once...and it was very common to see them hovering  in the air.  Like a hummingbird.  Now, we very seldom see more than two or three out there...and I cannot even remember the last time I saw one hovering in the air.Of course there were the red-winged blackbirds....always fun to see them.I am trying to patiently wait for the dickcissel and the bobolink...I will be a while yet before they show up.

I was at this one pond where there were at several swans...I was focused on one group but did not even count them because the pics were not at all good.  Well, I was getting ready to get back in the Rav4 and here flew these three geese...and they started to land.  Just as I took the picture they did this crazy break up...kind of like someone starting to land a plane for the first time and pulling up just as they are about to touch down.  Only the geese were not really close to the water.Well, I shot this one pic, and while getting in the Rav4 continued to watch them.  They regrouped a couple more times to come in for a landing on the water, only to put on the brakes and do that crazy break up.....almost as if they had never landed on water before.  They never did touch down, but regrouped and flew off.I did not realize I had capture them quite this way till I downloaded them to the computer.  And even then when I first saw it, I thought it was my imagination...then when I opened it up big, I saw that I wasn't seeing things.

Or if you just love barns, you can go there for links to see more.************I was just sitting here thinking bout all the beautiful country and unique things we have seen in traveling the county roads going at a snail's pace part of the time.  I bet there are people that have lived here all their lives and not seen any of it.  I have lived here 30+ and am just now seeing it.  Any time we go anywhere, we always see roads we wish we could travel down.  And if we stayed in the car 40 hours a week, it would be hard to cover all the area.Most people have jobs they go to every day, and things to do once they get home so they don't have time not energy to ramble around.  I know when I worked at the orchard, I had little energy left for anything other than the things that were absolutely necessary.  So, I am not being critical...just making an observation.But if you have the time, take a round-about way going to and from things...it is fun to discover new things and places.Just to get out a little bit, we headed north....I was sort of looking for the place in the post day before yesterday with all the big rocks....we didn't find it but we found the road in the first photo above...we have been down part of it before, one time. I recognized this barn, and have posted a different view of it but cannot supply the link at this time.We have been through this bridge before, but I did not remember it at all; the other time we were through here it was in the summertime.

So give them a chance if you dare.These are views I have pasted before, but ran across them last night when I was trying to upload some more of the photos that I deleted a couple years ago.  Then, we were watching a couple shows on PBS tonight....the last one was one of the guy above, the one that sings second and plays mandolin.  His name is Sam Bush and he used to play with New Grass Revival...now a mandolin is a lonesome sounding instrument to me.  And I love them...and the whole tone of this song pulls at my heart.See that line of trees in the photo below...it is the creek in the picture above...and when I was a kid and it rained a lot...the creek would flood and cover that whole field...and if it didn't flood a lot all the crawdad holes would have water bubbling up out of them....Have you seen crawdad holes?  I will try to think and take a photo of some when I go home.  But for now check here...that field would have them all over...and when the water was bubbling, it was not uncommon for me to get down on my hands and knees and take a drink.  I don't know if anyone else did it, but I think they did.  How we didn't catch some awful disease, I do not know.  Must have been God watching over us.We are planning on going down as soon as it gets good and warm, but hopefully before the heat of summer....and the Lorelei and her mommy and daddy might drive down, too. Speaking of them, they did come today.  First they stopped at a bank in Terre Haute to close an account they had there...Sarah said when they went in Lorelei started just crying, wanting to see her Papaw and Mamaw...And from there they ran by the hospital there to see new baby on Jeremy's side of the family...and all the time they were there she was wanting to come see Mamaw and Papaw.  She comes in here just like a big girl....as if she owns the place....she for sure owns our heart.  Sometimes I just hate for her to grow up, but I know that is the plan...and really I wouldn't want her to stay a child...it is so fun watch her learn how to do things and to see her figure things out.  It is sort of that she just changes so much in the few days we don't see her.***********************************I am posting this song...you may or may not have heard of Ralph Stanley...well this one is from his son.

I wonder if I would like it as much now as I did when young.Anyway, this is the barn he belonged to....one of the nicer ones we have run across.  How would you like to have to put new roofing on it?  I totally understand how some don't have the money to keep the barns in repair...but am so thankful to find ones like this that don't seem in too much danger of falling down.All eyes were on me as I took these pictures...they did not seem menacing but more as if they wondered I had something for them.  The house was right on to the right where you can't see it.  So they are probably used to being handled.  The only thing missing for me was a young calf.There isn't anything much cuter than a baby animal of any kind...and calves with their big eyes and long lashes are right up there at the top of being beautiful.  At home, each cow was named, as well as most calves received their own name.  Since we usually milked at least one cow, I can remember carrying a calf to the barn a time or two after it was born, till the cow would have to come in to it.For a while, we would milk some of the milk and leave the rest for the calf....I was never a milk lover, so don't remember drinking it a lot.  But I do remember when I went to school, it being strange to have a box of milk with my lunch.  Just tasted different.  I can also remember noticing the difference between the taste of evaporated cream or real milk in coffee.I will leave you with straight-on shot of the barn...I don't think I have ever seen one built just like this one...I don't know what you would call that part that sticks out at the peak of the roof.  Have you ever seen one built like this?  I don't know if the bottom drops open or not.  Believe it or not, I did not notice this part till I downloaded the photos."},

Probably just emptied and put back in place.  I really know next to nothing about the process of collecting sap and making the syrup....but will be learning some from my blog buddy Judy, over at Daily Yarns 'n More and Through My Lens as they make maple syrup for the first time at their Gentle Hearth Farm.**************When we were kids, sometimes something sweet was what we had for breakfast.  Mom usually kept Bob White Syrup for our use....it was dark and thick and really yummy if you like syrup and butter and biscuits.  If she ran out, sometimes she would use water and white granulated sugar, and I think vanilla flavoring, but it is possible that it was maple...she would cook the water and sugar on the top of the stove till it became a thin syrup.  I am not sure when she added the flavor, but would think near the end.  Pour a little of that in our plate, add butter, and dip one of her homemade biscuits in it...The other thing she made was a chocolate syrup.  She made it using flour, sugar, cocoa, and what else I don't know.  I don't remember if the liquid she added was water or milk....and I don't remember if she added any vanilla.  I just know that it was so good...it was thicker than water but not slow like molasses.  And there was nothing better in life than to have it and add butter to it while it was still hot, and dip one of her biscuits in it.I think I have mentioned her biscuits before....I have never tasted any like them anywhere else in my 55 years of living.  As with almost any of her cooking, she did not follow a recipe with measurements..not for the chocolate syrup, not for the homemade version of syrup, and not for the biscuits.For them she had a pan that she always kept in the flour bin, and it held more than 25 lbs of flour.  She, along with most of the mothers of the children I grew up with would never have dreamed of buying a 5 lb bag of flour or cornmeal.  Making biscuits and cornbread were just part of their daily routine....they never gave it a second thought.But back to her biscuits, she kept a little metal pan in the flour bin....and it always had a bit of flour in it....she would add more flour to it....by the time I was very old it was always self-rising flour.  She would make a well in the flour, add a dollop of lard, and start mixing with one hand while she added buttermilk which she poured from a gallon jar.  Homemade buttermilk, at that.She did not fool with it long till she had it the right consistency.  Then, unlike most people that roll out their dough and use a glass or biscuit cutter to get the same size biscuit each time...she just pinched off a small section of the dough, kind of held it in one hand and cupped the other over it and rolled it around...then placed it in a baking pan and flattened it a little bit.  And all her biscuits were uniform in size...until maybe the last little bit of dough.She always made a 9 x 13 pan full of biscuits, and if there was a little dough left over, sometime she would make a big biscuit and place in another pan...I almost think she made a big one in fun. Those biscuits were delicious...they were not flaky at all.  But were sort of holey...and were just so good.  I would give anything to have some of them once again, as well as some of her dumplings. I have tried making biscuits and I just do not have the knack for it at all....dogs won't eat my biscuits.  And I am dead serious...it has been a long time since I tried and I keep thinking one of these days I will start experimenting again but I never do.  At least I can make the good old southern type of cornbread with no sugar. Sometimes, at night when I want a snack but nothing sounds good, I will just make a pan of cornbread.  And nothing tastes better.  As a kid growing up, I would never have imagined a time would come when I thought cornbread a wonderful snack."},

I was mainly hoping to see eagles....and maybe deer and turkeys.  I 'may' have seen an eagle...in fact am almost positive I did.  But we were driving too fast and it was just there and gone,  so I am not positive.But look what we did see--Sandhill Cranes!  These we only saw in flight...but I could hear them.  They are so vocal!  You can look here and here to see other posts with better pictures.  Or go here to read about their life history...it is interesting.I wonder if they were looking for a place to rest, or were they just headed north...I have no idea how they do when heading back to their nesting grounds.  I hope we can make it back to Jasper Pulaski a little later on...I just never tire of seeing them.*************We had another almost sleepless night the other night and I have just been out of sync the past couple of days.  This time, it was basically cause we were having such nice weather and I was hyper...I could have stayed up all night.  Every so often, I do have a night where I just stay up all night...usually I sew.  This time we both read, and reading will help me settle down.  We went to bed at 5:00 and I got up at 9:00, so hopefully no more nights like that.It is doing nothing but rain here today...everything is so saturated.  The Wabash River was almost out of its banks yesterday, so bet that it will be flooded after this day is through.  Every time it floods, I think of George Rogers Clark and his men crossing it during flooding, on their way to battle....when they went to take back Kaskaskia from the British.  They had to be men of iron will.Anyway, of all days, I have laundry to do...I had much rather hang it outside but it is supposed to turn back chilly and even chance of light snow tonight.  So, I will just dry them in the dryer and be done with it.As I sit here, I hear Puss Puss crying in the basement....that is a sign she is looking for something, or in the process of carrying something up here.  Usually something of Roger's.  She has really been in that mood lately.  I told in an earlier post about the plastic tubing, and the pipe cleaner...well, a few days later, she kept bringing this little plastic bag up...it was something that belonged to Roger but I don't know what it was.  I know she brought it up at least three times....then the other night she brought up this whole bag of cleaning patches.  It is little squares of cloth he uses to clean rifle bores.  Only, with them, since the bag was bigger, there was a whole trail left behind her when she brought them up.There is never a dull moment when you have cats..."},
{"title": "Barn in weeds.....", "date": "Saturday, February 19, 2011", "text": "All the weeds in this pictures seem to indicate this barn is not used much, but it reminded me of something one of my brothers and I did one time.I don't remember how old we were, but we were in a barn up the road from our house.  It is one he now owns, but back then it might have belonged to the previous owners.  On past that barn was this creek...it had a kind of swampy feel about it.  I don't ever remember doing much there...just one of those places you don't pay much attention to.I know sometimes it would have big orange fish in it and we had no idea where they came from...and I am still not sure what they were.  I don't know if they were fish people had in aquariums and turned loose there or what....down there, at that time, was not an area where people had aquariums.Anyway, back to the point of this little story.....I don't have any idea what my brother and I were doing, but we were up in that barn.  He had an old homemade bow.  There were a couple other kids out by the creek....they would probably have been about a block away from us...just to give you an idea of how far away they were.  Of course by the barn were all kinds of stick weeds...my brother would have me sneak and get some of the weeds...it was late fall so they were dry and could just be broken off.I don't know what he used to give the stick weeds weight enough to fly, but he used something and would shoot them almost straight up while aiming through a crack in the barn wall.  (The 'arrow' was actually sticking through the crack.)  I don't remember how many he shot before one hit close enough to the boys for them to even have a clue...I am not sure they ever knew for sure what was going on.  I can remember them glancing around like they heard them hit.  And I remember us just laughing and thinking we were really being funny....I have no idea what possessed us to do that...I am sure we could have hurt someone.  We were not trying to hurt them...we didn't even know them.  I suppose we just wanted to be mysterious, or just the fact that they didn't know we were there was funny."},
{"title": "Wildlife report....", "date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "text": "Night before last I made a run through the strip pits....I went through the first time kind of early...right around 3:30.   Right after entering the area, there is a strip pit...and it was covered with geese.  They were walking on water ice....and sitting on ice as if they were sitting on water.  I could not help but think how cold that would be!I paused and took a few pictures, and continued on through...I seen one single Northern Harrier, and not any other life of any kind.  No birds flying, no ring-necked pheasants, no deer.I decided to head on over into Illinois...originally thinking I would go to Paris, Illinois to take a few pictures in town just to have something different to post.  However, I took off through the country to see if the geese were feeding in any of the fields.  Other than one right there close to the strip pit, I just seen a few others too far away to photograph.And did not see anything else in the wildlife department to photograph while out.  So, I headed back home, and finally had three deer run across the road in front of me.  This led me to run back through the strip pits on my way home.This time there were red-winged blackbirds...so at least they are moving back through.  There wasn't a lot of them, but sure more than when I had passed through earlier.  So, I went on, trying to keep an eye out for pheasants....no luck.  Looked for short-eared owls...no luck there either. I finally spotted a herd of deer on a far hill...at least 8, maybe more.  Too far to count.  After seeing them, I finally spot a single, solitary male pheasant, and next were three Northern Harriers.  Not a lot to see compared to other times, yet it was good to see what I did see.After I left the strip pits, the first thing I saw was another herd of deer.  I guess you would say herd.  Just on down the road a mile or so from the red barn...four deer ran across the road and I could see 4 more deer waiting in the weed patch....I slowed down and was going to try to take a photo but a dog on down the way started barking at a truck that was coming from the other direction...so they ran back the other way.So, I continue on my way home...by then there is a vehicle behind me.  Soon as I could, I pull to the side of the road till they can pass me.  I want to go slow.  I am out to this farm field by then...there are 6 deer out in that field, plus two turkeys.  So, I am thinking well, that is probably the end of what I will see...But I continue on...just creeping along.  I thought just maybe I might see a heron at this little creek I had yet to pass...but before I got there there is this woodsy/weedy patch and in there are more deer!  I counted at least 6, two of them are in the photo above....but it was getting really late and I have a feeling I missed some.  They blended in so well with their background it was hard to spot them.So all in all it was a good evening..."},

So am just showing this one that has the Little House on the Prairie in it...at least that is what I have named the farm.  If I knew their address, I think I would print one or two and photos and send it to them.I don't have much to say tonight...we did not get a good night's sleep.  No reason.  Just couldn't get to sleep.  Roger went to bed after midnight...maybe half past, and I followed not soon after.  He was not asleep when I got in there and that in itself is unusual.  We both tossed and turned and tossed and turned some more, talking some.  Finally, we got up about 3:00 a.m. and Roger watched a video, and I read.  He went back to bed at 4:00, and I read a while longer and went on to bed...and to sleep.The cats got me up early...had to be fed.  I fed them, lay back down and to sleep.  The phone rang about 8:30...it was one of Roger's buddies...they talked a while and I went on back to sleep.  Got up so late, felt like the day was just shot.  So I did not attempt to do anything. I did hear that it is supposed to be rainy the next couple of days, so I took off on a short drive...the photo above is from today."},

We came across this little house which was posted with 'no trespassing' signs.    Well, I never crossed the fence, but I so wanted to take different angles of the house....as well as this fence and building.  I just always love fences and generally the older the better.I did lean across the fence to take this photo of the house.  And I would have taken some other angles, but the road was slush/ice covered and I did not want to get my feet wet and/or fall and break my camera, not to mention my body.I would have loved to peak in the windows...it was too dark to see what was inside even with my zoom lens and  notice, the roof line is still straight and true...I wonder what the house would smell like now with the windows gone.  Would it still have that smell of a real old house...you know the one I am talking about.  Or would it just smell woodsy from all the weather that has blown through the openings.I also wonder how old the house is...if I knew much about the siding it would give me a clue to the age but I don't know and am not having any luck finding the information I want.On one of the few drives we have taken this winter, we came across this Hoosier Homestead..it is north of us.  I am not sure which county it is in though.  A Hoosier Homestead is one that has been owned by the same family for a hundred years or more.I would love to know the stories these farms could tell.  Imagine living here a hundred years ago in the weather we have been having.  I often wonder would I have been strong enough to survive.I suppose though, if you had never known any different, it would not seem as hard as we think it would be now.Or even if I were younger, I would not look at it as such hard way to live.  I think I have become soft as I age."},

She was not in the mood to really pose...was more in the mood to goof off....I captured the one above...she was being so goofy....I captured it and was going to try to get a picture of the look on her face but my battery died!  I was so happy that I captured even this one of her 'posing'.... She is just so funny.I was not in position to get her face....the house was totally full.  I think besides Roger and I there were at least 40 people there...counting half a dozen children.  I wish I had had a video of her opening presents....if it was a gift bag she would just rip the tissue paper from it and throw it over her shoulder....if there were clothes, they got throwed over her shoulder, too!The clothes part was really funny, cause she really likes clothes.  She was just focused on toys and opening more presents.  Which shows how much she has changed in less than two months.  At Christmas, she would open a present and not really be interested in the next...she just wanted to play with whatever she had opened.  Today, she was perfectly fine with going from one gift to the next.This is her with her mommy and her little cousin, Ellie...isn't Ellie adorable???And here we have the birthday cup cakes....believe it or not, I think Lorelei was more interested in the decorations than in the cupcake/frosting...."},

I must tell you that the photo does not do them justice.

These 13 blocks will be alternated with 12 blocks that are predominately in the tan colors.I worked a while on them yesterday and the night before...I do not even want to tell you the mistakes I made in sewing....and the ripping out that I done.

It just melts my heart and makes me wish she was right here, right now till I could sneak in a hug every now and then.Do you realize she will be two years old next week...the 9th to be exact.  I wonder where the time has flown.  I wish I could go back and relive some of the days, but since I can't....I will scroll through the photos and when I come to one of her, it will bring a smile to my face...and maybe a giggle in some instances...and my arms will ache to hold her."},

Look at Bubbie...he is the one all the way to the right...the one underneath the other one is Puss Puss....and Cougar is the dark tabby one between his mommy's arms.  Notice the size of them...Bubbie was the runt, and Puss Puss looks like she was one of the bigger ones.I chose Cougar as my own I think when he was one day old...went to bring him home when he was six weeks old.  My daughter told me a few days before that he and Puss Puss were extra close to each other...that you never seen one without the other.  I didn't even think about bringing two home.  But on the way to get him, I told Roger about how they were by each other.So, we get there and visit a little bit, then start to leave....and I get Cougar...and he got Puss Puss...I think it was the first night or two we got them home, they played and played and explored the area...and suddenly we realized we could not find the Puss Puss.  We started searching...gave tbe house quick once over...and did it a time or two.  Looking under the bed, behind anything she might fit.  I can remember feeling like it was impossible for her to so disappear....but getting sort of scared at the same time.About that time, Roger found her asleep in the kleenes box....This is how they were by each other till Bubbie and Mama Cat came to live with us.  They always slept together all balled up till it was hard to tell which head belonged with which body.  Now you just never see it, though every now and then you will catch little actions till you know they are still each other's best pal....one will wash the other's face or some little sign.*************I was standing watching the birds....I had thrown birdseed on top of the ice since their feeder was frozen and I couldn't get it down.  So all the birds come and go...and this cardinal lands right, and decides to hop/fly over a couple feet...if even that.  You know how they flit about when there is food on the ground.  Well, she flitted and when she landed, she slid about 6 inches...she did that jerk sort of like we do to catch herself.  Only her wings helped her...I know this is not a good description, but it was funny.I am getting very weary of this ice...I almost fell a couple times yesterday...and I did that jerk one does to keep from falling and my neck was so stiff and sore last night.  and Roger did fall...but is none the worse for wear.  I think there is at least 3 inches of ice everywhere.  They showed on the evening news where some of the employees were out in the parking lot playing ice hockey on their break...."},

I almost fell I don't know how  many times when I was out.  So, I am not taking my camera out to get any of the lovely pictures I know are there for the taking.   Instead I contented myself with taking a couple from the porch.The sun was too high for this to be a good shot...if I had taken it a bit earlier I think the ice on the trees would have shown better.But notice the sky!!!!  That is blue sky....and we had it yesterday starting sometime up in the day.  And water is dripping from things that are iced over.  So eventually it will all be gone.  And none too soon for me.I even saw Bubbie sliding around a little bit while trying to walk out on this ice.  The cats go out, but sure don't stay long...you can tell by their actions that their feet get cold.  I sure feel sorry for animals that don't have a a warm place to stay.Which reminds me of something I seen the other day.We were in Terre Haute and on one of the corners at a stoplight there was a couple that held signs wanting work...saying they are homeless.  Now some are used to seeing that, but I am not.   There is probably more of it close to here but I am not out enough at the right time to see it.  But I wonder where they slept....were they warm.I also wondered about their life....wonder what led to that condition.  Was it really beyond their means to avoid, or were they like some people with financial difficulties that won't do little things like give up their cell phone, do without cable, etc.  Continually using a credit card as if it does not have to be paid back?And I was thinking to myself that gee, we spend enough money on cats, we could cut enough out of that to at least buy them a meal...but I did not suggest doing anything....just drove on by. But I have thought about them several times since...wondering how do other people handle seeing homeless.  Do you feel a certain amount of guilt.  Do you wonder if you offered them a job, if they might steal anything they could lay their hands on?  Or do those thoughts never cross your mind?One time we were in the hospital cafeteria down there and this old man came through....and Roger could tell he was homeless...the old guy got a cup of hot coffee and a doughnut or some little something like that.  I don't think I even realized he was homeless till Roger mentioned it...now what Roger done was get out a little bit of money...it wasn't much but it was something.  He got up and pretended to go get something and walked by the old guy and pretended he found the money on the floor, and gave it to him saying he must have dropped it.The old man did say it wasn't his, but Roger just told him well, its not mine so you keep it.  And the old guy went back through the line and got more food...I don't recall just what.We left that situation and did not feel any guilt, yet ever since we seen that couple in Terre Haute, I have wondered what we should have done.  I think anything would have been better than nothing.  Kindness never hurts....no matter what the situation."},

I love the one above...it is the 'smoke' on my smoke tree.  Makes me think of a crystal chandelier.I wonder what my dogwood will do when spring comes after this freeze.I felt like I was risking life and limb getting out...everything is a sheet of ice.

The police are asking people to stay home unless they absolutely have to be out. Our lights were dimming earlier...then we heard a boom after a bit.  I didn't think anything more, but happened to look out and notice our streetlight is out.  Then I decided to step out and see what kind of picture I could get...that is when I notice the other side of our street has no electricity.  They are on a different something or other than this side of the street...so, I am hoping we escape without losing ours.While out just those few minutes, I heard limbs breaking in the trees south of us.  I don't think they were huge limbs, but too dark to see for sure.***************One year when the girls were young...not sure how old.  I don't know if either one was in high school or not.  But we got an ice storm...even the yard itself was treacherous to walk on.  There was inches of snow under the ice, but the ice was so strong, even us adults could walk on it without breaking through.  That is if we could stand up.The girls and one of their friends took off to the trails, a little bitty section of woods over across the railroad tracks.  It has some steep banks...I don't think they would classify as hills.  They came home, cold and red faced..and had about wore the seats of their pants wore out from sitting on their bottoms and sliding down those banks or hills or whatever you want to call them.  I have not seen it that slick in a long time and wonder if this is going to be another time a sled is not needed.****************I forgot to tell that while at Sarah's yesterday, I was playing with her Legos with her.  Well, the set she has has a mommy and a daddy and grandma and grandpa...I left the room for something and Roger said she had the mommy and daddy kissing.  So when I told Sarah this evening, I thought it would be something new.  But no, she told me she also has her animals kissing each other.And Sarah texted me today and said she was trying to watch a movie, but could not hear a word of it because of Lorelei singing and chattering so loud.  I told her she needed to get a recording...but I didn't tell her I wanted it to share with everyone.Well, that is about all from my corner of the world.

Need I tell you that there are chances of snow next week?  About the time it starts to disappear we get more.However, we have a long way to go before we even begin to compare with the Blizzard of '78.  We were young whippersnappers back then...both Roger and I worked at CBS.  The factory...where vinyl records and cassettes were made...also where the record club was that everyone belonged to....at 1400 North Fruitridge Ave., Terre Haute, Indiana.There was a record snowfall...15.5 inches in a single snow...20 inches on the ground was the most recorded.  I heard on the news the other night that there was 20 ft. drifts.  I read where the airport recorded gusts of wind up to 55 mph...CBS actually closed down...for at least one day if not two....that was something that just never happened.  Roads going east and west would be clear....but the ones going north and south would have snow drifts higher than the roof of our truck. I don't recall a lot of details....just the joy of getting a day or two off work.  And I remember playing in the snow....but I remember the 'feel' of the blizzard.  I know lots of businesses closed around town.  People just simply could not get to work...schools were closed.  Cars were stranded around town.That was before the era of everyone having front wheel drive and four-wheel drive.  Roger had bought a 4-wheel drive truck right before we got married and people kind of laughed about it...you know the type of sneering laugh of why do you think you need that?  Not that it could go through 20 ft. snow drifts, but it could and did go a lot of places normal cars did not go.So, I guess I should complain....we could have another blizzard."},
{"title": "Better late than never", "date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "text": "I hope this shows...it is Simon's Cat in Santa Claws.  I just happened to check his website and there it was.  But it is so true of cats.   It so reminds me of our current cats when they were mere kitties. The first Christmas we had the cats, they wanted to stay right in the middle of it.Specially at first...it did get easier to detour them away from it after the initial newness of it.  The next couple of years they did not bother it, then this year Bubbie tried to start.  I just happened to be there and put a stop to it before he could start.Look at them...that was when they were not even a year old.  You can sure see the mischief in his eyes in that bottom picture.  He is 3½ years old and he still has a glint in his eyes.  We play chase through the house.  I will tag him and take off running, and he will come creeping in to find me.  I jump out and scare him and he takes off.  I can't wait for Lorelei to be old enough to understand just how to play with him.  He needs someone younger than me.What I wanted to tell you about is the Puss Puss there in the top picture.  I have never, ever seen a cat with more curiosity.  I could write pages and pages of stuff she does, and you probably wouldn't believe me unless you have a cat just like her.Her true love is probably Roger.  I don't care what he goes to do, she is right in the middle of it.  Whether it is to sit down and sign a paper, or if he is cutting out the leather for a knife sheath, or if he is in the basement doing something to on his work bench...she is right there with her nose in the middle.  And she dearly loves his fly tying table.The other day, I kept picking up this little flexible plastic tubing....it was about a foot long.  I figured it was something she had snitched from Roger and couldn't think to ask him.  I did not want to throw it away, even if it did look completely useless.  Finally, he came through and it was in the floor again, and he told me what it was and I think that was his second time of taking it back down in the basement.The next day she brought a piece of leather...I don't know if it was an actual lacing or if it was just a piece he had trimmed off, but there she had it in the kitchen.  I think the one time was all we picked it up.  She lost interest in it.Then there was yesterday.  She had went down and stolen a pipe cleaner, or part of one, and she play ALL. DAY. LONG. with that pipe cleaner...she had it in every room in the house, on the counters, on the table, under stuff, in a bag....up and down the basement stairs.    Then she would leave it laying on one side of the door, and go behind the door and reach under the door to play with it.She is just so little and petite, and so curious.  It is cute most of the time, but sometimes it can be annoying.  But I still love her."},

We think they are poles for a tee-pee.  Then look at that bench....both things combined made Roger and I wonder if it belongs to some kind of re-enactor/mountain man type.  I don't know who owns it, but I sure wish I had one like it.It is hard to see the chimney in this photo, but if you look at the other photo on my other blog, you will see it.  There is just nothing quite like sitting my the fire with a loved one...be it husband, kid, parent, or friend.  It is true about any fire, even if it is a bonfire outside...Some of my favorite memories are of when Roger and I lived in Tennessee, we had a fireplace.  We only used it for a little bit, but in that time we did have a few fires in it.  Also my friend came and we got to sit by the fire and visit.Later Roger bricked it in, and we got a woodburner...a Buckstove to be exact.  It had double walls, with a fan in back that circulated the heat.  At the time we got it, the double walls with a fan was a new idea....and a fine idea at that.We have an old garage here...it has our lawnmower and some other junk in it.  I keep coming back to the idea of cleaning it out, using a power washer on the inside, then painting the walls and getting a woodburner to go in it....I would probably sit out there and have a fire sometimes even in the summer even.Then I could smell woodsmoke any time I wanted to...."},
{"title": "My 1000th post.....", "date": "Sunday, January 23, 2011", "text": "I thought about posting a photo from the past, but just decided to post this one. It is the type that makes me want to sit and think about the past....I just happened to notice that my last post was the 999th post! My first post was may 31, 2007....most times I don't even notice the day to remark about it on my blog...so just wanted to point out that this is my 1000th post.When I started, I had no idea if I would do it for even a month, let alone for years. Roger was still working when I first started it. I cannot remember how long I had started it before I told any of my family about it....I did not even tell Roger. Not one soul did I tell. I was afraid they would read it and afraid they wouldn't at the same time!Now that they know, some of them read it on a fairly regular basis...some never even look at it. I do love knowing that some of them take the time to read it...they usually give me feedback in the form of emails. I don't know if they can even imagine how much I appreciate them. And I love getting comments in general.In looking back, I realize just how many major things have happened. I don't even know where to begin. Roger retired, I had to have a biopsy to check for breast cancer, which turned out negative, oldest daughter got divorced, youngest daughter and husband bought their first home, Lorelei was born, youngest daughter moved a couple hours away, and oldest daughter moved clear across the country for a job I think she loves and that is very interesting, youngest daughter had two major surgeries....Roger has finally got the time and most of the tools he needs to make knives...and has made several since retiring. I have had time to make a few quilts. And I have taken more pictures in these few years than all the ones put together up until the point I started my blog. In the search for photos, we have started seeing bald eagles. Not a lot, but more than I ever thought I would see in my lifetime. And we have went down roads we would never would have traveled otherwise.I got my Cougar and Puss Puss after starting the blog...and later inherited Bubbie and Mama Cat. Sarah took her dog home to live with her after they bought their first house. Just in the past year both her dog and our old dog, Shelby have crossed the rainbow bridge.These are just a few of the things that have happened...I am sure I am forgetting things. Probably serious things. If I think of more...I may do another post...It is just amazing to look back and think of all the living that has been done in these few years."},

I guess I should call them visitors.  Daughter told me a couple days ago that she might come and spend the night tonight...I have been holding my breath, keeping my fingers crossed and saying a little prayer that nothing would happen to prevent the visit.And nothing has...they should be here in a couple hours at the most.  It has been a good long while since I have seen the Lorelei without her being sick.   At least to me it has been a long time...over two weeks.  In the overall scheme of things that is not long. I am so anxious to see her, while at the same time knowing she will have changed so much in the short while since I have seen her.Some of the things I have missed is Tea With Otti.  She got a tea set for Christmas...it is one of her favorite things.  When I have been over there, there is never a day that she misses playing with it.  Her thing now is to go get dog food and put it in her cup and serve it to Otto.  Then she tries to sneak and get water.  Next, when she is bored with that part, she will get dog food to tempt Otto and take off running down the hall with him chasing her.Another thing she has been doing is singing in the shower...at the top of her voice.  I don't know that it is a song every time...she will just sing words sometimes.  And sometimes she makes up little tunes when she is  just sitting.  I told Sarah that she will be another Russell Crowe and write her first song by the age of three...I saw him interviewed, probably by Jay Leno and music is his first love.  In that interview he told that he wrote his first song at 3 yrs. old.Let me think...what else has Lorelei been doing.  OH, have any of you seen the movie UP....it is an animation and it has an old man in it.  Sarah said they were watching it, and it showed the old man and the boy walking through the forest, Lorelei looked up at Sarah and said 'Grandpa?'The last time I was over there, she was taking her mommy's hands and putting them over her mommy's eyes and say 'Where did mommy go?  Where did mommy go?'  Then she would pull Sarah's hands away and say 'There she is!'**************It is another cold day here in the Wabash Valley.  Not quite as cold as yesterday...we don't feel the cold seeping in today.  I think our weatherman is predicting more significant snowfall sometime in the next few days.  I am not sure what I want....I want spring, but thinking I would like to have time to get out in one more snow to take photos...so if it does snow I am going to try think positive about it.I will sign off for now..."},
{"title": "Yesterday.....", "date": "Friday, January 21, 2011", "text": "This was taken yesterday...I know it is a mess with all the cluttered background.  I meant to get out and try to take some better ones but never got around to it.  The birds were out there all day long....all kinds.  There were a couple pair of cardinals, nuthatches, chickadees, woodpeckers, finches, sparrows, and starlings.  I heard a blue jay once, but did not see it.I think they must have known today was coming...they worked steadily all day long at filling their little bellies....today there has only been the occasional bird.  I would like to know where the others are.  Do they have some place they go that is not as cold as others?  It is a real puzzle.Yesterday I tried to keep the cats inside till the birds could eat their fill without fear....but when the cats do get out, they are not very smart.  They get right under the feeder and sit and wait.  Occasionally a bird will come and the cat will jump.  I am thankful that the cats are so dumb that they don't try to hide.Today has been bitter cold...the house has had a chill all day and I don't have the thermostat down...it is just so cold that it seeps in.  The cats go out, only to turn around and come back in in about 5 minutes...and sometimes they go out one door, go straight to the other one and want back in.  The joys of owning cats!"},

But he finished it for me the other day, and I just today took pictures.I just cannot take photos that do them justice....I don't have lighting, other than the flash on my camera.  But even if I did, I do not understand using it...so you are left with these photos.It sure fits my hand....feels just right.  I don't know if I will ever have the nerve to take it and use it...some of his buddies have used theirs.  But I have been know to lose things, so this may never leave the house.  It is very close to being like Jeremy's--it is what I requested.  I did have him make my sheath a bit different though.****************Here, it has turned cold again....3-6\" is in the forecast.  I don't even know if I hope they are wrong or right.  We had a very warm for January day yesterday and almost all the previous snow is gone.  But it left one big ugly world behind.  Everything just looks dirty and dingy.  So maybe to be covering it with white would be a big improvement.I have things I need to do and cannot seem to quit thinking about other things.  I need to focus on more positive things but having trouble with it right now.  I have cut a few strips of fabric to start another quilt top.  Seems like every time I go down and actually get in the mood and start, something happens to call me away from the task.  Then it is hard to get motivated to go back.***********I also splurged on myself and bought The Awakening Land.  It was a mini series on TV that aired in 1978 which is when we lived in Tennessee.  Since watching the mini series, I have read the books by Conrad Richter that it was based on numerous times.  (The Trees, The Fields, The Town, or they were all combined into one volume called The Awakening Land.)  Anyway, one of the first things I did when we got Internet access was start searching for it on VHS/DVD, every so often, I would scour the Internet....just hoping to come across it.  You just cannot imagine my surprise to do a search a few weeks ago and have it actually pop up.Anyway, that is all from this corner of the world for now..."},
{"title": "Red barn in white", "date": "Tuesday, January 18, 2011", "text": "This is another drive-by shot....on the way to Sarah's.  I wanted to post something but don't feel like dragging out the camera right now for what I want to post about so will put this photo up.*************What I would like to know is this:  does everyone go to Walmart, or wherever you go, with the intentions of getting just a few things and almost always end up with a cart piled high?  I just got home a few minutes ago....I got a new dish drainer.  I have a dishwasher and had went to the small dish drainer.  Lately, I have been washing dishes more than using the dishwasher, and find I need the bigger drainer.I about fainted when I saw the price....the drainer was $12.47, which would put it over $13 with taxes.  The tray it sits on was $7.97.....and get this, I don't like doing dishes.  I don't let them set and set....I cannot bare to go in to cook with a big pile of dirty dishes sitting.  So mine are always done up at least once a day, and most times two...occasionally three.I feel like I have been doing dishes all my life.  I am sure I am not the only woman that feels like that....and I don't just hate the job itself.  It is the fact that I no more than get them done, till someone messes up some.  It feels like I make no headway.  I really would hate to see all the dishes I have done put in a pile....it would be a mountain I am sure.As for how long I have been doing them, I think I started around 4th grade...not sure...could have been a little earlier or a little later.  I always did the supper dishes...and helped with either the breakfast or dinner dishes.  You would think I could not forget which other one I helped with, but for the life of me I don't remember.She did teach me to do them and get them over with...every now and then I would try to put them off, and she would tell me I could, but that I would have to get up early the next morn and wash them.  She would let me leave a cast iron pan every now and then....which she usually did that night.  She was not one to leave a bunch of dirty dishes either.I can so clearly remember one time, my brothers and I were out playing ball after supper.  Mom came to the back door and yelled and told me it was time to do the dishes....so, I went in uncomplaining...it did no good with mom so we basically didn't do too much.  Anyway, when I got in, she had them already washed them for me...what she really wanted was to give me some ice cream.  There had been just a little bit left, so she gave it to me. I remember that so clearly....See, ice cream was a BIG treat in our world....it was something we probably did not have once a month...not even sure if we averaged having it once every two months.  And we almost always got butter pecan!  You would think I would be tired of it by now, but about half the time I get ice cream now, I will still get butter pecan.Have you ever had a float made with butter pecan ice cream and Pepsi?  In my own opinion, no other float can compare....though now I usually use Coke.  Everyone says they don't want to deal with the nuts, but they usually go to the bottom and you use a spoon and eat them last.****************Oh, the tests came back negative on Lorelei....and she IS feeling better and the temperature has been down the past two days.  I am so relieved that she is feeling better.  And her mommy is feeling good.  So things are definitely looking up.Now if I could just have a day or two of sunshine and bright blue skies...I might feel like doing something."},

The first four were together...one adult and four juveniles.  They were just a bit too far for my camera.  I could barely tell they were eagles through it...Roger's spotting scope was a bit better.  We drove on a ways and saw this single eagle....it was a bit closer, but this time was snowing so hard.  Still I think you can tell it is an eagle!We also spotted this fellow...I don't are if there are a lot of coyotes, I still love to see them.

{"title": "After long absence...", "date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "text": "After a long absence, I think I am about ready to start blogging again, but don't hold it again me if I fail to post every day...I feel like I have been on a long journey.  Before I tell anything that has been happening, I wanted to show a few pictures of the Toot.Below, you will see her hard at work with her screwdriver...working on one of her toys.  She does love tools.  And always turning anything with wheels upside down.  She has been doing that forever.  I bet she won't be very old at all before she is helping her daddy when he works on his car.  He is not a mechanic by trade, but loves to fiddle with his car, or if his friends are doing anything interesting to theirs, they sometimes call him.  It is a fun thing, not a job.Also, be sure and notice how close Otto is...usually, he is not far from her.and by the same token, he couldn't get far away if he tried.  Lots of mornings, the first thing she does is go get him up.  She will run into her mom and dad's room, and I am thinking she is going after them, but no, she goes and yells for Otti and comes running out with him.One morn he had his collar on, and Lorelei was climbing on his back holding on to it...he got up to go do something.  Well, he never does anything in slow motion, so she had a short wild ride before she fell off...no harm.  I was really surprised that she did not start trying it on a regular basis...but normally, he just lays and takes it all.She has recently started to love baby dolls...and has to have a least one to take to bed with her every night, and sometimes we will have her, two or three babies, and maybe Olivia all to pack into her crib.**************************Lorelei's mom had her second surgery the 16th, except for a couple or three nights, I was over there for probably 3 weeks....this surgery only took about 50 minutes compared to the 7 ½ hours of the first surgery.  Recovery has went well....Our older daughter came home from Los Angeles for Christmas...it was so funny to see Lorelei's reaction to her.  Usually, when she hasn't seen some one for a while, she is a little bit shy.  But she seen her Auntie asleep on the couch, and said 'Mommy?', and went over there.  I wondered what she would do when she saw it was her aunt and not her mommy....she just kept going with a smile that could not be any bigger!  And from then on, she made almost every step her aunt made.And even though her aunt left the 30th, she still mentions her almost daily....it is just so sweet.    She said her name to me, two or three times yesterday, and Sarah said she had mentioned her the day before.Little Lo is sick...Sarah came home to spend the night on the 5th, and Lorelei started vomiting and running a temp that night...Sarah did call the doctor while she was here, she could not get in to see her, but the doctor seemed to think it was just a stomach flu that was going around anyway.Well, that has been 11 days ago and she is still running a temp.  Sarah took her to her new pediatrician over there.  He checked her over physically and could not see anything...her lungs were clear, her ears were fine, etc...so thought maybe it was just the end of some virus.  But he is having her checked for bladder infection.  So keep her in your prayers.*********************************We have had snow, snow and more snow...of course not as much as my brothers in Tennessee.  I will have to check in with George and Betsy and see what they have....they live in Tennessee also, but farther west than where I am from.I have not been taking many photos...haven't been doing much of anything since being home.   Roger got me a little netbook for Christmas...we ordered it after I came home, just something small to take with me for convenience.  Or something to take up and down to the basement when I am working down there.  It only weights 2.8 pounds....I think the physical size is a little over 7 inches wide, and a bit over 10 inches long, and about and 1 inch in depth.It does not have its on dvd/cd drive, so had to buy and external cd/dvd writer to make the recovery disk...so been fooling some getting it set up.For now, that is all I have to say...please bare with me as I try to catch up with everyone."},

One of these days things will be back to normal.Lorelei is changing daily it seems...she is just so busy all the time.She sings Jingle Bells, Happy Birthday, and other songs...and has just been playing the drums and singingShe loves you, Yeah, Yeah, yeahShe loves you Yeah, yeah, yeahOver and over.She now tells me to 'Get up---I need you' She will get my hand and take me all over the place. Otto hardly has a moment's peace...and for the most part he enjoys every minute of it. This morning she went for a short but wild ride on him....unplanned. She was climbing on his back and was astraddle of him and up he got. She hung on for a second or two before falling off. I half expected her to get back up and try it again but she didn't.Our oldest daughter will be here at this time tomorrow night...along with a bit more snow. I am not sure how much is in the forecast. I am hoping not much.This will probably be my only post on here for a little while to come...one of these days I will get back to it on a regular basis I hope.

Spaghetti is not the subject of this post though.It is onions.  Just with the simple act of cutting into the onion, I am immediately ravenous!  I don't care if I have just gotten up from a holiday feast, or if I have just had a steak meal, or barbecued ribs...if I smell an onion I am immediately hungry.  I want cornbread!  Southern style, I suppose, without sugar.  I don't know if that is a southern thing or just from my particular neck of the woods.  But I do know that I have yet to meet anyone up here, that makes our type of cornbread.But back to onions.  I want cornbread and a slice of pork shoulder or salt cured bacon, cooked over an open fire with onions to eat with it.   Or if I smell onions, I want soup beans and cornbread and onions...and you won't believe this.  I like them cold out of the fridge...one of my sisters used to come back home to visit and I can remember her/us getting up after everyone had gone to bed, and we would go raid the fridge and if there were cold soup beans, she would have cornbread, soup beans and onions.  I had not had that in years and years, and last spring, I remembered and tried it again, and I still love it.And let's not forget wilted lettuce and onions.  With cornbread....Or something my mom cooked and I do, too, that I have never seen anyone else cook...well, my sister-in-law might...but she would be the only one...but not sure if she does.   I think I ask her a year or two or three ago, but forget the answer. Anyway, mom would get stew beef and cook it in the pressure cooker till tender, or almost tender....then add potatoes.  I get a nice chuck roast from my local IGA store...cook it till tender in the pressure cooker.  While it is cooking I usually have my potatoes cooking in another pot and once the meat is tender, I add the potatoes to the beef and add water if needed and cook a while longer.I have my cornbread baking, and green beans in another pot...then when I sit down to eat, I have an onion sliced....there just isn't much better on this earth.  I don't fix it often...but when I do, I am ashamed of how much I eat.I don't cook like that all the time, but ever since I made the spaghetti I have been craving at the least, a pone of cornbread and a slice of onion.When a kid, and my nephews stayed/visited in the summer, if there happened to be sliced, white bread, which we called light bread, sometimes for a snack we would have a mustard and onion sandwich.  I still have that once in a blue moon....And I love onions on a hamburger.I suppose if I could have left the bit about having a mustard and onion sandwich and having onion on a hamburger, I could have titled this post With cornbread.But since there are some people that just cannot stand onions, I will leave it titled as is..."},

I think she knows I long to be in Tennessee one more time when it snows.  There is just something about looking out and seeing snow on the hills and the misty look of the mountains.  It is home...one of these days maybe things will settle down till we can head down that way when we know they are expecting snow.Now, Holly is Jackson's mama....and Holly's mom told me that Holly had taken a photo of Jackson and he reminded both of them of Lorelei....it was hard to imagine but being that Holly's mom and I agree about a lot of stuff, I sort of figured if they saw it I would too so I told her to have Holly send it to me and she did a few days later..so now I am showing it to you along with one of Lorelei when she was younger.I think it is the way they hold their mouth and also their eyes when they are really happy...how they are all squinty.And that is not the only way they are similar....Jackson loves to dance, also.  But he is a toe tapper where Lorelei is a butt wiggler, head bobber.  Can you just picture the two of them together!***************We got another dusting of snow yesterday...maybe an inch or so.  But the wind has blown it around so much it is hard to tell.  We had our first howling wind last night of the winter.  It was searching for any little crack or crevice to get in.  Our swing on our back porch is a glider swing...made of wood.  So, in weight, it is not real light.  It normally sits with the ends going east and west.  I heard it being scooted around by the wind last night, and when I went to let the cats out, the ends are now pointed in the north-south direction.The cats are getting cabin fever....they want out but only stay out a minute or two and come back in.  Last night they were trying to start the game of tag, or something and racing through the house after each other...Roger was laying on the couch and Cougar came tearing through, jumped over the end that his head was on, and landed right on his solar plexus and made him about jump out of his skin!Even Mama Cat was swatting everyone and trying to get them to play chase with her.  If Lorelei had been here she would have had a ball watching them.  She just giggles and laughs so hard when Otto and their cat chase each other.As you can tell, they are absolutely the best of buddies.  When we were over there just a month or so ago, we were outside.  Sarah, Roger and I ended up setting in the swing...along with Lorelei.  And on top of all of us, here came Otto and got up with us.  It would have made the most perfect picture, but we could not have got up to get the camera without them moving.It was so funny, Otto was sitting there between Lorelei and me.  Her mom was on the other side of her.  I looked down at Lorelei and she looked at Otto and scooted over as close to him as she could get.  I would love to have captured that moment in time."},

I wasn't really in the mood to get out but I knew it was supposed to rain today so I forced myself got my mind/body in gear and headed out there late yesterday evening.I had not gone even half a mile till I seen my first pheasant...he took off at a pace, too fast to get a good photo.  But just little bit farther on I hit the jackpot!  Except I did not get a photo of them all.  Up near the road there were 6, yes SIX male ring-necked pheasants...and up the hill a bit farther were the two above.I did not get a single picture of the group of six....they were kind of strung out and started taking off before I could get all the photos I wanted  And at that none of the ones I took are very good.  The only thing I wonder is where are the females...I saw several more pheasants after this bunch, but not one single female.  And back during the spring and summer, I only saw one or two females...but lots and lots of males. I know the females are harder to spot...they do not have the the beautiful colors of the male, but still you would think I would have seen one or two last night...specially with the snow on the ground.No here we have the main reason I was wanting to go out there late in the evening...I wanted to see if any of the short-eared owls had returned.  I am here to tell you they have returned and brought their relatives and neighbors, too.  I have never seen so many as were out there.I am showing three different short-eared owls....but I could not count how many I saw...I counted 5 in the sky at one time.  It was not seeing one, it disappearing and seeing another...they were all within sight at the same time!  They look like a bomber at certain angles in flight.Notice the sign under the one above...apparently the owl is not reading the sign.  Click the above photo and and look how intent the owl is looking at something down below.  If I were a mouse, I would be afraid.Aren't they a fine looking bird?"},

I really need to study the little woodpeckers and the sparrows.I am not sure if the above is a purple finch or a house finch...whichever it is, I like seeing them.This here is the titmouse.  Another visitor I am always glad to see. And of course the nuthatch...we always have some of the above birds with a few more that I did not stand out there long enough to capture.  We have the chickadees, the cardinals, red-bellied woodpecker...oh, and the juncos.  Plus all the other sparrows.  They have been flocking to our feeders...most all coming in in one big swoop, with a few stragglers following behind.  I think there has to be at least 50 of them.  I have never had them so thick.Then, I have been having the wren regularly...I only see one at a time, so don't know if it is single or I just haven't looked at the right time to see the two of them.  And, I had three big blue jays out there at the same time.  We used to have lots of blue jays all through the summer...but the past few years, we only see one occasionally.  I don't know what has changed for them to just not show up at all, and now to see them at the feeders was surprising.One afternoon we came home...can't remember where we had been, but it was as if someone had dumped the feeder on the ground.  I wondered had two or three blue jays landed on one side, but the next day the crows were out here so I sort of figured they were the culprit. I only have two little squirrels that are coming, and I have not seen one of them attempt to get up to the food....plus even if they did, they are only a bit over half grown.  Or else really small.  They are not big as Mama Squirrel and she never did tip the feeder when she was getting into it.Well, that is my bird report for now....maybe I will have success later with some of the other visitors we have."},
{"title": "Now showing in my part of the world...", "date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2010", "text": "Out at the strip pits I go to as often as I can, we saw these two whooping cranes....Last week Mary at Faith, Fabric, and Photos went to Goose Pond which is south of me...probably just a little be farther east then me, and she came back with photos of some Whooping Cranes she shows HERE.   When I heard about her trip, I immediately wanted to go out to the strip pits near here...just in case.  I didn't really think there would be any there, but much to my surprise there were these two....According to Cornell's All about Birds, the population of whooping cranes in 1987 was 100....about 250 in 1995 and in 2004 the population had reached 468.....only part of those were in the wild.  You can read more about them here....On the bird in front, I could definitely see something green when I looked through Roger's spotting scope...not thinking to look it up I told Mary and she told me they  are radio transmitters used to track them.**************************It is staying bitter cold here.  I have my doubts of the temps even reaching 20º F today...the only thing I have done is let the cats in and out a time or two.  Even they are mostly just laying around, taking it easy, and sleeping away the hours. Bubbie was up this morn and wanting to start something with the other cats; he gets bored. He is also so rough, no one likes to play with him. Of the three cats, he needs the most attention, likes to play the most, and is probably into more stuff in general.  Anyway, after a short stay outside, he calmed down and welcomed a nice nap in front of the TV.I can laugh till I cry sometimes thinking about these cats and things they and the dogs have done.  When my older daughter was going to college, she worked full time here in town at a Mini-Mart.  She came home to eat a quick bite about 7:30.  Her dog, Shelby, always had food available.   But when did she eat...she would wait till my daughter was sitting down to eat.  She would get a big mouthful of food, come and drop at her feet, and then CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH!!!  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH!  Which in turn got on her and my nerves both...because we were usually taking that opportunity to talk a few minutes.After that, fast forward a few years and she is out of college, has been out on her own for a while, moved back home for a short while.  In that time I had acquired two of these cats from her, and when she came back home, she brought their mom and brother.  This time around she has a good job, and has to really be awake and aware of what is going on around her. Every other night or so, soon as she went to bed, two of the kitties would go in the kitchen which is right off her bedroom.  They would proceed to start some sort of game which involved the cabinet doors.  This time it was rattle, rattle, rattle.  Rattle, Rattle, Rattle!  Sometimes it would just be one reaching and pulling a door with their paw; other times one would manage to open the door enough to get inside, then they would play with each other through the door.  They would have did this right on if I did not go set something in front of the doors till they could not reach them.And I cannot tell how Puss Puss does Roger...you would have to hear and see him tell how she comes when he is sleeping and gets right in his face and her little whiskers tickling him so bad.  It is just so funny...she does not do me that way.  But then, Cougar does not bother him...and Bubbie has no mercy on either one of us.  He used to never jump onto the bed itself...he jumped up there but it was always to land on my back or side...now he actually jumps on the bed part of the time so that is a big improvement.There's other stories but I will save them for another day..."},

Yet how long has it been since I was a kid...longer than I want to admit.  And several years since the chance of our daughters getting a snow day.  But if I quit feeling that anticipation of school being called off, I will probably be dead.\r\rWhen I see the snow capping everything after a fresh snowfall, I remember walking along and taking a bite of snow off everything....fence posts and heavy laden branches or anything that would hold a mound of snow. How thirsty it made me!   I never understood why I could be eating what is basically frozen water, and be getting thirstier all the time.\r\r\rGoing through the strip pits pulls at my heartstrings even more...I want to be a kid again and take my dogs and go tramping through it all.  To see if we can scare up anything.  I don't ever remember us jumping a rabbit in all my times of taking them, but there was still that anticipation.   I do remember finding a rabbit sitting in a feeding trough at a neighbor's barn, though but I did not show it to the dogs.\r\rI also remember one time my niece and I were out rambling about after a new fallen snow.  We were walking along the railroad, where honeysuckle grows.  I think she was the one spotted this 'wad' of stuff in the vines about as big around as a softball , but more elongated than round.  We got the bright idea to squeeze it.  I don't recall which of us squeezed first, but each time we did, a mouse would run out....and we would jump each time even though we expected it.\r\rAfter seven ran out, no more would come out.  We left the nest...we didn't want to hurt them.  We just wanted to see.  I suppose it is a wonder we didn't try to catch one or two.  That memory makes me smile after all this time...."},

I like it a lot...and would love to have walked the neighborhood taking more, but it was snowing too hard to have the camera out in it.These were taken over in Illinois...as we were driving down the road above we were thinking all kinds of titles for it but sadly I cannot remember any except something about Edge of the World and wondering if this is how Columbus felt.You have to click this to get a better view...although you will still wonder why I posted it...it is just to show how hard it was to see.  I have some I took before we were this close, and I fear you could not even see it.These trees just a bit farther down the road, and this was actually probably not even the length of a football field away.  I love the misty feel of it.And this one was taken late yesterday evening after we got back to the house...at 3:53 pm.  It snowed all day long...never hard...but the ground was warm and the snow melted all day long sidewalks and paved areas were warm, and the snow on them melted all day long....but last night I started hearing the crunch of tires as the snow and slush froze.It is a cold, cold world out there this day...the birds are flocking to the feeders.  I see my little Jenny Wren out there...she is a Carolina Wren.  I always name them Jenny...I don't know where   got that but I heard someone else or read someone else calling them Jenny.  So I just give them that as a name.  I am hoping she stays here through the summer.It is so cold the cats are staying inside with barely a thought to going outside.  If they do go, they don't stay long, they don't come to the door begging us to come outside either.  They come in and are glad to stay inside for a good long while."},
{"title": "The boys....", "date": "Friday, December 3, 2010", "text": "I have been wanting to post pictures of the cats for a while now, but the only time they will be still is when they are sleeping.  I went ahead and took a few of the boys today. First we have Bubbie...the above picture is just typical of him.  He sleeps like this at least half the time.  And below he is helping Roger surf the net, taken a couple days ago.Can you tell that he loves us?  He should...remember when he broke his leg....way back here.  I think he has been grateful ever since.  Before his leg was broken, he was Roger and Rachel's cat....did not have the time of day for me.  Unless I was feeding him..just didn't care if I gave him any type of petting or anything.After he went through his leg being broken, he comes at least once a day for me to pet him...can be very insistent on it.  And he still doesn't mind Lorelei...remember this.  That seems like a lifetime ago.  Just look how small Lorelei was in that post.And this is my boy!  Like his namesake, I am Cougar's favorite person.  He likes everyone but I am the one he loves best!I cannot put the skirt under the tree...any time I think about it, a cat is sleeping under it.  And I don't like to disturb them.   I will forever think that a cat laying sleeping in a house or store adds so much to the atmosphere.***************As I type this, we are getting snow!!!!  I told Roger the other night that winter is officially here.  We happened to go to bed about the same time and here came Puss Puss wanting under the cover with us.  And she still insists on being between us.  Roger let her under the cover on the outside edge but she just goes under and then proceeds to climb over him and snuggles down between us.Bubbie, on the other hand does not want between us and generally does not want under the cover.  He likes for one of us to scoot back from the edge of the bed and then he will snuggle in to our stomach and sleep. Cougar comes and will come up and if my hands are under the cover, he will reach under with his paws to find my hand.  He only wants to be petted a little bit and will either sleep curled up at the foot of the bed or get down completely. And Mama Cat now comes and gets in bed occasionally to be petted and even sometimes to sleep with us.  She now comes and gets in my lap and sits and sits.  And she still is good with Lorelei also...if you knew her life before she came to live with us, you would understand that her attitude is basically a miracle.  I have yet to see her get mad at Lorelei. **************That is it for now...I am hoping we get enough snow for it to make the world new.  It is just beautiful to look out towards the streetlights now."},

I can remember wishing we had ornaments to really decorate that blue spruce out front for Christmas.  We were lucky to have any to go on our Christmas tree....let alone to decorate outside.  We had a strand or two of the big multicolored lights and a few of the shiny ball ornaments...I don't ever remember getting to buy any new ones.However, I can remember cutting a star out of cardboard and wrapping it in aluminum foil to put on the spruce...I think about this every year...and I never fail to think about how we saved wrapping paper from year to year.  And I think of gathering pine cones and painting them with gold and silver paint.  Thinking about that now, I would love to know where the paint came from and why we had it.  It was in little bottles...maybe a couple inches tall.  I wonder if they had been model paint...but even if they were, that still does not explain why we had them.But don't feel sorry or sad for me...having a childhood like this has made even simple things so much more enjoyable.  I buy a few new Christmas ornaments every year, and probably get twice the enjoyment from it that most people do. Anyway, all that is going through my mind, and thinking how I have lived in the small town I live in now for 30 years...even with living here that long, Tennessee is still home.And I would love to go back to Tennessee to live, but I could never willingly move farther way from Lorelei....nor her mommy either.  It is bad enough when the kids move away by choice or with work and jobs...but I don't think I could willingly move away from them.  Our one daughter lives on the west coast, but at least we have hopes of her someday moving back closer to home.Right now I get sort of teary-eyed after leaving Lorelei...she is such a bright part of our life.  She is always so glad to see us...right now she is at the age where Mamaw and Papaw can do no wrong...and honestly she can't either;-)"},

Be sure and check out the photos there....You need to click on these to see them...specially the one above.  There had been this little kestrel on the power line and every time I got near enough to even think about taking a photo, it would fly.  Usually just past the next pole, but it skipped one and went on...I wondered why.  Then gave a second look and there was this big hawk sitting on top of the light pole...it took off before we could stop.In just a second here came the kestrel and looks like it was trying to knock the hawk right out of the sky!  Just click the above picture...it is a tad bit blurry but there was no time to focus. I can't help but wonder if what the hawk thought, or if he had a head ache.They proceeded to fly on; it was as if the kestrel was escorting the hawk away from its hunting territory....In the end the hawk was fine and no worse for wear..."},
{"title": "Laughter and tears....", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "text": "For several years, with the exception of last year, I have listened to the unabridged version Rick Bragg's book, All Over but the Shoutin', sometime during the holiday season...either on the day before Thanksgiving or Christmas as I mess around in the kitchen fixing this and that.  But last year, it was no longer available at the library.  I know I ended up with something to listen to, but whatever it was did not impress me because I don't remember.This year, I just happened to start listening to Oogy, the Dog Only a Family Could Love by Larry Levin....I tell you I have found my new holiday book!  You can click the badge to be taken to Amazon's page....or you can watch the video below about the book. Oogy was used as a bait dog for fighting dogs, but was rescued in a police raid.  His ear is chewed off, and lots of other damage...but he never holds a grudge against human beings, nor other dogs for that matter.I have cried and I have laughed while listening to this...the bittersweet sort of tears.  Though Lorelei's Otti Doddi was not abused, there are so many of their traits that are the same.  The destructiveness  in puppy hood--that was oh, so familiar.  Then the barking at people, not because of aggressiveness but because he can't get to them...in Otto's case he wants to lick them to death.In Otto's case, other than once or twice showing aggressiveness towards strays, he usually drools with anticipation if he thinks one of their friends might be bringing a  play date for him...that is the only time he drools.  Since they have moved away, he no longer has play dates, but a neighbor behind them has a little dog that runs up and down the outside of Sarah's fence and he enjoys running back and forth with it.Anyway, I am not being paid for this...I am just really, really enjoying the book.  It is one of the better finds I have made.  Sometimes I check out a book at the library thinking it will be good, only to be disappointed....I have had two or three animal stories that while not bad were not as great as I thought.  So, I checked this one out thinking well, it is free...if it isn't good it is nothing lost.  I didn't want to be disappointed again.  Now, I am thinking I would not mind owning it.I will leave you with a picture of our Lorelei...this is the other thing that makes me smile, when I think of this picture.I will leave you a picture of Lorelei...Sarah was at her sink, which is where the bright spot is in the photo...she heard this \"I found you mommy\" and looked around and Lorelei had rolled the chair over from their computer and climbed on it and was looking over the counter at her.I haven't got a new picture of Otto...Lorelei still uses him for everything.  Sits on him, uses him to climb places, gets her blanket and lays down beside him, and generally loves him to pieces.  I would say they are both lucky to have each other...the only thing he don't like is for her to get his tail and pull on it.  He don't get mad or anything, he just pulls away....other than that he takes it all and kisses her every chance he gets.As this holiday season begins, I am so thankful to have the husband I have, and to have two daughters that are ever a source of love, joy and might I add pride, a son-in-law that could not be better, and cute little Lorelei to hold and love...I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving...and may it hold for you all the joy your heart can hold.Edited to add:I have listened far enough to learn that Oogy is not a pitbull, as the vets first thought but is a Dogo....a breed that was developed in Argentina for big game hunting.  To me, they still look like pitbulls."},

There had not been one single ray of sunshine so far the entire day, and I will say here that we never got the first hint of sunshine before dark.  And though I didn't check my thermometer, I checked the weather on line and the high was 48º. Anyway, I just didn't feel like being out in the chilly wind to take photographs.

I for the longest time called it one thing and it was the other and now I can't remember which is correct and which isn't.  They have the best chicken, best dressing, and vegetable soup!  They are served on their buffet, which we always get.  I always get those three things..sometimes I try a little of something else, but I always choose those first.I ran by Stitch and Sew to pick up a couple things, then by an Amish shop out in the country where I got Lorelei some coloring books.  They have coloring books more along the lines of what we had as kids...not based on some TV cartoon or character.  These have all kinds of nice pictures of animals, and kids playing doing things.We headed on home from there, sticking to back roads for about half the way.We passed this place after we left the previously mentioned shop....I liked the door area, and I liked the fall decorations.**********************I set and finished the binding on Lorelei's quilt.

I was afraid I would come home someday to a foot of water in the basement.  So we picked up a new one, came home, and I helped Roger get it down in the basement, and left him getting ready to put it in.  I had gotten some new birdseed and wanted to fill my feeders...then got into something else.I went down there in a bit, to find a big puddle of water...the 'faucet' that served as the drain at the bottom of the old water heater had broken off when Roger put the hose on it and tried to turn it on.

I have always wanted to have a few seeds to see if I could grow it up here.  I know I would have to start it inside in very early spring or late winter.    But that has never happened...but at least I got to see it growing and got to take these photos.There were occasional blooms, even though the majority of the field was about ready to be picked...at least I think it was about ready.   When  picking apples in the fall, I would occasionally find a few blooms scattered here or there in the orchard...so it did not surprise me to see these cotton blossoms.I always thought growing tobacco was a hot job, and sort of nasty with the way the tobacco would tar up my hands...but I am thinking nothing I done with tobacco would hold a candle to the job of picking cotton by hand.The cotton we seen was low growing--maybe two feet high.  So most adults would have to stoop to pick it...then it would be rough on the hands...and dragging that bag behind would have really been tiring when it was full and probably aggravating even when it was empty.  But I would still like to grow a few plants just to see it grow.I love cotton...I prefer clothes made of cotton.  I want sheets made of cotton.   It is the fabric I use to make my quilts with.  So it really is the fabric of choice for my life."},

I ended up being home about a week more than I had planned.Sarah is doing great, and we are all about recovered from our colds except for the occasional coughing.   I just have to tell this...I don't think Sarah will mind.  After we left that first night we came home, Sarah had to get up with Lorelei....then Sarah got sick at her stomach.  Lorelei was standing in the door of the bathroom while Sarah was being sick...Lorelei stood over there and laughed and laughed at her mom vomiting.

Maybe the quilting will be finished by this time tomorrow.Speaking of tomorrow, we are supposed to get our Rav4 back then.  Hopefully all will be as good as new."},
{"title": "Showing earlier than I planned....", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "Isn't this wild?  It is going to be a new quilt for Lorelei...it is Olivia, the TV cartoon pig.  I saw her before Lorelei had arrived and thought well who in the world would like that cartoon.  The answer is Lorelei.  She loves her...along with a bunch of others.  I have had the top made for a week or two.  I had the 'blocks' made for a few days before finding that wild fabric to use as sashing and border.I use the term block loosely here...the pictures of Olivia are just printed on the fabric.  Not applique or anything hard.  They came framed in pink and red, but I cut that off to cut them all the same size, then used a black and white print to frame each picture.  They sat for a while...I went through my material and could  not find anything I liked to use between the blocks.I happened to go for a drive one day...one of those rambling drives with no destination in mind.  I ended up north of Paris, Illinois, on Route 1 a couple miles north of Lori's Pins & Needles, one of the best quilt shops around.  She always has the best selection of fabric around.  So, I thought since I was over there I would stop and look for sashing material.  I had something entirely different in mind, but she had everything but what I wanted.  She had fabrics from the line of fabrics I wanted, but not the particular fabric I had had in mind.Then I saw the red/chartreuse fabric and it called my name...no, it shouted my name...saying 'Here I am! Here I am!'  I could not resist it.  I thought I might get home and not like it, but when I laid the blocks on top of it leaving 3 or 4 inches between, I still liked it.  I hollered for Roger to come look and see what he thought.  He loved it as much as me.  So, I stuck with it.I made the backing the other day...I am using bleached muslin for the first time ever in my life.  Well, the bleached part...I have used plain muslin before.  Anyway, yesterday I got it all stretched and layered and pin basted, my machine is set up to free motion quilt...yet I have not totally made up my mind about how I am going to quilt it nor the  thread I want to use.  About the time I think I have decided, I have second thoughts.I am hoping to get it quilted in the next day or so...since we will be headed over there this weekend sometime."},

{"title": "Smells of memories.....", "date": "Wednesday, September 29, 2010", "text": "I was frying bacon the other morn, and the aroma attacked my sense of smell...triggering memories of home. Feelings of well being.  Childhood.  Just everything rolled into one little scent. For the moment, I forgot all else. It seems like the older I get, the more I think about and notice smells and how they are associated with memories.  And many of those are of childhood.Is there anyone that reads this, other than family, who knows the smell of a corn crib?  When seeing a corn crib one day on one of our rambling drives, I thought to myself I will probably never smell that again.  It is hard to describe...kind of a dusty, musty smell I guess.  When the crib is almost empty at the end of the summer, I can remember us kids digging through the last corners of corn, looking for the nests of mice.  I know we found them, and I am pretty sure we killed the babies...but I don't remember doing that myself.  (Now, I could not do that at all...and maybe I didn't actually kill them then...I don't remember.  I know we did not attempt to raise them as pets.)And then there is the smell of a cow and/or horse barn.  That odor offends many people's senses, but I always take a deep breath of it....again transported back in time.  I remember playing with calves when they were born.  Our barn had individual stalls for each cow...each cow had a name of course.  The barn did not sit in the pasture but at the edge of it.We only put all the cows in in the winter;  in the summer, we sometimes kept a calf or two in the barn and would turn the mom in to it, then turn her back out of the morn.  Or let one in to be milked.But back to winter, we made sure all the stall doors were open before we opened the gate.  Once the gate was open, the cows and Old Bob would come rambling in, pretty much in an orderly fashion.  Each cow had an assigned stall, and each one went into its own stall...we didn't have to direct them or anything.  Why we had them assigned to their own place I don't know...unless it was just easier.  We went behind them and shut the doors...made sure all was fed before we left.I think Dolly Parton said it well when she wrote these lines toMy Tennessee Mountain Home  Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon  In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall  Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string  And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall    Chorus:  In my Tennessee mountain home  Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh  In my Tennessee mountain home  Crickets sing in the fields near by    Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane  Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet  And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings  An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody Is there any smell better than honeysuckle blooming when you are driving down the road and pass through an area where it is growing.  It grows over by the railroad here close to home.  When the girls were young, they would take walks over there and bring home bouquets of it....the smell would permeate the whole house.   So every time I smell it, I think of my own childhood, plus think of our girls....and I wonder do they ever think of those times.And there is woodsmoke.  I always write about woodsmoke.  I always make a comment if I smell woodsmoke.  I would dearly love to be able to bottle it...I would use at as perfume...I would make a candle that smells like it...I would have those car deodorant things in that smell. And hay that has just been cut...I love it just about as much as wood smoke...Oh, and the smell of the cooler at work when it is getting full of apples....it is an all enveloping smell...or when we made cider. And the smell of pine needle....."},

The wig part.  Just something about seeing that followed by prom dresses...just who is going to the prom?By the way, it is Newnan, not Newman as I originally thought.  I misread the sign...************We got up and headed to Terre Haute this morn, originally to go by the book store but decided to go to Hobby Lobby first.  We had left there and were sitting at a stoplight and we were rear ended...a pretty good hit.  We had our seat belts on...I did not notice at first but stuff, mainly change, had flew out of the cubbyhole;  I had a can of Coke and some of it had splattered out.We at least walked away from it....Edited to add:I told Roger other than the first three or four years of our marriage, I don't think we have had a single vehicle that hasn't been involved in at least one wreck...some more than one.  And only one was my fault. It is not even funny.  I don't even think I can remember all of them...off the top of my head I can remember nine.  One of them don't count in ways...someone hit us from behind but it was so minor we could not see any damage so we all just went on. On the other hand, we had a Dodge minivan that seemed to have a bull's eye on it.  We had had it 6 months when Roger was coming home from work...down a 4 lane highway...55mph and this old man got confused at a stoplight and turned in front of him.  The old man was hurt...We got t-boned in it...no one hurt.  But both it and the one above really did a lot of damage to the van. I was going to pick up my daughter at school and a girl pulled out in front of me...I was right at the cross street and even though I was only going 25-30 mph, I couldn't stop when the teenager pulled out in front of me.  But it didn't hurt the van too much nor me at all...Then Roger had it at work and someone went to pull through a parking space and pulled into him.  It was one of the guys I didn't know.  But thankfully, Roger had a buddy with him...the guy that hit him started to claim it wasn't his fault and Roger reminded him he had a witness. I feel like I am forgetting something that happened with the van....but I think 4 accidents is a lot for one vehicle. I don't think the rest of our families combined has been involved in this many wrecks."},

{"title": "Once when we were children...", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2010", "text": "I got these pictures in an email from Glen, my nephew that gave me the tool tips in the post below...he thought you might like to see a picture of us when we were young.  Above is my mom, with her hand on his back...and that is me sitting there.That is taken up at our old home place...I don't know what year it was taken.  Probably around 1957-58...(Just think back then...diapers were the norm...pampers had not been invented quite yet.  Here is wikipedia's article on Pampers...they were made at a much earlier date than I would have thought.  According to the article, 1961 was the date they were introduced.) Of course I don't remember this being taken...but there are lots of memories of Glen...he spent two or three summers with us.  None of us can remember how many...we all are positive he spent at least two summers with us, but other than that none of us know for sure if he spent any more.It makes no difference how many he spent...we have a lifetime of memories. There was Gap Creek that bordered our pasture and hayfield...I think we waded it every day of the week.  Unless it stormed and the creek got too high.  People up the road a few miles had thrown a tire in it every now and then, and when it flooded, it would wash them on down the creek.  One would get partially buried in the creekbed.  We would catch all the crawdads we could fine and put them 'in the tire,' as if that would actually corral them.And we were mussel farmers of a sort...you go along and watch for their mouth to be open...all it looks like is just a small dark slit in the sand on the bottom.  We would also gather all of those we could and have an area of the creek we would stick them in.  Of course they didn't stay...but it was fun to do.Not to mention skipping rocks, and occasionally actually fishing...nothing big to fish for, except there was supposed to be a big turtle down by the railroad trestle.  No one ever caught it that I am aware of so it might have been a figment of someone's imagination.   And I cannot walk where there are a lot of pine/cedar trees without the smell takes me instantly back to our childhood. I think we spent a third of the day in the creek, and a third in the cedar thicket, and a third in this basement that had been dug for a house....it filled with 2 or 3 feet of water and a house was never built.  It was more or less a big mudhole.  Actually, there was another pond just a couple hundred yards from the one--I really think they started to dig the basement there, only to have water start filling it right away.    It really wasn't much more than a mudhole. We (actually, my brothers I think) had put sungrannies in it, and I think catfish.  Sungrannies were some kind of fish...I don't know  what their real name was and cannot remember them too clearly.  I just know sometimes we could hold a worm down to the water with our bare hands and they would take it...other times they wouldn't bite anything.  We caught and released them because they were to little for eating.I don't remember being inside, during the summer except at night...and for meals.  And I think I probably had to wash dishes at night...I can't remember real clear when that started.  Otherwise, we were outside doing something."},
{"title": "With thanks to my nephew, here you have Tool Tips", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "I don't know about everyone else, but normally I check my email several times a day...though I may not do anything else on here...I usually check it.  Yesterday I came in and found an email from my nephew...in it was these tool tips.  I sat there and laughed till I cried over several of them...I don't know if they were that funny or if it was just the mood I was in.....nahhh, I just started reading them again and they are still just as funny.  Oh, and by the way, the photo has nothing to do with the writing...I  just thought the color was gorgeous.For those of you who might not be very familiar with some tools, this might help.     DRILL PRESS: A  tall upright machine useful for suddenly snatching flat metal bar stock  out of your hands so that it smacks you in the chest and flings your  beer across the room, denting the freshly-painted vertical stabilizer which you had carefully set in the corner where nothing could get to it.   WIRE WHEEL: Cleans  paint off bolts and then throws them somewhere under the workbench with  the speed of light. Also removes fingerprints and hard-earned calluses  from fingers in about the time it takes you to say, ' Oh sh--.... '   ELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning pop rivets in their holes until you die of old age.   SKILL SAW: A portable cutting tool used to make studs too short.   PLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads. Sometimes used in the creation of blood-blisters.   BELT SANDER: An electric sanding tool commonly used to convert minor touch-up jobs into major refinishing jobs.   HACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools  built on the Ouija board principle. It transforms human energy into a  crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its  course, the more dismal your future becomes.   VISE-GRIPS: Generally  used after pliers to completely round off bolt heads. If nothing else  is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to  the palm of your hand.   WELDING GLOVES: Heavy duty leather gloves used to prolong the conduction of intense welding heat to the palm of your hand.   OXYACETYLENE TORCH: Used  almost entirely for lighting various flammable objects in your shop on  fire. Also handy for igniting the grease inside the wheel hub out of  which you want to remove a bearing race.   TABLE SAW: A large stationary power tool commonly used to launch wood projectiles for testing wall integrity.   HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used  for lowering an automobile to the ground after you have installed your  new brake shoes, trapping the jack handle firmly under the bumper.   EIGHT-FOOT LONG YELLOW PINE 2X4: Used for levering an automobile upward off of a trapped hydraulic jack handle.   E-Z OUT BOLT AND STUD EXTRACTOR: A tool ten times harder than any known drill bit that snaps neatly off in bolt holes thereby ending any possible future use.   BAND SAW: A large stationary power saw primarily used by most shops to cut good aluminum sheet  into smaller pieces that more easily fit into the trash can after you  cut on the inside of the line instead of the outside edge.   TWO-TON ENGINE HOIST: A tool for testing the maximum tensile strength of everything you forgot to disconnect.   CRAFTSMAN 1/2 x 24-INCH SCREWDRIVER: A very large pry bar that inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end opposite the handle.   AVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw.   PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally  used to stab the vacuum seals under lids or for opening old-style  paper-and-tin oil cans and splashing oil on your shirt; but can also be  used, as the name implies, to strip out Phillips screw heads.   STRAIGHT SCREWDRIVER: A tool for opening paint cans. Sometimes used to convert common slotted screws into non-removable screws.   PRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.   HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to make hoses too short.   HAMMER: Originally  employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of  divining rod to locate the most expensive parts adjacent the object we  are trying to hit.   MECHANIC ' S KNIFE: Used  to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered  to your front door; works particularly well on contents such as seats,  vinyl records, liquids in plastic bottles, collector magazines , refund  checks, and rubber or plastic parts. Especially useful for slicing work  clothes, but only while in use.   DAMMIT TOOL: Any  handy tool that you grab and throw across the garage while yelling '  DAMMIT ' at the top of your lungs. It is also, most often, the next tool  that you will need."},

I can just look and look and never seem to drink in the scene enough to get my fill.One day I want to get the tripod out and take a series of photos and stitch them together....the photo above does not quite do justice to the feel of the area.  Did anyone else see the show PBS had about the photographer, Art Sinsabaugh?  Sometimes I question why I feel the need to take so many photographs, but then I find someone like him whose photographs really captured  moments in time and I realize I hope some of mine might mean something, someday, to someone. I will spend hours looking at photographs...sometimes I look for digital libraries of old photographs, and others I just find web albums or blogs that have really good images.

I was sitting in the floor playing with Lorelei Thursday evening.  She was kind of in front of me on one side, and Otto was laying just inches from her.

Well, we spotted this caterpillar yesterday and I told Roger I was tempted to get a jar or something to put him in, but since I didn't know what he was...didn't know what to feed him, I didn't.  And the fact is, I am not sure he was even hungry....he seemed to be on a hunt.Finally late yesterday evening I googled 'bright green caterpillar', seen a photo that matched this one right away, and it led me to finding that it is a Polyphemus Moth...take a look at what he becomes.  So I have been wishing I had captured it; but in ways I am glad I didn't cause I think it was on the hunt to find a place to spin its cocoon...so I might have really interfered with its life cycle.*****************Now, for something I cannot quite believe myself.  I don't suppose any of you have noticed that I have not mentioned Mama Squirrel in quite a while.  I have not seen her in at least two months....I really had given up on her still being alive.  Or maybe not totally, because I sure have been looking for her....even if she had been in the cottonwoods across the street she is hard to see in them.But with us being outside and talking almost everyday, it has been very odd for her to not come.  Used to be I would set outside to talk on the phone, or just Roger and I sitting out back and we would look up and there she would be.  So with him being outside working on the old garage almost every day, it was really starting to hit home that this time she was really gone.Lo and behold, this afternoon a buddy of Roger's was over and we were sitting on the front porch talking, and I glanced towards the street and there ran a squirrel...I yelled, \"Mama Squirrel, is that you?\" never really expecting a reaction.  It put on the brakes, stopped, and I think I yelled 'Mama' again and it gave me that look...I ran inside to get nuts, and Roger kept talking to her...I came outside, all the time thinking it doesn't even look like her...it can't be her...but as I got closer I could see that it was her...I walked right up to her and bent down and gave her a nut, and then told her to come on and I went to the back...she followed along behind and I put her 'lunch' on Roger's trailer...and I got her a bowl of water.  She used to all the time drink from Shelby's water dish out back so I though she might appreciate some fresh water.Every time I think about it, I just cannot believe it was her...she is SO skinny...I have never seen her so little.  She was/is almost skin and bones.  I know summers have really bothered her the past two summers, but she never looked near like this.But back to me yelling at her, Roger's friend is a new friend and has never seen her and even though I think we told him about her, I don't think it sunk in...most of Roger's buddies have either seen her or at least seen her pictures.  But today when I yelled, I felt like his friend about jumped out of his skin....then proceeded to think we were both probably a little bit crazy.  Now he didn't say anything, but I just got that feeling..till he seen her and her reaction.And you know, I told Roger we should have known it was her...what other squirrel stops and looks at us when we yell 'Mama Squirrel!'And I do wish I had a picture of her, but if you compared it to the others, you wouldn't believe it was her anyway."},
{"title": "Warning ahead", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "We went for a little drive yesterday...actually wanted to go down this road that we have passed numerous times in over the years and always wondered what was down it.  Well, there wasn't anything real special about the road, but at last we know.  And that road led us down other roads...and one we started down warned of a height restriction ahead.  We wondered what in the world was ahead...and came down around a little bend and here was what awaited us.  I will have another view on Time Stand Still...This is interesting to me by itself...but I went to Mike and D's Life in the Hoosier State and Beyond post of something I have passed at least a hundred times, and probably more. Another railroad trestle.  It is one I have always meant to take a photo of, but just never been there at the right time with my camera.But what got me was the date of it...it is the same date as this one.  Enlarge the picture and look at how the numbers are made and then go look at her post.  It makes me wonder if they were made by the same people.  We even came to another trestle/bridge or what ever you want to call it similar to the one above, with the same date, but I did not take a photo of it.*********It is taking some time to get used to not seeing Lorelei two or three times a week.  She is liking the new house--seems to have settled in really nice.  One day when Sarah was trying to get her settled for her nap, she had to have her Elmo, her bee pillow which is a big fuzzy yellow pillow about 15 inches square, with markings like a bee and her cow.  Now her cow is just a hard plastic cow and this is not the first time she has had to have it to go to sleep....She is also really enjoying getting to see her daddy every day...She ended up sick at the end of last week...one doctor said it was a double ear infection...and gave her an antibiotic.  The next day she had a rash, which they were afraid was an allergic reaction so they took her to another doctor, who said that he thought it was a heat rash from such high temperatures, and said that if it was an allergic reaction it would be more splotchy.  He also said her ears looked fine, but her throat was red and that it might have been strep but the antibiotic the other doctor had prescribed would take care of it.Then yesterday she fell and hit her head on the TV stand and got a goose egg..I have picture but not going to show it.  It makes me hurt just to look at it.   So, it has been somewhat of a rough start over there...but things will settle down.We went for a little drive today, passing this house during our travels.  There is just so much on this porch and in the yard it is hard to see it all.  I wondered to myself if it was all treasures, or if it was just stuff.  I have not doubt that at least at one time it was all treasures, and may still be.I also got to thinking about old houses down home...a lot of women had flowers on the front porch.  Back when I was a child it was not uncommon to have a 'shelf' spanning the space between two support posts of the porch.  The only ones I ever saw were just boards...no paint or stain of any sort.  And potted plants and flowers were set on the board. I have not seen a house like this in years and years.  And this in turn led me to thinking about other things that have come and gone.  Remember when plant stands similar to the one shown here was the thing to have.  Almost everyone I knew, and granted I didn't know that many people, but I think every neighbor we had at one time had one of these.Another thing that everyone seemed to buy during the early years of our marriage was the hall tree.  Granted, people still buy them but not near as much. Oh, and remember when ashtrays and ashtray stands were a common gift...no home was without ashtrays.  Even if you did not smoke, you almost always had people coming that did.  I still do have a couple of ashtrays, but my friends that do smoke usually smoke outside because they know smoke really bothers us.Then there were all the gadgets for the kitchen...I cannot even remember all the different things that came out.  I think there was one for making grilled cheese.  Then there was this 'thing' to do hot dogs on.  The hot dogs  were more or less electrocuted.  I know there were others, but I am having trouble remembering them.  Those were the two things that were given to me...other than them I cannot remember any of the others.  I just know at one time I thought it was possible to buy a gadget geared to every job."},

Instead I chose to introduce Bill Dance.  He is an angler and had his own TV show at one time....I don't know if it is still on TV. Anyway, after watching this video, you will see why I called this post ' An accident waiting to happen.'  This is compilation of some of his 'accidents.'  I hope you enjoy it."},
{"title": "From Sarah's cell phone", "date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2010", "text": "At first glance, you may think Lorelei is asleep, but glance at the hand against the door..it is just a blur of motion.  This is taken in what we call the sun room of Sarah's house...the door goes out on to the deck...Sarah put this little throw rug there and the toot just loves to play with it.  She uses it as a quilt to cover up her toys, etc.  Today she was playing with Otto there.I cannot seem  to settle down into blogging at all...yet I don't do much else either.  I guess I will eventually get back to normal, or at least what is normal for me.***************We just got a little bit of rain for the first time in ages.  I cannot remember the last time we had rain.  I think there has been a time or two when we got a few drops, but not enough to even make the pavement and sidewalks wet.  So far, that is all this rain had done....just enough to get them damp.  We have some patches in the yard that are turning brown.That is typical of the summers here, though.  I remember more summers where we would go a month with hardly needing to mow.  I can probably count on one hand the number of summers where we have had to mow every week.I see more leaves falling every day...When the leaves start to turn, my mind automatically turns to the woods.  And ginseng....pictured above for those of you who don't know what it is.  It turns this golden glow in the fall...even before fall became the legal time to dig it, fall was the favorite time.  It was easier to spot.Usually on a Sunday, my mom and I would decide to head for the woods...sometimes just to be going, but more often it was to dig ginseng.  If we were lucky, we got to go for 3 or 4 or 5 hours.  I had this old black purse.....I used it as a pack.  It had belonged to an older sister, was round like a log....probably about 6 inches in diameter and 12 or 15 inches long with a zipper across the top and a shoulder strap.I didn't take it to put the ginseng in...ginseng went in our pockets.  I used that old purse to carry our dinner in...a slice of home cured pork shoulder or  sometimes plain old home cured bacon, cornbread, and an onion.  I always carried some matches, but I don't remember if I carried them in that old purse or in something in my pocket. We would work our way back to this one creek, usually ending up there about half way through our hunt.We would get out on a little gravel bar, I would hunt dried twigs and little limbs that I could break, and we would start a little fire. While the fire got going good and got hot, we would each hunt a small sapling or a tree to break a limb/twig from...you know how you do to cook marshmellow.... we would peel back the bark, sharpen an end, and spear our slice of meat on it.  We would slowly turn it over the fire, till it was sizzling hot, and grease dripping from it.  I can almost smell it now!We would find a rock or something to sit and get comfortable on while we ate meat and onion and cornbread!  Talk about delicious....there isn't anything better than that."},

I don't know what the above caterpillar becomes...I first thought that maybe a Pearl Crescent, but when googling Pearl Crescent cater pillar, this is not among the images shown.  So I have no idea what it is going to become.I had tried to capture the Pearl Crescent butterfly other times and they  were not very cooperative.  However, they were enjoying the jewel weed so  much that I had not trouble getting near....**************************The move went smoothly for Sarah and Jeremy....Neal and his wife came and helped unload, as well as a couple of their friends, plus Jeremy's brother and his wife.  Little Lorelei definitely enjoyed the second day better than the first because her little cousin was there, plus other kids.BUT.....she had only taken a 45 minute nap on Friday, did not get to bed till 10:30 or 11:00, and up at 7:00 Saturday morn.  No nap that day, and she did not want to settle down to go to sleep, but when she did she was back up in an hour or two for a while.We spent the night and came home Sunday evening...I think it was a rough night for Lo that night too, but yesterday she settled down for a nap easily....after Sarah got her her Elmo, her big fuzzy Bee pillow and her hard plastic cow!  She wanted Otti Doddie but Sarah felt like that was little bit too much.I don't think I mentioned that during the past week or two, one day Lorelei would try to get Otto to chase her and she would throw herself in the floor, trying to get him to get her  like he did in the videos in the link above.  And she was doing that Sunday...she just thinks it is so funny. I don't know if he would ever be protective of her...he just doesn't meet strangers.  But a lot of the time, when Lorelei is outside, he lays not too far from her.I don't know if I have told this or not, but Lorelei loves dirt!  She likes to take her shovel and find a dusty place and cover herself and Otto with dirt...and Otto just lets her.  Actually, you can do anything to him, and he just doesn't care.  You cannot hurt him.  That is one of the reasons they were the #1 pet in America at one time...  Anyway, after an afternoon of playing in the dirt, their mommy has to hose Otto down, and take Lo inside and give her a bath....I must say I sure enjoy him...I fell asleep on Sarah's couch Saturday night, and he came and laid right beside me up against the couch.  Every now and then he would raise up, maybe lay his face on the edge of the couch and stare at me, and then lay back down and curl up right back against the couch.I think we have to make a trip to Terre Haute here in a bit...not sure when I will catch up with everyone...I am hoping tonight I get some un-interrupted time to visit my favorite blogs.."},

I notice a tree over on the next street starting to turn...and see splotches of color every now and then.  I really am looking forward to the changing colors.I am running on empty....we spent the day at Sarah's.  The trucks are packed, the house is practically empty.....hopefully by this time tomorrow night we will all be asleep at her new house.  I didn't do much other than try to keep Lorelei entertained, but had stuff to do when I got home and have just now finally finished.Jeremy and Sarah have some really great friends....there were three there when we got there this morn and none of them were slackers.  They got the house cleaned out in no time.  One couple had to leave, but they waited till all the heavy stuff was loaded...which means that almost all of it was done.  One guy had come home from Indy with Jeremy last night to drive one of their cars home...he left sometime in the afternoon....and he will be at their new house tomorrow to help unload.  One of the guys was there still there when we left....And they are all kids we like...the instant we meet them.  Just hard working, good hearted kids.  Oh, and Lorelei likes them all!  That should tell you a whole lot right there.Not sure when I will get to blog again or visit anyone...I have photos scheduled for my other blog...but nothing planned for here.  So I will see you in two or three days probably."},

I swear, I don't think there is a time when I see them that I don't think of childhood.  First of all, my own childhood.  I just remember everywhere I went,  the grasshoppers were always jumping every which way in front of and beside me.  To walk through a hayfield or tall grass was something else!  They were just everywhere, and lots of them...all sizes.  I am not sure, but I think we shot them with BB guns also...or maybe it was my brother and my nephew that shot at them....but if they did, then I am sure I was involved in it too but the memory is so vague I just cannot be positive.And I remember the cats catching them and eating them.Then I think of my own girls...I don't know of any other kids that did the things we let them do.  Like I can remember them catching this one grasshopper and putting him in a quart jar and poking holes in the lid.  And they would gather grass for it....I cannot remember how long they kept him, but he doubled in size!  And I am pretty sure they set him free before the summer was over.They also had the Monarch chrysalis and witnessed the butterfly emerge....When they were young, up around 8 and 10, and along about that age, for two or three summers we kept one of those little wading pools in the back yard.  You know, the hard plastic kind like this.  You might ask what kids that age would want with one of those pools...well, we brought home tadpoles, Pumpkinseed bluegills, crawdads, and waterboatmen....I guess you would say it was an aquarium of sorts.  We watched the bluegills grow, watched tadpoles change to frogs, we even had a crawdad that had a bunch of babies....I think that is the one and only time I witnessed that....and I think they brought the waterboatman home just because they could....that is all I remember them having, but I might be forgetting something. But all these memories are jogged every time I see grasshoppers.I am pretty sure this is a Question Mark butterfly...I only got to snap this single photo.  He seems to be on the shy side...I have seen it or one just like it several times but it never pauses very long.  And for sure not if I approach it....with or without camera.There are more butterflies here this year than I have ever noticed before...Puss Puss has a fun time trying to catch them.  I saw her come carrying a Monarch yesterday evening, but she let it get away.Oh, last night we went out to the garage real late....to check on something about the doors Roger is making for the old garage.  We spotted three little tree frogs on the side of the garage!  One of them looked just the exact color of the siding, one had more green to it, and one was down so close to the ground that I didn't get down and inspect it.  I am so thrilled to have seen that many.One summer there were all kinds of toads in the yard, but I have not seen that many since.  In fact, only see one occasionally.  I think our 'pet' must have died...the last time we seen her she was about double the size she is in the post above.  Notice the size in comparison to the hand.  The last time we had it, it was almost wider than our hand!"},

I say fellow,  but I have a feeling it was a little gal.  We seen it up by Shipshewana...I assume they are raising it by hand.When I was a kid I helped to raise a couple calves....we didn't use a bottle, but a bucket that had a big rubber nipple on the outside similar to this. Ours was made of metal, and it also had a  way for us to hang it from a board if we wanted.  But I never wanted to...feeding baby calves was a fun thing to do in my opinion.  And still would be for that matter.  We didn't raise very many that way, and now I cannot even remember where they came from.Then later, when Roger and I lived in Tennessee we raised two on bottles...I don't remember why we chose bottles.  Either way was fun....We would buy the formula in what I assume was 25 lb. bags and mix a bucket/bottle of it and head for the barn.  Of course we mixed a small amount to begin with and increased the amount as the calf grew.  I know we had to teach a calf how to use the bucket, but it was never hard to do.  Since then, I have heard so many times of calves just being taught to drink it like it is water and I wonder if that would have worked.  I still would do it the way with did it or with bottles, simply cause I would enjoy it...but when you hear of something being done different to the way you have done things, you tend to wonder how well it works that way.*************************I did get my project made yesterday...I am so relieved to have it done.  Now I can start on something fun...I have another small quilt top I want to make.  Then when it is done, I want to quilt it and the other baby quilt that I just recently made.For right now, I have to head to Sarah's....she has more packing to do."},

We counted 7 butterflies in it...Then there were these butterflies...I have just started seeing them this year.  I don't ever recall seeing them before, but maybe I did and just don't remember.  The width of the yellow bands almost makes me think it is two different kinds, but maybe it just signifies male and female.  I am thinking they are the Giant Swallowtail, so if you know for sure one way or the other, please chime in in the comments.Then there is the little guy below...We saw just a few of them...not sure what kind it is.  Probably a Frittillary but I am not sure which one.  It was much smaller than the swallowtails and the monarchs.*****************I have clothes hanging on the line, Roger is working on the old garage....actually he is getting ready to make doors for it.  He is going to make them to look like barn doors.  He is having to do some other work first.I went down to sew some this morn, and discovered I had cut some pieces of my project the wrong way...so I am having to 'fix' my problem before I can really get down to sewing.    I was tired when I cut the pieces and I know better than to do anything that requires thinking when I have that worn out feeling.  I know what I done, and it was dumb, dumb, dumb!  But mom always said if you hadn't made mistakes, you hadn't ever done anything....so will try to look at this as a learning experience.I don't mind that tired feeling if I have actually been working, but I hate that just going shopping totally wears me out.  I hate shopping because of that...the only time I enjoy it is when I go Christmas shopping.  And even then I still suffer that totally worn out feeling, but I still enjoy shopping for gifts.P.S.  I forgot to add that it was harder than heck to get any decent photograghs of the butterflies...the wind was blowing the entire time I was there."},

The humidity has been down some the past few days.  I am feeling fall drawing near every morn or every evening that I set outside in the swings.  This year, I suppose it will be bittersweet, with both girls moving.My older daughter has about a month of training left....she is doing well in it.  Both the physical and the book learning.  I wish I could remember the details of some of her physical training...I don't think I could have did it when young.  The other days was this:  12 stations of calisthenics...1 min of cal then run a lap to following station....another involved an Indian run....along with all the other calisthenics.

Sarah's sister-in-law was there today and she noticed it.  She puts her arms straight and sort of back a little bit and bends forward and runs...just sort of all out for her. Her head leading the way... I wish I had a video to show.  It makes us all giggle.She has two Noah's in her life, and she loves them both.  She has the Noah who is the son of one of Sarah's childhood friend, but she also has a neighbor across the street named Noah.  He is either a couple weeks older or younger than Lorelei.  Well, neighbor Noah had been gone on vacation last week and they got home yesterday evening sometime after I left.I would have loved to witness the reunion...Sarah was doing something outside and heard Lorelei getting excited...and she turned around and there she was at the fence, reaching through for him.  I can only imagine the excitement...I was there today and Noah's dad came walking over with him....when Lorelei saw him she just started giggling.  It makes everyone laugh to see and hear her."},

Notice how his legs really blend in with the siding on the garage?The above photo is a cropped version of another one...I was so happy with this.  I was amaze it was even half in focus because it was dark outside with only the light from the corner of the garage.At home, we had a wisteria growing at the end of the porch...and often times we would see a tree frog on the window in the living room...I think it traveled out the wisteria and got on the window from one of the vines.  He was at least 10-15 times bigger than this little guy!  This one would almost have fit on a quarter, and for sure on a half dollar. For a while, every time I sat on the front porch here, I would hear one but have yet to spot it.  It sounds as if it could be quite a bit bigger than this one, if you can go at all by sound.And remember when we were kids and would go out on the playground at school, and there would be little tiny frogs everywhere?  Or did that not happen any where else.  We never did know where they came from...but there would be hundreds of them and they were easy to catch they were so plentiful.  If I remember correctly, they would only be there a day or two and then we just didn't see them any more.There wasn't any pond of water anywhere close, though I do think if it rained enough over in the pasture next to the school grounds there would be a big puddle.  It was just strange...I cannot remember seeing that happen anywhere else...but it happened there several different years."},

And we would be there and not have to get up super early to go in.   They were leaving at 7:30. So, we got to be there again when Miss Lorelei got up from a night sleep.  It is just so special...she wakes in the best mood.  And she is just so bright-eyed  and fresh.  It is just like having a little bit of sunshine in the room with us.  I tell you we sure have a good time with her.  She tries to say whatever we tell her if she thinks she has a chance at all...and she does seem to know the words she would have problems with and skips them.She has an active imagination...we just can't decipher what she is saying most of the time.

Sarah and Jeremy live in Terre Haute right now...the couple they are buying the house from is from Terre Haute and they both graduated from the same high school Jeremy went to.Now this couple happens to be personal friends with their realtor and his wife...and his wife was there today.

I seen frogs, butterflies, one pheasant and one quail....none of the things that fly cooperated at all...and only one photo of a frog.I passed on through the strip pits coming out just over the state line in Illinois...and drove north for the most part.  I came to this section of road that had fresh clover blossoms and in general was just a grassy area, with butterflies that were much more willing to pose.  I had one land on me and I shooed it off without thinking.  Then this one landed on my arm.I took a few photos with it there, but I could not get my arm in a position and far enough away at the same time for it to be in focus...the auto focus on my longer lens does not work so all that was left was to move my arm to try to get it in focus.  The above is one of those photos.I took some other pictures with it staying on my arm, so I though I might as well try something...so I put my finger up there and it crawled on to that hand.  It was on my left arm so, I had to use my right hand.  So, since I am right handed and could not operate the camera at all with my left hand, I had to transfer the little guy back over to my left hand...so, here's a photo from that.I tried to go on about my business and leave it alone while I took photos of other butterflies, but it insisted on staying at the ends of my fingers so I had actually shake it and make it leave.I don't know what type of butterfly it is, and too tired to try to identify.

I am telling you now that I don't even like to go outside in it.  I picked okra yesterday and had to pick it again this evening.  I cut it up, and fried one batch for supper, and threw meal and flour in the other and made sure it was coated real good, and froze another bag of it.  That will be so good come winter time.  I will fix soup beans, cornbread and fried okra....there is no finer meal to be had.I have been sitting outside a little bit after the sun goes down, sometimes just by myself, sometimes when I am talking to Neal.  Even though the heat is pressing in even then, there is that certain feel to the air till you know fall is approaching.  There is all the singing of the insects...I am not sure what kind of insects they are, but we hear them every summer when fall is approaching. I have also noticed leaves are beginning to drop from certain trees...my crab apple for one.And I have even seen a few leaves that have dropped that are gold.  And on our way north,  and on our way home I noticed a two trees tipped with red!  I cannot remember how far north we were though.Even though our fall promises to be a busy one, I am so looking forward to it.  Days that are crisp to begin with but warm up as the sun rises higher in the sky...with big puffy clouds on some of the days at least.  You know the type...the ones that make you feel like you could just go on forever.  At least that is they make me feel...but instead I wish I could just freeze some of the those moments in time.

The old one gave out just a few years before this photo  was taken. The old one was taken to be worked on and the dealer lent us  this one to use while they worked on the old one...Well, it was going to cost so much to fix the old one, they decided to  buy this one instead.  But first they had to take it back to the shop  and put on these small tires.  It would not have gone through the  orchard in the fallThe Red Beauty is mine...was mine...I have logged many hours and apples and miles on that picker.  It has quit on me in more trees than I care to name...I always say I should have had the trees named by the time I left there.  I have climbed down the tree more times than I care to count.There was pruning in the winter, then in the spring sometimes I did thinning by hand.   There is a king blossom with other blooms all around it.  The king blossom makes an apple first.  After those apples from the king blossom are so big, the orchard is sprayed with something to make the other apples fall off.  But they don't all fall...and if an apple tree is left with too many apples clustered together, they don't get as big as they would if only an apple or two are left together.  So, I ended up going through and pruning by hand.Also, in the summer is a disease called fireblight...I would make runs through the whole orchard about twice a week cutting out all the fireblight I could find.  And before you know it, it is time to start picking apples.  The earliest variety we had was the Earliblaze...which is pictured below. Anyway, I didn't do much today....but in the heat I cannot help but think what I  might have been doing were I still working.  The above pictures were  taken August 10 in 2007....two years after I quit work.  That is Earliblaze  apples they are picking...so it is possible if I still worked there I would have been picking apples.Though I sort of miss it, I don't miss the extremes of the weather.  The heat of the summer, and the cold of the winter.  Yet I would not have missed any of it for anything...it was the ideal job for me."},
{"title": "Fabric decisions....", "date": "Wednesday, August 11, 2010", "text": "Mary wondered what kind of fabric I got while in Shipshewana, so I thought I would take pictures to show her everyone else.  The top are the Civil War Reproductions, plus the one green on the side is not a Civil War, but was from some time close to that era.  Betsy said she like them...I should spread out all I have of those and take a photo or two.  Mainly because I have trouble remember which ones I have...but also just to show anyone interested.  I am pretty sure I have enough for a full sized quilt.And the above are my new batiks....they are the ones I really have trouble cutting...I just like to go down and look at them....pet them if you want to know.  I am almost to the point where I am going to start some serious cutting with them.  Maybe.  There is always that fear that I will cut it and then later discover it would have been the perfect fabric for something special.Anyway, I may have posted the following list sometime way in the past, but I am going to post it again.Reasons to buy fabric:1.  It insulates the closet where it is kept.2.  It helps keep the economy going. It is our patriotic duty to support cotton farmers, textile mills, and quilt shops.3.  It is less expensive and more fun than psychiatric care.4.  \"Oh, it's not for me! I'm buying it for a friend!\"5.  My cat/dog needs a fresh, new pile of fabric to sleep on and roll around on at least once a week.6.  Because it's on sale.7.

And I had enough from day before yesterday fix a smaller mess...The bell peppers I cleaned and cut and froze....every year I do that and then we use it in chili, and I made what I call a bell pepper casserole.  I prefer fresh bell peppers when I make stir-fry, but if I don't have one, I will even use the frozen in it.  To at least get the flavor.***********************I have shown this before, but have to show it again.I have to tell you about this morn....I got  up and checked email, and decided to do a load of laundry and hang it out.  Puss Puss was the only cat that stayed inside last night...as I passed by the door, I notice Bubbie wanting in.  I went to the front door to see if Cougar and Mama Cat were out front, but neither was out there.I intended to put the laundry in and come right back up and feed the two cats that were in.  both cats came down....Bubbie even got up on the washer right in front of me wanting to be petted.  I set him down till I could finish.   My sewing table sits right behind my washer and he got up there and put his paws up on my back...and I turned around talking to him and he started to nip me!  He really wanted my attention...he doesn't do it hard...nothing like to bring the blood or anything.  Just his way of saying, \"Hey, Look At Me!\"Well, I did pet him, but instead of coming up, I got busy with something else.  I was down there quite a while when I heard Roger up.  I came up in a few minutes, and he had fed the two cats that were in.  But had not looked for the others...by then they were on the front porch and I let them in.Anyway, Roger proceeded to tell me that Bubbie had got him up.  And the video above is so similar to what he done to Roger.  Bubbie got up on Roger and pedal pushed...then he would stand there and just stare Roger in the face.   Then maybe he would reach under the cover and get Roger with his paw...then back to pedal-pushing with his paws.  Then give him the stare.  Or maybe get right in his face till his whiskers tickle Roger.  No reaction from Roger....so he nips Roger in the side....and Roger really covered up then.  And it was back to the pedal-pushing...then the stare till he finally persuaded Roger to get up.Anyway, this reminded me of the Simon's cat video above...The way I told this is not half as funny as it is in real life...Roger has me in tears by the time he finishes a tale."},

I could not believe it had been a jail.I was going to title this post something along the lines of 'A man's home is his castle' but decided against it.  And I thought about spreading the posts out over a couple of days but will just post the best ones here.  The above part shows the jail ....It was constructed in 1876,  to house the convicts and to house the Sheriff's office and to also serve as his home.

We were on the road heading for home  when I took the first view...we did one turn to get the next view...and another turn to get the last view...but when we were getting ready to make the second turn, we were looking across the road to the view above....We turned and drove a few yards, and you can see the back of the building in the first photo there on the left side...but on past it is the America Clubhouse.  I have no information about what it is...That looks like a soccer ball to me....On a few feet farther, looking back, the above is the view.  There was no way to get a closer view of that dome.  I thought there was, so didn't use my zoom lens...so now I regret that.Across the road from the above buildings is the powerhouse pictured above...  it is on the same side of the road as the barn in the previous post.  If you were approaching on that road alone, the powerhouse would be seen first.Across the road from the barn is the building above...looks like a dorm or a school or something.We were talking to a man at the courthouse just a few miles down the road and he said this place used to belong to the nuns, but had been sold to private owners.I have tried to find information about it, without too much success.  I have found a Convent mentioned that was in Noble county, but not finding any photos to compare.   I have also found a Catholic sanatorium mentioned.... I will keep on looking in my spare time and I bet I eventually hit on the history of it.  I have figured out that it this place is at Rome City...that is here in Indiana. We are half way planning on going back up north in the fall sometime...just to poke around.  There is just so much interesting stuff right under our nose if we just look.Coming home today, we came a route different to the one we drove  up....we came around curve and there in the distance was this barn.  I have no idea of the history....but it is impressive. Any side photographed, it is big and beautiful.....it does need repairs though...maybe someday before it is too late it will get them.I am so tired tonight...I have a lot to say but not the energy to do it.  So good night for now..."},

You can tell by the above photo that it was not a hard rain, but boy, was it overcast.Everywhere one goes here, the above is a familiar scene.  Shipshewana, a very small town, along with the surrounding area is home to a very large Amish and Mennonite community.  It is definitely has the most concentrated area of Amish that I have ever been in...but I know that Pennsylvania and Ohio have more.  I read somewhere on line that it was the 3rd most concentrated area....I assumed it meant in the total United States.  I live near a couple communities and there are not near as many Amish homes in them.After spending the first 5 or 6 hours in Shipshewana, we got down to the business of driving backroads.  I am sorry to say I got no fabulous captures, but it was fun anyway.  We were on roads that were one Amish farm after another.  This one seemed to have a real love for birds...one has to wonder are all those birdhouses really needed.  At the same time, I don't think the Amish would waste time with something that wasn't useful.The other thing I wonder is how do they get the birdhouses up that far off the ground?  If anyone knows the answer, I would appreciate the answer.************Just a note to tell you that I am having a real problem staying connected.  I play to publish this soon as I get a chance.

The photo was taken through the front windshield, though why I am telling that I do not know...it did not change the way it looked. I can't remember which road we were on, but it is in northern Indiana.  We came up to Shipshewana for a night or two.  I made it to two fabric stores today...one is Yoder's.  I have been to it once before..and while it is okay, it is not especially impressive. I did a little research before leaving and found one called Lolly's....it was too impressive.  So much to choose from I had a hard time making any choices.  But I did choose a few more fabrics from the Civil War reproduction fabrics.  Roger loves those, and truth be told, I do, too.  Actually there are very few kinds fabrics I don't like....anyway, when I get some of my current projects finished I have a lot  more I want to start.  One made with the Civil War fabrics is one of them.Tomorrow we want to go to this huge yard sale that is held ever Tues and Wed through the summer months....we may not like it at all, but we won't know until we go.  And we may get there and be pleasantly surprised. There is a big community of Amish up here...hoping we can get out on some back roads before we go home.  We have seen some really interesting looking roads...there is one I want to check out if we don't get any place else.For right now, I am going to close.

Not the greatest photo, but not horrible either.*************I am not sure how much blogging I will get done in the next few days...I have photos scheduled for Time Stand Still, but have not got anything scheduled ahead for her.  I am hoping I at least get time to post but not positive that I will.This is Lorelei last year in September....Lorelei loved to smile and laugh even then.  I swear she was born just looking for a reason to laugh and wanting to make us laugh.This was taken just a week or so ago...if you look closely at her eyes, hey look teary eyed.  That is because they were.  Her mom had been playing 'bee's knees' with her and she was laughing till tears were in her eyes.  In case you are wondering, 'bee's knees' is just something Sarah says while gently getting Lorelei...sort of the same thing as 'bottom feeders', while pretending she is going to pinch her bottom...or 'neck nibblers' while tickling her neck. You name it and she will love it.   Sarah also does a Lorelei sandwich...which is Lorelei in the middle of a hug....normally it was Lorelei and a stuffed toy, but we tried it with the three of us the other day and that was fun.   Then Grandpa joined in and she squealed with delight.  I would have loved for Jeremy to be there...I cannot imagine what she would have done had he been there.She pretends to talk on the phone and she always talks to her Da-da!  And she wanted to see the baby on the computer (her), so I was showing her.  She is the wall paper on both our computers...then I went to my blog and pulled up the Lorelei posts, and there was one with her dad in it, and she just Da-da....with this hint of longing in her voice.  She surely loves her dad! *****************I have got to tell this little story Sarah told me today.  Sarah has a childhood friend who is still one of her best friends.  This friend has a little boy named Noah.  They had lunch together the other day...along with Noah's grandma and great aunt.  Noah and Lorelei are the best of friends...he is almost a year older than her and is just so good to her.  For some reason they seem to click.  Even at this age.At lunch, Noah was sitting between Sarah and his mom with Lorelei in the high chair.  Lorelei wanted to be beside Noah...so they got her out of the high chair and sat her beside Noah.  Well, I don't know how many times he kissed her...and I don't know what all else they did.  But this is not the point of this story.Noah is going to be getting a little baby brother towards the end of the year...a name has not been chosen.   Noah's mom told Sarah she had ask Noah what they should name the new baby brother he was going to get.  She asked should they name him Jackson....Noah said no.  She asked should they name him Abraham...Noah said no.  She asked him, \"Well, what should we name him?\"  Noah answered, \"Lorelei.\""},

I hurried inside to get my camera, and snapped the above picture before she flew.Late in the evening, I sat out there an hour or so trying to get a better photo...but both were a tad bit shy.  This one above is a cropped version of one I took.  They were just singing and singing...sometimes I really wish I had their attitude.I left my chair sitting out there, hoping they would get used to it.  And every time I am out and they are out there, I talk to them.  I know they are the House Wren, and not the Carolina--at least I have  never heard them sing like the Carolina Wren.  I am so used to Carolina Wrens...all I have ever dealt with were very, very friendly.There was a pair at home that always built somewhere on one of the porches...we would be sitting on the swing, and they would perch on the chain to the swing right above our head.  And my dad,  sat out there with his feet up and they would land on his foot.*************I have not seen Mama Squirrel in soooo long...I would say it has been at least two months.  I keep looking and hoping she will show up.  But we have been working outside a lot and have not seen hide nor hair of her.  Lots of times when I have not seen her for a long time, she will end up just showing up when we are outside for any length of time talking.  So this really makes me think she is gone for sure this time."},

We have passed so close to it all these years, but had never taken that particular road...it is a real little beauty.  And that date of 1837 caught both our eyes.Truth be told, it is not far from Saint Marys-of-the-Woods College...but other than that, I don't know if there are two dozen houses there.Just look at the windows...I would love to be there some night when the windows are lit from within.This is the best I could do with in just passing by...Roger did stop but I didn't get out.  To have gotten any farther away, I would have been in some one's yard....****************Tomorrow I am going to be at Sarah's watching the toot while her mom goes to Indianapolis for the home inspection of the house they are planning to buy.  I just hope I can get a good night's they sleep tonight.  It is highly unlikely unless some of the cats go outside before I head to bed.  Just a few minutes ago, the boys came in.  Mama Cat and Puss Puss came in earlier...so probably about the time I go to bed, one will start something.You just about have to wonder about my sanity...why put up with them.  They are worth it all, though.  All except Mama Cat provides us with comic relief at some time or other every day.  And she sort of provides us with wonder in that she has come so far since coming here to live.Mama Cat was born at a federal prison. After hearing about her, my oldest daughter wanted her.  She was just a doll baby....I had not seen her and was still recovering from losing my first Cougar or she would have ended up here.  Anyway, Mama was just the perfect little kitty...but the guy my daughter was married to did not like cats, and his boys were not good with animals.  By the time she lived there just a short while, no one could pet her except my daughter.  She had forgotten Roger by then, and neither he nor I could pet her without her hissing and trying to bite.It has been almost 3 years ago now that she came, and you would never ever guess her background.  Lorelei can step all over her and half the time she doesn't move.  And so far I have never seen Mama get mad at Lo...if she doesn't want to be wallered around by Lo she just gets up and leaves.Sometimes Roger or I can hardly walk for her rubbing against our ankles and running in between out feet as we walk....she occasionally comes and gets in bed with us.  But usually she just likes to be near us...though every now and then she will come get on our chair arm for petting.As for Mama Cat's mama, Roger and the guys he worked with all pitched in and got her spayed...so in the end it is a fairly happy ending.  The other three cats I have are from Mama Cat's one and only litter...another one went to a friend of Roger's and I am not sure what happened with it.  And the other one went to one of their co-workers and I think it rules the roost at that house."},

I put on the brakes, took a couple minutes and shot these images.I really would like to know the history of this place...it has been empty a long time, by the looks of it.

She just screams with laughter and she still laughs so hard she has tears in her eyes at times.  It is the simple things she thinks funny...like making faces at her....or if I jump like shes frightened me....Later after we had eaten lunch...Lorelei was out of her high chair running around while we sat and talked.  Well, she had on a little outfit and the bottoms kept falling down.  She stopped all of a sudden and pulled them all the way down and stepped out of them...then she sat down and tried to pull of her top.  Sarah had to help her with that, and then she ran through with such joy. *******************I have been very on and off with my blogging the past week or two.  Well, after being away from bogging for two or three or four days, I came back to find I had missed this post by Betsy....it was almost like a visit home.  In fact it made me pretty homesick...I visit several blogs and even if I am away for two or three days, the ones I comment on regular, I always go back and see what I have missed, though I might not always comment on those missed.  So, I leave Betsy's blog and go over to Carletta's Round the Bend blog...and that first glance lead me to this post that I had missed.  Carletta talked about the cow bell in the photo, and that made me even more homesick...and led me to thinking about home.We at one time had a milk cow, a jersey named Patsy.   She always had a cowbell on....though why I am not sure.  Patsy was almost always at the gate waiting when it was time for milking.  And if she wasn't there, we just had to call for her to come..Anyway, she always wore the cowbell...but every now and then it lost the clapper--you know the thing that clangs against the bell to make the noise. So, whenever we noticed it was missing, the bell would be taken off her and brought to the house to fix.  I don't remember if she bawled when we left with it, but I do know that when it was fixed, all we had to do was take it to the pasture and ring the bell and she came flying...at least for a cow she was moving fast.This is also the cow that was best friends with our horse, Old Bob...she bawled if we took him out of the pasture, and again if we brought him back, she would come to him.  I think they were almost always in the close vicinity of each other, and you would see her 'washing' him...I never seen any other cow do that...so I always took it as a sign of her affection for him.  Some might think that is childhood fantasy, but I still think it to this day."},

Notice the streaks...those were really there.  Nothing to do with my camera or altering the photo in anyway except a reduction in size.Then looking to the west, this is the scene as the sun slipped behind that could....I really hope you will enlarge this one, if not any of the others.  It was just glorious.***************We went down to see the Toot today...she is so funny.  Roger will stretch out in the floor or on the couch and pretend to be asleep--sometimes not pretending...and Lorelei's eyes just light up.  She heads right to him and will climb all over him or beat on him...along with laying down beside him and pretending to be asleep.  She will do that for a few minutes, then get up and go on about her business of playing.In a little while, if he is actually asleep, she will go over close to him and either lean on him, or on  the couch, or whatever and stare at his face.  Next, she will start beating on him, or go get something to beat on him with.  Sarah and I sit and laugh till we cry...*******************You will never guess what I fixed tonight, considering the temperature was in the 90's, but felt near  100º....I came home and fixed vegetable soup.  And it was GOOD!  Even Roger liked it, and he doesn't usually care much for soup in the heat of summer.I made a run through the strip pits...or maybe I should call it a crawl...because that is what I did.    Everywhere I went, there were herds and herds of these little white butterflies.  I think they are called cabbage whites.  I don't know what groups of butterflies are called, so I called it a herd.At this one puddle/pond I saw this muskrat above...along with the 'ducks' below...I'm not sure what they are called.This body of water is maybe 20 ft. in length and probably 10-12 ft. wide at the most, and there is almost always something there.  I saw frogs, but didn't try to take any photos...and sometimes I see turtles.  I doubt the water is over two ft. in depth anywhere...and it is right beside the road.  It is amazing the amount of life it supports."},

Shelby was such a tease...she would aggravate Keesha to death.  Shelby was the bigger of the two, and with that she was extra long legged, and taller than Keesha.  Shelby would get a stick, get right in front of Keesha and the minute Keesha would reach for it, she would whirl away....Keesha would end up so mad.Now, Keesha, when we were potty training her, had this thing of when we would take her out to do her business, she would not want to come in when she was done.  Or probably more to the point, she considered it a prime time to play...we would start to pick her and she would run...run behind a tree, to the other side of the car, to the other side of a flowerbed...just anything to go between  us.  It was just like a cartoon....you go one way and she would keep herself just opposite of you.  Then, it would be us that ended up mad and aggravated...just imagine going through that when trying to leave for school, or work...or just wanting to go to bed.One time when both she and Sarah were young, she led Sarah all around the neighbors house...we still laugh about that.  The neighbors were sitting outside, and here Sarah and Keesha go by on the side walk, then in just a second here they come around their house....thank goodness for good neighbors.We got Keesha from a humane shelter...she was so small she could easily sleep on a pillow.  Sarah started teaching her to jump from the couch into her lap.  As she got older, Sarah would sit out in the yard about 6 or 8 feet from the edge of the porch, usually she would get an old pillow and put it in her lap...and she would call Keesha and she would make a big leap into her lap.She and Shelby were pups together...only where Shelby could not have chosen which of us she loved best...Keesha was a one woman dog.  Oh, she liked the rest of us, but she really only had eyes for Sarah.  Consequently, it was hard for Sarah to make the same decision we had to make for Shelby just a few weeks ago---she had to have her put down.****************Do any of you know that this is an okra blossom?

I thought seeing this might make you smile:-)************We had Lorelei Thursday because Sarah had an appointment, then we had her Friday while Sarah and Jeremy looked at houses in Indianapolis...15 houses if you want to know.  That makes me tired just thinking about it.We had Lorelei from sometime around 11:00--give or take a few minutes--till around 7:00 and that little girl did not stop the entire time.  She might set a few minutes playing with something, but she would be doing something.  Then she would think of Bubbie and run to the bed to see him.  It is so cute to see her think of him and run flying in there. I would put her on the bed and she would pet him a time or two then sit there and play with things we had sitting there.  And she always has to turn the bedside lamp off and on before we leave.....we just don't leave the room without her doing that. I have a couple different step stools in my kitchen...one step stool just that--a step stool.  And Lorelei loves to stand on it beside me and look on the counter to see what she can see.  The other step stool is one of these....you can sit on it or raise the seat and use it as a step stool.  And when Lorelei is here, I take the seat part off.  She usually likes to sit in front of the door and watch her papaw do things outside.  Just completely content to do that if he is out there doing something.But Friday, she scooted it over to the fridge, climbed up and stood on the top step to reach magnets on the fridge!  And she did not want to sit down like a big girl; I had to physically get her down and move the stool.Her little mind is done trying to figure things out...when she is able to use tools, it will be watch out world.  I have a feeling she will want to take things apart to figure how they work...she will stand for minutes at a time trying to figure the relation between the doorknob and the latch part.  We have a little cheap plastic wagon  for her and she turns it upside down to check how the wheels work...***********We are starting to have regular tomatoes, but some are also practically cooking on the vine with the heat we have had.  I would love to know if a shade cloth would help that....I sliced two today and even Roger could tell that the one did not taste quite right.  It was inedible for both of us.***********I am not sure how much blogging I will be doing for the next little bit...I hope to get back on some sort of schedule, but not sure when it will be.  We are going with Sarah and Jeremy tomorrow to look at a couple more houses, and I think Sarah wants us to see one that she liked the other day.Maybe I will get caught up with everyone in the next day or two...."},
{"title": "The garden report....", "date": "Wednesday, July 14, 2010", "text": "I was hanging out a couple loads of clothes this morn and thought of doing a gardening post.For those of you not familiar with it, that is okra above.  I planted a few hills this year, but have not managed to capture a bloom yet.  I will probably have to mix what I do get with green tomatoes to have enough to fry.  That is okay....it is good that way, too.  I can remember we were kids, mom would just throw everything together and fry it...green tomatoes, okra, hot pepper, and maybe even cucumber.  She would just cut/chop it in small chunks, mix with mainly meal with a little flour mixed it, and fry till browned.  Talk about yummy!  That was just so good with soup beans, or anything else for that matter.Remember last year we had an abundance of bell peppers...well, for some reason they are scarcer this year...I am not sure what the problem is.  But we have plenty frozen from last year, so it is no big deal.  We use them in chili, spaghetti sauce sometimes, and I make a bell pepper casserole that my kids just love.And look here....we have regular tomatoes getting ripe...And just look at the photo below....I had enough of these little cherry tomatoes to get my fill...and so did Roger.  Plus we saved a few for my next door little neighbor's little girl.  She absolutely loves fresh garden stuff...she will pick a bell pepper off the plant and eat it as if it is an apple."},

Believe that or not, it is the truth.Her favorite thing was the sheep and they were the most responsive to us.  She just wondered all around the barn they were in.I would never have picked the sheep to be the one she really liked...every time we have ever been to a fair, the goats have been extremely friendly.  So friendly, I have wished I could bring one home.  But not yesterday.  Not a single one wanted to be petted...some of the girls got out this young one for her to see, but it was not enthusiastic and Lorelei didn't quite know what to think.The cattle were tied with their heads to the inside of the stalls so there was no petting them, except this one that was at the end and she was asleep.  In the chicken barn it was so noisy with the roosters crowing, that part of the time I think she actually got afraid, still she was interested in them."},

It just blew their wings ever which way...and let me tell you there was a lot of them out there.************The toot had her mom and I in tears...she is just so funny.  It is impossible to describe some of her antics...but will tell you she had her doll and was waving its arm and saying bye-bye to her papaw and me.  And she had her dancing feet with her a big part of the time...they were climbing feet as well.  When she gets a bit older, she will be climbing everything in sight.I had a regular little step stool in the kitchen, and she climbed up on it first thing, and was looking for something to get into...and helping me cook!  Then she wanted a banana...she would take a bite of it and go off and play a minute, then come back to me and tell me 'nana.'But the funniest thing of all was late when Sarah was about to get ready to leave, I was playing with her...she went to the kitchen door and sort of pounded on it with her hand...and told me \"Gotta go!

{"title": "Fishing for camels....", "date": "Friday, July 9, 2010", "text": "I have planned to do a post about fishing for camels for well over a year now...I wanted to take pictures to go along with it but have not seen any camel holes to even attempt it.  So, I thought I would show you one of the scenes where fishing for camels took place....hours and hours of it over the years...this is the elementary school I attended for 8 years.When we were in grade school, we always seemed to all do things in spurts...we might play basketball every day for a month, or softball, or playing hide and seek, and other things.  And then there was fishing for camels...A camel in this case is a grub much like some of those pictured here...if you are at all squeamish, you might not like to look at these.  I always thought the ones we caught were skinnier and had more of an actual hump...but maybe I am remembering wrong.  I do know they had that brown head.Anyway, I don't know who would start it, but fishing for camels would come to be the thing to do at recess.  Someone would ask what somebody else was going to do and the answer would be Fish for Camels...and suddenly we would all be fishing for camels.  We always hunted for a stem of grass....the part that holds the seed...minus the seed was a favorite.  And I think we preferred them dry.Of course it being a school yard and trampled daily by kids playing, there were lots of bare spots of ground.  We looked for holes about a quarter inch in diameter.  Getting down on our hands and knees, poking the straw down in the hole 6 or 8 inches till it stops and then wait.  In short order it would start to move slightly...you grab that straw and jerk and you feel this very slight resistance...and out plops a camel.  A grub in other words.I guess the straw invaded its home and it is holding on to it trying to push it out...that is when we would see the stem/straw move and that is when we would grab it and jerk it out of the hole, bringing the camel/grub with it.I know I often caught more than one but don't really recall how many.  And we didn't do anything with them...though I think they were good fishing bait.  I think we just left them laying when the bell rang to call us in from recess.But I can see us all now, plain as day.  Kids hunkered down all over the school yard a couple kids here, three more there, another over there...hands at the ready to grab that straw and catch a camel.  Sometimes, I think kids just do not know what real fun is any more. When I started to do this post, I wondered if any other soul had heard of this or if it was just something done in our area...so I googled the exact term 'fishing for camels' and found this little story.  He mentions doing it in the spring, but I don't recall it only being in the spring...but I could be wrong."},

We were not headed home when we passed this one in southern Indiana, so we did not stop.  We didn't return the same route, so had no chance to stop on the way back home.  (This is a drive by shot, and it is poor quality--but I was grasping at straws to have a photo to post.) There is a 'Y' in the road we pass on our way to our local Walmart that people often stop at and sell stuff direct from their truck.  We get some really good corn and cantaloupes from various people at the 'y' as we call it.  I think whoever gets there first claims the space.************We went to Indianapolis with Sarah and the toot yesterday to look at houses. Sarah did see a couple that she liked....Lorelei had a really good time till the last little bit.   She almost fell asleep the first few minutes in the car after the last house, then she woke up.  She cried a little bit, then she was just happy....talked and jabbered.  Then started her 'yelling', where she goes ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh for as long as she can.  Loud.  Over and over.Sarah kept telling me she was about to fall asleep, and that is what she did....she was doing that and just stopped.....Roger said it was like turning off a light switch.  She woke up right before home, and was just so happy to be in her own environment...***************Now, to the questions.  It is about how you handle comments and followers.  I always try to visit whoever leaves a comment...I know I miss a few every now and then when I have joined a meme, but I even try to do return visits for them.I have blocked a follower or two just because I felt like their sights were just spam sights...I guess that is what you would call them.  Just trying to sell stuff with nothing else. My question is, do you block some followers just cause you don't want to be associated with their type of blog?  And do you block comments from places like that, even though the comment doesn't contain any links other than the name.  I have wanted to ask these questions for a long time.  I got a comment on my other blog....just a generic comment.  I checked the commenter out...there were 3 blogs I think, and one of them the first thing I read was a poem with inappropriate language in it...so I am going to delete that comment in a few minutes...the other blogs seemed more about selling things...so can't imagine him coming back to my blog."},

I ask Sarah if she 'read' them or just tossed them over her shoulder...she actually will sit and look at the books and tell her own little story as she turns the pages.  We just cannot tell what she says.  She sure gets intent when she reads though.But today Sarah said she would read part of them then toss them over her shoulder.  Others, she just pulled out and tossed.The other day Sarah was either putting Lorelei's outside toys in the garage, or was getting them out.  She went in and turned around to come back out and there was Otto standing looking towards her and Lorelei was standing at his back end beating on him like he was a drum, both just happy as a lark."},

An 8 oz thing of creme cheese softened, a big bowl of cool whip, a big spoonful of sour cream, a tablespoon or so of real lemon flavoring, and some splenda...whip together and have a graham crust ready.

{"title": "A million steps....", "date": "Wednesday, June 30, 2010", "text": "Any time I see a railroad, I have a yearning to walk it....and the view above, well almost the view above....I have looked at hundreds of times as I walked home from school.  As have all my brothers and sisters.  The biggest part of our walk home from school was on these tracks.  Our grade school was a block or two from these tracks, and when we went to high school, we still had to walk down to Arthur to catch the bus.Now, for me, I never had near the distance my brothers and sisters walked...I don't think I had a mile walk...maybe 3/4's of a mile, but I bet the walk for my brothers and sisters, was at least two miles before we moved from the old home place to the new house.  They had a path through weeds...so I just know their feet had to start the day out wet.  And if it rained too much, they could not get across the creek....This is the new and updated railroad...when we walked it, it was not rock, but cinders, etc that filled in between the ties.  I suppose there is a name for that, but I don't know what it is, unless it would be called the bed of the tracks.  My socks always had coal dust in the wrinkles...it was a coal train that went up and down this track.  It went up it once, and back down.  No more, no less.  Maybe every now and then there was something extra....and in the summer, they had a steam engine that gave people rides up to Cumberland Gap,  maybe on to Middlesboro, KY, and back to Knoxville.  Just one trip a summer.  None of us ever got to take it...I don't even know if anyone else wanted to.One of the things we sometimes did was try to walk the rail home without falling off.  I don't know about everyone else, but I know I never quite accomplished that feat.  I made it once or twice with only falling off once or twice...but I know that was the best I ever did.  It is amazing that some of us did not get hurt...The other thing, the railroad sat above the surrounding land for the most part...and the banks grew thick with bushes, briars, and honeysuckle to name a few.  So thick one could not pass through them.  So, you had to beware and listen for the train, and head to the nearest path down.  Sometimes we had to hurry, and just wait, but if we were lucky, it was at a place that the path went down to a field and we could continue walking.Only one time was there ever a close call for me.  It was cold and windy...I had my hood up and my head down...not even looking up.  I was by myself, and the train tooted.  I swear, I don't think it was much over the length of a city block away.  I don't mind telling you my heart jumped into my throat....if it had not tooted, I would never have heard it.  Luckily, I was right at the train trestle and could get off by it.We also walked down the railroad to go to the store and to the post office in summer, and we walked the railroad on up past our home to go to the barn (not far away), or if we wanted to go up to the old place, or to the tobacco patches.  You'd see us walking down the road, with a hoe over our shoulder.When we go home, I know Neal and I always walk the railroad...either to get up to the old place or down to Arthur. Anyway, I bet our family has easily taken a million steps on those tracks that ran by home.Sometimes when I am drifting off to sleep, I will hear a train blow its horn here...and just for a moment I am back in bed at home.  It has to be the right tone, and sometimes I think it has to be a certain type of weather for it to be the right tone to make me think I am home again.  But just FYI, I have never lived where I could not hear a train, and most of the time within sight of the tracks.Us and the one family of neighbors, it is a common last name, but I won't say it...anyway, besides us, they are the only ones I ever remember really using the railroads a lot.  Now, I suppose you would be fined if they caught you walking on them up here.  And that because if someone got hurt, they would probably sue the railroad.  I often see No Trespassing signs, but that is usually by overpasses.  I have not noticed them at home, but maybe it is cause I haven't been paying attention."},

They are passed when coming in the back way to Mansfield, Indiana.  When coming, you come around the bend and the view above is what you see.  Even though I know they are not real, my heart still flutters about half the time thinking just for a second that they are alive.Then you go on around the curve, and here is what you see.  These were just quick snaps cause there is no place to pull off the road and it is curvy right there...so I took what I could get!*****************I feel like I have been busy all day yet look back and don't feel like I accomplished much at all.  I did laundry...I swear there is someone that comes and wears our clothes for us.  I am always amazed at the amount of laundry I do.  Yet, when I really think about it, I think I only did one load all last week.  So, maybe I am not doing as bad as I think I do.  The two loads did today did not leave enough to do another load of everything left combined.I also replaced a pocket in a pair of shorts.  Let me tell you, I am glad no one sees the pocket...it is definitely not your finest looking pocket, but the best I could do with the pair of shorts.  They were a pair of Roger's old work shorts with an elastic in the waist and I was not about to undo all that sewing when elastic was involved.  I did do some ripping, and then cut the pocket off at the top and replaced it.And while I was down there I cut the sashing for my baby quilt which I have not touched since I posted a pic of the finished blocks sometime last week.  Later I went back and almost got the whole thing sewn together.  Just a few more long lines of sewing and the top will be almost totally done.That has about been the sum of my day--tomorrow I am going to Sarah's for a while."},
{"title": "Butterfly blues", "date": "Monday, June 28, 2010", "text": "Yesterday, before Lorelei and Sarah came over, we took a little drive. We wanted to check out Big Raccoon Creek...it was up much to much to fish.  So, we headed home--through the country of course.  Along this one stretch of road, there were all these butterflies.I don't know why, but they were not flighty at all...maybe these were blooms at just the right stage.  Whatever the reason, they tried to stay put.But it was so windy, they had a hard time.  Which resulted in many missed shots for me.  About the time I was read to squeeze off a shot off, the wind would blow the bloom/butterflies sometimes completely out of the picture.  Sometimes, just enough till they were nothing but a blur.  And part of the time, the wind was whipping their wings...they were doing like a flag rippling in the wind.I did get two or three fairly good photos of them that I will be showing later on my other blog, but for right now I thought I would show these for now."},

It is not the greatest shot, but I always like these barns.  There is a nice little article about them here....and at the bottom of that page is this link to lots of great photos of Mail Pouch barns.Then there is the photo below, taken the same day as the above.  Again we are moving.And this one is not even the quality of the above but it is the one that calls to my heart.  It makes me feel like I could be looking at an East Tennessee farm...it just has that feel for me.  All the time we were down in the southern part of the state, I kept thinking we might eventually spot a patch of tobacco.  But that was not the case....It really doesn't take much to make me think of Tennessee...I guess it will always hold first place in my heart.  We were talking today about when we lived down there, we lived in this little house, which would be a shack to most people, but home to us.  The side of the hill had actually been dug away, cut out...whatever you want to call it to make room for part of the kitchen.  As I think about it now, I bet that part was added later after the original house was built.  But it was there as long back as I can remember. The back door opened off it, and even though we had no air conditioning, in the hottest of summertime days we opened one window in our bedroom, and opened the back door and the house cooled right out...allowing us to sleep just fine.  I guess to be fair, I will tell you the sun did not fully hit the place till later in the morn, and our house was in the shade fairly early.  So the surrounding area did not have the time to build and hold the heat.Even though the house burned down sometime back, that place will always hold a special place in our heart.  I honestly think it is my favorite place on earth."},

I did not notice the crosses in the roof till I looked I looked at these photos.********************Our GPS came the other day...today was the first opportunity we have had to try it out.    I wanted to head north, but checked the weather up that way.  There was a big storm on the way to the area I wanted to go....so quickly chose a destination to the south.  We didn't follow The Voice's directions exactly....we wanted to go a more indirect route.We had fun imagining what The Voice was thinking...we could almost hear the disgust in The Voice each time we Did Not make the turn she suggested...she would say 'recalculating'...Roger asked if I thought she realized it was a man driving and if she realized he was hardheaded.I told him I was going to do a post and title it: A GPS, we are still taking the scenic route!  We have sure taken some in our travels, but I don't think any have been quite as bad as a friend.  I don't remember the car they were driving at the time, but one time they ended up on a road and the only other vehicles were jeeps and 4-wheel drive trucks!Then there is the song One Headlight by the Wallflowers...we neither one can hear it without thinking of the time that we only had this old, old station wagon.  I think we only had our older daughter, but I am not sure.  We were on our way home from Terre Haute, and we would hit a pothole and the lights would go out...hit another one and they were back on!I was scared of course, though there must have been moonlight because I can still remember we could see the road...but I got tickled.  And started laughing...and Roger was shall we say frustrated...and he asked me if I could hush which made it that much more funny.  I did tell him it was either laugh or cry....and that was the truth.    We made it home safely, and without being seen by the police.  So any time you hear the song, or even hear the term headlight, think of  us.Another time, for a second vehicle Roger got this old, old truck.  Guess what...coming up Highway 63  one night, the lights started the same thing...drive a few hundred feet and they would turn off.  Wait a little bit and they would blink back on....that time he cut over to the river road and drove home.  Much darker that night...no street lights or not many houses to light the way.And on the subject of cars, I think our Rav4 might be the only car we have had that didn't have a flat tire within about a month of getting it...even when they were brand new cars.  And almost all have had a rock fly up and chip the front windshield."},

I wanted to show the blocks I am working on for a baby quilt...I have enough blocks made.  And I actually picked out the fabric I want to use for the sashing but I haven't gotten it cut yet.I am not sure how much like a baby quilt it will look, but it will still be fairly bright and cheerful and big enough to lay in the floor for a baby to lay on when it is first starting to roll around.  And Lorelei liked laying on hers just to look around.BTW, the bits of paper you see folded over on each block tells me where in the quilt that block belongs.    I don't want two lions side by side, nor two monkeys, etc.  Though it really wouldn't matter a lot because they are different views of the animals.The fabric above is my latest acquisition...I bought it to make pajamas.  I love just plain old cotton pj's, but could probably buy them cheaper than I make them...even with the good deals I get on fabric at Thousands of Bolts.  I make them, though, for the sheer pleasure of sewing and finishing a project in one evening.   Also, with these, I will have the scraps left over and can use them in quilts!Then there is the other two pieces of fabric below...I bought them at the same time as I bought the above.  The first piece, I loved, and if I had known it was as nice as it is, I would have bought more.  But it is a brand of fabric that I have had some issues with...it being so thin I could see through.  I did not want to buy much of it since I could not examine it. The second piece is a reproduction piece will work well with all my Civil War fabrics I am collecting.  Roger loves them, so I will be making another quilt for us sometime in the future."},

Not last night.  I finally put in a PBS Inspector Morse Mystery and that did the trick...I watched about 30 or 40 minutes and was having a hard time holding my eyes open...so turned it off....realized it was the beginning of daylight, but I went on to bed anyway.So my day has had a late start...I hung a load of clothes out about an hour ago, but it is so hot they will be dry in no time.  The only reason they won't be dry in an hour or so is the humidity.  It is horribly humid today.  Our thermometer says it is 88º...feels hotter than that.While waiting on the load of clothes, I sewed on some quilt blocks....I know I haven't quilted my Chantelle Tulips yet, but I felt the need to start a baby quilt so the next time someone close has a baby, I will have one prepared.  I am trying to make it start to finish from fabrics I have on hand...so far that part is going well.  It is just something simple...also not going to make it quite as big as I used to make all baby quilts.So, it is back to the sewing machine for me...I think.  I am so tempted to take a nap, but would feel guilty if I did.  Roger is working in his shop....not sure what the cats are doing.  I haven't heard from Sarah, but will contact her later...we have plans to see her and Jeremy tomorrow.Wish me luck in the sewing department...."},
{"title": "One of the things I wonder about...", "date": "Sunday, June 20, 2010", "text": "I always wonder why a house has two doors right beside each other...I have never tried to google that to see if there is a reason.  Was it a house built for two families?  I don't think so...almost all I see with the two doors side by side are small houses.  Most of the times they are just big enough for a small family.***********Lorelei has been here quite a bit this week.  She is growing and changing so fast.  She has bumped her head a time or two on our table...and it does hurt.  There is no doubt about it.  But after one of the first times of doing it, a little bit later she dropped something and bent over to pick it up.  After she picked it up, she laid her head against the corner of the table, and started to pretend to cry.  It was so funny!That first time was a week or two ago...well, yesterday she started to doing it again.  She did it two or three times.  I am not sure if she does it to get sympathy or laughter...because it always gets a laugh from us. I have a really small vacuum...more or less a dust-buster...it is a small upright, but you can take off  the vacuum just like  Dustbuster.  That tells you how small it is...Lorelei has discovered it and loves to get it out and push it all around the house. And sometimes here with her papaw or at home with her dad, she will go to yell for one of them and out comes 'Dad-Paw!'  She definitely loves her dad and papaw....she loves for Roger to chase her through the house.   There is just something about her papaw that she wants all his attention.She has learned to jump now, and has been shaking her head no and nodding it up and down, though the up and down is not quite as easy as shaking her head no.  Her dad was showing her how to turn a flip and she is trying...it is so cute to watch. When her dad is home for her bedtime, he has to go give her the ET touch two or three times before she will settle down and go to sleep..."},

I probably wouldn't have got this photograph if it hadn't.  And it was not a place to stop and back up.  I snapped this one and one other...but I so would like to go back and look at it again.  Click and enlarge it to see it better. I would love to know just how old it is and the history...I even wondered had it been a school.  I tend to think it was a church because of the windows but whatever it was, I bet it would have tons of stories to tell if the walls could talk.  Look at that tin roof...can you imagine a preacher trying to deliver his sermon with a hard rain or hail falling?  If you have never been in a building with a tin roof, you don't know what you have missed.I did not see a sign of any kind around it...weeds were growing up all around it.  It just seemed to be in a sad state, but there is that dumpster beside it so maybe someone is trying to do something with it.  I sure hope they are.Now, take a good look at this church and go take a look at this picture posted by Don at Slackwater.  It was taken by a friend of his...all I am going to say is that my mouth fell open when I saw it!  I just cannot comprehend how it was built at the time it was built...I can't even comprehend starting the project this day and age.  Later, after seeing it, I thought to google 'The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,' then clicked images to see more detailed photos of the architecture.  I was even more impressed after doing that."},

One I don't often see around here are the tiny little silver ones....not sure what they are called, but I don't think they are an inch long even.  Oh, I see one once in a blue moon, but that is about it.Puss Puss is rough on butterflies....I have seen her chase one all over the yard, leaping for it.  Run up trees, and jump out after it, and finally actually catching it by doing just that.  Of my four cats, she is the most dedicated hunter.  Always catching the least bit of movement and going on the alert.The cardinals have moved on...I don't think they had babies yet.  But I am sort of relieved because I don't think the cats caught one of them...usually if they catch a bird, mouse, or mole, they bring it to show us.  They like to share that way.But the cats are just being cats, and I love them.  Each one has a distinct personality.  My four now are so totally different than the four I had a few years ago.  The ones I have now never listen to me...and I am meaning never.  Except one time last Christmas Bubbie was about to start with the Christmas tree and I yelled at him, really mad in fact, and he looked at me and actually stopped.  I think that was the one and only time any have ever listened.   They don't look when I call their name, much less come to me.The four I had before, well, one was mine, one for each of my daughters and the other....she came here and claimed us all.  One of my daughter's cats came from the humane shelter, and was older, but she still knew her name...all of them knew their name, came to their name, I don't remember the one we got from the pound ever doing  much for me to tell her no or get down...but the other three all knew what the word no mean, they all got down when I told them, and they came to their name.With our cats now, we call ourselves the cat herders part of the time;  the rest we are just doormen.I want to leave you with a couple quotes which I find to be so true....if you want to read more go here.\"Dogs  believe they are human. Cats believe they are God.\"- Unknown\"Dogs have  owners, cats have staff.\"- Unknown\"Cats are  smarter than dogs. You can't get eight cats to pull a sled through snow.  \"- Jeff Valdez"},

We noticed this cloud start forming, but we were in too big of a hurry for me to stop and get a good photo of it...so I was trying to snap shots of it as it changed.  We never did get any real bad weather, though we did have some storms after we got home.We have been planning on getting a GPS for a while now....the past two or three times we have been out we have wished we had one for one reason or another.  Last night we really needed one...we were in an area we had never been before, and even though I have an Indiana atlas, for the most part it gives county road numbers, but they have since been given names such as Arney Rd, and other names I don't remember how to spell.Anyway, I ordered a GPS last night...next I need one of those things my brother talks about that gives the GPS coordinates of each picture taken.

{"title": "Let's talk...", "date": "Wednesday, June 16, 2010", "text": "I have been MIA as far as blogging goes for a few days...not because anything is really wrong...just had other things on my mind.  We have been seeing quite a bit of the little girl seen above...such joy to be found with her. The above was taken last Friday...we were in Terre Haute on other errands but of course stopped to see her.  She was out in the back yard with her mommy and Otto.  I cannot think how old Otto is, but I think at least 3, if not 4 but he is a perpetual puppy.  A big, goofy puppy at that, that LOVES everyone and everything...I have seen him growl and mean business at one person walking by, and Sarah has seen him growl at one dog. You may think that is two too many, but if you knew how busy his neighborhood is, you would have to wonder what the two were up to.  There are so many people that walk by, lots of them walking their dogs.  And oh, does he bark....but it is to announce, 'Hey, I am here--come see me!  I want to play!'  And I think most people know that and recognize the bark for what it is.When Roger and I got there Friday, he was thrilled to death to see us...as was Lorelei.  But he was a bit more insistent on attention.  Well, we had given him his snacks, and had petted him and he had walked a few steps away from us...I suppose lost in his own world.  Lorelei walked up from behind and started petting him, and he started to squirm and get all rambunctious thinking it was us, but soon as he turned his head and seen it was her, he just melted...just settled down and stood so still and let her beat on his back.  She can pet him, she can beat him, she can do anything to him and he just does not care.Now to Lorelei, she has become a Papaw's girl...she just wants all of his attention.  It is just so cute and funny to watch her watch him.  If he isn't looking, she'll shout 'PAPAW!' and smile from ear to ear.  We kept her Saturday, while Sarah got ready for open house, which the realtor was holding Sunday.  She had taken the dogs and cat to the kennel just to not have to worry with them.  Sunday they came up here while the open house was going on...While Lorelei was with us Saturday, she mentioned Oddie Doddie two or three times, so I feel it was only natural for us to want to be there when Sarah went and got the animals.  We got there Monday morn just about the time Sarah was ready to go get them.  We played with the toot, and she kept herself busy...after a bit Sarah returns.  She is in and out of the house a time or two and Lorelei doesn't realize it...she is over playing with something...just totally engrossed in whatever it was.Then she heard Otto's toenails on the floor, she threw down her toy, and went running to the gate, all the while yelling 'Oddie Doddie' and giggling and reaching her arm through the gate to get him.  She was so thrilled to see him...I let her on in with them and she just could not get enough, and had this big smile on her face.   Her face would have lit up a room.********************Nothing else exciting has been happening...we are still having a lot of rain.  Roger mowed the yard three times in nine days...and it needed it really bad each time.  It us supposed to be clear today, so since I want to hang clothes out I best get busy with that."},
{"title": "Rural Indiana", "date": "Sunday, June 13, 2010", "text": "I love the way the vines cover the old silo...some people see a place like this and wonder why someone don't care for it better.  I have been guilty of thinking that myself.  But then if I give it a second thought, I have a feeling the people probably have more work than they can handle.  And maybe not enough money to do the repairs.When I was a kid, we always had nails...or almost always had nails on hand, and in various sizes.  And could usually find lumber to do small jobs with.  I think about it now...think about the playhouse and tree house we built, and I wonder where the wood came from.   We did not go buy it...I don't remember even asking if we could use it.  And we didn't get into trouble for using it...it was just there. I know when 'we' built our house, that my dad had the lumber cut from trees on our property.  I think dad could look at a tree and figure the board feet that would come from it.  He had trouble getting someone to cut it to his specifications.  He wanted the boards to be finished one inch thick...not like they are now--3/4 inch thick.  I don't know why that sticks in my mind...I know I had to hear him talk about it later in my life, cause I was only about 4 or 5 years old when it was built. And I do remember helping sand the drywall where the nails were mudded over.  I don't remember how much I don't...it could have been very little.  I do remember also folding the drywall tape that goes in the corners to be mudded over. I often think our mom never bragged or was proud of any of us, even though we were not bad kids...but I do remember her bragging to other people that I helped to build the house."},

I think I have only been home all day one day, and not positive of that.  But if I wasn't home all day that day, I didn't leave our little town.  And I am not getting any time to go on an excursion to take photographs.    I had to go back and really search for a photo to post.  With how hot it is, I thought it might be nice to look back just a few months to see what we are missing.  This was taken January 7, 2010...I just have to see this to be glad I don't have to get out in it.  The heat is miserable, but I don't miss having to wear layers.  I don't miss my fingers freezing when I do take pictures...well, they do if I forget my little knit gloves.  I don't miss shopping in the freezing cold.  I suppose there are other things I don't miss.But at the same time, there is nothing like being home and looking out at a day like this and knowing you don't have to get out in it.  In spite of not missing it right now, I know when the time rolls around again, the prospect of snow will thrill me just like it did when I was a kid.  I don't think I will ever get to old to feel that thrill.***************Does anyone else watch the show American Pickers?  It is one of my favorite shows...any time I see a place such as the one pictured I think of that show.  I have even known a place or two I think the guys would love picking through.

I cannot wait to have fresh tomatoes.  My mouth waters just thinking about picking one and sitting outside with a salt shaker to eat it.  I am wondering what Lorelei will think of them...her mom eats catchup but doesn't like tomatoes.  And I don't think her dad likes them either, though he loves catchup.My husband loves catchup, loves tomatoes, likes things cooked with tomatoes such as spaghetti, or anything generally that requires tomato sauce or juice.  But he will not drink tomato juice.  I will actually buy the small pop can sizes of tomato juice to have one when I am desperate...but they don't hold a candle to home canned tomato juice.  If I had it here right now, I could easily drink a quart of it.Okay, here is Lorelei and her dancing feet again...not sure if you can see it or not.  It is a bit dark on my computer, but it was taken late this afternoon with her mom's cell phone and there is not much I can do about that."},
{"title": "What I should be working on....", "date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2010", "text": "These are a couple small pieces that I am working on...part of the time.  It is a process that was shown on Simply Quilts--a show about quilting that used to be on HGTV.  It was hosted by Alex Anderson, and she had various guests on...showing all kinds of projects.  This particular episode had Ricky Tims, teaching how to make this Chantelle Tulip in his caveman style of quilting.I have never really made an art quilt, and Mary and I got to talking via email and both decided to do something different compared to what we normally do.  This is what I decided for my project.  It is a two for one deal.  Two pieces of contrasting fabric are layered together--one set for the top part with the flower and two more pieces for the leaves and the background.  Then the flowers and leaves are cut free-hand with the rotary cutter.  Notice that the colors are switched opposite on the two above....when you cut one you automatically cut the second one.These are just small, and will be smaller still when I trim the sides and ends.  Just a bit over two feet 'tall' and maybe 15 inches wide.  I will probably make little wall hangings from them, though Roger would like for me to make a whole quilt.  If it weren't that the seams are so scant I would think serious about it.  But with this caveman quilting, the 1/4 inch seam allowance is not figured in.  When sewing, one only takes just enough to hold the two pieces together....in my case I probably have a 1/8 inch or less seam allowance.I would not want to make a quilt with that allowance because I don't think it would hold up to wear.  So this is all I am going to make with this method.In doing it, I think I have come to the conclusion that I like to make quilts that are to be used.  I was not happy with these at all at first...but I have come to the conclusion that I can live with them.  But I have to force myself to work on them. ***********I have spent the entire evening playing music at My Playlist...I have not done that in soooo long.  Almost all music was from the pop/rock category with about half a dozen country and a couple bluegrass thrown in.  I would have listened to more bluegrass, but the music is not divided into categories....and when I say bluegrass, I generally mean newer songs done with bluegrass instruments.  I always just browse the category to find music I like...I often wonder what makes us like the music we like...I almost always like some of all types, though to be honest I cannot listen to rap long enough to discover anything.  Although I think I heard one or two that included bits of 'real' songs that made them bearable,   I guess I am showing my age here...Music is another of those things that really bring back images, feelings, and dreams.  There is a big, big playlist that will forever be associated with the orchard.  Sometime I need to sit and make a playlist of my favorites that I listened to over and over there....it would be a long, long one and some I could never find anywhere on the web.  They were songs I taped from the college radio station.Well, I here a storm rolling in...I should just post this and head to bed.  I always sleep so much better when it is raining or storming."},
{"title": "At last, at last", "date": "Monday, June 7, 2010", "text": "If Blogger ever becomes available I will do this post...it is not really  important in the overall scheme of things.  It is frustrating  nevertheless.  I have been getting the Blogger Unavailable message  since last night.  I didn't think I could even post comments but they  will go through so I might get some visiting done today.The photo that will be included with this was taken while coming  home from a little fishing expedition.  We decided to check out  creeks...I was thinking with all the rain that they would all be to high  to wade and fish, and in thinking that I wore one of my better pair of  jeans.  Anyway, yesterday, the photo above shows the kind of sky we had..which is the kind that makes my heart sing out with joy.  But on with the rest of the day.We went by Mansfield where Big Raccoon Creek is...it was up a tiny bit, but still plenty  fishable.  But there were a couple guys already there.  So we headed on  to the Big Walnut Creek.  It was just right for fishing...I was so  aggravated at myself for not being prepared to wade.  I fished from the  bank, and caught a couple...Roger caught 3 or 4.  One of his  small-mouthed bass was keeper size.  Small-mouthed bass are so much fun  to catch because they sometimes jump out of the water when fighting to  get free.  It is so much fun...kind of makes your heart pump a little  faster...and hope that someone else is watching.Right now I have a couple loads of clothes on the line, and thinking  I should do at least one more and have it ready to go when some of these get  dry enough.  The humidity is down this morn, and there is a gentle  breeze so it shouldn't take long for some to dry.  I have to take  advantage of today because rain is in our forecast for the rest of the  week.  And I have become addicted to hanging my clothes out--laundry is  one chore I have always enjoyed.  Even when I was still a teen I enjoyed hanging laundry on the line.***********I wrote the above this morn about 9:45 and have tried off and on all day long to post with no luck till now.  I have my clothes in off the lines and almost all put away.  I always remember Grammy telling about when she was young...Grammy being my husband's grandmother...anyway, she left home while still a teen.  She had an apartment in the city, not sure what job she had.  But from what she said, it was a busy, bustling place.  She would hand wash some of her clothes and hang them on the line before she left for work.  One time she came home from work, and they had been stolen.Ever since she told me that story, any time I leave clothes hanging on the line and actually go shopping or something....when I come home I look to see if my clothes are still there.  One time, when my oldest was just a toddler, I had hung towels on the line, put her in the stroller and we walked downtown. When we returned home, I glanced up to see if my towels were still, there and glanced back down at my daughter...she had stood up and it startled me so that I stopped.  The sudden stop caused her to fall our of the stroller, but she only received a bump."},
{"title": "Rain, rain, and more rain", "date": "Sunday, June 6, 2010", "text": "This is what the skies were looking like Thursday afternoon on our way home from shopping...this is looking east.  When I get done with this post, I am going to post a couple pictures on my other blog looking north...I was going to say this is the first day without rain in ages, but actually we had sprinkles around 9:00 or 9:30.  Our yard was about a foot high...notice I saw was.  Roger and Sarah cut it today.  Roger probably should not have been mowing, but he is a lot better.  His neck just gets to feeling stiff at the end of the day.Lorelei wanted to be right where she could see her mom part of the time...part of the time she would come in and play with me.  And we watched Olivia a little bit.  She is such a character...we had spaghetti for late lunch and she sure ate....but Roger had given her a taste of banana bread earlier.  She was done eating, but he got that out and she says 'YEAH!' and had just a bite of it.*************I have been working on a couple little artsy quilts...just a few minutes here and there.  I was at first totally disgusted with them, but like them better now.  I have to find a piece of leftover batting to use for them, and decide on a fabric backing and get them finished.I think about how different things are for me quilting compared to my mom and women of the earlier generations.  I don't even know where to begin.  I think about my mom...she bought very little fabric just for quilting...she did buy muslin for the backing...that is all I can remember her buying when I was younger.  She used scraps leftover from making our dresses, and I think my sisters all sewed and sometimes gave her scraps they had.About the time I started driving, one of the stores started carrying remnants from sewing factories.  So, she started buying some of the remnants to use.  I cannot remember the prices now...I cannot even remember the prices we paid for material for dresses..but I do know that the prices were cheaper than that.  Those remnants were sold by pound.  Even with buying the remnants, she still used a lot of scraps.Then there is me.  I have been buying fabric for years.  Sometimes by the yard, sometimes just a half yard here or fat quarter there....all to build up my stash.  I always said I was buying till when Roger retired, I would have lots to work with.  I still buy fabric, but not near as much as I did...and it was all bought with the purpose of making quilts. For the last quilt I made, I cannot remember the number of fabrics I used, but I did not buy anything new except for the backing.   I used all fabrics that I already had. There are 168 squares in the top, and I only cut two squares of any one fabric, and I did not use all the doubles.  Another big difference is this:  the memories or thoughts are not there with my quilts that come when looking at quilts my mom  made.  I look at quilts from her and I see pieces from a dress I had in fifth grade, or there...there is a fabric from that dress she had.  Or look there!!!  That is a piece from the first dress I made in Home Economics.  Oh, and there is fabric from a skirt of one of my sisters.  And over there is from a dress I had in 8th grade....and there is one from the dress my sister made me.There are lots of other differences, but the fabric thing always really stands out for me.  When I grew up, I don't even know if there was such a thing as a quilt shop.  We bought most of our fabric from J.C. Penney's...they had patterns and fabric on the top floor...there just was not near the variety of fabrics to choose from...you just cannot imagine the variety available now. However, the one thing that I think remains the same...quilts are made with love.  When you receive a quilt, you are being wrapped in love.  Even if it is made entirely with a sewing machine, there is still loads of work that goes into one.  And that is not counting the money spent on fabric."},

This one seemed to be warning evey thing else to stay away.  Even the one on the ground.   And soon as they notice me, they were both gone!I managed to keep the cats inside today, did not let them out till after dark. (I am just saying the cardinals lasted another day.) That probably only happened cause we were gone a big part of the day.  Roger had a couple things to do this morn...then we were going to Sarah's house.  But I decided to sew just a line or two or three before we went. I came up about two hours before we had to be there..grabbed my camera and out the door we went.  Roger had left the Rav4 out by the sidewalk rather than put it in the garage since he knew we would be leaving shortly.  He was a bit ahead of me...about the time I got in he made the announcement that the car wouldn't start.  Neither of us know what to think...we have never had a  minute's worth of problems from it.He tries again and then gets out and looks under the hood...nothing obvious.  I try...no luck.  Of course the windows are down just a little bit and there is a chance of rain.  I came in and snatched trash bags, we cut them open, open the doors, and sort of wrap the plastic trash bags over the open part of the window....that involved Roger coming in and getting duct tape, the handy man's secret weapon.We get them taped in place, and get in the truck and head on to Sarah's...we have probably killed half and hour or 45 minutes by this time.  We go our usual route, only at the last sets of railroad tracks cars are backed way back and everyone is turning around and heading a different route.  So we do, too...we go to the next way we might be able to get through...no luck there...the train is all the way down there.So we go an even longer route and on the third try we make it through...not sure how much time we spent doing that...but we still made it in time to spend a few minutes with Sarah before she left...and stayed for a bit after she got back.  Came home, and decided it was just the battery with the Rav4...it is fixed and running fine.I tried to catch up on some of the inside work tonight...haven't spend much time on here other than to text my daughter and to compose a couple emails.  Now it is time to close and maybe watch a bit of TV or to read..not sure which."},
{"title": "Hard to see but look anyway", "date": "Thursday, June 3, 2010", "text": "These are hard to see, but click and take a look anyway.  The top photo is a birds nest....a cardinal's nest, in fact.  And below is a not so good photo of one the pair of cardinals that have the nest.The other day, one of the cats was wanting in...I opened the door to let it in and heard this chirp, chirp, chirp from a bird.  I opened the door wider and there on the swing sat a cardinal.  I thought it odd, but didn't really think anything farther.  But later that day or the next day, I heard it again.  It was fussing cause Mama Cat was laying in a chair out there.  So, then I investigated farther. It would not leave even with me stepping out there.  Just kept flitting around in the smoke tree and dogwood...then I spotted the nest.  It is level with the roof, or very close to that height...about 3-4 ft. from the edge of the roof.  I have no idea why they built there...I am both happy but at the same time kind of on edge because of my kitties. Mama Cat and Cougar are not so totally into hunting though they do show some interest, I think Bubbie is more so than they are, but Puss Puss is another story.  She is a dedicated hunter...anything that moves is not safe....whether it is a bug, butterfly, spider, or bird.  I have seen her catch all those things. Yesterday I heard her meowing and meowing.  Well, she will go down in the basement and 'catch' some of my dirty socks from the clothes hamper and carry them around and meow and meow.  Usually she brings them up here and I find them laying in the middle of the floor.  I am not sure if she thinks she has caught something or if she is wishing she had a kitty. I figured that that was what she was doing this time...so I started out by looking down in the basement.  She wasn't there.  So I started to look through the rest of the house and happened to glance out the kitchen door and there she was at the storm door, with a present for me....a dead robin she had caught.  So, I am really hoping the cardinal family survives.  I so wish it was not the nature of cats to hunt...but it is their nature and I have to accept it. **************Roger is really starting to feel better.  Maybe by this time next week, this will be just a memory.  Tomorrow morn he goes to the chiropractor , then we head to Sarah's house to watch Lorelei for a while.  Such a hard job, but someone's got to do it;)  If I had had to go of the morn, Roger would have cancelled his appointment...seeing her is like a dose of medicine for whatever ails us."},
{"title": "Another update/Lorelei post", "date": "Wednesday, June 2, 2010", "text": "I don't know when I will be back to regular blogging...somehow or other I am having a hard time getting back to it.  When I have time to blog, I seem to have blogger's block...but when I am out doing things, there are always things that pop into  my mind, but by the time I get time to sit down, I don't remember how I was going to say what I wanted to say.It is never just one thing that happens here...Roger was doing some painting and was in a tight cramped space and he 'sprained' his neck...that is what the chiropractor said.  He has been hurt at various times in his life, but this had had the most intense pain he has ever felt.  He has been to Doc twice with this and has improved, but I think he has a ways to go.  He is supposed to not do anything for at least a week.And there are other things, too, but won't go into any more details.  Instead I will tell you a thing or two Lorelei has done.  Last night, I was reading and didn't get on the computer till later...I had a message from Sarah telling that when she put Lorelei down for the night, that as she closed the door, Lorelei yelled 'Bye!'  ( I couldn't help but wonder if she blew her mom a kiss also--which she does now)The other night her dad came in with some chips...when Lorelei seen him with them she says 'OH. Yeah!'  She is just so funny.I almost forgot...Otto got out of their yard over the weekend.  Let me explain...the regular door to go in the garage is in the fenced in part of their yard...and they had forgot and left it open and the overhead door was open also.  So, he gets out and is gone...he wasn't gone long before they realized it.  They each got in their own car and started to search...stopped and ask people and no one had seen him.Then Sarah is at a stop sign and hears his toenails on the sidewalk...she gets out and opens her back door and he jumps in the back with Lorelei.  Lorelei in turn is so excited, she yells Oddie Doddie, and keeps saying it over and over and over on the way home...which wasn't that far, but was across one major, busy road.Have I mentioned she has dancing feet...I honestly can't remember.  Anyway, I will leave you with a couple of her and her dancing feet.  The first video was when she was about done with dancing feet, but the second is out of this world.  She impressed her Papaw....oh, that is another thing.  She has been saying dad and mom mom and even Mamaw for a while...which she sometimes calls me Mamaw and sometimes calls me Nana.  Even though she has known who Papaw was for so long...since just a few months old...she could not say his name...would hardly even attempt it.Last week while she was here, she said it, yelled it actually.  And Sarah said she said Papaw all the way home...over and over and over.Now, back to the good stuff, here she is with her dancing feet!And here is Dancing feet out of control!"},

Sorry that it has taken this long to do the post...if I had know I would take this long to do this post, I would have answered the query with a comment.Anyway, believe  it or not,  years ago I did a google on it, and found several reasons.  Some of the reasons were:  to protect the timbers of the bridge and keep it from rotting, to keep horses from being afraid when crossing the bridge, to have a shelter from a storm, and I am sure there were others but these are the ones that stuck with me through all the years.  At that time, no one wanted gave a definite answer.However, after having a discussion with Roger--he was just sure it was to protect the timbers,  I did another google on it.   This time the first two links I checked out both seemed sure it was to protect the timbers from the weather, so he was right.  You can check them out here and here."},

The grass/hay/weeds are just too tall.  We saw deer crossing the road out ahead of us.  They walked one at a time across the road...three in total.  When they walked out, we had not seen the first one, and barely saw the other two before they stepped into the open.  And when they crossed to the other side, after a couple of steps in the field of hay, we could not see them at all.  I would never have believed the grass was high enough to totally hide them."},

I finished doing the binding yesterday evening, but did not take pictures till today.  I wanted to take them outside till the quilting would show up better.  It has been one of the most fun quilts to quilt because it is for us...I did not agonize over how to do anything...I just did it.I like my backs to have a little something extra on them sometimes....and sometimes it serves a purpose other than just to add interest.  In this case, I had all those blocks left over, I thought why not add interest as well as save cutting more material.  Oh, yeah, see the white to the left of the blocks-- I caught an extra block of a different size in the quilting and did not notice till way late.    Since this quilt is going on our bed, to use every day, I was not going to rip out those stitches to remove it.  I just trimmed it real close to the stitching.  After one or two washings, it will probably be almost gone.I thought I would zoom in just a little to show the quilting a bit more...it is just free-motion quilted.  No pattern is drawn on or anything.  I like it because it adds texture to the quilt.  This is the quilt I used almost 1,000 yards of thread in the quilting..."},
{"title": "Blogger's quilt festival....", "date": "Sunday, May 23, 2010", "text": "I can not even remember how I came across The Blogger's Quilt Festival hosted by Amy's Creative Side...I have grabbed moments here and there through the day to visit quilting blogs and see what there is to view...for the most part I have not commented because I didn't have a post ready for it.  And had not planned to do one till a friend pointed out that it is open till May 28th.  If you want to join or just view some quilts and hear their story, click on the badge below.One of the rules is to tell a bit about the quilt and why it is special to you. So here goes.This is my River of Light quilt.  I started it when I still worked at the apple orchard....I wanted to sew sometimes but was too tired to do anything that required thinking.  I decided to make a string quilt in the quilt as you go method.  I cut the backing and batting foundation over-sized.  I drew two diagonal lines with a chalk marker to help me with the placement of the yellow.  I did not measure at all when marking the lines...just threw my ruler down and ran the chalk marker along the ruler.The only real restriction was I wanted the last yellow on each  corner/end to be the same one.  And a black and white print was to go  next to the yellow.  I think I cut the strips anywhere from 1 1/4  to 2 inches wide.  As I sewed each strip to the previous strip, I would  pull the thread up from the bottom and tie it in a knot, trim the ends,  then press the strip open.I just used old fabrics that I didn't especially like for the  backing...just to use them up.  If I had known I would like the quilt as  much as I do, I might have planned the backing a bit better.  After all  the blocks were done, I made borders by a method similar to making the  blocks.  Then I made the little sashing strips to connect the blocks.So this is my first entry for the Blogger's Quilt Festival...I have shown this quilt before but I do really like it....I think it is special to me because I really had not planned on liking it so much."},
{"title": "A turtle here, a turtle there", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2010", "text": "I did one drive through at the strip pits this evening..there are several little ponds or big puddles of water that are right next to the road.  Later in the summer when there is less rain, they dry up...that is why I sometimes refer to them as big puddles.Right now they are full of life though...I first seen a turtle headed across the road, but it quickly hurried back to the water when I came along.On down at the next puddle there is this mound in the middle of it...before I got within photographic distance, one turtle slid off into the water.  But this one stayed...when I looked through my lens, I quickly seen the other two little ones.  If you enlarge this, you can see them better...they are still out of focus though.Also seen but no chance to photograph were Dickcissels, a pheasant, a bob white, a muskrat, and a deer.  One thing I have not seen out there so far this year are the beavers.  In previous years, I did not fail to see them any time I was through there.  I almost always saw more than one...so I am really wondering what has happened to them.  I was really hoping that I would catch a glimpse of one tonight...*************Lorelei stayed with us just a little while this afternoon while her mom and dad went to a meeting.  She cried so when her mom left, but it only lasted a minute...she was very easily satisfied.   Below is a shot her mom sent me last night...as you can see the fun is about to begin!She really likes to climb...she climbed up in her rocking chair first thing after she got here.  But Sarah set her down in it that first time, the rest of the evening she would get in it and set down.  I have a clothes basket I use a lot of times turned upside down by my chair and if I have to get up, I set my laptop on it.  So, I had set it there before they came...well, after her mom and dad got back we were sitting in here talking and she started climbing up on it and turning around and sitting down.  She would sit there with her feet hanging over the edge and just laugh and clap her hands.  (We clap our hands and tell her 'good job!' when she accomplishes things. )While she was here she has this little book and each animal has a spot to feel...she brought it and got in my lap.  As we went through it, she would take my finger and have me feel the fur.  She is changing so much, sometimes I wish I could just press pause for a little bit."},
{"title": "Another story unfinished.....", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2010", "text": "When we were going to Bridgeton and Mansfield the other day....the first time...there was this cross at a country intersection, I think in Vigo County.  The most I can find is that he was born March 31, 1982 and died August 5, 1997.  It just made me wonder what he would have accomplished had he lived...and made me wonder what happened.  I cannot imagine being his  mom and dad...I don't even like to try to imagine.I tend to look at the obituaries in the newspapers...mainly the ones from home.  When someone has died in their 50's or younger, I can't help but think what a short life.  And of course, I think Wow, they are are  close to 100 yrs old when I see some one up in their 80's, and occasionally their 90's.But no matter the age, I often wonder what their story was...everyone has one.  I wonder what they did as children, wonder what their schooling was like, what games did they play.  And on the obituaries I see up here of people that were born in some other state other than a neighboring state,  I  wonder what the story is behind them moving here.I don't mean to be morbid...people and their life just interest me."},

Most times I go ahead and post mine but sometimes I don't...The past two or three drives we have went on, I have been trying to see an eagle but all I can see are buzzards.  LOTS of buzzards.  I have seen them perched on rocks and on logs at Bridgeton and Mansfield and I have never seen that before.  So strange.And then I saw all those perched along the river in Mary's post and realize I haven't seen anything yet.  LOL**************I had to do a couple things this morn, then I went down to Sarah's...we took Lorelei on her first visit to the library.  She was attracted to some trucks and toys they had...and to the other kids.  She just loves other little kids.  One little girl was so quiet and so well behaved, but Lorelei made friends with her mommy.  Another little girl talked to her a bit more.What was fun was the drive there and back.  Lorelei was in high form...she sat in her carseat doing her fake laugh trying to get us to laugh, which we did.  It is just so funny to hear her.  And she sang a little bit for us...such a sweet little voice.I was sitting here looking back at some of the little videos of her...and Roger said 'you can almost see her halo.'  I was also thinking how blessed she is to have her daddy.  I was thinking about how when he walks in the room, her whole face just lights up...then I thought about that is the reaction she has when we she sees us.  She sure makes life interesting."},

After we got our older daughter moved last week, and I got over being sick, I decided to get busy.  I had got about half of it quilted previously, and the past three or four days have really spent time on it.  The quilting is done, and I have almost finished the second spool of thread.  They each had 500 yards of thread. If I was just quick at making decisions, I could have had the binding made this afternoon.  Instead I didn't even want to think about it cause I know how I agonize over what to use.  Maybe I will get it done tomorrow...some people hate doing the binding but I really do enjoy it.  I guess I enjoy the whole process of quilting, except for pin basting the quilt sandwich together."},

Friday that opportunity arose.When we passed it on our way to Mansfield from Bridgeton, a lady was there working on a flowerbed at the end of the barn.  We ask for permission to see inside and she said to go right ahead.It did not belong to her, but she had known the owner all her life...she lived close to it and said they always keep an eye on it.She did know that it was over 100 yrs old and had been a horse barn. I am so thankful to her for letting us look around..."},
{"title": "Let's go for a bike ride!", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "I took this picture at the same place I took this picture of that real old tractor....as you can see if you enlarge this photo there is lots of old stuff at this place.  But this bicycle is in a class by itself.  I would not want to ride it...if you had a wreck and it fell on top of you, you would not soon forget.But it makes me think of my brother, Robert.  No, he never built anything like this but if he had wanted to he could have.  When we were young, he was not one of those brothers that wanted his little sister to have to stay at home.  He never minded if I tagged along with him and his friends; we would go to the dump and shoot bottles, light bulbs etc with BB guns, or we would head to the woods to find a grapevine swing.  I know we did other things when his friends came but these are the highlights for me.When it was just us, he was always busy with something.  One summer we decided to build a tree house up in the thicket.  The thicket was this patch of cedar and pine trees just across the road from our house.  If you will enlarge the google image below, the thicket is within the circle...at the edge of the circle 'x' marks where our home was.  Within the circle is an 'x' that marks the general area of where our treehouse was.I know we got the wood from home...I don't know if mom and dad knew we were using it.  But they had to because we had to pass right by the house with it.  Seems like I remember being warned not to lose the hammer.  Our tree house was built between 3 or 4 trees...I cannot remember if it was more or less a rectangle or if it was a triangle...but 2 x 4s  were nailed to the trees.  Plank flooring was laid on the 2 x 4s...and there was an area that had a second level....we more or less had a tree platform.  I don't remember actually doing much with it after it was build, the joy was in the building.Another summer we built a playhouse...there close to home and the barn.  Neal was laughing about it the other day...about how no room was level.  I agreed that nothing was level, but I still think it was something that we built it with nothing more than a saw and a hammer and nails.  And whatever else we could scavenge.It ended up with three rooms and had windows.  One room did not have any windows, and where the other windows came from I do not know.  I can't even remember what they actually looked like, just remember the light coming through them.  You could stand up in the rooms.  We got a seat from some old car and that was our couch.When Robert started driving, at that time it seemed to me he was always working on cars.  And always wanting me to help by holding something and that was the last thing I wanted to do...I can remember saying, \"ah, do I have to?\"  One time he switched out the transmission on a car.  I can remember having the feeling that his cars would just fly if he wanted...."},
{"title": "Time slipping away", "date": "Saturday, May 15, 2010", "text": "It feels like forever since I blogged any, when in fact it just now verging on a week.  My older daughter's belongings are now here, she is now in Georgia and has done started her training.  And I have been sick.  Again.  I am not going into details, but will just say there were a couple days that I was pretty miserable.  I am pretty much back to normal, and I think a big part of that is due to our activities yesterday.After breakfast, sometime up in the morn we headed out with camera and fishing equipment.  We wanted to see Lorelei since we had not seen her since Tuesday so headed to Terre Haute first.  We had not been there but a few minutes till she left and went in the other room, and here she came back dragging her jacket behind her!  Roger was sitting in the floor, so she gave it to him and stuck her arm out for him to put it on.He tried to distract her, but she was not having it.  So, we put her jacket on and took her outside thinking that she just wanted to be outside...she went to our Rav4.  We did distract her from that...not sure how she would have done had we brought her home.  And I still was not totally back to normal, so didn't know how well I would keep up with her.  But we really think she wanted us to bring her here.  She is such a bright little girl!We stayed and visited an hour or two, and headed out for a drive...taking roads we had never taken before with the ultimate destination Mansfield...in nearby Parke County.  We first stopped at Bridgeton to fish below the dam...I only caught a couple there and Roger not many more than that.We left there and headed to Mansfield, which is just a few minutes away.  The picture above is of the dam...and that is where I really began to feel like myself again.  We each caught fish--so many we didn't attempt to keep count.  It was a catch and release day for us...neither one of us felt like cleaning fish at the end of the day.But there is just something about fishing that does me a world of good.  I think it is because I focus on fishing only, on what lure to try next, or where I want to cast.  I can have the worst headache in the world and if I can go fishing for an hour or two it will be gone.  I came home yesterday feeling like a new woman...well, almost new!  I was plenty tired, but at least I had been doing something."},

{"title": "Tools of my craft....", "date": "Friday, May 7, 2010", "text": "Most people that know me, knows I like quilts.  I like to look at  quilts, I like to watch shows about quilting, and I even manage to make a  few quilts as I go along.  I have liked quilts as long as I can remember...I remember playing in my moms quilt pieces before I even started school.  If she watched TV, a lot of the time she pieced quilts while she watched. Now we have so many more tools....we have the the rulers such as those pictures above on my cutting mats.  They are acrylic and probably at least an eighth inch thick.  Using those with the rotary cutter pictured with the scissors below makes quick work of what used to would have been a time consuming job.  I have various sizes of mats, rulers, and rotary cutters.  Pictured below is the 60mm rotary cutter.  With it I will sometimes cut six layers of fabrics at the same time.I just had to throw in a few of the empty spools...I wish I had all the ones I have ever emptied...and really, really wish I had a lot of the old wooden spools. The above is the drawer to the right of my sewing machine...yes, we do use gloves in quilting.  My fingers just tend to slip on the fabric when free-motion quilting, but if I put on gloves with rubberized tips, the fabric does not slip at all.   That little plastic box is safety pins that I remove as I quilt....and there is the painter's tape...sometimes I use it to help me get an accurate quarter-inch seam.And on the left side this is one of the drawers...just some of my thread.  I don't have a lot more than this, but there are quilters that really have thread stashes also.  Most of this pictured here is Essential thread from Connecting Threads....a place that sells quilting supplies.  It is their own brand and is cheaper than a lot of other threads.  I have heard a few people complain  that it is the same as another brand of thread, but I totally disagree with them.  I have been sewing with the brand they swear it is, and had to switch to this because the other brand keeps shredding and breaking.And this is my much loved Juki 98Q!  I had a  Pfaff which I let Sarah take home, and I have a Husqvarna Viking machine and I love them both, but for quilting give me this straight stitch only machine.  I seen one at a quilt show a few years ago, but didn't think much about it.  I did not sew on it at all.  There came a time when I wanted to machine quilt a baby quilt. I actually did machine quilt two or three baby quilts, one full-sized quilt  and also did a couple of the rag quilts...each time swearing I would never attempt it again.  yet I always went back and tried.  Some people can do fine on a regular sewing machine...but the area to the right side of the needle is not very wide and it is really a job to manage all the bulk of a quilt under it.I am not sure what got me started looking at the Juki sewing machines...it has almost double the room to the right of the needle.  I kept looking but there was no place near to test-drive one.  Then I joined a Juki group on yahoo and read and read and read all the posts about them.  Though there were troubles of course, but 99% of the time it was operator error.  I decided to take the plunge, and bought one without ever sewing on it. I got a real good deal from a dealer on eBay....and it has made all the difference.I sound like I one of their dealers, but I am not.  I am just one happy customer.  A few people have troubles and say theirs won't sew this or that thread, but so far mine is happy with any thread, except the old standby of JP Coats.  And I can do regular sewing with it...just not free-motion quilting.  I have enough fabric to keep me busy the rest of my life, if things ever settle down till I can concentrate on quilting.Tomorrow is the big day...we move my older daughter's stuff home.  I spent the day with her yesterday and brought home a load of stuff.  She will have a couple days here before she heads to Georgia for her training.  So my blogging will for sure be just a bit here and there for the next few days.  I may get pictures loaded for my other blog...but this one will probably fall by the wayside for a bit."},
{"title": "After a sprinkle....", "date": "Tuesday, May 4, 2010", "text": "I took these the other day after a light rain...I couldn't resist another of the above new iris...The other two I have posted every spring before...I am always so glad to see them blooming each year.  I will probably take pictures ever year for the rest of my life, or for the rest of the time I am able.To me the above is the queen of the iris that I have...its petals make me think of a frilly dress.************************Lorelei was here today...she was sooo glad to see us.  It is hard to explain how she changes...I see it so plainly yet it is so subtle.  The one constant that does not change is her love of laughter.  Today when I had her in her high chair, I discovered something new to make her laugh.  I would been down till my eyes were about 8 or 10 inches from her eyes...I would close my eyes for a few seconds, then open them suddenly and make them big.  She thought that was so funny.She always goes and wants to watch videos of herself on You tube, then that leads to a few others.  She will watch two or three, then be done.  Then later, she will run in there to the chair and beat on it and look back at me...that is her signal that she wants to see more.  We always watch a few sesame street videos...and then just this and that.  Almost always just a very few  minutes at a time.I thought late this evening to look up Olivia's sight...she actually sat in my lap and watched a couple episodes...and she laughs at the appropriate times.  It is amazing to me that she will set that long.  I think Olivia is the only one that will hold her attention that long. Earlier she had sat in my lap and looked at books for quite a while...and then right before Sarah picked her up, she had sat in the swing for probably 15 or 20 minutes.  I guess that is one of the things that might now reveal much to others, but to us it is a big change for her to be still that long.  When she is playing with her toys, she is also starting to pick play with toys longer, rather than always going from one thing to another.  She still does go from one thing to another, but there are times she settles on one thing and plays quite a while.Well, that is the Lorelei report for right now...if I think of more I will add it later or in the comments."},

I kid you not,  there was this gym bag type of bag that was given to Roger at work...not just to him but to all the supervisors or to everyone in general.   What I am trying to say is it was not a special gift to him.  It was of such poor design that it has sat here for at least 3 or 4 years unused.  I have moved it from one spot to another numerous times.  I came across it again today and that was it...I took it out, told Roger it was either going in his section of the basement, the garage or the garbage, and I didn't care which.I really have no idea what the bag was supposed to be used for...it was tall...with a round zippered section on the bottom...and a drawstring type of top closing.  He looked at it and said put it in the garage...he plans to remove the nylon straps and any type of closures and then pitch it in the garbage.I have a bag of purses setting to take to Good Will, some of them hardly used, but none of them less than two years old, and some much much older than that. I threw away a couple of small thermoses that I used to use for work.  I quit work in the fall of 2005 and have not needed one since, so I got rid of them.  (I do still have my half gallon one.)  Other things found their way to the trash from that particular closet.I also got into my 'baking section' of the cabinets....it has my cake pans, pie pans, flour, sugar, mixer...etc.  And up until today it had two heavy wooden chopping blocks.  I did use them at one time, but they are not really considered as sanitary as the plastic ones.  I have been using plastic ones for years and years...so I pitched the chopping blocks.  Roger helped me carry them out to the trash can in the garage, and he started to dig out something I had thrown away...I said 'don't dare pull out something I have finally found the nerve to throw away.'Lorelei is coming tomorrow...so no more clearing of the clutter."},

But as you look farther down, one sees an entirely different story.  My husband likes to fly fish, but I think even more than all the fishing and hunting, he likes creating things.He used to make spinner baits for bass fishing, and even back when he did that, he would take little bits of black foam and cut and shape it...and use bits of the living rubber to make legs and would make little spiders to fly fish with.  Keep in mind when I am talking about fly fishing, I am not meaning for trout...I am talking about large-mouth and small-mouth bass, bluegill, crappie...fish commonly found around here.Last summer he got into making flies big time...every where we went, even to fabric shops, he managed to find things he could use such as some of the thread.  Department stores were goldmines.   In the make-up department he found nail polish to paint heads and eyes, in the craft department he found beads to use for eyes..and other things I don't remember now.Notice the spool holders above and below...the blue one on the end and the middle one with the spool of green thread...I think those were bought.  But look at the others--he made them using things he already had.And just look at the flies below...this is just a small sample of the flies he tied...some of these I think he came up with on his on...Now we have just got to take the time and go fishing...seems like the older we get the less time we spend fishing."},

I at least feel sure I remember being cold while taking the photograph. That is the thing about photographs...they are remembrances of things past...of things we have seen.  Things that have brought feelings rushing to the forefront, that makes us want to capture a moment in time.I feel compelled to take photographs.  When I was young, I always had my camera with me....though at that time I did not have the money to take near all the photographs I wanted.  Then through the years of raising our girls, working, and just life in general my cameras fell by the wayside.  I did take a lot of photographs of them when they were young, and a few when we would go to Tennessee.  But the camera was no longer my constant companion.The past year or two the camera has regained its place...I take either either one or both of them with me almost every where we go.  If I leave home without, most times I regret it.  I see things that are just so beautiful, I want to capture that moment in time.  Sometimes looking at things with the camera makes me see stuff I would not have noticed otherwise.Also, I get so much enjoyment from looking at old, old photographs of times past, it makes me want to start recording things as they are now to leave for future generations.  There is nothing I like better than finding digital libraries on line....specially when they are about Tennessee."},

It is the only color blooming but we don't have long to wait.  They are all loaded with blooms. I don't know about where you are at, but here on the western edge of Indiana the wind has not stopped for two days.  If you had a hang-glider, you wouldn't need to jump from anything.  The wind would just take you away...maybe not to where you want to go but you would be gone.  Roger said the weatherman said we had had gusts up to 35 mph, but I would bet money they are wrong.  At least for where I am at.I have been having a hard time deciding on what I want to blog about...just in a mood.  However, I have seen Lorelei two days this week...she was wonderful both days.  I went and stayed with her Tuesday, as previously mentioned.  Then she and her mommy came up here yesterday while someone came and viewed their house.  Her husband has spent the past couple of weeks in training at his new place of employment and starts his regular shift next week.  It is over an hour drive one way to work, so hopefully their house will sell and they can find one over there soon.Today is my other daughter's last day of work here...she has leave she has to take next week.  We will be moving her stuff here to store in our garage...she will actually spend a couple nights here before heading to Georgia.  This is sure happening faster than I expected...I thought she would still be here come this fall...boy, did I get a surprise.  With all the traveling she will be doing, we got her a GPS...she will be up this weekend to get it.For now, I am going to get off and post this...hopefully I will eventually get back to blogging on a regular basis."},

It was just the toot and I.  She is one happy, busy little girl.  She can really stay occupied with things....she can play by herself and be happy.  But she loves interaction...and she is beginning to know she is supposed to smile for the camera!***************When I finally got settled down tonight to sit, we started to watch the movie, Blind Side.  We knew we wanted to see when it first started being advertised.  Let me tell you, it is one of the very best movies ever!  At least in my opinion.  And to realize it is all true.  It is one of those movies that I would not mind owning..one of those that I will watch any time I see it on."},
{"title": "An explanation.....", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2010", "text": "A bit back I mentioned popcorn bloom...I had meant to link back to a post with the photos below but forgot to.  Then I wanted to find the rest of the photos and rescan them with the scanner I have now...it would do a better job.  But guess what?--I could not find them.Anyway, these first two photos were taken by Roger....at the orchard I used to work at.  I had broken my leg that year, and had a walking cast on it still when these were taken.  It had rained and everything was just saturated, so Roger took the photos for us.  You have to enlarge these to even get an inkling of what it was like.And compare the photos above with one below that I took 3 or 4 years ago...notice in the one above there is not one bud that is not open, but in the one below, some clusters are all bloomed while other clusters of blooms have not even begun.My boss' wife, or as we always said, the one that wrote my checks, explained to me that it was called popcorn bloom when all the blossoms bloomed at once and all the trees bloomed at the same time...a rare occurrence.  And I must say that I started work there in the fall of 1987, and the time above has been the one and only time it happened to this date.I wanted to get out there this spring to take more photos, but I am probably too late now.  I talked to my partner in crime out there and they were blooming there a couple weeks ago.  I also wanted to get up to the big orchard up north, and haven't had the chance to go back. I think this is one of the first years I haven't seen them both during part of the bloom...and last year is the first year that has went by that I haven't been out to 'our' orchard in the fall during harvest.I must say there is only one or two things more fun to do that pick apples...just something about looking and seeing what all has been accomplished during the day.  And fun being out in the sun and even rain, though not fun when it is so muddy you have to worry about getting your picker stuck, or when it is hard to get the tractor to pull the load up a slick, clay hill.When I first started there, we used to pick into crates and load them on the wagon.  During the last few years, we started picking into milk crates, pouring them into a big bin that held approx 10-12 bushels.  There were 3 or 4 of those bins on a mud boat....the mud boat would just dig into the mud and not slide over the ground as easily as it did when it was dry.That mud boat was about like having a tractor and trailer sometimes...to have that thing trailing behind always took a little bit of thinking when wanting to turn around and head back to the barn with a load.  There were always a tree missing here or one there, but you had to take into consideration were the apples still on the tree you were swinging through...or even if you just went to the end of the row it took some thought in a couple places. I sometimes wonder if I will ever forget where things are out there...the different varieties of trees.  And the odd trees planted here and there....I was always supposed to map out where everything was for the other girls...just never got it accomplished.I also always mean to go and pick a day or two in the fall but never do...I am afraid I would either be disappointed, or else I would not be satisfied with just a day!"},

We did make it to the greenhouse and got tomato plants, as well as some bell peppers.  But the garden is too wet to get in right now to plant.  I am ready for tomatoes from the garden...I can't wait to have one to bring in, peel back a little bit of the peeling back, sprinkle with salt and eat till the juice runs down my chin and arm.  That requires sitting out on the step, but that is okay.  Fresh tomatoes are one of my favorite things in life!"},
{"title": "Empty right now....", "date": "Saturday, April 24, 2010", "text": "This is at the orchard up north....when we passed through there the way the tree loomed over it caught my eye.Then I isolated the outhouse with the tree, and it seemed even more massive.   Or maybe it is just that the outhouse seems so insignificant.  Notice how the tree, outhouse, and light pole all lean one way while the house and the young trees in the background don't lean at all.  If I remember correctly the trees are staked so they can't lean.**************I remember our grade school had an outhouse for boys on one corner of the school ground and the girls was on the other corner.  I always remembered the teachers waited till recess was over before they went to the bathroom, and to the best of my memories, that happened very few times.  Can you imagine walking down a dirt path in dress shoes and dress clothes? I think the two that lived there close by would sometimes run home.My brother and I were talking about our teachers, and wondering if getting assigned to our school was looked forward to or if it was almost a disgrace, or some sort of punishment.  At least two of the teachers lived within a mile or two of school,  so it might have really been an appealing position for them.  Also, even with each teacher teaching two grades, our classes were small...very small.  I think, with the exception maybe of a time or two when a student came and left, our class always had the same 10 students in it.  I should have ask my other friends before writing this, maybe I am forgetting someone. In our 7th & 8th grade, we had the principal as our teacher.  I never felt like he enjoyed us at all.  And I really don't think he had a clue about what went on in class.  When we had to read out loud, some of the boys in the grade above us would reach over and cover the page of one of my friends till she could not see what she was reading.  He would tell her such words as 'the' and 'this' or 'her' and 'him'....and never look up.  And this for an A student!  Everyone in class could read those words....not once did he look up to see what was going on.We had a basketball court, but could only take one basketball out.  Or one softball, or one volleyball.  But there was a big metal locker that was full of basketballs, footballs, and I don't know what else.  The principal would not let us have a football...I think my friend and I ask for one one time.  His reply was no touch ball.Yet we used the volleyball in what we called 'keep-away,' and sometimes the whole gang of us would end up in a big pile fighting for the ball.  We could not have played any rougher if we had had a football.We played all games unsupervised...yet very seldom was there an argument.  And I don't ever remember there being a serious argument.  We might fuss a bit over whether someone was out or safe, but went on and played. When we were young, my best friend and I played ball with the older boys.  We had to get permission from that same principal mentioned above...his words were 'no crying.'We had times when we played jump rope, red rover, tag, Mother may I, hide and seek, etc...or swung on the swings.  When they were up...I think part of the time they were taken down for some reason.  We would swing in those swings just as high as we could and bale out...I don't know how we didn't end up crippled as much as we jumped out of those swings.  But as far as I know, it never hurt any of us.These are just a few of my thoughts when I see an outhouse...who would ever think that an old outhouse could evoke such memories?"},

When you look close at the handle you can see the weave of the fabric, but it is so silky smooth to the touch.**************My niece is coming down for a couple days so I may not get much blogging done.

Can you believe this is the same dogwood?  It is, but I have no way of proving it to you.  I really thought this year it was going to stay pink, but as you can see all that is left is just a hint of color.I had ran to the library today, got home and after a bit checked my email...found that Vicki from The Middle Sister blog had left this Beautiful Blogger award for Miss Lorelei.  She may not realize it but she made my day.  As Lorelei often does.Our family is going through transitions...Lorelei will probably be moving in the near future.  Not too far away, but not so easy to just drop by.  We celebrated her mom's birthday yesterday by having a cookout.  It was sort of bittersweet, knowing it  And our other daughter is taking a new job...she will go to training for four months starting next month, then be moving to the Los Angeles area.  Kind of hard to describe what that feels like;  I am happy because it is what she wants to do.  Yet I dread her being so far away.Anyway, this award just sort of brightened the day for me...made me think about Lorelei and the joy she is.  I am really hating that her auntie will be moving so far away from her, but maybe in two or three years she can transfer back closer to home, cause Lorelei sure loves her.I was supposed to help Lorelei decide who is going to be the recipient of the Beautiful Blogger award and was having a hard time deciding.  Then I thought, now if I were Lorelei, who would I give the award to?  And then it was sort of easy...I am giving it to Scout, the Bernese Mountain Dog.  As much as she loves dogs and cats, it such an obvious choice...and just looking in his eyes, I bet he would love her."},

And the above photo is the result.This is a coffee table my husband made our older daughter when she first moved out...she bought the slate tile and decided on how she wanted it laid out.  My husband's friend gave him the oak wood....and this is the result.

While we are at it, lets do a couple.  Be sure and have your sound on...in the second one, she does not know what to shake first.Now to the reason I am tired...our older daughter came up today and we went mushroom hunting.  We were in the woods at least a couple or three hours, and in that entire time only two were found.  And our daughter found them.After we came home, she went home and I rested a little bit.  And then the fun began!  We had the furnace put in yesterday, and I must say we are both so relieved to have that done.  The guys worked hard all day long to get it done.  They did take a break for lunch,  but that was it.  They were here by 9:00 and was at least 4:30 when they left. I had had to move some of my sewing stuff in order for them to be able to work...only another quilter could comprehend just what I mean by sewing stuff.  Last night I did go down there but just could not face getting things back in order, but I knew I had to get busy this evening.  I have been busy off and on all evening and night...and had Roger down there part of the time cause I needed muscle power.A bit back I let Sarah have one of my sewing machines....but of course she didn't want the big old desk I had for it.  At least I don't think she did.  So, I wanted to rearrange things...and I did.  We are both dragging now.  My desks are the big heavy, full sized office desks and it is all both Roger and I together can do to move them.Anyway, I am so glad to have it done...I still have some 'stuff' to rearrange, but that is not like lifting and tugging and pulling.  Oh, and hunting...did I mention hunting?  I can lose  more stuff than any person I know...and I spent a good half hour looking for this piece of thin plywood that my sewing machine has to set on to be the right height.  Roger finally went out to the garage to cut another one...about the time he got done I found it.  So now I have two.  But that is okay.  If I had the nerve I would go back down and finish putting stuff away, but too tired.That's all for tonight....going to go post a photo on my other blog and maybe watch a little TV...."},

I still want to go back and take some more photos...we got up there later than we should have with me taking the detour to go by the big orchard up that way.  I still would like to go back to it again....I would love to see it in full bloom just one time in my life.  Normally the different varieties bloom a few days apart.

Look at that trim, and if you don't enlarge any of them, enlarge this one and look at the door, I don't know if that was an old style of door or if it is one that has been made by a craftsman.  I suggest enlarging all of them to see better, though.*******************Today has been one of those days around here.  We have been talking about having a new furnace put in here...so Roger called today.  The guy came out and they are coming back tomorrow to put it in.  They should be able to do it in one day.

I got busy and called the phone company, and they told me it should be repaired by 6:00 p.m. tomorrow.  Again we were pleasantly surprised...it was fixed within an hour or two.Tonight I have spent most of the evening working on finding all the pictures of Roger's knives...and making resized copies and putting them in a folder all their own. I still need to go down and get my quilt folded and put away till nothing happens to it tomorrow...I went down earlier to do it, but started quilting on it again.

She has met him two or three times...he is a big guy with a booming voice and she has been shy of him before, but today she had a big smile on her face.  She didn't offer to go to him or anything, but he didn't keep her from doing what she wanted.I thought you might want to see how totally absorbed she can be with sticks.Her dad was talking to her and getting all these grins out of her...it was hard to limit the photos to just five.Even in the photo below, she still has a small piece of stick in her hands.Can't you just see the gleam in her eyes!Yesterday  was just a gorgeous, beautiful day...one that just called for a drive.We went back north again, to Williamsport, a little town we always drove  through on the way to Purdue.  Williamsport is the county seat of Warren County, and this is a drive by shot of the courthouse. We also drove on north to Attica, where these flowering trees were taken.  I told Roger I would like  to go and park and just walk the neighborhoods and take pictures.  In the coming week I hope to show some of the house shots I took.

There was a rear tine one listed, in Terre Haute, and now that baby is in our garage waiting for the ground to dry.  I am glad to have found one...it started so easy that I have no fear of starting it myself if the need ever arises.We had the Little Busy Body (link to cute little video) yesterday all day in case you wondered why I have not been around much.  It is about impossible to get a photo of her because she keeps me so busy otherwise.  She wants outside constantly...while out in the yard itself, she just walks around.  Let her feet touch the sidewalk, and she thinks she has to run...and she thinks I should let her run with a stick in one hand and a rock in the other.I am seriously thinking about picking her up a small box of rocks to have in the house...I have considered sticks too, but may not do them.  And I may regret doing rocks...Neal and I were talking about how we each think our child/grandchild is extra smart.  And it is true...but you can see the wheels turning in her head.  Her car seat sets in the house, and she will work and work trying to buckle the buckles, and sometimes succeeds.  And she has made the connection between the light switch and lights coming on.

I have did it in the past a time or two, but it wasn't fun back then.  I really don't think the Mantis tines would last--the tines were not very heavy at all.  So we will do some more thinking.

We really don't have to have one....In the meantime, I will show you these turtles we saw last weekend.When I first started visiting Mary's Faith, Fabric, and Photos, she had posted a lot of turtle pictures...gee, that must have been about 2 years ago.

That is kind of hot for April 1.  Not that I am complaining...no indeed.We sat outside and had coffee this morn...Roger had a bacon&lettuce sandwich and I had coffee with a side of bacon. I am not kidding.  Bacon and coffee are the best combination ever.  Toast ruins the effect.  Try it sometime.  Roger has tried it but doesn't taste the same thing I taste.  Or else he would not have another bacon and lettuce sandwich...at least not until we have tomatoes fresh from our own garden to go with it.  I will probably choose that when it is available, but until then, it is bacon only and coffee.Sarah called this evening...to let us know that her husband did get a new job offer.  His job he is at now will be ending shortly.  It is about an hour away...so they may end up moving.  Even though that is not as easy as now to go see them, it is not that horrible either.  Much better than if they had to move to Utah or Washington State."},
{"title": "Nothing like a bottle, a kitty,and watching Olivia", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "text": "Lorelei came to visit today...she wanted to stay outside almost all day.  The only thing that really tempts her voluntarily to come back inside is if there is a cat she wants to get...So, we played outside here...her favorite thing is sticks, followed by rocks.  Lorelei can also spend a fair amount of time opening and closing the gate.  She will open it, close it, open it and go out it, turn around and close it and then open, and go back inside.  Over and over.We also took her to a little park near here...again her favorite thing:  sticks of course.  She did like the slide, but not the swings.  There is a small church up there...the church and park share a parking lot.  I actually don't know who officially owns the parking lot.  The church has a ramp for wheel chairs that is not very steep and not very long.  Lorelei discovered it and had a very good time going up and down it.She did take a small nap in her car seat on the way home from the park....but I figured when they went home that she might fall back asleep.  No such luck.  She did decide to slow down and have a bottle...and that is when Sarah took this picture...she gave it the title I used. However her mommy did tell me a couple interesting things.  One is if Sarah is setting down and Lorelei is playing, Diesel comes and gets in her lap, here comes Lorelei and sits down on him.  And makes him leave....she don't want to share her mommy, though she likes it if he comes to see her.The other thing, her friend told her that if her little boy starts to get into something she will tell him , 'no, no' and he will say 'O, its Lorelei's'....he is two years old.  And she is not the only kid he is around...he has just always been so good to her."},

She was laying back in her mommy's lap, and of course, Diesel wanted up there also.  Lorelei did not mind at all.  She still will grab a kitty's ear sometimes or she wants to feel their eye.  Bubbie will just set there most of the time with her poking at him.  Puss Puss runs any time she is near...she always has so it isn't a thing of Lorelei having hurt her.Cougar runs sometimes and sometimes not...and the biggest surprise of all is a lot of times Lorelei can walk all over Mama Cat and she will just let her.  At least half the time...other times she will get up and leave.  I doubt anyone can imagine the change in Mama Cat since she came to live with us...before the only person that could pet her was my older daughter...the rest of us she would try to bite or to scratch.  Now she never meets a stranger.I was going to post this last night, but for some reason you tube was really slow on this end last night.  Tonight, I have been getting an error code when I try to publish some of the comments but reported the error and got them published.  Only from one person...all the others I could publish."},

When they finish, it is going to look fantastic...but has it lost something in covering the wood?  I understand why they do it...yet I hate seeing it done.  I am just glad I was not required to do the roofing...it would not have gotten done.Notice the angled cuts...whoever is doing them is doing an expert job!  And the pieces are so wide they were not being done with a chop saw.  But maybe they made a jig...I know in doing some things that have to be done over and over, my husband has made his own jig, or tool, to get the cuts and/or measurements the same.Maybe in a week or two, I can go back up through there and take a photo of the finished barn.  I plan to post another photo from this farm on Time Stand Still."},

And for being in the middle of the day, the lighting was not as bad as it normally is.  So, we headed out for a drive...we chose to go north.  I got a surprise when I downloaded the picture above...I had not noticed the plane at all...Roger first called it Almost a Collision...or something like that...then he said, being funny, 'wonder if they saw each other?'This is the backwaters of the Wabash River...we saw quite a few coots..no really good shots though.  This one was almost a good 'Bottoms Up' shot...you might have to click and enlarge to see it...There are a couple buzzards on top of the barn...spreading their wings.  I like the barn anyway.This was the prize of the day..not so much the photograph but what it is a photograph of.  It is an eagle...a juvenile from the white on his chest.I would love to know how high he was...he was way, way up there and still looked so huge.  To us, his wings look too big for his body.  I told Roger that I don't know why, but when they are up so high, they look so much larger to me than the ones I have seen closer to the ground.  I would love to know why that is."},

It was bright and sunny, not a cloud in the sky.  I got my hair cut this morn...I would say first thing, but it was 10:30 so it was not the very first thing...but it was the first thing I left the house for.  After that, we headed to Terre Haute and got a couple errands done...nothing urgent but just things I wanted to get done.But the day did not have the greatest of starts...I had been up a little while and decided to get on line...checked my mail, and tried to publish a couple comments to this blog.  I could not access my blog, I could not access any blog done with blogger.  I was using Firefox so switched to Internet Explorer...no luck.  I switched to the other computer, again trying both browsers....no luck there either.By then it was time to head to get my hair cut...and soon as I got back we left.  I was thinking it was something with Blogger since I had no trouble with any other sites.  I figured by the time we got home, it would be working.  WRONG!I got to investigating a little farther...I could not use the google search engine...I could not access any site to do with blogger...but if I changed to another search engine I could at least get results, but if it was a site to do with blogger, I could not access it.I tried turned off the computers and restarting...no luck, I unplugged and plugged everything back in...the first time I did this, I lost all Internet connection.  So I unplugged everything again and actually just let it set a few minutes and plugged everything back in...SUCCESS at last.  I have visited most my normal blogs, and I even used the google search engine with success, but just tried to use it again, and I got that famous message that the connection to the server was lost...so I am posting while the posting is good.  But wait a minute, I tried it again, and it worked that time...I swear these computers have a mind of their own.But you can imagine how I enjoyed this little video after the puzzle of trying to get things to running again."},
{"title": "Going back....", "date": "Friday, March 26, 2010", "text": "My brother Neal has wanted me to try to write this for a long time...it is hard to do and do it right but here goes.  This is the house of our nearest neighbor when I grew up. It is as it was when I grew up....this is not a good picture of it.  I don't have one...this is just a cropped portion of another one. It was the home of V and V....both their names did begin with V.  What are the chances of that?I don't quite know where to begin...maybe I will say that every now and then, mom and I would walk out there to visit. I know we sometimes stopped to visit in the summer, usually just for a few minutes then.  I think we were more apt to go visit in the cooler months.  Maybe because mom did not have quite the work to do in the winter.Going there was like stepping back in time.   You just cannot imagine...my words are inadequate. The first thing that always hit me was just how gray the atmosphere was...and I actually think a lot of things were gray.  You walked into the what would normally be the living room, and there was the gray floor....I don't know if it was a gray linoleum or if it was actually gray floorboards.  The room had little in it...I don't think it had a couch....but I am not positive.  It seems there was something to sit on, just not a sofa as we think of them.  What was in there was the horses bridle...I don't remember if the rest of the harness was there, but that always struck me odd for the bridle to be there.We would go through another room, at one time I am sure it was meant for a dining room, but we just passed through it and I know on the one side of the room was a bed.  Now, what is funny, we would close the door between that room and the living room...and we would pass through it into the kitchen...again the door closed behind us.The kitchen is where they lived...they had an a-m radio and a single light bulb hanging down in the middle of the room.  I know the table was set in front of the window that faced our house...and I know there was a cook stove in there.  The wood burning kind.  But I don't remember much else about it other than the walls were covered with newspapers and cardboard, and a calender of course.  I would set listening to the talk...talk about crops, gardening, etc.They did not have running water...they had a well outside where they got their water--the kind you lower a bucket down and bring it up one bucket at a time.  She did have a wringer washer...considering everything, I think she must have been lucky to have it.    And they had an outhouse...which some college kids stole one weekend.  I am sure they probably did not even realize anyone actually lived in the house....my brothers had to go find it and retrieve it....and no, they were not involved in taking it.Another thing, they didn't drive, didn't have a car.  The post office and store were about a mile away.  I honestly don't know if this part is true, or if it just seemed to me that Mr. V walked down to the store and post office every weekday...at the least every other day.  But he would try to time it to catch rides from neighbors...going or coming.  And though he did go most days, Mrs. V very seldom left the home.  At the most they might come out to our house and visit.  If they had to go to an actual town they would find someone to give them a ride.  It goes without saying that they did not have a phone...if they needed to make a phone call, they came and used ours.Neal and I were talking earlier, as long as we knew him he never worked a regular job.  He was in the army at one time, but probably only for a short period...he did not retire from it.  They had a small garden, and raised a patch of tobacco.  His dad had a tractor and would do the initial plowing...you know where you plow deep and turn the ground over after it has gone through the winter.  He had a horse to do the rest of the plowing with...They were strange...even for down there at that time and place.  Their doors were always locked...unless they were sitting on their front porch.  They were locked if they were in the house...night and day.  If they were out in the garden at the side of the house, the doors were locked.  Mrs. V's dad had to stay with them for a while, and they would lock the doors on him and leave him locked in.  My dad would go out to visit him and they would have to yell through the door.  Then dad remember we had an old skeleton key and took it, and could unlock the door.  I don't remember their reaction to that.  Her dad was not strange...and neither was his dad....so don't know why they were so strange.She would see some of us kids out, and hide behind the chimney or an outbuilding...and would peek around the corner at us.  At other times, she would go on about her business, and would speak if we were close enough.Everyone was always good to them...there was always someone to help him load his tobacco and take it to market...even though he always found an excuse not to help anyone.  He would condemn television, but yet when they came to our house to visit, if it was on he could not take his eyes off it.Even though we lived by them all those years, there were things about them that will always puzzle me.I am leaving out somethings...maybe my brother will comment and tell about them...like Roxie their horse.  Right now I am running out of steam and need to close and post this."},

She is just so full of life...but I did succeed in getting her to take a nice nap. Remember how I told how much she likes to be outside? I had her outside a time or two, and I put her in her stroller and went for a walk around the block.  After all that, she went to sleep fairly easy.  Slept about an hour and a half...much more than she slept when she was just 5 or 6 months old.Well, she had been up long enough to get her diaper changed and fooled around a few minutes.  She went and got her jacket for me...she wanted me to know that she wanted to go outside!  It was warm enough till she didn't need to it. I took her outside, but all she wants to do is go up and down the steps...so I brought her back in. After her mom came home, I found the You Tube video of Feist singing 1, 2, 3, 4...one of Lorelei's favorite song.  She came and climbed up in my lap and was really trying to sing along.  Such a sweet little voice. And she loves seeing that video of herself with the shopping cart...she just looks at us and grins with the most mischievous look in her eyes....First of all, I did NOT take these pictures...they are of my daughter and her tandem partner/instructor.  A few years ago, she and one of her friends decided they wanted to try skydiving.  So they looked into it and decided to do a tandem jump--that is where you have a little bit of training and then are harnessed in with someone who is an experienced jumper.She did enjoy it, but hasn't gone again.

And was totally fascinated by the other kids.  We had her stroller, but she did not want to stay in it.  She like to be down and walking around...We stopped for pizza on the way home--that is one of her favorites.

{"title": "Evening glow....", "date": "Thursday, March 18, 2010", "text": "I have been missing some great sunsets...every night I have looked to the west and there has been this fabulous golden glow.  It has been indescribable, and will remain so even though I went to the strip pits again to try to capture it.I saw a blue heron taking off as soon as I turned down the road to enter the area, no chance for a photo.  But then I noticed a pheasant..no chance to get a close picture.  Just seen his head.  So I crawled along, and eventually saw two more that were together, these were too far away for my poor lens.  I watched them a little while and continued on and saw the one above.  This is not the greatest picture but it will do.  By the time I headed home, I had seen either 7 or 9 pheasant.  The reason I say 7 or 9 is that I think I saw the same two twice...all were male.  I wonder where the females are hiding.The evening glow had just barely started when I took the photo of the pheasant...I am not sure you can tell it in it but I think you can see its beginning in this photo.  I thought about calling it The Long Shadow....And two more of the sunset itself!  Even though it didn't have quite the same color that I have been missing, it was gorgeous.  I hope you enlarge them for full effect!I wish everyone could have been there...the spring peepers were in full voice, red-winged blackbirds were every where...it was just so peaceful.And I almost forgot to tell this...I was creeping along retracing my route....the one I had just went down and there was a fishing rod-n-reel in the road.  How I had not run over it on the way down the road is more than I know because it was on that side!  It was not near a strip pit...have no idea how it got there.  It came home with me...it isn't a good one or anything.  One of the eyes were bent....I bent it back in place.    If there were a local bait shop I would leave it there, or else tell them if someone comes in looking for one to call me.    We have lost stuff out like that, only it was a more cherished item and it is not a good feeling."},

However, one of the guys Roger used to work with came and spent a good part of the day here.A while after his friend left, we decided to run out to the strip pits to see what we could see.  On my Time Stand Still I have featured the prize capture, but I thought I would show these as well.  Yes, if you click the photo above, I think you can tell that that is a cat!  I thought it made a fairly good photo.There were not too many birds, we seen more mallards than anything.  The geese and the mallards seem to be pairing off to start their families.We saw some other deer, but this was the only one that I captured with the camera.********************I just discovered something about ScribeFire...the Firefox add-on to manage blogs.  The pictures that I upload with it cannot be enlarged.  Another negative thing was that only one photo at a time could be uploaded.   Though I would have lived with that if the photos had enlarged.  Anyway, I probably won't be using it.I think it would be fine if you didn't publish photos to enlarge...but even on my Time Stand Still blog, my photos can be enlarged.

Just a happy little girl......she played with her papaw.  Chasing him through the house.  She would not quite go through the door cause she knew he would be on the other side.  But she would wait for him to jump out and say 'BOO' and would just giggle.Sarah says her dad plays hide-n-seek with her, and he will hide and call 'Lorelei' real softly, and Lorelei will go 'da-da' real soft back to him.  She still likes the eee-i-ee-i-O thing.  Sarah said the other day she had gotten horse from doing it.And guess what?  When Sarah has her outside and takes her back in the house, she gets mad.  Who would have imagined that.  One thing she likes to do is to find Otto sitting outside and she just goes up and sits beside him.  Just happy to be with him.  She was doing that today with Mama Cat.  Sometimes she gets up and leaves and other times Lorelei can step all over her and she just sits there.*******************Have any of you ever lost a kid, or thought you did?  When Sarah was about three years old, all of a sudden I/we couldn't find her.  Even back then, I kept close tabs on them.  I only let her and Rachel out in the backyard if I was going to be with them or in the kitchen where I could watch out the back door and window.I don't remember the circumstances right now, just that Roger was home and I/we realized we couldn't find her.  We called for her, and was in and out of all the rooms, went next door to Aunt Luddy's--no Sarah.  I can still feel my heart up in my throat.  Then we thought, do this methodically....go through each room close the door behind us after we are sure she isn't in there. In one bedroom, the bed sat in front of a window.  She was hiding behind the headboard, behind the curtain....and had not made a sound!  I can't help but wonder how many times Lorelei is going to pull stunts like that. I may sound like a negligent parent, when I tell this next, but really I am not.  I cannot remember how old she was when this incident occurred...she might have been a year year and a half older.  I am not sure.  Again I realized she was just not here, and I was starting to go through the search.  Even knowing how she did the other time, I was still on the verge of being frantic.  I get a phone call...it is Aunt Luddy telling me she had a little girl over there.   That little girl was Sarah, and Sarah told her she had told us she was coming over there.  She knew us well enough to know that we wouldn't just let her wonder over there.These days, I would be afraid to let a kid out of my sight for even a minute....even when Lorelei gets older than that."},

If it wasn't so windy, I would take it outside to take photos.But these at least give you a glimpse of the quilt in all its glory.This is something I just sort of made up as I went along...There is a pattern called an Irish Chain and this has the feel of one, though it really isn't one.  It is Sarah's...I want to take it to the laundry mat to wash the first time...I will use a Shout color catcher in case any of the fabric bleeds.  Though now that it  is done, I might be able to do it in my washer...I first thought it was too big.Some quilters wash all their fabric first thing when they bring it home but I like working with new fabric.  I guess the first time I have a quilt ruined I will do different.  I did buy this one fabric several years ago...just a beautiful vivid blue...I had a feeling I should wash it before I used it.  It bled so much, repeatedly that I never used it for anything.I am trying to make up my mind to get out another quilt top and get the sandwich made and pin basted...I may wait a day or two.  The one I have in mind is almost as big as this one I just finished.  I guess I will just wait and see what the weekend brings.***********For a story that will give you a warm feeling all over, read this story.  I belong to a quilt forum and the link was posted there...it is one of the best heart-warming stories I have read in a while.*************The day started with thunderstorms...I was up about daylight unplugging computers.  Even though they are on a surge protector, I don't totally trust it.  So if I am here, I unplug them.  Later, it was warm...in the 60's today....it was over 70º yesterday!  Things are trying to spring to life.  I hung out a load of clothes, even though it was dark and cloudy one minute and sunny the next.  Probably dark and cloudy more than sunny.  I just love hanging out clothes.  I don't know why.  I like hanging them in an orderly fashion, shirts with shirts, jeans with jeans, towels with towels, etc.  I even separate them as I get them out of the washer.Sometimes I wish I had a wringer washer.  When I was a kid, that is what we washed with.  And laundry day was sort of an all day job....well, at least all morning.  And we had to be there in the evening to bring them in off the line.  I can't help but think how much water would be saved.  I have heard the auto washers and dryers called time savers, but I am not so sure.  I hate to think how much time I spend running up and down the basement stairs taking care of them."},

So, we took a left turn on to the campus, I stopped and got the first two pictures.We continued on around and found out that it was St. Joseph's College....I had not heard of it before, but I am not likely to forget it now.  It is a small college in (around 1000 students) in a small town of 5,000-6000.  It is a private, Catholic liberal arts college that was founded in 1889.This is the front of the church...I have fiddled with it in photoshop trying to get the best photo I could.

We were headed north to Jasper-Pulaski Fish and Wildlife Area to see the Sandhill cranes again and yesterday seemed the best day to make the attempt.I am telling you now, if rain was not in the forecast so much for the coming week, there is no way I  would have traveled yesterday.  We were in fog so thick most of the way there...so thick you couldn't see what was in the road right beside you.  Go here, and look what is right beside the road...notice the 3rd photo down especially.  Now we were in the lane this photo was taken from so we were across the median, etc....but there are others almost as close on our side of the road and even though I was looking for the wind turbines, I never spotted a single one on the way north.  That gives you a clue to how thick the fog was.When we got so far north we were going to have to get off the 4 lane road, we decided to find a place to sit and have coffee and wait for the fog to lift.  We did take our chances though and traveled a few mile on a two lane road to Watseka, Illinois....we went to this little mom and pop restaurant and ordered coffee.The first thing the waitress told us there had been a 10 car pile up just right there close to Watseka....that all the ambulances had been used.  We sat there at least an hour, and finally thought the fog was lifting, but as we left there I thought I saw a junk shop so stopped there for a few minutes before heading out.  There we heard 12 cars, and this morn I did find a link and it said 12 cars....  These top two scenes were after we left there...And these are the Sandhill cranes we went to see.  I didn't get many good pictures...of course with all the waiting it was the middle of the day when there and though my focusing skills leave a lot to be desired, the lighting was also bad."},

Hopefully before the week is  out I will have opportunity to take some.  I have not worked on it steady, but just when I had TV to watch.I am sure this quilt is going to be well loved...in fact, it already is.  The three youngsters of the cats have all laid in it, on it, under it every opportunity they could get.  But the Puss Puss shown here has been the one that seemed to love it most.  She has really given it the official test the past couple of days.Bubbie usually wanted in it if he thought he could get some kind of game out of it...and would crawl under the folds.  He crawls under anything he can...put a newspaper on the floor and he will try to crawl under it.  If just his head is under, he thinks his whole body is hidden.Now Cougar is a bit different...he likes to lay on anything he can that I have recently handled.  If I lay a jacket down, and forget it, I will look around in a bit and he is laying on it.  He has gotten in my lap while I was stitching the binding down and sat on it till he had to move, and he did this while I was quilting it. I would quilt, have to stop and move him to reposition the quilt, and he would crawl right back on it.  You don't know what you are missing if you don't have cats!"},
{"title": "Meet Sheba", "date": "Saturday, March 6, 2010", "text": "Please click to enlarge to see how pretty she really was! Roger and I was at the wedding of his cousin and she told us about the puppies that were just born and that they were collie and samoyed.  At that time I had not heard of samoyeds.  But I could not remember a time that I had not loved collies.Attending his cousin's wedding was one of the first things we did together, and  though we had not discussed marriage, we said something about liking  them.  Or maybe it was at our wedding, we mentioned them again...I don't  know.  Keep in mind we only dated a month and got married....anyway, we had not been married too long when here came his cousin bringing us this little bundle of love and energy.I don't know where I came up with the name of Sheba, but that is what I named her.  And I think by the time we got her, I had been home to Tennessee and brought my dachshund home.  They were a pair...Snoopy the dachshund liked to play ball and Sheba like to play with an old sock with a not tied in it.  She would have liked for Snoopy to play, but Snoopy preferred to play with us.  But every now and then when Snoopy walked by Sheba, Sheba would reach out and bite her tail just to get a reaction out of her.Roger and I both worked the evening shift, so they were alone for several hours, though my mother-in-law would come and let them outside a time or two before we got home for them to go to the bathroom.  But still, I cannot remember all that Sheba chewed up with her sharp, puppy teeth.  For one thing she chewed our checkbook to pieces, and another thing was a  New Testament Roger's aunt had given him when he joined the marines.The destructive phase of her puppyhood did not last long and she grew into a wonderful dog.  She liked all women, and though she didn't hate men, she very seldom met any that she liked immediately.  She knew family, though it might take her a day to accept them as family if she had not met them when young, but once she knew, she didn't forget them the next time she saw them.  If it was any of Roger's male friends from work, she usually sat between us and them.From the first minute she met our preacher, she liked him.  And this one guy down home....that had been buddies with my brothers and been like family.  She loved him the minute she met him.Roger could pretend to attack me, and she would go up and would put her mouth around his legbut not bite him....if he had really been hurting me she would have defended me I am sure.We had had her about two years when we moved to Tennessee....where these photos were taken.  All I had to do to was say 'here kitty, kitty' or 'where's the cat?'  I do not know why, but she hated cats.  Or maybe she didn't hate them, but just wanted to chase them.  So, when I wanted a nice picture of her, the word to say was not 'cheese' but 'kitty.'When we moved back to Indiana, it was sort of suddenly...my father-in-law's cancer had returned.  We moved in with them for a month or so...and we left Sheba with my mom.  Though we got to see her a more times, she was always thrilled to see us.  A faithful companion always."},

However, the more I watch the birds...the more I classify as beautiful.These were taken at Turkey Run State Park...I have these kinds of birds at home, but have yet to get shots even as good as these.  And these were taken through dirty windows.**************Lorelei and her mommy came up today....I taught her a new habit.  I have a basket that has handholds--not a handle.  I set her in it and took her for rides.  She liked it.  I have a feeling I might regret doing it if I don't find something else to distract her.  She went to it two or three times after I did it the first time and got in it...So, I had her in tears right before she went home....I was giving her one last diaper change before she left, and she started her version of the E-I-E-I-O from Old McDonald Had a Farm...it is something we all sing back and forth to each other.  Just the ee-i-ee-i-o part...so when she started she looked to me to take my turn at it.  So, I did...only I sung the ee-i-ee-i part in a normal or slightly high voice...then I would lower the tone of my voice and say (almost shout) it while getting her belly.  She laughed so hard and had me do it over and over...she honestly had tears rolling down the side of her face from laughing so hard.I have never seen a child that young have tears of laughter, and I know I say this all the time but I have never seen a kid of any age just look for something to laugh at as much as she does.  She has been that way from so young."},

She loves her monkey and some of her other toys and will pick them up and give them hugs...and brings them to us for us to hug them, too.She can spend a lot of time in her box!  She loves to play peek-a-boo while in it.  And she really loves it if she sees their cat, Diesel, get in the box.  She goes in with him, but he won't stay there.I know I am her grandma and a little bit prejudiced, but I cannot believe how smart she is.  They have a gate up between the living room and dining room...it is one that actually swings back and forth like an actual gate...not one you have to put up and down.  She actually knows what part of it stops it from swing from one side to the other, just hasn't quite figured out how to get past it.  I bet if she could see the top of it, that she could figure it out."},

I wanted to go for one reason, but didn't want to because on the drive down there, there is just no opportunity to stop and take pictures.  It is a fairly busy road with no place to pull over.So, we were past Terre Haute, but not to Spencer, and came to a major 4-way stop....I asked Roger did he mind taking a different route...so we head south still on a major road for a ways.  Then we started through the country.  Though I still didn't take a lot of photos, we sure seen some beautiful places.  Places I want to go back to, preferably in the fall...I think the ridges and rolling hills would really be beautiful.However, I seen this sign...it isn't beautiful or anything.  I have no idea what it means, but I thought it funny....and would love to know the story behind it.*****************We had little Miss Busy Body with us all day yesterday...when she is here she just stays busy.  When we got her in the house, we could not get her out of the car seat quick enough to please her....she was straining at the straps.  I told her mom, when she is standing by something such as an end table or whatever...if you watch her feet, one of them is constantly feeling for something to climb up on.  I bet she will be able to climb trees by the age of two...well, maybe not that young.  But she will want to."},

I feel sure they have at least fallen to the ground.  Even though we have had a lot of melting, we still have snow on the ground.  We had snow flurries this evening, and we are supposed to have snow showers tomorrow. I have seen buzzards, but I am still watching for my first robin.  I think I usually see the first ones in February.  My lilac continues to have big buds, and somewhere we were I really noticed a big tree starting to get lots of buds.  I suppose it is the number of daylight hours plus sunshine that triggers the growth.Meanwhile, I will try to wait patiently for spring to appear."},
{"title": "A road not taken", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "text": "This is not the road we followed today, however I thought I would show it to you.  I like the gentle curve and the feeling of expectation of wondering what is to come...What we did do was run...almost all day long.  I had a couple things due at the library in Terre Haute so we headed that way this morn, but first went by the bookstore.  I picked up a couple books for Lorelei, then on to the library.  Even though I didn't need to get anything, I still found 3 or 4 books I could not resist checking out. From there we went and seen Ms. Hollywood....she was sitting in her mom's lap when we got there, but she got up to look at her new book.  Sarah said she had been laying in bed one morning saying 'cat' or 'kitty cat' over and over.  She did take a nap while we were there...then got up and played in her big box and with her phone.  Her box is just a cardboard box and she really likes it....I can remember our girls sometimes liking the box something came in more than they did the toy.She would take her phone over to her mom or to her Papaw and have them talk on it, then they would give it back to her and tell her someone wanted to talk to her.  She would hold it to her ear, and pretend to talk.  It was so funny and cute.  Just so you know, her mom liked to talk to her grandma when she was about 2 years old...so Lorelei promises to be a chip off the old block.Other than that, I have been settled in watching the Olympics...tonight has probably been my favorite night except for the snowboarding.  The free skate in the dance is just finishing up, with more to come of the freestyle skiing qualifications later on.  So, I think I will publish this and settle down to watch the rest."},

I suppose Lorelei will never know her name, or else answer to any and everything cause we have so many names for her.On to why I haven't been blogging the past day or two....I have finally finished the quilting on this...I would love to know the hours I have spent, as well as how many yards of thread.  I bet it is close to a thousand yards counting top and bottom thread.  I know I spent at least 4 hours yesterday, another hour today....and I just had a little bit left to do today.  I only had to take a out a few stitches a couple times...so time was not wasted on redoing stitching.I have listened to 7 CDs of an audio book while doing it and each one is approx 75 minutes long, plus I have watched TV some of the time.I still have to make the binding...making a decision on what to use will be the first hurtle.  The cutting and stitching the lengths of fabric together, then folding lengthwise and pressing in half will take a bit of time, but not much compared to actually doing the binding.  First, I will sew it around the perimeter of the quilt with the sewing machine...not such a long job.  But, then I fold it to the back and stitch it down by hand.  That will take a lot of hours.  But I do enjoy it...I watch TV and just stitch away.It is not perfect, but hopefully it will be finished one of these days.***********On the subject of snow, we only got a little bit of frozen ice Friday night, and it did not last.  A lot of snow melted yesterday, and today it has rained lightly all day long.  More snow is gone...while our neighbors yard is almost bare of snow, ours still has inches on it.  From the drifting, I suppose.  It is 40º as I type this;  if it stays this warm the rest should be gone soon.**********HELP!!!!!I have a question for everyone.  I love the pop-up window comment form, I use it on mine, but the other day all of a sudden whenever I clicked to comment on a blog, including my own that had the pop-up window type of comment form, it pops up but as a whole new window!   I have not changed anything that I am aware of.  I have been looking on the settings trying to find a way to change it, but not finding anything.It does not do it when I use Explorer, so I am wondering is it a blogger/Firefox issue.  Other sites that have pop-up windows are not effected while using Firefox.  This makes me think it isn't Firefox, which I had first thought.  Is there something I am missing???"},
{"title": "A Lorelei report", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "text": "This photo is from day before yesterday....Since I was MIA  yesterday as far as blogging goes, I thought I would share the reason why.  We went and got the Lorelei yesterday morn and kept her till her daddy got off work at 5:00.  I did do a load of clothes while she was here, but basically chased after her all day long.One of the first things she did when she got here was to go give her Mickey Mouse plush rocker a hug.  She doesn't like to sit on him, but she likes him.  She will go and turn him around and hold him by his ears up to her face...or she will sit right in front of him and just look at his eyes and nose.  Sometimes she tries to hang stuff on his nose.  Others she pushes him around by his rockers.She loves it when one the cats comes up to the window on the other side and wants in...she gets right in the window and jabbers.  If she is doing something else and we see one come up to the window, we can say Lorelei, look at the cat in the window.  She gets to that window as quickly as she can.She does not like to give up and take a nap, so later in the afternoon she had just been yawning, and yawning.  She got her little plastic turtle out of her toys and was walking around chewing on it.  She stumbled over one of her other toys and fell...she just rolled over on her back and kept laying there, chewing on the turtle and looking around.  I thought sure she would fall asleep like that, but she only laid there about 10-15 minutes, looking all around, and up she got.Not long after that she went to sleep in my lap and slept for about an hour and 20 minutes.  When she woke up, she didn't know whether to be happy or to cry...just kind of grumpy.  Then I said the magic words:  \"Look at Bubbie in Papaw's chair!\"  Her eyes lit up and she wanted down, went over and started jabbering to him and just smiling.  She didn't pet him...just talked to him.  And he just looked at her.I have a feeling she is going to be the best friend those cats ever have...they just don't know it yet.  And I told Roger a while back, I don't think I have ever seen a child that doesn't like cats.  And dogs, too, for that matter."},

There was quite a bit of figure skating, so my eyes were on it.  Though I must say, I don't have a favorite skater and I miss that feeling of really cheering for someone.

We were not even a mile from the main road till he spotted this fellow!I had mixed emotions...I couldn't believe my eyes even though I had seen one adult and one juvenile not too far from this location a couple or three years ago.  This is the first one we/I have seen in that area since then.  Someone told us they had a nest somewhere close there but they didn't know just where.I cannot believe they are actually there!  In my childhood, I could only dream of seeing one.  I don't know when they came to Indiana.  One of the local power plants has an eagle viewing weekend every year, and I have yet to attend it.  We have seen an eagle or two up in that area also.*******I wanted to get Lorelei a drum for her birthday...but could not find one that sounded good...except these bongos.  Well, there was one that didn't sound bad that was for kids, but it had this lip of metal that I could just see her falling on, and it would really have hurt...maybe causing a cut  if she fell hard enough.So we seen these, no sharp edges, they make good sound...so we got them.

She did not like it one bit.There were several other little kids there....one that is Jackson's age, (born this past Dec.), one nine months old, another one I am not sure of, but younger than Lorelei,  and then there were at least 4 others there, one soon to be 2 years old and the other  were in the 2-3 yrs of age category. Sarah's best friend's son is the one soon to be 2 yrs. old, and he gave Lorelei a kiss...someone asked Lorelei if that was her first kiss, and his mom said, Oh, no, no, no--he has been kissing her a long time.

Here she was playing with some of her toys and watching something...but she did not stay still long.She was from one thing to another...first the cats.  Except if Bubbie is sleeping, he doesn't pay her any mind so she gets bored.  But let Mama Cat or Puss Puss walk through and she is right after them.If not them, she likes to go in the kitchen...she will walk all around in there, then come to one of us and want to be lifted up till she can see the magnets on the fridge, cat magnets to be specific.She also stops and plays with my old churn part of the time...when she first discovered it, she could not pass it by but now she just occasionally goes to it.  Oh, she also liked to stand and look out the back storm door...especially if there was a cat or Shelby on the other side.She will now show us her feet if we ask where her feet are, she gives high fives, and today I ask her where her belly button was.  She immediately pulled her shirt up and showed me.

He weighed 15 lb 1oz a few days ago and is now 24 inches long.  He is growing like a weed...He is always in a good mood and takes plenty of naps.  You can just tell by the photo above that he is a pleasant little fellow to be around.  He is will sure be a fisherman and hunter with my brother as his grandpa...well, the fishing comes from his mommy and mamaw, too, but I am not sure if his dad likes to fish or not.  Truth to tell, I think almost my whole family likes to fish...I feel like our families have been blessed beyond measure with Lorelei and Jackson.  I knew I would love her, but I did not comprehend how just thinking of her could make me smile, and sometimes laugh out loud...anywhere, any time.  I think I can say the same thing about Jackson's mamaw....***************I am getting ready for my little toot toot to come tomorrow...Sarah says she was on the go constantly today.  So I have been trying to get anything put up that she might get into.  I cannot do anything with the cats though, and Sarah said she was after Diesel cat all day long today.

{"title": "Thinking on things that make me happy...", "date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "text": "I read this post earlier.   It got me started thinking of all the things that make life pleasant.  Of how it isn't the things money buys, although it can help. But honestly, there are things that have no price.  I even think I did a post similiar to this last year...but it really does a body good to dwell on the pleasant things in life.  So I am doing it anyway.   And since family and friends are on everyone's list, I will assume that you know they would be at the top of my list.  How could you not with all the times I post Lorelei....Even though I have had time to think this through, I haven't.  So here is my list off the top of my head...I'm attempting to do a list of ten.1.  I love the way evening light hits things...there is a glow about it that can not be reproduced.  It  makes even the most boring subject beautiful.2. I love the feeling I get when I finish a quilt.  (How boring is that?) I can't help it...it is such a feeling of accomplishment..3.  I love the big puffy clouds that are dark with a silver lining...it takes me back to younger days.  One of my very best friends in life and I always loved them and we always quoted the lines,Be still, sad heart, and cease repiningBehind the clouds is the sun still shining.....So any time I see that type of clouds it immediately transports me back in time.4. I love finding new music that I love.  And it is even better if a song mentions Tennessee.5.  There is nothing finer in life than to be able to sit outside in the swing and have a cup of coffee, and have breakfast out there.  Or to just sit outside with Lorelei.6.  Finding ginseng.    I just like to see it growing.  I hunted it as a kid, to sell, to help buy school clothes.  So any time I am in woods, I look for it.  But I very seldom dig any...I just like to see it grow.  At one time I had some growing in my yard...actually in a corner by the porch.  A dog dug it up, and no I didn't get mad at her.  She was a collie that had been abused...not mine, but she stayed with me here if I was home.7.   Seeing cats curled asleep ...there is just something so pleasing about that.8.  I love have a cake or brownies, still warm from the oven....with butter!9.  Wrens make me happy.  Just their big happy song from such a little body.  Who can resist them?10. Finding a new author is always a joy.  Or a new book by one of my favorite authors!11.  I cannot leave out smells...the smell of wood smoke, the smell of new mown hay, how it smells so fresh and new after a rain...and there are more...but need to finish...I am sure once I publish this I will think of half a dozen things I wish I had thought of.  But it is late, so I am going to click 'publish' and be done with it.edited to add:BTW,  Betsy just gave me a new name...and Fishing Guy followed suit...but that is okay.  I like Ruth just as well as I do Rose.  haha"},

{"title": "Progress in two areas...", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2010", "text": "After a bit more fiddling with my machine this morn, I actually started quilting in the afternoon.  I am a bit disappointed in myself because I am just meandering, and not actually trying anything new.  I have no one to blame but myself...I should have had a warm up quilt to start on.  It takes a bit to get used to handling all that material under that arm of the sewing machine. I am trying to become proficient at free-motion quilting.  For those that don't know what that is let me explain.  Normally, the feed dogs are up and the pressure foot has pressure, when you put the fabric under the pressure foot and put the pressure foot down, the material is pressed against the feed dogs.  When sewing, the feed dogs pull the fabric through at a precise rate.In free-motion quilting, FMQ, the feed dogs are dropped or in some cases where machines don't have that capability, they are covered up.  And the pressure of the pressure foot is reduced, and for some machines/some people the stitch length is set to zero, and a hoping foot or darning foot such as the one shown above is put on the machine to take the place of the regular pressure foot.There are stitch regulators/speed controls that can be bought.  The stitch regulator will keep your stitch length consistent no matter what what speed is sewn.  The speed control is just that...keeps the speed of the needle the same consistent speed and then all left to the operator is just keep his on speed consistent.I don't have either of these...so it is all left to me.  I have to try to keep my speed and my motions in sync to keep a consistent stitch length. I have not mastered that yet....but so long as they are not toenail catchers, I am happy.  When the quilt is washed, they more than likely will not show up.If you enlarge the photo of the quilt above, it appears that I have used a dark bobbin thread but I haven't.  I had to use a large jeans needle and it leaves holes in some of the cheaper fabric;  again I think once it is washed they will close and not be noticeable.*****************  Someone ask me if I had any recent photos of Mama Squirrel, so I got the camera out this weekend and tried to snap a photo or two.  She was slightly jumpy and this was the best I could do.  When I turned around to go in the house, there was Puss Puss, so no wonder she was slightly agitated.But to the progress in that area, at least I hope it is progress.  For a little while now, I sometimes try to pet her....not with just my finger as she gets food out of my hand.  I try to rub her back...she always moves back about 18 inches or a couple feet....she never runs completely away.  Well, this weekend, I waited till she had a nut and was eating it and I just placed my hand on her back and left it a few seconds...then I start to pet her.  I got a couple little strokes in and she hopped down to a different level, but was right back up.  Maybe one of these days she will realize how good it feels to have her back scratched!"},
{"title": "Original Cougar, geese, and strip pits...stated randomly", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2010", "text": "I often do posts from the strip pit area...this one among them.  But in the end, there is a more intimate tale involved this time.  First off, we drove around out there last night till the sun was setting...the first thing we noticed were the geese...they are back in larger numbers.  The sound was incredible.  I wondered aloud if I lived close, would I get tired of their incessant honking.Even if you click and enlarge the above photo, it appears compressed.  It just does not show how big the strip pit is, nor can you get the full impact of how many geese are there.Below, is an image from google earth that shows the area out there.  The strip pit above is marked...it is in the upper left-hand corner of the image.  BTW, it is in Illinois. I really hope you will click on it at least...one of these days I am going to think and see how long that strip pit is by hitting the odometer on the vehicle I am in.  I am pretty sure it is at least half a mile long, and probably longer.  Just east of the strip pit is the road we take about half of the time to enter the area.We have been going out there for years, though originally, it was being mined so we only drove through it every now and then. If you will look in the lower righ-hand corner, I have a strip pit marked as where we got our original cat named Cougar.  Before the mining stopped, we could get permits to fish that strip pit.... I have spent more happy hours fishing there than any place else on earth.  I never once got to stay as long as I wanted to stay.Anyway, that is one long strip pit...it doesn't show  it here so much, but it was big and it was deep.  Where the arrow is pointing, there was a pump house close to there.  The part of the strip pit to the east of the arrow is where I fished the most....but I did fish on south also.  Right where the arrow is was just a narrow strip of water leading from one part of the strip pit into the other.  A boat could go through, but it would have been close for two boats to pass each other, though I am not sure they could have.Anyway, one evening we were out there fishing and kept hearing this sound.  Over and over.  Right there where that arrow is.  Well, we fished for quite a while, and before we left, for my sake Roger went across to find out what was over there.  I think he could wade most of it chest deep, but had to swim a few strokes...Anyway, he got over there and found it....a little tabby cat.  Its voice was so hoarse from meowing so much.  As he held it above the cattails for me to see, he said, \"Do you want it?\"  Dumb question...I had never seen a cat I didn't want.  Just some I didn't need.Anyway, so the kitty went home with us, to become Cougar Lee.   He was literally on the point of starvation...I have only seen one other animal in my life as bad off as he was.  You could see almost every bone in his body.  His backbone was just so prominent... And he was SO sick....congestion and his little eyes all matted.There was never any doubt that he was my kitty...from day one.  It was a weekend so no going to the vet....and besides that I don't know if we went right away or if we waited a few days.  I do know that right away, I made warm salty water and wrung a washrag out in it and would wash his eyes 3 or 4 times a day.  Salt water will do miracles for some things...and it did help.But his cold/congestion was another story.  I don't know how many times he was to the vet to get rid of it.  It was over a period of a few weeks, and at one time he and I were on the same antibiotic....only his was just once a day and not as strong as mine.  It was this antibiotic, ampicillin that finally cleared his congestion.Cougar was sure an original...when he was little, if I was standing washing dishes or doing something in the kitchen, he would climb up my jeans to my waist and just hang there till I got to the point where I could stop and hold him a few minutes.  He slept with us/me, at first he laid across my forehead and I wondered how in the world was I ever going to get used to that.You would not believe how quickly I became accustomed to it, I would have to feel my head to see if he was there or not.  As he got older, he gradually stopped doing that very much, but graduated to curling himself around my head, or somehow till his one paw would be across my neck.  Honest to goodness.  He had to be touching me.What is so funny, he jumped on Roger when Roger was asleep and it startled Roger and made him really mad at Cougar.  From that time on, Cougar never, ever touched Roger unless Roger was awake.  He would sniff towards Roger and somehow or other could tell if Roger was awake.  If Roger was awake, he would put a paw out and touch him.As Cougar got older, he was neutered, of course.  He loved to spend time outside in the summer...we always thought when he laid in the garden under the tomato plants, that he thought himself in the jungle.  He was not much of a hunter...which was fine by me.  He loved all of us, and was never afraid of strangers, but I was always his favorite.  He could be sitting with anyone else, and all I had to do was say his name and he would come to me.Cougar was the smartest cat I have ever known...though I am trying to think of examples and having a hard time.  He did know his name...if he was out in the yard...all we had to do was open the door and call his name and he came.  He knew what the word 'no' meant, also knew what we meant if we said 'get down.'  I also think he showed how smart he was by not bothering Roger when Roger was asleep.He loved tomatoes or things cooked with tomatoes.  If we had spaghetti, he literally came running.  He always got a bite or two of it.  He really didn't want much, but had to have a taste or if we had a pizza, he had to have a bite.  If I cut a tomato in half and left it laying, he would lick the whole inside of it out.  Even if it was a medium sized tomato.If I was sick and sleeping on the couch, he watched over me...he would sleep on the back and talk to me if I was awake.  Oh, that is the other thing.  He would really try to carry on a conversation.  Not the constant meowing that some cats do, but an exchange.  We could say something and he would say something back...with what we called a meow-purr.  Not loud and disturbing, more like, hey, what are you doing. And he would stop and wait for our reply.He also was a guard cat...did not like other cats or dogs in our yard.  Even though he was neutered, he would fight any cat that came in the yard.  Yet if the kids brought one home, he wasn't jealous.  And luckily, all the dogs he chased out were so surprised to have a cat come after them, that they ran.During the last years of his life, he started to sleep under the cover...always against my side with his head resting over my arm.  And always between us...never on the outside edge.A couple times he almost died.  One night he was fine, begging for hamburger. The next morn, I happened to be up and about to leave for work and went downstairs for something.  Cougar was sitting down there...he never sits down there.  Just never. I could tell he was dieing.I called the vet, and got him in that evening.  We never really knew what happened to him...the vet kept him a couple days and did find that he had inflammation but could not find what was causing it.  He gave him a vitamin B shot, and that did the trick.  That was the strangest thing...he was perfectly fine the night before and I am positive if I had not taken him to the vet the next day, he would have died.  No doubt in my mind.And we had a repeat of that episode the following spring.  Went through basically the same scenario.  Again, the vitamin B shot brought him out of it.During the last few months of his life, he lost weight...and he never had any weight to lose.  We always assumed it was from being almost starved to death in his youth.  Cougar just stayed a long, lanky cat.  So, with losing the weight, he really was skin and bones.  I had him to the vet, and it was just basically old age.I knew I needed to make the decision, but could not do it till one morn, I heard him hit the floor.  I will not go into details, I will just say I promised him then he would not have to go through any more.  When the vet opened, I called and made arrangements to take him to be put down once Roger got home from work....I dug his grave in the garden so he could have his final sleep where he had spent so many enjoyable hours.For two or three years, I did not even want to pet a cat...just didn't even want to look at one really.  His spirit stayed with us.  In the two or three years between losing him and getting the kitties we have now, Roger and I both felt him.  There were a couple times we both, at the same time, felt him jump up in bed with us, and we both moved apart and started to raise the cover for him to go under.  This was not right after he died, but months later.Another time I had one of those colds where I coughed and coughed and coughed, so was trying to sleep sitting up on the couch...Cougar was there with me.  I heard him talking...and looked to talk to him before I thought.  Even after I realized, I kept hearing him.His spirit doesn't visit us any more, not since we got the cats we have.  Except my new Cougar loves tomatoes...does anyone else have a cat that likes tomatoes?  I have never heard of it before...so I think it sort of strange that I have had two that likes them.edited to add:  I wanted to add that Cougar, the original, lived to be approximately 17 yrs. oldI still have not started my quilting, though I do have my machine ready....I think I am just going to have to start and see what develops.  I wish for once I could decide how I want to quilt something before I start.Before I start free motion quilting, I always do a test on a small quilt sandwich....luckily I still had this from before.  I have to make sure that the tension is right and which size needle I want to use.  So far, it really doesn't take much to get the Juki ready to quilt.  I got it ready Thursday night....I had plans to just get up and start Friday.  Instead I had a phone call from a friend that I had not talked to in several months.  We talked at least two hours.Did I say the snow started yesterday morn--but it was so wet and I suppose warm, that it didn't start sticking till later in the day.   Roger was working in his shop, and I was looking at quilting on the computer....I finally made up my mind that maybe I just needed to get out.  This is what our little town looked like as we left....and this is what it was like out.  This road...I bet I have driven up and down it about a million times....maybe not quite that many.  But it is the road I took to work.  I will be posting another picture from it on Time Stand Still....one that I like even better.*********************Lorelei was here Thursday.  She is walking more and more...and just busy.  Usually she will sit and play with her toys, but Thursday she was just from here to there.  Every day it crosses my mind that I cannot believe she will be a year old Tuesday!  Sarah is having her party next weekend.  We are both wondering how she will react to so many people in her house....and we are both hoping she doesn't turn all shy.Sarah said every time Lorelei hears her dad come in, she does her yell of \"DA-da!!\"  She also said one of Jeremy's friends stopped by and Lorelei had him totally entertained.   I guess she was laughing so hard at Diesel their cat...and you know how contagious her laughter is."},
{"title": "Strip pit report", "date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "text": "I have not been to the strip pits near as much as last year...BL (before Lorelei), but we are still either through there or by there enough to get an idea of the geese situation.  These were taken a few days back, but I passed through there today and there are not even as many as there were then. Look at the the two top  pictures, then click here to see what this strip pit featured last year.  I don't know what happened this year, but I have never seen so few geese out in that area.  The area I am talking about includes these strip pits and just a few miles over in the Illinois farmland.  In previous years, the sky would be just filled with the geese.  Even though I seen it every year, I was always amazed.  This year, I have wondered over and over what happened.I see the Northern Harriers every time I am out there, and I did see some owls at the beginning of winter but have not seen them lately.  Again, I have not been out there as much so probably not been there at the right time.*************************If nothing happens Sarah and Lorelei are coming tomorrow...I will probably have new Lorelei tales to tell, so bare with me. I have did nothing more with my quilt.  My hips didn't hurt today, but my knees feel stiff.  And I have other aches and pains that I have never had before, but I know what I did to cause them.  The only thing, I don't think I could have did anything different.  Anyway, with Sarah coming tomorrow, I probably won't do any quilting. Hopefully I will get started sometime this week.  I did check and I have thread that I can use.   I did get the lent cleaned out of my machine, which is not a big job.  I keep it pretty clean all the time.    I am looking forward to doing the quilting...somehow or other, I just want to do my quilts from start to finish.  If I had a close friend that helped me or a daughter or if my mom were alive, that would be okay. I don't really get all that many finished, and almost anything I have ever made has been given away once it is finished.  You could almost say I am one of those people that are all talk...."},
{"title": "Lorelei definitely thinks kitty cats are funny!", "date": "Tuesday, February 2, 2010", "text": "I just have to post this new little video of Lorelei...Sarah sent it to me this morn;  I have watched it several times and it always makes me laugh.  she is such a hoot.  From this and the video I posted the other day, I can definitely say she thinks cats are funny....   hope you enjoy this as much as I did.We went down to see her and Sarah yesterday, and we all went out for breakfast.  Lorelei entertained everyone around her and enjoyed it all.  She first started playing peek-a-boo with the couple behind us...they had 11 grandchildren of their own.  When they left, Lorelei watched them as far as she could see them.Isn't it amazing how babies just form a bridge to make friendships on...Anyway, the hostess came by to see her two or three times.  I forget how many grandchildren she had but they were all boys.  And there were a couple men seated across from us and she was having a good time with them.I Did It!  I actually got the quilt ready to take to the sewing machine to quilt.  I may be too stiff to even move tomorrow after all the crawling around on the floor that I did.  I took ibuprofen trying to ward it off and will take another dose before I go to bed.In the photo above, you can get an idea of how many pins I used...I didn't place them as close as i normally do so am hoping I don't regret it.  And I used a kind of cotton batting I have never used before and though I think it would be a dream to hand quilt through, I was not real happy with it in other ways.  The edges kind of wanted to ruffle...and I could not actually stretch it across the floor...I just had to smooth it the best I could.  But I will withhold final judgement till I am done quilting it and have washed and dried it.Just thought I would show a bigger area of it here.  I have not decided how I am going to quilt it yet.  When I made this top, started with no plans.  I started making the little 4-patches.  From there it grew.   I decided to use the 4-patches as the corners of 9-patches...and then went from there.  Not even deciding how big I wanted to make the quilt till I started sewing it together.Well, I had a few blocks left over when the top above was as big as I wanted it...so I put those leftover blocks together and made the little quilt seen here.  If you go and look at it, be sure and click on the photos to enlarge them and get the full effect.  I don't remember the exact finished size...I think it was about 60 inches long...maybe a little longer.  I sent it as a surprise to a friend in Pennsylvania.I have an appointment right before lunch tomorrow...and then I have plans....I have decided this is the quilt top I am going to quilt.  It has been waiting for quite a while...but not near as long as some I have.  I made it about three years ago, and had plans to machine quilt it.  Then life got in the way, things happened and I hardly touched my sewing machines, or sewing of any kind for the past two or three years.  Except to make baby quilts.Tonight I rearranged Lorelei's room till I could spread everything out and get it pin basted.  This is a big quilt, approximately 90 inches square so it takes a big area.  First I spread the backing out, right side down.  I use t-pins and stretch it out on the carpet.  This is time consuming...do one on one side, then go straight across to the opposite side and do another.  Next, do one on the other two sides.  From there, I place one about every 12-18 inches.Then I spread the batting on top of that and smooth it out.  I use a few T-pins but not near as many as I use on the backing.  Before  I use the batting I will throw it in the dryer on the Air setting for a few minutes to get it to relax.Next I spread the top out and smooth it...and then go about using the T-pins to keep the top stretched out.  Then comes the real time consuming part...I use the bent safety pins and pin the three layers together about every six inches.  (You can't do this if you have looped carpet...I have enough trouble doing it on regular carpet..)(This is only a small fraction of the pins I use.)That is my plans...now if I can just follow through.  The past few days, I have been trying to decide which quilt top to quilt...I had planned to do the top I just finished but thought I should do this one if I am going to work on one.  It will take a while to quilt, even if I am machine quilting it.  And I will have to make the binding...so don't expect me to show you the finished product any time soon."},

(Betsy, maybe that is a new 'up' to add to your list.)  Anyway, that bud a promise that spring does follow winter...and today with the sunshine its been believable.  I took this yesterday along with some others, but I liked seeing both in one photo.We did head south today...I didn't know where we were headed when I left the house but we decided to go south.  I was hoping that if we went south we might get into some snow, but no, it was sunny all the way.  We went at least an hour south of Terre Haute...so I am assuming no one in Indiana got any.  I have not taken time to check out Mary's blog...I will do that later.  If I had known we were going to head south, I would have gotten on line and checked out the weather.I shouldn't have left.  I will tell you about a little mystery I have had.One day last week, I went down in the basement early in the morn...I don't remember why.  Now our basement is not finished...it isn't as bad as some I have seen.  It could be better though.  Anyway, I get down there and there is this small puddle of water in the floor...and I could not tell where it came from.  I had been down the night before after midnight, I had not run the dishwasher, the washer or the dryer, nor anything.Nothing happened for a few days, then I was back down there yesterday and there was a bigger puddle of water.  I looked and looked and could not see anything wet.  This time Roger went down and looked.  We have a humidifier that we added to the furnace...water runs through a filter each time the furnace runs.  The part of the water that isn't used drains into a bucket in which we have a pump, and the pump pumps it over into the sink.  So Roger thought something on the pump had gotten stuck, so he worked on it a bit.  We thought that did it.I went down this morn, and there was another big puddle.    Roger came and looked and the furnace happened to kick on, and something about the humidifier was leaking.  He turned off the water to it, and then that valve wanted to leak.  To make a long story short, he thought he had it fixed again...but changed the bucket he had the water draining in.We left shortly after that, and was gone a till about 4:00, came in and I fooled around a bit.  Checking email, and snail mail, fixing a bite to eat, etc.  Then, I thought I better go check the basement and guess what?  Another puddle!  I realized then that I had not really felt satisfied with it when we left.  We cleaned it up again, and Roger worked on the valve again.I didn't think it was the valve because I stood down there and watched and watched before I even told him about it.  So, came up and waited a while again....down the stairs I go.  Still a puddle!    This time he thought and filled the bucket with water that the pump is in...when he kicked it on, it had this tiny leak that showed up.I went back down there a few minutes ago and it is actually dry.  He will have to work on the humidifier because I  am getting shocked every time I touch anything, or any time I got to pet the cats.  For now I feel like the puzzle is solved...with all the time spent down there it better be.  If I am spending time down there, I had rather spend it sewing.I will leave you with a little video of Lorelei...I first thought I wouldn't because it is so dark on one of our computers...but thought again and thought I might as well.  If you can see it, it will get a chuckle.  I have watched it numerous times and get so tickled at her."},
{"title": "A visitor", "date": "Friday, January 29, 2010", "text": "We had the pleasure of having our little darling come for a visit yesterday!  She gets so excited when she sees us.  Who would have thought anyone our age could give such joy to a kid.  She just about jumps out of her car seat to get to us.She is doing the blast-off thing from Sid the Science kid in the photo above...we just say blast-off and she raises her arms up.   Or sometimes she will raise them and go 'ta-daaa!'  Sarah said the other night Jeremy came in, I don't remember if it was from work or from going and doing something else.  Anyway, Lorelei heard him and yelled 'DA-Da!'She yells 'Cat'when she sees the cats for the first time or if one appears unexpectedly.  She gets excited over them and wants to follow them.  It is more the excitement of the chase than it is to actually pet them.  Bubbie laid on the couch the entire time she was here and she might look, touch him for a couple minutes, then she would go back to playing with her toys or with us.  Yet let one of the others walk through, and she was after them in a flash.*************It is down to 13º as I type this.  Tennessee is supposed to get hit with a pretty good snow storm, but we are only supposed to get an inch at the most from it....more as you go south.  I don't know if I am happy or sad with that.  I really would like to have one more good snow at least...so I suppose I will be wishing we were getting it.Not sure what I am going to do today...nothing has to be done.  We had sunshine yesterday!  If I thought it was going to be sunny most of the day, I would suggest a road trip.  But Roger may have other things in mind."},

I put on my winter boots and old work coat....it is a generic Carhartt...grabbed camera bag and went with him.  I even went in with him to pick up the prescription...pretty sight that I was.You have to understand that my coat is stained from work, and the pockets are crammed full of stuff.  Who cares...it keeps me warm and if something happens to it it is not hard to replace.   My good coat, I very seldom wear.  For one thing I very seldom wear a real coat, I much prefer a jacket.  I searched for ages for that 'good' coat, only leave it in the closet.  But I have it if I actually need it.I had just planned to go through the strip pits to check on the wildlife.  I will report on that another day.  I didn't get a single good shot of anything there, so we headed up the highway.  Betsy had told me to take pictures of the snow.  When I had went to bed the night before there was at least an inch on everything, but by the time I got up the wind had blown it every which way and there appeared to be just a skim.However, Roger spotted the view in the top picture....I like it.  And the bottom shows how the snow was being blown about.  I think either photo is better appreciated if enlarged.It is still cold this morn, but supposed to make it into the thirties before he day is over.  I will believe it when I see it.  The boys just went outside....I cannot believe they have not wanted back in.  Last night Bubbie would want outside and be wanting back inside in about 10 minutes.   Mama Cat does not even want outside any more.  She finally got brave and went outside a bit Sunday, for the first time in ages.During the last cold spell, she started out trying to go out only to turn around and rush back inside before the door was closed.  She finally gave up trying and would turn around and run if she was looking out the storm door and one of us opened it.  It was as if she thought we would force her to go.  She is only 3 or 4 years old and seems like such an old cat.Right now I am going to post this, and head over to my other blog.  I have to decide what to post there."},

I don't care what she is doing, you can usually get her attention if you get a book.  As of right now, they are planning to come up tomorrow.  Even though I just saw her yesterday, I will be so glad to see her.  She is a ray of sunshine in our life.Yesterday Sarah was changing her, and I was there trying to keep her entertained.  I need not have worried.  She got started with her foot...she would hold it up right in front of her face and just wiggle it all around and talk to it.  Then she would lick her toe...then hold it back out.  I honestly think she was having a pretend conversation with it.  Sarah and I both had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard....or I think she did.  I know I did.As for today, it has snowed all day long, but yesterday was so warm that the snow melted for the longest time. Yesterday was in the 50's and we had lots of sunshine here...my brother lives an hour or so east of us and he said they only had 10-15 minutes of sun. It is down in the 20's and windy, but still not the freezing cold that we just got throughThe birds just flocked to the feeders all day long...I think I counted 17 starlings out there at once.  Tons of sparrows and juncos were here, along with a couple cardinals.  And the squirrels came this morn.  So everything should be full tonight, but I am sure they will be here tomorrow.I made the cats stay in today till the wild things could eat in peace.  The cats weren't too happy, but they don't really need to be out anyway.  They sit and look out the window and dream of what they would do if they were allowed outside.  Except my boy...he has laid and slept most of the day.  A couple of times he wanted outside, but for the most part he has snoozed the day away."},

It is just out in the country....it feels like it is miles from anywhere, but it really isn't too far to Paris, Illinois.  It is a Catholic church...I took a picture at another time that told the date of when it was built but now I have searched and searched and cannot find the photo.Someday I want to be over there at the right time to get either a sunset or a sunrise in the background.  I am always just a little late for a sunset.***************We went to see Lorelei yesterday....she is just such a funny little girl.  Busy all the time, but doesn't have to have someone entertaining her.  She can sit and play and play with her toys.  Right now she is the sunshine of our days.  She laughs so easily and it is contagious to be around."},

It is so like Bubbie...he comes to bed of the morn, and jumps up, and for the longest time, he always jumped up on me.  He will walk, sometimes jump from me to Roger or Roger to me.  It is against the rules to step on the bed.  He gives this little meow, just about like the meow on this.  Only, it isn't so much that he is hungry...he just wants one of us to be awake and maybe get up and move around.  If we make room for him, he will snuggle into one of us and stay there if one of us pets him.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy it...now for the business at hand.MB, over at Small City Scenes of Stanwood was tagged to do this meme that was Eight lists of Eight categories....she didn't tag anyone but invited anyone that wanted to, to do it.

I love reading this type of meme.***********I got the above almost ready last night late.  I did finish my quilt top.  Now to the business of finding what I want to use for a backing.  I like wild backs, but Roger thought I should use a plain one.  I think I will have to rummage around in my fabric to see what I have.Roger wanted to get out of the house today, so we went over to Arthur, Illinois.  I didn't take but a half a dozen or so photos.  It was foggy, and there are very few places to pull totally off the road over there.  And even out on the county roads, there is quite a bit of  traffic.  As an example, we might drive around here on our county roads for 15-20 minutes without passing anyone or having anyone behind us.  Over there, we are very seldom out of the sight of another vehicle.  Even for 5 minutes.No sewing done today..."},
{"title": "Sewing", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010", "text": "I spent a big part of the day sewing...the time flies once I start.  I listen to audio books part of the time...most of the time in fact.  I have spent a lot of happy hours with the pedal to the medal so to speak. There are so many tools for quilting now that my mom never had nor used.  And when I was young, Coats & Clark was the only thread we had heard of.  Now, there are so many to choose from....the ones above are just a sample.  And some of you would probably never believe the price of some of them. For machine quilting, with my Juki machine, Coats and Clark is not the way to go...but it sews fine when I am just sewing.  In machine quilting...at least in free-motion quilting it seems to break often when I use it. I used King Tut thread by Superior threads for the first time on the quilt for Lorelei and for my new nephew's quilt and it was wonderful.  It is the spool second from the right. Anyway, one of these days I want to take pictures of some of the other tools that speed up the process of quilting...or at least the making of the top.  But for now, I need to think about some sleep."},
{"title": "Through the fog", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "text": "One thing about Indiana is the weather is always changing.  The past few days it has been foggy of the morn.  Friday when we went up through Attica and on north of there, it was foggy all the way there.  Not bad enough to be dangerous...but always when looking in the distance, everything was in a fog.These were both drive-by shots.  That is the one thing about fog, I do not like to stop if there isn't a real good place to get off the road. Still they are not bad.**************Lorelei was up here today...well, everyone was here.  But she keeps us all entertained.  We consider ourselves so blessed to have been able to have her as much as we did while she was so young.  The minute she sees us she gets this big old smile on her face and she cannot wait to get out of her car seat.   And she jabbers, talks and has so many expressions that she is more fun to watch than TV.And I got to see her take a couple steps to Rachel, our older daughter.  She has been taking steps at home but this was the first time for me to witness it.  It won't be long until she is running around all over the place.  And I do mean run...I have a feeling she is going to be like her mommy.  When Sarah was little, she never just walked anywhere....she either ran, skipped, jumped.  Never just a simple walk.***************My quilt top I am working on is at least half done.  In ways more than half since all the rest of the squares are cut, and I have a whole bunch of the rest of the blocks sewn into pairs, or twosies as we quilters call it when you join two parts.We were almost the only ones in the quilt shop yesterday, so as I was checking out the sales lady asked me if I was headed straight home.  I told her maybe not straight home, that I had my cameras with me and we just sort of wonder the back roads and eventually get home.  So, she started telling me about this place.It was the first school of higher learning in Tippecanoe County....as you can see for yourself if you enlarge the pictures.  The one below is not in sharp focus, but I can still read it with no trouble when enlarge.  There is another view of the Academy at my test blog, From the dirt road.  If you look closely at the picture there you will see a two story home out behind this place.  Imagine only paying a dollar for room and board!  Of course, a dollar was much harder to get back then."},

I love fabric...specifically cotton fabric.   I love my clothes to be cotton, but I love cotton fabric for quilting just as much.  And I really love some of all kinds of cotton....the bright colored fabric, the batiks, stripes, plaids, etc.  I love, love, love batiks and have quite a collection going as shown here....and that was long ago.  I probably have almost double this now.For a long time now I have had my eyes on the Civil War /Reproduction fabrics....I always look at them but have restrained myself from starting to collect them.  Today I finally gave in and started...I just love the old timey look of them.  I will have to collect a few more before I start anything.  I would also like to finish a few things I have started.I did finally start sewing my fabric squares together yesterday evening...and I did a few more this evening.  Hopefully I will get more done this weekend, but we will probably be watching football most of tomorrow evening and night.  The Saints play in the evening, and the Colts play tomorrow night.We watch the Saints because Drew Brees is the quarterback, and he played for Purdue.  And it is sort of obvious why we watch the Colts....but what isn't so obvious to everyone is that P. Manning was the quarterback for University of Tennessee.  I was so thrilled when he signed on with the Colts...it was more than I ever hoped for.It is late and time for me to think about going to bed.  So, got to hurry and post a pic to my other blog.  Good night for now."},

And he ran across this home made birthday card from Sarah.The minute I seen it, I wanted to share it with you.  It makes me laugh just looking at it.   If you enlarge the photos, in the middle of the word 'tell' she punched a bunch of holes with a pin or needle or something.  I have no idea what age she was...it is possible that she was in high school, but I think she was younger.  Yet it is apparent she was giving him money.  So, I don't know.  We almost always went and picked out something for him.  Maybe this is from when she had her paper route.She has always had a great sense of humor.  When she was just little I used to say that she was going to grow up to be a stand-up comedian.Though what I showed you from Sarah is funny, it is still sweet. And I wanted to show you something from Rachel.  I have always loved chickens, mainly roosters.  I have over a hundred of them...and this is a water color Rachel did for me.  I cropped off part of the tail when I scanned it but you can tell what a great one it is.  Again, I am not sure of the age...I don't know why I didn't write it down somewhere.  I am sure she was either in middle school or high school.Both girls are very talented.  They get it from their dad."},

I don't think it will amount to much but the sidewalks have a skim of snow covering them.I took a little drive this evening to see what I could see.  I headed to the strip pit area...the first trip through I seen one Northern Harrier, and some geese in the distance.   (The photo above was from a few days back.)  I went on over into Illinois to see if the geese were over there, but there were fewer today than when my brother was here.  It really makes me wonder what has changed.  Maybe they will come later.On the way back home, I drove through the strip pits again, this time I saw a coyote.  He was moving pretty fast when he spotted me...crossed the road and disappeared into the weeds, etc.  The only thing moving otherwise were crows.*****************I need to make a run to pick up birdseed and sunflower seed...I guess they are birdseed, too.  But I get them for the squirrels also.  I really figured that I would see lots of action out at the strip pits because the squirrels were playing and chasing each other all morning long. I think I have enough squares of material cut to finish a quilt top...I just have to get down there and start sewing.  I got all my material back in place, and I have my machine set up again for regular sewing.  It's funny...I have three sewing machines set up for sewing, but of course one of them is my favorite for all things quilt related."},

Every time I see the animals out in this weather I wonder how they survive.  At least the cows don't have to hunt for food...I can just imagine the hard time the wild animals have when the weather is so bad and everything is frozen solid.The birds and the squirrels are eating me out of house and home.  I would love to know of a way to discourage the starlings.  They just seem to take over.  The juncos and the sparrows get plenty that is dropped to the ground but the cardinals keep a bit more distance.And I am assuming it is Mama Squirrel's last litter that comes with her.  Two of them are definitely this years young...the other I am not so sure about but I think it is hers because it will come and get on the picnic table while I am putting food out for them;  it knows my voice.  It just isn't quite brave enough to take from my hand though I think it considers it. We were getting flurries just a few minutes ago when I let Shelby out and in.  I don't think more snow is  in the forecast, but the forecast has been wrong before.We have snow!!!!  And it is still snowing as I type this.  It started after midnight last night....I seen a few little flakes sometime before I went to bed.  I am not saying what time I got up, but we had about 2-3 inches then.  As I was laying there awake, I was thinking how rich we really are.  We never go hungry, never really suffer with cold or heat;  we are blessed more than we will probably ever really know.We messed around here a little while and Roger asked me a couple times if I wanted to go for a drive.  Well, I wanted to, but I didn't.  I dreaded getting out in the cold...however, we filled up the gas tank, and headed north...but only for a mile or two, then across the highway and into the country.  It was snowing and blowing...if not for a line of trees, there was no definition between the sky and the land.******I cannot seem to settle down to blogging steadily.  I seem to jump from one thing to another, or one thought to another.  I keep thinking I will get back in the groove, but I get sidetracked by things and thoughts.  I turned off the comment moderation on this blog the other day, but left the word verification and the first thing I got a spam comment.  I would love to know how they choose their victims.  Do they actually get business from it?************I went to Sarah's yesterday and we did a few errands.  Loralei was in high form.  She could out yell me any time.  She now has three teeth that we can see...it is so hard to catch her still enough to actually see.I got an email from Sarah today...Loralei is officially climbing now.  She is always going over to their elliptical machine...Jeremy was distracted by a phone call and in just minute she was up on it.  And beating on the upright part.  Can you believe that next month she will be one year old?  I cannot imagine life before her now."},

I don't care how cold it is, he will be out without any jacket.  He usually has a jacket or coat of some kind in the car, but he very seldom wears one.These were taken last week...and it was cold then.  But not the bitter cold that it has been the past few days.   It is 9º as I type this.  On this day some of the bigger icicles were actually melting.These were taken near Fallen Rock Camp Ground...so you can see where it got its name.  It is east of Highway 59, south of Mansfield a couple roads.The cats go out but don't stay long.  Mother cat only tries to go out about once a day...but before I can shut the door she whirls around and runs back inside.The birds are really going through the food and Mama Squirrel and three others help them.  Even with the nuts and handfuls of sunflower seeds I put out for the squirrels they get under the birdfeeders and hunt for all the drops.***********I am  slowly cutting 6 inch squares of fabric to make a quilt top.  I just have the urge to sew and not sure what I want to sew.  If I would go down and work steady I would have enough cut in no time.  I think I need 240, give or take a few....and I have 150 cut.   With rotary cutters and rulers, it really doesn't take much time.  Even in this, the time consuming part is deciding which fabrics to use.I was just going to use mainly fabrics that were in the dark blues, dark reds, and tans but have been introducing other colors along.  I only cut two square of each fabric, so by that you can guess I have a lot of fabric.  I probably have enough to just cut one square of each fabric, with no two alike....I have been building a fabric stash for a long, long time."},

Not as many as I hope there will be....I know there was only a drop in the bucket compared to what we usually see, so I am keeping my fingers crossed.And of all times, we had went out to eat so I didn't take my camera.

That was what was happening with our Bubbie last year.  As our Christmas came and went this year, I could not help but compare it to last Christmas.  Last year I would be fine one minute, and the next my heart would just be breaking.  All because of this fellow.  And I had the music from above playing on my blog during that time...though I love it, it sure brings back bittersweet memories for me.This is the way he sleeps most of the time.  In fact his mom and brother also sleep like this, but not as much of the time as he does.Before his accident, he never, ever sat with me or really wanted my attention unless it was to wake me up so I would let him outside.  Now, he comes and sets with me sometimes when I am watching TV, or comes and curls up against me in the wee hours of the morn.  I definitely feel like he knows we saved his life....and he is not even a jerk with his brother and sister.  Before the accident, he drove them crazy with tackling them and wrestling with them.  Now he seldom attempts anything. And you can't even tell that anything was ever wrong with him.  He is still curious, and loves to find an open cabinet door, or any door for that matter that isn't normally open.   Roger does call him the Court Jester....*************I have been trying to decide on a new sewing project and spending a  lot of time trying to make a decision.  When I could not make a decision, I finally went down and just started cutting squares.  Big squares at that...when I think I have enough cut, I will start to sew them together.  I am in the mood to sew!And to read.  Lately, I have acquired several books....most of them things you probably have never heard of.  Right now, I am reading Outlasting the Trail: The Story of a Woman's Journey West. This is considered a work of fiction, but it is inspired and based on true events.  I can tell it is one I am not going to want to put down.Cold, winter weather is always a good time to read.  I told Roger, if I didn't have such good new books awaiting me, I would be tempted to read Long Knife by James Alexander Thom.  And I might just read it anyway.I am  not sure if I mentioned before, but we did our Christmas yesterday....the day after.  It makes it so much easier on Lorelei.  She has so many people to visit, that it is more fun to wait and just have her the day after.  It is easier on her mommy and daddy, too, because she is in a much better mood.She was just a happy little girl yesterday, and kept us all entertained.  Just busy all the time.  She has to check out Shelby every so often....and that is okay as long as Shelby knows she is coming....not that she would hurt Lorelei on purpose, but she does not hear anything at all...and Lorelei does not cause enough vibration in the floor to warn her....so if she is startled she jumps up.  And then there is the possibility of her stepping on Lorelei.As you can probably tell by these last two photos, she is a born mom.  She is just so gentle with Lorelei.************************We finally got some snow today....we have been having flurries the past few days but it never amounted to more than a skim of snow.  Now we have 3 inches, or maybe 4.  Believe it or not, we went to Terre Haute this morn, thinking it was only going to be flurries again.  I took my camera with me.On the way home, I mentioned going by Green Valley, just to see.  It snowed harder and harder for a while, and everything was slick as could be.  We were on country roads so only passed 3 or 4 cars...nothing was happening at Green Valley.  We did not see anything moving at all, so continued on in a round about way that we have went before.  We finally saw a flock of turkeys that were too far away to even attempt to photograph.This is when it first began to really snow....to see a bit more be sure and visit my other blog.  We did make it home safe and sound, glad to get here.  We had leftovers--always the best part of holiday meals."},

But in the distance, I seen seven in one spot.  I have no idea how many are out there...they are amazing.  And fast!  I can be watching one, and glance away just for a few seconds and look back and it will have disappeared!  Even if they are high in the sky. They tend to hunt while flying just a few feet above the ground....then they disappear into the background.  Yesterday we saw one catch something...Roger thought maybe a muskrat.

It did not take long to finish it once I started.  It was mailed this week, and has been received.  I didn't show it previously in any other stage because I wanted it to be a surprise.I am just itching to start something else, but haven't decided on what.

I still have a few things left to wrap.  And actually need to get gifts for the little kids next door.  And I have yet to get in all the fixings for Christmas dinner.  But that is not that much left to do.Neal and I were talking the other night...our talks always include talking about childhood and the things we remember.  I was telling him, the one memory that really stands out in my mind is all the cakes mom would bake at Christmas.  There was a metal cabinet that had two shelves up top behind glass, and those two shelves would be full of cakes!  I could not remember if it was just a year or two that she did that, or every year.He said he thought it was every year, and that he helped her bake them.  So, I told him I didn't remember actually eating them...he thought that she gave most of them away.  Which makes sense...I just can't imagine not remembering eating them. I cannot remember the variety that she made, but know she almost always made a jam cake...it tasted sort of like a spice cake if I remember correctly, and she always made a caramel icing for it.  She also made a stack cake...at least that is what we called it.  She had no written recipe, and did not measure a thing....but she made this dough.  I know it had eggs and sugar in it, and other than that I can't recall what else.   I know I liked the dough raw, better than baked.She would divide take a dough ball about the size of a fist or maybe just a bit bigger....she would pat that out flat in a greased iron skillet.  She kept two iron skillets in the oven and would make anywhere from 8 to 12 or 14 layers.For the filling in between the layers, she used dried apples and cooked them down to something similar to apple butter but with more texture if I remember correctly.  ( I know water and cinnamon were added to the apples, but think there were other spices, just don't recall what all.)  That was a cake that company always enjoyed.    I have never seen the cake made by anyone else, but I did find a recipe that sounds right here.Thinking back, that is one of my favorite memories."},

It has been ages since I have seen her that still.  She just sat so quietly, not moving at all unless a car passed.  She totally loves cars...I don't know what it is about them but she watches them as far as she can see them.And she mimics us....at least Roger.  If he coughs, she coughs.  It is just too cute for words.  And any of us can initiate a yelling contest.  And she smiles the whole time.  When she crawls through the house, she looks like a little wind-up toy.  Specially on the linoleum in the dining room and in the kitchen. I only hope everyone gets as much enjoyment from their kids as we do her.  Her mom and dad are just so good with her.  And her aunt is wonderful with her.I never talk a lot about my older daughter...but I am just as proud of her as can be.  I showed Lorelei some pictures of her today and when she saw them, a smile lit up her whole face.  This daughter somehow inspires that in kids.When she was in college, she worked at a mini mart for about 3 or 4 years while going to college.  So many of the kids that came in there reacted to her in ways that astonished their parents.  One or two would always have to kiss her good-by, all the time the parents saying their child never did that with anyone else.  Then there was another couple that had a little girl about 3 yrs. old if I remember correctly....they would try to get gas without bringing her in.  They would come in and warn my daughter to stay away from the window, but if their little girl seen my daughter, she would insist on being brought in.  And my daughter would have to pick her up for just a couple minutes.  The only thing I can think is that she made them feel safe."},
{"title": "Road to memories", "date": "Sunday, December 13, 2009", "text": "As I sit here trying to type, a cat is at the front door wanting in.  With four cats, there is one wanting in or out continually.  When it is really cold, sometimes one will want out and when we open the door and it feels the cold, it will either step out and turn around and run back in or sometimes they don't even go out.  But it has to be really bitter cold/wind for that.Anyway, this road to the barn reminds me of other roads, other barns, other times and places.  But mostly I think about our barn.   It sure seen a lot of life.  Just the normal day to day chores of feeding the pigs, and we always fed Old Bob, our old horse a little extra every day.  I think it was corn ground up with some kind of sweetening added to it...maybe molasses?  I don't really know what was used--I just know it smelled good.And how many of you know that pigs will eat coal?  Honest to goodness, they do.  A few times during the year, I would have to get a bucket and gather it full of smaller pieces of coal,  the various sizes of crushed rock.  I don't know how mom knew they ate coal...and I don't know what it supplied for the pigs but they ate it like the pigs they were.  Totally enjoyed it.  And I know mom thought it supplied something they needed.  And I have heard a neighbor talking about his pigs and thinking something was wrong, and mom told him to feed them coal.And in the summer, two or three times a week mom or I, or both of us would cut a big armload of what we called horseweeds and carry them and throw them in the pigpen to the pigs.  I have been trying to find a decent picture of what we called horseweeds but can't.  What is listed as horseweeds in a google search is not what we called horseweeds.  I just had a thought googled ragweed, then clicked images.  It came up as giant ragweed.  That makes sense because of the flower head--it is similar to regular ragweed.In the summer, my sisters would usually come home for at least one visit...and soon as they got in my nieces and/or nephews wanted to go to the barn.  The one thing I remember them really liking to do was to shell corn for the pigs.  It was an added bonus if we happened to have a calf that we were keeping in the barn!  I didn't realize it when I was a kid, at least not at first, but a couple of the nephews would try riding the calves if they were any size at all!That is just a few of the memories that flood my soul when I see barns...so it is no wonder that I love them.We were out yesterday and went through Bridgeton and Mansfield.  I took these pictures but am hoping it snows before the season is over.I am sorry I haven't got the history of this house, and there is no excuse.  Roger used to work with the lady that has this cabin, and we have even seen her up there and talked to her.  Their farm is not too far from Bridgeton.I will be posting another house that she has crafts in over on my other blog, Time Stand Still."},

I was wanting her to flip her tail up over her back till you could see how much is missing but she never once flipped it up.She is never on any schedule in coming.  Though I think now that it is colder, I do see her more.  There was one time earlier in the summer when I was just sure she had gotten killed.  There were 3 or 4 weeks in a row that she didn't show up at all.  She is a little piggy right now, and just eats and eats and eats.  I suppose she is trying to build a layer of fat."},

We will think  a heat wave has hit.   I will be thankful for it!We kept Lorelei today while her mom did some errands and a bit of Christmas shopping.  She is such a happy little girl.  And have I told you that she loves books?  I didn't realize Sarah had stuck some of hers from home in the diaper bag, so  I got out one we had for her for Christmas.  She looked and looked through it.  She will sit and sit looking through and talking about the pictures....what she is saying I do not know, but she is very intent when telling me all about them.Her other thing is to reach for her papaw every time he passes.  He carries her around and shows her everything and tells her about each item.  And while it is okay for him to leave the room I am in with her, she does not like it if I leave the room and leave them behind.She also enjoys going after the cats and Shelby...not all the time, though she does crawl up to Shelby fairly often and talks to her also.  Shelby doesn't know what to think...she is sort of afraid of being hurt inless I am right there.  Or maybe she is afraid of Lorelei being hurt...not sure which it is.  If I am right there about as close as possible she is fine with it.  But if I am standing up, she gets up, too.****************I have went back to moderating comments....I tried just using word verification and it did not slow them spammers down at all."},

So, I would like to take just a minute to encourage you to click each photo and enlarge it.Lorelei was one busy little girl today...in fact, I think she is a busy girl every day.And a happy kid at that.  But oh, does she have a temper!There is a corner in their living room where there is an antique lamp table... and she always wants to crawl back under it.  I have a hard time getting her out from back there, so  I just don't let her go.  She gets mad and starts kicking her feet, and does this grunting thing till you know she is unhappy.I think you can see her tooth in this one if you enlarge it!However, usually if she is offered other things such as a book, or to go look out the window, she forgets all about what she had started to do."},

It is funny, the wind literally howls in the winter.  I suppose the foliage of the trees in the summer dampens that sound.  That is my reasoning at least, whether it is wrong or right I cannot say.Now, the fourth cat is out.  I hope by the time we leave to go babysit Lorelei that they are all back inside.  I don't like to leave and them be out in this type of weather.  But two of them have been at me for the past hour at least to let them out.  The boys of course....the girls tend to wait patiently most of the time.The coldest weather so far is supposed to be headed out way.  Mama Squirrel was a real little piggy yesterday.  I told Roger then I wondered if she was trying to get enough food in her to last for a few days of sleep.  Looking back, I bet she knew this weather was coming.   I do hope she has a nice hole she sleeps in across the street.It is about time for my alarm to go off, so I best go shut it off.  I have been so off schedule with my sleep, I thought I best set it to be sure I am up early this morn.

The point and shoot does not do a good job of capturing her.  She is just never still unless she is asleep.  She jumped and jumped in her jumper.  She gets going and she don't stop.  However, I thought she sounded tired and asked her if she wanted her mamaw to come get her.  She stopped and smiled real big.  her smile will light up the whole room.I went over and picker her up out of the jumper, she laid her head on my shoulder and never raised it again.  She was sound asleep in just a couple minutes.  I just sat and enjoyed the quiet time with her.I will leave you with a little video I found in my mail 3 or 4 mornings ago....enjoy!  (Sarah just uses her cell phone so they are not the best quality.)Although we often think of the Amish as leading a simple life, I think it is a busy one.  Something about this photo, taken the other day says busy, busy, busy. Almost every Amish farm we passed had their washing out on the line.  Everything about their places was as neat as a pin. As for me, Lorelei is waiting to see me, so I am heading to her house here shortly."},

The fact that Roger feels like getting out is a blessing in itself.  To have a second day of sunshine was wonderful. We headed to Parke County and headed down some back roads we have been on before, but at a different time of year.  I have shown this barn before...taken in the summer.  I still wanted to stop and take a couple...I didn't notice what was in the hallway of the barn till I zoomed in.   This is not a good picture, but it still makes me smile!***********I don't back up my files as often as I should, and decided the other day that I would back them up.  I set it to back up on this external storage thing I have, and we left.  I did not check when I got home other than it said it was done...I just disconnected it and put it away. When I got today's photos downloaded, I was going to quick back them up.  I discovered that there had not been enough room on the other thing to back them all up.I ran to Walmart and picked up an external hard drive and backed everything up on it.  I have 48 gigabytes of photos alone!  I just decided to let it back up and stayed off the computer while it was doing it.  It was after 11:00 p.m. before it was done, then I had to re-size photos for here.  And while I was at it, I just resized all the ones I thought I might use.Don't I lead an exciting life?"},

He belonged to a girl up the street.  I can almost guarantee that he was the king of the cats around here.  He was not neutered or anything, so you can see the scars from all his fighting if you look at his ear.Yet he was one of the best cats ever...he would come here and stay for a few days ever little bit.  The girls were young and there was nothing he liked better than for one of them to carry him to a chair or bed to snuggle with. If I was outside sitting and reading, he would come and sit beside me to be petted, but if I were writing a letter, he would lay across my paper till I had to stop and pet him. He is long gone, but we think of him often.  Especially if Cougar leaves and is gone for a day or two...we wonder if he has another home as TJ considered this his second home.  If he was gone too long, his 'mom' would call down here to see if he was here.  She didn't mind, she just wanted to know if he was okay.I often think he would be the perfect cat for Lorelei, though I really think my Cougar and Bubbie are going to be fine."},

I got 2 or 3 other good photos from that one little side trip.********************Today was another good day for Roger!  We went to Terre Haute to pick up the ham for Thanksgiving.  Roger is the only one that really like turkey, so we just fix ham.    A Cumberland Gap ham to be exact.  I have been getting them for several years and never been disappointed. They are actually processed in Middlesboro, KY....that is just across the state line from Cumberland Gap, TN which is where I grew up."},

Even though it isn't sunny, the blue is such a cheerful blue.Roger is certainly feeling better...not sure if meds had anything at all to do with it at all.  The dr's office did call today to put him on another antibiotic because of something they found. Roger had done been saying that he thought it might be some kind of bug.  The girl he talked to did not know what was found, so guess we will find out either the next time he goes, if he doesn't call them back tomorrow.  It has sure been a slow recovery...every day he has felt a bit better.I am just sort of gun shy when it comes to meds after the other episode in 2005.  For a while any time he got the least little bit sick I was afraid it was something to do with his liver.  This was the first time I had that real scared feeling about that in a while.*******************The sun actually shone for a while this morn, but it was dark and cloudy by noon.  This is at least the 3rd day of dreary weather....and it has really gotten to me.  I don't think it would have bothered me so bad if Roger had not been sick for so long.  I am definitely a person that needs sunshine and have always loved the feel of the sun upon my face.I guess like a little bit of all kinds of weather...Ialways LOVED picking apples in the quiet of a rain...as long as it wasn't raining so hard that I couldn't see if I had to look up.  And even cold can be exhilarating.  It feels so wonderful to come in to a warm house when your nose is red from the cold!   I love being out in the hushed quiet after a snow...I guess the key is not to have too much of any one of them.Old barns often remind me of a different time...when we had more time for each other.  With all our time saving appliances and devices, time still seems to slip away.   The song below is one of my favorites.  It just seems to fit the mood I am in.  I often think about how the best songs tell a lifetime story in just a few verses.  I hope you will listen and enjoy as much as I do.  Below the video I will put the lyrics...Better Days (Tim Grimm)Farmer Jim had the bailerI had the hands and had the timeHe was up into his seventiesI was in the middle of may primeI was bringing back my childhoodHe'd been doing this all his lifeDriving that old John Deere tractorEating lunch brought by his wifeAnd they'd rest under our maplesAnd they'd tell me of their pastLost a son and lost a grandsonOne went slow, one went fastRuth would tell me of the old timesMen would go off to the fieldsAnd all the children and the women wouldHitch the team and drive them down to the woods(chorus)Me, I'm trying to learn the old waysOf the heart and of the landPeople growing old togetherFamilies working hand in handSo I will watch and I will listenTo voices cracked and faces worn with ageAnd when they're gone, Lord knows I'll miss themThey give me hope for better daysAmos Chesnut is my neighborAll his life an honest manI stepped up to his door a strangerWalked away a new found friendWhen he works out by the roadsidePeople slow and wave a handHe watches life pass by his Oak Bend farmBut I don't know a richer manHe knows every creek and hollowEvery fencepost dug by handWhere the paw-paws growWhere the coyotes roamWhere the dirt turns into sand(chorus)with repeat last 2 lines The first lines of the last verse reminds me so much of Lily, that used to be my neighbor.  We moved here in 1980, and after spending the first night, Roger got up to go to work and our car would not start.  The phone had not been put in, that was before cell phones...doesn't that in itself seem like another century?Anyway, our way of meeting was for me to go over and ask if I could use her phone.  I did walk away with a lifetime friend."},

It was not even that cool, but it still had the feel of winter coming.  Rain started about midnight, and was still raining this morn, however lightly.  I was awake a time or two and the rain was really coming down.  It even sounded cold...the tone when it hits the awning is just a tad bit higher pitched when it is cold.We still don't really know what happened with Roger...the lab work done did not show anything wrong...all his levels were normal.  On our own, we decided to cut out most of the medications and he feels better.  He now gets tired without doing anything.  He is so tired of just sitting around.It is a long story about why we cut out the meds...if you want to  know more email me.  I will say this that in 2005 he spent 5 days in the hospital.  His liver functions were out of whack--one of the doctors made a comment that his body was just shutting down.  It turned out to be caused by the medications he was on.  At that time, the doctor and I talked him into going with insulin alone to control the diabetes. He had to stop taking Lipitor also...and he had recently started on Zetia and Welchol for high cholesterol. I am leaving out a lot...I have forgotten bits and pieces about it.  This symptoms this time are so similiar to then.  That is why we cut out most of what he takes. I am just so in hopes that he really is on the way to recovery now.  All we can do is take it one day at a time."},

Anyway, to the update.Roger felt like he was really starting to get well the past couple of days but got up feeling horrible again this morn.  So to the doctor we went.  I don't think she knows quite what to think...she is trying to treat at least one of his symptoms.  And she is having some lab work done.  Blood tests.When we went over to the hospital, I just stayed out in the waiting room.  Not a lot of room in the lab.  They called Code Blue to the lab...everyone went running.  I was hoping that it wasn't him, but it was.  His blood sugar went real low and he crashed.  Passed out and woke up to everyone over him.He is diabetic.  What is strange with this, besides not running a temperature, normally if he has a cold, or sick in any way, his sugar will be high.  No matter if he hasn't eaten anything, it will still run high.  With this, it is running normal.So that is what is going on here.This is Lorelei bopping to Feist on Sesame Street--you can hardly hear it on the video here.  Enjoy!"},

When you do, besides the road leading to the barn, you can see cow paths above and below the road.  Being in Indiana, I don't notice cow paths very often. (Click here to see this in sepia.)In the hills and hollers of east Tennessee, they are much more noticeable.   A cow don't usually climb straight up and down the side of a hill...they will go along just gradually zig zagging back and forth as they graze on a hillside.I remember following cow paths while I picked blackberries as a kid.  My mom always reminded me/us kids to watch out for a rattlesnake.  I suppose if she were alive today and I was to go blackberry picking she would still remind me to watch out for a rattlesnake.For a big part of her life, they were a serious danger.  The old home place bordered a park...and I think she killed at least one rattler in our front yard.  It is probably a miracle that none of us were ever bitten by one.Another time, one of my sisters was doing something in the tobacco patch...she thought she saw a rat run under the tobacco plants--thought she saw a rat's tail.  When she raised the tobacco leaf, it was a copperhead.Neal or I either one, would have loved to have a home up at the old place, but mom never wanted us to.  I think she had too many hard times up there.  Too many things to worry about.   It is still one of the most peaceful places to just go and sit and listen to the silence."},

He didn't feel any better Saturday...Sunday he stayed up all day and we thought he was on the road to recovery, only for him to get up today feeling like he had been run over by a truck.  I am hoping if he doesn't feel better tomorrow that I can get him to go to the doctor.I haven't sewn any today, but sewed a lot off and on Saturday and yesterday I got a small quilt layered and pin basted;  it is ready for me to machine quilt now.  Maybe before too long I will have something to show for my labors.It is late, and I need to post a photo on my other blog...This sycamore tree was just as massive in person as it appears to be in the picture.

I was thinking about all the joyous moments of sitting out there holding Lorelei this past summer...wondering what would she would have been doing if she were here today.  And I was also wondering a bit about what the future holds.Across the street, Kay came outside and started jumping rope.  The first thought that popped into my head was:Up the ladderA B CDown the ladderH O T!That was one of the little rhymes we chanted when we were young and jumping rope...and on the Down part, we jumped as fast as we could.  And this thought lead to the thought of other rhymes.  I could only remember fragments...I could remember the phrase 'turn around,' and one about going upstairs...and there is one about who you are going to marry: doctor, lawyer, Indian chief.I did a quick glance on the computer and came up with:Teddy bear, teddy bearTurn around,Teddy bear, teddy bearTouch the ground.Teddy bear,teddy bearTurn around,Teddy bear, teddy bearTie(?) your shoeTeddy bear, teddy bearTurn aroundTeddy bear, teddy bearOut goes you.As we jumped rope to Teddy Bear, we did the actions...I am not sure about some of the words here, and I also think we had more actions we did but I cannot remember them.All I can remember of another is:Cinderella, dressed in yellow,Went upstairs to see her fellow...and this was followed by something about how many kisses she got...The one about who we are going to marry completely escapes me, but I do think it was a rhyme for jump rope...and I think we had other rhymes but I am having a real mental block when it comes to remembering them.I was hoping Kay would come over:  I wanted to see if they used these same little rhymes...I am sure I taught them to my kids but not sure if anyone else knew them.  Were they common place every where or just a regional thing?  Is this one of those things that remains the same in spite of the passage of time, or one that passes away into only the dim memories of the older generation.  (How odd to think of myself as among the older generation--sometimes I have a real problem believing I am.)"},

When I say I am designing a quilt I probably shouldn't use the term designing.  I am almost always just playing with the arrangement of colors...so I don't know if that qualifies as designing.  A better term would be to say that I am planning my quilt maybe.  Anyway, I didn't want someone to think I was that talented.I completed 6 little blocks, have some others half made and during making the first two blocks earlier in the evening, I made the same mistake 2 or 3 times and had to do the froggy dance....rip-it, rip-it, rip-it....rip the seam out.  It is very satisfying to sew.  There is nothing like hearing my sewing machine or hearing the shutter of my camera!

She looked back behind and seen him, then she looked at her toys...repeated the actions, then the third time she looked back at him she took off after him.  He had just woke from a nap and was not in the mood so he took off.Sarah has a double doorway between her living room and dining room....they have a wide gate across it to keep Otto and Keesha out of the living room when they want.  She says if Lorelei looks over and sees him, she is off to see him to quick to talk about.  And he is quick to lick.  Sarah's favorite saying about him is that he can't hold his licker.

{"title": "The gift of friendship", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2009", "text": "I felt like we struck gold this past week.The other day when we stopped along the road for me to take this photo,  out the back door of the house came the owner.  And along with him came a beautiful collie dog, which I hope to go back and photograph at a later date.I was trying to tell him how beautiful the tree was, but he could not hear me, so he came out to the road where we were to talk to us.  He ended up having Roger pull into the drive and started showing us all kinds of stuff.Among the things he showed us were these gourds....he had a couple tractor waggons with them setting drying.  I think that was the first thing he showed us...then he said come on over here.  I wish I had had my camera, but the collie seemed to be afraid of it, so I put in in the car so he would come to me.  But he is another story.So he took us in a small pole barn; he had small boxes and crates of walnuts everywhere.  He uses an old corn sheller to get the green hull off, then he lets them dry outside on screen frames.  When they are done drying, he has a small cement mixer that he uses to tumble them to get the walnuts really clean.He took us over to his regular garage to show us dried gourds, and also some little bitty bell peppers.  He gave me some of those.  While over there he also went in the house to get this photographic view he had of his farm...his wife came out and talked to us just a few minutes when we were over there.Then he took us to another little pole barn type building to show us the corn sheller and actually ran a few walnuts through it.   He showed us this thing called a Nut Wizard.  He uses to pick up walnuts.  Here is a link to one similar to what he had...he says it doesn't work where the grass is not mowed, but he threw walnuts down and demonstrated it to us.  It really works!I am not even beginning to tell all he told us.  During the time of it, he gave me the top two gourds.  Actually, he just told me to pick the ones I liked.  On top of those, he gave me a couple flowers...he didn't know what they were.  They have leaves/blades like maybe some type of day lily or iris.So, Roger told him we would bring him one of my gourds.   Later, I decided I would print a photo of the photo I took on my photo printer.  I printed a couple 8 x10s of it,  Saturday I picked out 3 or 4 gourds and we ran them out there.  We really were just going to drop them off...but they insisted on us coming in.  We sat and visited for probably an hour...As we left, Helen told me not to forget my photos...she was totally surprised when I told her I printed them for them.  And as we were leaving, Dick said to wait a minute...he went and got the dried apple gourd above, telling me he meant to give it to me the other day.****************Everyone knows I LOVE collies.  I have never met a collie I didn't like.  Diamond, their dog, was no different.  He was just a tad bit shy at first, but when we went back Saturday the first thing he did was bring one of his stuffed animals and dropped it at my feet for me to throw.  Every time we think of him, we smile.  Maybe not as big as when we think about Lorelei, but still we smile.  And we would love for the two of them to meet.  I have never seen a collie that didn't like kids...at least not a regular full sized collie.*****************I just had to tell this...it was like a breath of fresh air to meet and talk to Dick and Helen.  He showed us some old pictures...she showed me pictures of her grand kids  and great grand kids. They told us bits and pieces from their life...him more than her.  He talked about the goats and goat cart he had as a kid and even showed us a picture...told us he road it to school every day.He didn't live far from the school....he was the one that went early to start the fire before everyone else got there.    He even had a picture of the old school...looked like a one-room school to me.  I wish I had ask more questions.  Maybe next time I will ask more.   I also hope to get the courage to take photos of Diamond.  I think he knows us well enough to not mind the camera now."},

Also, she told me that she was told that when Jeremy was a baby and learned to roll, he rolled to where he wanted to go.

This is Brouillete's Creek which starts over in Illinois and empties into the Wabash River in Indiana north of Terre Haute and south ClintonThis is close to the same view, except I was under the bridge taking the bottom one today.  Notice how high the creek is compared to the first picture...I did not realize we had had this much rain.But the thing that really caught my eye and actually surprised me was the total absence of any gold on the trees.  This bottom photo actually cuts off part of both trees that are at the edges in the top, yet limbs from both trees are actually in the photos.    The tree that is so yellow on the left side did not have hardly any leaves left on it.  And the one on the right edge is almost as bad.You can see the differences much better if you enlarge the photos."},

I have not tried to identify them other than that.  The gills told me they weren't what I wanted.  Chicken mushrooms are polypores.    For one thing, they don't have gills.  (Read more about polypores in the previous link.)  They are porous on the underside.  When torn apart, they tear very similar to a chicken breast, and when fried have a light chicken taste.

I am stopping for the night, even though I probably still need to update some things.  I am just going to stop and take a break...my mind can relax now that everything is working again.Lorelei is a hoot to be with....I swear she has a since of humor right now.

On top of that I have had a bit of a cold and just didn't feel normal.When I have computer problems, I just obsess about it till I do something, but haven't felt like doing anything.  But I have started...the slate is being wiped clean as I speak.  It was this Security Tool thing that got on Sunday...if I tried to run my antivirus ware, it would turn the computer off.  I tried to go to Microsoft to get something to get rid of it, and it would not let it run, nor would it let some other anti-adware run.I tried going to the safe mode to delete somethings, and though I only found one thing to delete, soon as I restarted the computer, it was back again.So, until I get this settled, I won't be doing much of anything other than fooling with it."},

That was followed by playing on the floor with some of her toys.  By the time she did all that, she was ready for a bottle and a nap.By the time she woke from it her Aunt Rachel was here...so she visited with her for a bit.  Soon, her mommy and daddy were back.These were taken about three weeks ago...I had downloaded the photos to the old computer and just forgot about them.  (The 2008 part of the date is wrong, of course.  I didn't realize it was wrong till after I took these photos.)We had a wedding to go to today, and on the way there I took some drive-by shots with the little point and shoot camera.  So, when I downloaded those to my laptop, I downloaded these also.  I thought I would share a couple with you.She was at the wedding....cute as a button of course.

Still not positive I could find it again, but I know more about the place to begin looking. As you can see here, there was a camper trailer parked there this time.  I think they are beginning to work on the house.  No one was there...if there had been, I think we would have stopped to ask questions.  I am so curious about the history of this fine old farm.*******************I have been being gone/or occupied with Lorelei this whole week.  I am not sick, or anything...just been preoccupied with other things.  I had not planned to take so long a break from blogging, or I would have warned everyone.

I have got my machine all set and ready to sew if I could make up my mind.  Sometimes it was easier when I didn't have so much to choose from.Along the way, I have built up a significant stash of quilting material because I knew once Roger retired I wouldn't be going and spending so much on fabric.  I still buy some along, or if I really need something I go get it.  Usually I have a good supply of anything I need...I do buy good yellow fabric whenever I find one I really like because I continually run out of it.  Almost any quilt I make has some yellow yellow in it.It is so wet and rainy here in our area...I don't think it totally quit raining the entire day yesterday.  And it is the same again this morn, though I think the rain is supposed to move on through by the end of the day, with days of typical fall weather following.I was thinking as was waking up this morn about how unusual the weather is.  I don't ever remember having as much cool weather by this time of the year when I worked at the orchard.  There would be days I would start out with a jacket or one of Roger's heavy flannel shirts, but very seldom did they stay on past 10:00 a.m.  This fall, there have been several days where I think I would have had to wear a jacket most or all of the day."},

{"title": "For all you birders out there", "date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2009", "text": "I have been wishing I was good at working with metal...I have been wondering about making a few things.  My husband could make them with hardly a thought...he is good at working with metal.  And even though he doesn't do art stuff, he is good at it.  He just prefers to make things that really serve a purpose...not that he doesn't like beauty.He likes to make things that are really useful and really needed, not just things to look at.  He can almost always look at something and make it....and a lot of times make it better.I saw these along the sidewalk down in Nashville, and am thinking I will have him make me one or two, or else teach me how to make them.   But I think it would be safer if he made them.  Now he would make them for me if they weren't for suet, but he will like making them since they are for something other than just to look at.Does anyone make their own suet?  I know my mom did every now and then.  I don't remember how she did it...for one thing it was maybe once a year.  I don't think she had the beef fat available to do it more often.  Being that I couldn't remember how she made it, I googled suet and find the info...if you are interested, here and here are a couple of places that have info on making suet.  I am really thinking I might try making some.  I hate throwing away the fat that comes on some of the beef I buy....so making suet would put it to good use."},

{"title": "In the air", "date": "Friday, October 2, 2009", "text": "There is such a feeling of fall in the air, with even a hint of winter in the wind that seems to continuously blow.  I think the day's high was 65º .Seeing all the pumpkins on display everywhere emphasizes that fall is here.  I love seeing them, but there is such a feeling of nostalgia that there is just a bit of sadness mixed in with the elation of the beauty that  is emerging.  I just want to be outside ALL the time and SEE all that I can see.And at times I wish I go back and visit with friends that have passed on....or visit with my mom and dad and sister.  I'd like to see the home place as it once was...full of activity--with things kind of slowing down for the winter.  We would be feeling thankful for the fruits of our labor.  There would be a freezer full of food, along with jars and jars of stuff in the basement as well as a bin full of potatoes.Grading tobacco and hog killing time would be yet to come.  Along with killing hogs, came rendering lard.  I helped with grading tobacco, but most to do with hog killing was done by Neal, George and Robert...and mom, of course.  I did help with cutting up the fat for making lard.  And sometimes stood and stirred it while it rendered down.  Other than that, I don't remember helping much with it...I just enjoyed the fruit of their labor.And as the weather cooled, us kids played more inside at the end of the day.  I do not know how mom and dad stood all the noise. We had a homemade ping pong table in the basement...and believe me our basement was not a finished basement.  But we had a blast down there.  There was one dim, bare light bulb above the ping pong table, and one of my brothers came up with the idea of using a jar to cover it till we didn't break the bulb in our play.I am not sure just how they did it...but they attached a jar lid to the light bulb socket.  It was the kind shown here.  Then they just screwed the jar to the lid over the light bulb and it was protected.  This was later carried on the the light bulb in our hallway.  I guess that hallway was where the most noise erupted.I don't know how long that hallway is, but it was the scene of many good times for us.  Our bedrooms and the bathroom were off that hallway, and to go in the bathroom, the door was inset a little....I don't know how else to say it.  Instead of just an opening off the wall, it was inset about a foot and a half.Two of us would play...each would take an end. (if there were more than two of us, the others would wait in the entryway to the bathroom.)  We set down in the floor and set empty shotgun shells in front.  I don't know if there was a set number or if we just divided however many we had...and we would take either ping pong balls or those little bitty super balls and our ping pong paddles and try to knock each others shells down.  We tried to hit the ball back before it hit our shells.I hope you remember what super balls are...they bounced every which way.  It got really wild when we used them.  And noisy!  My goodness, I can still hear the paddles hitting the floor when we tried to 'kill' a ball.  I can hear the balls bouncing off the wall.  I can remember laughing and laughing with one of my nieces when we were in there playing.And I wonder why it is that I look to the past so much, and others seem to look forward with hardly a thought to what happened before.  And a few people don't even want to talk about the past...maybe it is because I see it through rose-colored glasses."},

And believe it or not, I didn't buy anything.  The only thing we bought down there was an Elmo doll for Bright Eyes.  I can't wait to see what she does when she sees it.It has been very cool fall weather.  Sarah and Jeremy had a cookout Tuesday night for a friend of theirs that is moving to Washington.  The state.  I went down and helped Sarah keep Lorelei entertained...though it was more like she entertained us.  Her giggle box was easy to kick on that day.  I honestly think she looks for something to laugh at.And I got reports from both daughters about how good Otto was with the children that came.  To be such a hardheaded dog, he sure is good with little ones.  He can and will drag me around their yard when playing tug of war, yet when playing with a small  pre-kindergarten girl...he didn't pull her down one single time.  His demeanor totally changes when it is a child.  Rachel had never actually seen him interact with kids, other than trying to lick Lorelei, and she was totally amazed.And Lorelei just loves him...as she does the cats and Shelby.

I did not get out and try to take their photo that day...well, I didn't get out of the car.  I did have my camera in hand, but just thought they had ran to far away.As we were leaving the area, I had to get out and open the gate....in the process I lost my lens cap.  I almost always stick it in one spot, except sometimes if I get excited I will stick it in my pocket, or just where I can reach.I got home and went to get the cap out of my bag and it was no where to be found...we checked the car...I checked my pockets.  The next morn I ask Roger if he wanted to run back out there till I could look for it.  On the way in, there were the little coons again!  This time I was out with camera in hand...but it was under the trees, dark and not much available light.They scurried up a tree there...and would go on the side away from me.  Roger got out to go on one side, hoping to scare them towards me.  Well, this little fellow was up about 10 0r 12 ft off the ground going out on a limb and he fell and landed just within feet of me.  He was a bit stunned, and I did get these photos.  But he survived and walked away.If you enlarge the picture and look at the coon's pupils...one looks slightly larger than the other.  I have not had a chance to be out there since then, but hoping to make it out there in the next few days.Edited to add:  George ask me if I found my lens cap...yes, I found it right where I thought I lost it."},

I wonder if I should save some of the seed????  Just kidding.  I do need to break off a stem of it and see what the cats think about it....when I was a kid, I was always using it to play with cats.And below are some of the gourds from my vines...I pulled them from the vines today.  One or two are almost all the way dry.  Roger counted and there are thirty of them.  I just hope they all dry.

Just a totally different tone to the raspberries and the look on her face... And she was blowing spit everywhere....but she ended up getting tickled at herself and got in a better mood.  I laughed so hard that I cried...I guess that is enough about her.  I hope you found some  of it enjoyable...we sure had fun with her."},

Even though the quality of the shot isn't the greatest, I think you can see that a good time was had by all.Do you realize I haven't seen Lorelei since Tuesday?  I have heard her though, in the background when I am talking to Sarah.  I would love to have seen what all she did at the wedding...I guess she was vocal but there was so much stuff going on that she didn't really interrupt anything. Sarah says she is completely over her congestion, and has been laughing and laughing at Keesha and Otto. Here and at home, the least little thing distracts her when we go to feed her.  It is almost as if she looks for something else to focus on.  And Sarah says if Otto is anywhere around, Lorelei is reaching out for him."},

I can't say that I put in a lot of hours on it, though I did my share.  But it was my constant companion during apple picking season.  The John Deere I started with was older than this...but not ancient. A new one was bought sometime after 2001, but I don't remember the exact year.  In the orchard, the tractor has to have so many horsepower to pull the sprayer.  I can't remember how big, but the tractor also has to be small enough to through the orchard without knocking off apples.When I first started working at the orchard, I picked into crates on a wagon.  Then in the last half or so of the time I worked there, I picked into bins that were on this sled type of thing.   They called it a  mudboat.  I have missed those days this fall...it was a lot of fun even if it was hard work.  I usually picked from a cherry picker...but I absolutely loved to pick with a pack from the ground because I could just fly."},

I know I was back in the far corner of the orchard picking Jonathan apples and the boss came out and told me what had happened.The strange thing is I don't remember how I felt....I think it was somewhat unreal to me.  Even after going in and watching some of the news.  I just couldn't believe it had happened.  For days afterward, we did not see a single contrail in the sky.  That was so strange....and I wonder did anyone else notice it.  I think I noticed it more because I was always outside...always watching for hawks, or if I was moving my picker from one place to another, I would count how many contrails I could see out of boredom.**************Lorelei went to the doctor today...they were told she was just really congested.  I was so afraid she had an ear infection just because she had been pulling at her ears, and also because she would whine and fuss till I give her a bottle.  Then she would only take a couple of ounces and quit.  It is a good thing she don't have one.  I just hope she gets to feeling better soon.  Her mom and dad both have the cold, and Roger and I both have it.***********I have tried and tried to get links installed on both my blogs.  I thought I had them installed till my sister-in-law told me she couldn't pull anything up.  When I had a minute I got on the old computer and checked, and they did not come up.  So, when I got time, I got on it using Internet Explorer and got the one I wanted installed on here.But on Time Stand Still, the same widget would not install and I had to use a different one.

Remember those days?They took the orders for our morning recess for us to have a snack, or we could order something for lunch.  All I remember anyone ever ordering for lunch was hot dogs.  A dime for a plain hot dog, or 15¢ for one with chili.  I don't know if they served more or not...most of us did not get to order lunch often.And on holidays, when we had our little parties, we could bring money and order what we wanted to drink for our evening parties.  I remember most of the time ordering root beer!  It was such a treat for us to have pop!If I remember correctly it only had room for 3 or 4 booths....but I really am not sure about this.

Every where I look, I see a story wanting to be told with no one to tell it.  It is probably at least a mile to any house near this post...and no one has lived any closer in years and years so how did this wind up here.  I figure it has been lost, and someone else found it and perched it up there so it could possibly be found again.It reminds me of a story about one of my nieces....when she was young, she had a bear that went with her everywhere she went.  I can't remember how old she was, but at least not in school.  At least I am almost positive she wasn't in school.  Her mom and her had went to town...not sure but possibly her grandma, too.  But for some reason I think it was just her and her mom.  They go, they come back home, and no bear returned with them.  I don't remember how long it took to discover the bear wasn't with them, but soon as they discovered it, they backtracked and went back to town, to where they were parked and found him sitting on top of a parking meter!  Thank God for kind samaritans that know children!I didn't ask for permission to tell this story, but I don't think she will mind....specially since no names have been mentioned."},

I wanted to visit a quilt store there, The Stitching Post....not because I needed anything but just to see.  I had been there years ago, and I must say I thought it had improved a lot!  I had a very good visit there...the salesladies were very friendly and directed us to this barn. **********On the way there, we stopped in Terre Haute and bought a walker for Bright Eyes....I think she will like it but not positive.  She is just so wiggly all the time now.  She cannot just take a bottle--she makes this noise while she takes it that is hard to explain.  Or she pushes herself away from me and looks back at me and just grins.  She has got a twinkle in her eyes all the time almost.One day last week, I was changing her diaper.  I just use our bed as the changing table...I have a pad with a towel over it that I lay her on.  I was just starting to change her, and Roger was laying across the bed beside her talking to her when up jumps Cougar...I don't know how he done it but there was just enough room for him to land between Roger and Lorelei.Lorelei seen him and he started to smell her...she grabbed a handful of fur on each side of his face, her mouth came open as she tried to pull him to her, and she was going to take a bite out of  him!  It was so funny...of course she couldn't really hold him so he just jumped down.  And I washed her hands....but sure did get a good laugh out of it.  I am so glad he is an easy going cat.

I love how it is backlit.  Believe it or not, I don't think it was even two feet tall.But that is not what I want to report.  What we have seen is Northern Harrier hawks...both times.  Only one last week, and just a couple today.  Though there were some other birds soaring that just might have been them.  I know, most times it is buzzards when there are several, but out there I have seen several Northern Harriers at the same time.Either way, it was hard not to keep a big goofy smile on my face.  I just love seeing them...they are the only birds I have ever seen besides a hummingbird that can just hover in flight.  I really hope I can get time to spend out there when they all come back, and hopefully get a good picture or two.Some of the fields have been partially mowed and some were in the process of being bailed today.  Maybe we will be able to see more wildlife if it is not quite so grown up.  I would have loved to spend more time out there, but had things I had to so so we just went through one little section of it and went on about our business."},
{"title": "Tobacco sticks", "date": "Wednesday, September 2, 2009", "text": "Or as we called them, baccer sticks.  You didn't say reach me a tobacco stick...it was reach me a baccer stick.  And I can remember our dad having a hard time finding a sawmill that would saw us some new ones.This is not a good picture...not sure what I done wrong.  I can't seem to improve it no matter how I try.  But it still brings a flood of images to me every time I see it.  Or if I hear the term, tobacco stick...you would probably be amazed at how many times my hands have handled these sticks.  Along with those of my brothers.In one season alone, first they are loaded on a wagon and taken to the tobacco patch.  Then I and my brother next to me in age usually spread them, end to end through the tobacco patch.  Through every two rows.  As soon as we got started, my other brothers Neal and George would start cutting.  And as we got older, I think Robert started cutting it also.Anyway, so now they pick up the sticks and pound one end in the ground, stick a spear on the other end.  (I wish I had a picture of one, but I don't.)  I think they put 5 or 6 stalks of tobacco on each stick...correct me if I am wrong Neal.  I didn't do this job, but was usually picking up any leaves that had broken off during the process.Anyway, keep in mind that is the 3rd time they are handled...the tobacco is usually let set I think a day till it wilts.  Then my brothers handle them one more time as they load the tobacco on the wagon, and one more time when they take it to the barn and hang it on the tier poles.  One would be on the wagon handing the sticks full of tobacco to one brother who would be straddling the first set of tier poles, and he would reach it up to the next who would be straddling the second set of tier poles and hanging it on the third row up close to the roof.  Now that makes a 5th time of handling those same sticks.Then, after the tobacco is cured, they have to go back and take the tobacco down and stand it in a pile against one side of the hallway.  The tobacco is taken off the sticks to be graded, and the sticks are thrown to the side to be picked up and straightened into a pile similar to the one above at the end of the day.Did you keep count of how many times the tobacco sticks were handled...I lose track every time I try.  I think if I am counting right, that they are handled at least 7 times during one season.  I really wish I had had more pictures to show you."},

Nothing more is required in life...she likes to lay across my lap, and if I don't have her in an outfit she at least likes me to take her feet and legs out of her sleepers.  Then she lays there on her back, staring off out in the yard or at the ceiling, jabbering, and normally holding one foot up to her mouth and kicking the other one in the air."},

I just had to have a picture of  this garage....just something about it is so appealing to me.  Some people can take anything and make it so appealing that you have to take a second look.Though the wreath with sunflowers on the side is what grabbed my attention, I really love the leaves laying on the wet roof.  You can see them a bit better if you enlarge the picture.  And I love that old gate leaning against the side.  If I was a kid, I would want that place for my house!*************I had Lorelei today...I really meant to get some new photos but instead I entertained her and she entertained me.  Her Aunt Rachel was here this morn...she cannot take her eyes off Rachel when she is here.  Just stares and stares and smiles if Rachel talks to her.  Rachel was busy with something on line...she did try to hold her when she first got here but Lorelei was not wanting anyone but me.  And I don't even really think it was that so much as maybe she had a bit of a tummy ache.Then later,  Kay and her little brother and one of her friends came over right before she went home, and she was all eyes and ears watching and listening to them.  Their dog also came over, and she thought he was funny. I think she is getting a bit more hair and she is definitely changing...I really wanted pictures to see if anyone else would see the change.

I love spring, and I love parts of summer, and I still have a childish glee come over me when it starts to snow.  But I dearly love fall.  I love it when the days are crisp and clear and the clouds floating big and bold in the sky, and the feeling you get of how nice a fire would be.Or to walk into the kitchen on those days when you have the smell of a pot of soup drifting through the house.  Though I admit I like soup any time, any season, it is just a bit more lovely when the days turn cool.  In the fall it is a joy to bake something and enjoy the heat it creates having the oven on.Then there is the actual beauty of the colors changing...I never tire of photos of the autumn leaves.  These were taken late this evening...I had to have my ISO set at 1600 to get these.  I want to go for another drive in better weather.It rained a big portion of the day here.  Huge puddles were every where for a while.  It was almost like pouring water out of a bucket part of the time.  It thundered so bad it really shook the house...I unplugged everything for most of the day.  I did plug it back in for a few minutes once...but was afraid to leave them plugged in.  Even though I have surge protectors, I just didn't want to risk losing anything.I have heard stuff similar to this called fret work, gingerbread trim, and bargeboard.  Not knowing if there are specifics to each, I will leave it to you the reader to decide what to call it.  I call it pretty.  I never see any of this type of work without thinking what a chore it must be to paint it.  And this even more so because it is painted different colors.  I almost think I would like it better if it were all one color.  And that because the background is basically green.  I suppose if if it was all white behind it, I would like it better this way.

I cannot help but wonder what is done in that barn with all those windows.  It looked even better in person than in this picture....I think because I was feeling its size.

I don't remember who I have heard use that term, I was thinking my mom, but not real sure.  But it sure describes the process for this quilt.  It should have been done long ago, but here it is unfinished.  I did decide to get serious about it a bit back.  I had 8 or 10 squares left to make, got those made.  I got the blocks sewn together without mishap...I figured I would get at least one turned wrong.I have enough fabric in my basement to start a small quilt shop, but did not have anything I wanted to use for the backing of the quilt.  So there was a pause to search for fabric for it.  I looked at some of my favorite quilt shops on line with no luck.  Ended up stopping at Joann Fabrics on the way home from a doctors appointment and found something I liked.Actually, I chose three fabrics and got the backing sewn together this past weekend, got the batting cut down to size, got everything stretched and it all pin-basted together.  Now to decide how to quilt it.  I am going to free-motion machine quilt it.  At least that is the plans so far.  When you free-motion quilt, the feed-dogs are lowered, the pressure on the pressure foot lowered to zero as well as the stitch length is set to zero.The ball is in your court then, or the quilting in this case.  You can stitch forwards, backwards, sideways, any direction you want...everything is controlled by you, the quilter.  I am not horrible at it, but I do have a lot room for improvement.  It takes lots and lots of practice to get your stitches somewhat even.I have been thinking and thinking on what design to attempt.  The few times I have machine quilted, I have winged it....you can click here to see other quilts I have posted that are machine quilted.  Be sure to enlarge the pictures to see the actual quilting.  Though maybe I shouldn't suggest it.  My favorite I have done so far is the one posted on December 10, 2007.I would really like to plan this quilting, and have looked and looked at other's photos of quilts trying to get inspiration and nothing really strikes my fancy.  So, I may have to just wing-it again and hope for the best."},

When it is just me there, Sarah will sit in the living room to nurse her....well, yesterday she would nurse a minute, then roll over and look at me and grin, all the time her leg is kicking.  If her leg is kicking, she is a happy child.She was just pure comedy to watch.  Over the weekend, she would do something similar with her dad.  She would look at him and do this fake cough to get his attention.  I really have not been around very many babies...I had never changed a diaper till I had my own child so you have to keep that in mind when I say stuff about Lorelei.  Things like I have never seen another baby jabber the way she jabbers...my kids jabbered, as well as the toddler that I babysat when our girls were toddlers.It is Lorelei's actual way of jabbering that is so strange....it is from the back of her throat and almost sounds as if it is straining her voice.  And she will do it as loud as she can....***********I just talked to Sarah and will probably head over there in a bit.  They are having a new fence put in....the guys came yesterday and took down the old one and put in the posts for the new one.  They told Jeremy they had to let the posts/concrete sit over night.  Yet they did not come back today.  So, for right now, they have to take the dogs out on their leashes.  Otto definitely will not mind enough to let loose, and she just doesn't feel like yelling at Keesha.  Keesha will eventually listen, but she is so hard headed that if she really wants to do something, she will keep pushing for it.I have a load of clothes in the washer and want to get them put over to the dryer, and another load started before I head that way.  And have a couple other things to do here at home.  So it does not look like I will get to do any blog visiting tonight.On top of being over Sarah's a lot, our DVD player/recorder seems to have bitten the dust.  I spent time last night trying to decide whether to invest in getting it fixed, or just buying a new one.  If I didn't want one that records also, I would just go get a new one.  But there are times when I want to watch two things that are on at same time, or else Roger wants one thing and me another.  Or if there is something I am afraid I will forget, I will sit it to record.But the more I read customer reviews of them, the more it seems like they all have problems....so not sure what is best to do!"},

To me there is a look of expectation in they way they hold themself.  As if they know something good is on its way.

Well, I quit seeing any activity a while back.  I didn't really know what to think...I thought I saw one or two hornets at different times, but never could see any when looking up in the hole.Two or three weeks ago we were sitting on the front porch with Lorelei, and Roger noticed this out in the crab apple.  They are active there....not sure, but thinking about getting rid of it just because of Lorelei.  I hate to tear it down...but it is so close to the house that I think we need to do something.I don't know about anyone else, but I like having mail coming that is something to look forward to.  (I know, I shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition but sometimes that is the only way to go.)  Below is my recent order from Amazon.I love maps.  I don't know if that is a common thing or not, but I can sit for an hour or two studying maps.  Sometimes I just like looking at the names of the towns and trying to find the funniest name.  Others, I love looking at all the creeks, lakes, etc.  Or following a river to where it begins.  And I like following railroads....oh, I am about to forget I like to look for parks and wildlife/recreational areas.The atlases above show each and every public road in Indiana and Illinois, all the little county roads, etc.  I have not had the Illinois one before, but we have wore out one of Indiana.  It is falling apart at the seams.  So, I needed a new one, and I have been wanting the Illinois one for quite a while, too.We don't travel as much in Illinois, but I think it is now more a matter of not having time.  I think when we get the time we will do more.The above books were the original intent of my order.  A bit back we got the movie Housewife 49 from Netflix to watch.  I really enjoyed it, but most times the books are better than the movies so I immediately came and did search for the books.  Since the libraries didn't have them, I checked out the bookstores and decided Amazon was the best buy.And when I am at Amazon or Barnes&Noble, or a library, I almost always look up certain key words:  Alaska, Yukon, pioneer, Tennessee, and Appalachia are almost a given.  And in doing this, I ran across the above book.  And could not resist.  It is all B&W photography;  some are of people and some are of places/things.   In the back of the book, it gives a thumbnail of the picture followed by a story about it derived from oral histories given in conversations and interviews.  It promises to be a favorite of mine."},

I really enjoyed reading your answers.Now, on with the day...I feel like I think this old mule looks to me...tired.  When Roger found out that Lorelei was not going to be here today, he suggested a couple errands.  And I added a couple more.  We spent the biggest part of the day in Terre Haute!  Was I ever glad to get home in the afternoon.We went out to eat breakfast,  to the library down there where I had a book overdue.  I just returned everything I had and came home with another load of things...audio books, DVDs, and books.  We had seen the movie Defiance about the Bielski brothers who were responsible for saving hundreds of Jews during WWII.  So I came home with a book about the brothers and have read a couple pages in it and it promises to be very good.I also came home with an audio book about Charles Shulz and Peanuts...I have listed to a bit of it and I think it will be good as well.  Now to just find time to listen to it or read the other.  I brought home a load of stuff and know that there is no hope of getting through it all...but at least I have plenty to choose from.In addition, I went to Joann fabrics where i did not find a single piece of fabric that I wanted, but I did get batting for Lorelei's new quilt.  Now to find time to get the backing made and the quilt sandwiched and quilted.  But I can dream, can't I?************I keep forgetting to tell this little tidbit about Lorelei.  Sarah told me one day last week that she was fixing supper and had Lorelei in the kitchen with her...in the high chair.  Sarah had her back to her and turned around to see her leaning out as far as she could reaching her hand out to Otto for him to lick it all the time with a big smile on her face. It is for sure in her genes that she is going to love animals....just no way of getting around it.  She gets a smile on her face and can't take her eyes off the cats here or Shelby if they are moving.*********I got to thinking about this post I read over a year ago...I had to search to find it.  I knew it was at Mrs. Nesbitt's Place, but just couldn't remember how long ago...so I  looked some this morn, but didn't have time to find it till this evening.  I laugh till I cry, but no one else seems to think it as funny as me.  So, I thought I would share it here and see if anyone else thinks it funny, or is it for people who have dogs and have had similar experiences?Lorelei is not coming today, so have a time to do a post....I was going to do one late last night and got detoured.  So here is something to look at if you came for a photograph, but what I really want is some feedback on the following....What I wanted to talk about is blogging.  I have wondered how does everyone else find the blogs they visit regularly?  I really don't remember exactly how I came across the blogs that got me started, nor do I remember whose blog was the first.  There is a handful of blogs that I know were the first ones that really got me hooked...I liked the content of their blog, and they were so friendly and their personality came through so loud and clear that I still visit them and though I may not visit every day, I do go back and check each post.  Every now and then I miss one, but it is a fluke and I generally catch it at some point in time.Also, what attracts you to a blog?  With me, it is sometimes just the photographs....and sometimes it is the writing or both.  I suppose if I had to pick just one, that photography would win, yet I love some of the writing.  There have been a few posts that I have laughed till I cried...they were so well written I could just see it all.  And I wished I had the talent to express myself so well.Does anyone else ever just sit and click that 'Next Blog\" link at the top of most blogs from blogger and do you ever find one you want to continue to visit?  Seems like most days I do that, the majority of the blogs I get will be in a foreign language, but yesterday I indulged in doing that for a while.  Though a few were in other languages, most that I came across were in English.  But I still didn't find a single one that I wanted to add to my bookmarks.And is there any blog that you have went back and looked at every single post?  There are two I have did that with, and there are others I wish I had the time to go back.....and I probably will someday.Anyway, was just wondering..."},
{"title": "Just a bit more salsa...", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2009", "text": "My older daughter came by this morn...I  had done washed jars and was in the process of gathering ripe tomatoes.  I did the skinning of the tomatoes...you know where you dip them in boiling water for just a minute then dunk them in cold and the skin comes off real easy.  And I cored them and handed them to her to cut into chunks.She cut them in really big chunks, plus took out some of the juice/seeds in the hopes that it will be a bit more chunky.   I think she will be better satisfied with the result.  She did take a couple jars of the juicy salsa home with her to share with friends when they are over.I got five more quarts out of this batch...I cannot even think how many that makes....but I am about to call it quits on the salsa.  I think I have close to enough to last us.  Though if Rachel likes this, we might make another batch.And do you see that funnel in the second picture...that is the funnel my mom had.  I would love to know how many jars it has been used to fill.  I bet most people would be amazed.  I know a few people who can, but they don't can in that amount.  Other than my sister-in-law and another neighbor down home, I can not think of anyone I personally know that really consistently cans or freezes most of the vegetables and stuff that they need..  I know I sure don't.I can remember my mom talking about so many people only know how to go to the store and buy cans of goods, little realizing that one of those days I would be one of the people going to the store.  But I do know how to can, and if I can't remember I can always ask my sister-in-law.  It is a lot of work, but I remember feeling so thankful to look at the rows and rows of jars full of food.And the other thing I think about in regards to canning...well, in relation to canning and 'going green'.  Does anyone besides me ever think about how much less garbage there would be if everyone canned the majority of what they used.  The jars are used over and over...I have two or three jars that I bet are at least 40 or 50 years old, maybe older.  They are from home, and were old when I was a kid.The only thing to throw away is the little dome lids that seals the jar....that is less than one end of a metal can of something."},

Oh, be sure and notice the birds!***********Lorelei is actually down for a nap; it probably won't last long but any is better than none.  I forgot to tell that day before yesterday I put her in her little rocker-seat while I vacuumed and she went to sleep in it before I got done.  She only slept about 20-30 minutes but that gives me a few minutes to relax....or get things done.   That was all the napping she did that day."},

I have had Lorelei all week of course, and she does keep me busy of the day.  She is so much joy to have around, even if I don't get much else done.  I should post her favorite tune...it is Elmo's world...if you hum it, whistle it, or however way you come up with doing it...she is going to look and smile.  I catch myself humming it when she isn't here even...and smile just thinking of her.Yesterday, she had a doctor's appointment for some of her immunizations, and after she left I did sew for quite a while.  I have not had time to really do much in that line in a long while.  It seems if I get on here, I find too much other stuff I want to check out.I made 4 quarts and almost 4 pints of salsa tonight...one pint is not quite full.  But that will just give me an excuse to sample it in the next few days.But canning sure takes me back home...mom canned or froze almost everything we ate.  She had shelves in the basement...I think they were about 8 feet long...and were about 20 inches deep I would think.  I can't remember for sure how many shelves there were, but I think at least 6.  If I remember correctly the top shelf didn't always have canned goods on it.  I am not real positive of that...maybe one of my brothers will read this and tell me.  And I don't think the bottom shelf was ever full...but the other three or four shelves were almost all full of canned goods.I don't know just when I started actually being much help with the canning, but I always enjoyed it as long as I can remember.  And mom sure enjoyed it.  She canned green beans, tomatoes and tomato juice, blackberries, peaches, pears, dill pickles and bread and butter pickles, made sauerkraut, and she canned a mixture of stuff that was for making vegetable soup.  I am sure I am forgetting something....oh, she always canned hot peppers also.  And I am probably still forgetting something but too tired to remember more.I don't remember how old I was when we got a freezer...it was a chest type freezer and by the end of summer it was crammed full to the brim.  Mom maybe canned a little less once we got the freezer, but not much less.  She usually could come up with a good meal, without needing anything from the store.  She always kept some meat frozen, at least chicken, and could always have plenty to go with it.  And would make a blackberry cobbler or fried apple pies, or any number of things if she wanted a dessert."},

I think that is the first time I have ever seen one not in flight.And I barely captured these butterflies....they barely paused.  Most of the time their wings continued to quiver even when they lit on the flowers.**************They bring back memories of childhood....my nephew, Glen, used to spend the summer with us.  And mom had a butterfly bush out at one end/side of the house.  We spent lots of happy hours catching butterflies...we sometimes held them captive in a canning jar I think, but eventually let them go.My nephew would catch bumblebees by easing up to one on a flower with a jar in one hand and a lid in the other.  At times he would catch two or three in the same jar.  I didn't have the nerve to catch one, let alone two or three.  Sometimes when he had a couple in a jar, they would fight with each other.  It didn't take a lot to entertain us back then.Back then there would be all kinds of butterflies...every day of the week it seemed.  Monarchs, Tiger swallowtails, Zebra swallowtails, and several little skipper types.  I cannot remember all and probably would not know the name if I could remember what they looked like.  I just know we sure enjoyed them back then and I think I enjoy seeing them just as much now, only I try to capture them in a different way.Roger wanted to get out and go for a drive today...so we headed south.  We ended up at some more strip pits...some were in the process of being reclaimed.  Others were just beautiful.  We had our rods with us and actually stopped and threw our line in for a few minutes....Roger caught a real nice bluegill.  We didn't stay long, but if I had had a zebco, with bait and bobber, I could have stayed at this one place all day.  Except Roger wanted to explore the area.I am not sure how long we drove around this area, but am sure we only saw a few of the strip pits.  We need to actually plan some of the days like this and leave really early...we left around 9:30 this morn, and it is at least an hour's drive down there.And on top of that, there are the stops we make for me to take pictures.  I guess I need to go and not take out my camera till we get there.  That would give us more time....Anyway, I noticed this flower today.

I was hoping they would grow up the fence....and they are, but they are also growing up my tomatoes and the tomato stakes.  I almost feel I am in a jungle when I am out there.But I am still glad I planted them.  I just hope I have some gourds that reach a good size.And they don't seem to slow the tomatoes down....I made 4 quarts and a pint of salsa night before last, and need to make more.  I like making salsa because I cannot find any to buy that tastes good consistently.  Year before last I made 26 quarts of it, which lasted Sarah and Jeremy and us till this year.  Though Sarah may have been out a little while.Our other daughter, Rachel, likes thick and chunky salsa, so she had rather buy her own because my salsa has lots of juice, which is the way I like it."},

I did gather a few more full-sized tomatoes but did not try to fit them in the picture.I could not believe all the cherry tomatoes...they are big cherry but little when compared to a regular tomato.I have never used them to make salsa, but they seem to have lots of flavor.  And I actually used enough of the Super Fantastic tomatoes  to make more than half the salsa.  So, it should have lots of flavor.  My salsa has a lot of juice, which is what I like.  I just hope I get to can several more jars.As for the bell peppers, we cleaned them and I cut them into strips.  I put a handful in a sandwich baggie and close the flap.  Then I place all the pepper filled sandwich baggies into a large gallon sized Ziploc baggie and freeze for later use.  I use them in chili and sometimes spaghetti sauce.  And instead of making stuffed peppers, I make a bell pepper casserole.  I also will use them in stir-fry if I don't have a fresh one available.I sure enjoy eating tomatoes straight from the garden...right now I am eating them with salt.  Later I will start using Italian salad dressing part of the time.  And have you ever taken your favorite veggies-- in my case it is tomatoes, cucumbers, cauliflower, onions, bell peppers--anyway, cut them in bite sized pieces.  Use a big bowl that has a lid, and cover with Italian dressing....let soak over night preferably.  They are so yummy and refreshing on a hot summer day."},

It was sure a sad sight to see.Everything seemed to be falling in on itself.  That is the roof in the picture below with all the green weeds growing on it.And below is one corner of the building...The actual building is mainly enclosed in a cow pasture, so is not as grown up around as is the front.One can't help but wonder why it was let ruin--maybe it was full of asbestos?  I know a couple elementary schools here in Clinton were unusable because of that.  But to me, this appears to have been let go long before the worry of asbestos."},

I think what a chore it is when I want to find new shirts/blouses.  I just absolutely hate going shopping  for clothes.  If I lived their way, it would be pretty much set and I wouldn't have to make choices.I also wonder what they think of us...running to and fro.  But then, they hire English drivers and still use our ways, even though they may not have them right in their home.And I think about the phone...they don't have a phone ringing interrupting a meal, nor interrupting visiting with someone.  Yet, if I were Amish, I would not be talking to my brother at least once or twice a week, or any other family member on a whim.  It would be a great deal more trouble to talk to someone that was far away.I guess if you have never known any thing different, you don't feel like you are missing anything."},

I took this one of the blue heron from inside the Rav.  I tried to get out and get close, but soon as I stepped around the Rav, it took off.The sky was absolutely amazing that evening. We had started out to go to this nearby little town to get an ice cream cone, not even realizing what the sky looked like. We took a side road trying to find a place to capture it....and I did take other pictures there, but none of them are very good. So, we went on and had our ice cream, and before we got home Roger asked me if I wanted to go on to the strip pits. I never say no to that, so out there is where we ended up. Even when we got to the strip pits, the ones to the west and northwest are not as good as I wish they were.  Even so, the one above kind of gives you a feel for it.Then these other two are taken just about 3 minutes later, looking east and southeast.  I need to do a collage of all the photos I have looking down this road...and the changing weather.  I even need to get all my pictures labeled and just see how many are from out there.  It would be a big percentage.   I don't have Bright Eyes for a few days...her mom just got through working 7 days and is off for two or three.

She wondered if he stays home now.  The answer is no, he doesn't.  So far he doesn't leave as often, though I am honestly about afraid to say that.  And he's skinny!  He comes home with all kinds of little burrs.  My older daughter was up and she thought he was Puss Puss he was so little.  If you met him out anywhere, you would swear that no one loves him.  He eats....he just don't put any way back on.  Now he is even more like the Cougar he was named after.  If he would only be like him--my original Cougar was never out of earshot that I remember.  If I called his name, he would be here shortly. I had something else happen that I was/am almost too embarrassed to tell. Remember I took  Cougar to the vet for his cold, and that was on a Saturday?  The following Monday, Bubbie was not at the door waiting, but when I stepped out the door enough to call his name he came from around the house, slinking in and looking back over his shoulder like something was after him.He came in and ran to our bedroom, did not bother to eat.  I went and got him, and brought him back to feed him, but he turned right around and ran back to our bedroom again.  He did not eat nor drink, nor come out of our room for about 36 hours.  We thought he was going to die, but decided to just wait and see.  He came out a few times after that first 36 hours, I had brought kitty litter up from the basement because he just seemed to weak to do anything.I forgot to mention that we could not find any kind of sore or sore spot on him.  We checked him over two or three times.  Nothing. Remember this happened on Monday morn early, before Lorelei got here.  Tuesday night and Wednesday he was out a few times, ate just a bite or two and drank a little bit.  Then he spent another 36 hours in our room, not moving.  I think he went to the kitty litter once.  I get up before daylight Saturday morn, and he is in the living room, and barely breathing.  I had to feel of him to tell that he was still alive...he did not respond at all.  I got my pillow and laid on the floor with him for a while...finally got up and went back to bed. I would not get up before Roger because I didn't want to be the one to find him dead.  So laid there and waited, and Roger got up...and he didn't come back.  So, I got up to see what was going on, and Bubbie was in the kitchen waiting for Roger to feed him.  And he has basically not looked back; well he had one day of not being himself...but seems to feel fine now.We both would love to know what happened...the first time he went outside after that, he was definitely afraid.  He was looking up and around like he was afraid something would get him.  He basically stays in the yard.  He comes in and sleeps all day, and likes to go out at night.  But almost any time I look out or go outside, he is somewhere near."},

We always called these wasps bee wolves, but in googling that it appears to be the wrong wasp for that name.  Tomorrow I will try looking in my National Audubon insect book and see if I can come up with anything.Anyway, it would try to fly with it and could almost take off, but not quite make it.  Then it would crawl around and eventually try to take it through the cracks in the porch but it was too big to fit through that.  It eventually got tired of trying and left it laying there, to be enjoyed by the cats later.  Or at least Mama Cat...she batted it around for a while and then left it laying.We made a quick run through the strip pits this evening and it was strange.  Usually, the red-winged blackbirds are just everywhere you look.  I don't think we saw a single one for the first mile or mile and a half.  But there were chimney sweep/swallow type birds everywhere and they had not been there before.    And little white butterflies were abundant, but this is the only monarch I seen.  I took several pictures of it, with this being one of my favorites.I am heading for bed...Lorelei will be here in the morning.  Yeah!  I can't wait to see her smile!"},

So, since tomorrow is Sunday, I might as well post some photos of this church we passed over in Illinois on our way to Willow Slough the other day.I don't remember the town it was in, and though we drove on two sides of it, we did not see a name anywhere.  It was surely there, but we sure did not see it.I really liked these features of it...I am just amazed at some of the architecture seen every where you go.  But I thought this was an extra nice church.  If I remember correctly it was a very small town...in the middle of farm country.I always wonder who goes to churches this size out in the middle of no where.  I don't know the size of the farms in this area, but I do know that farmhouses and barns are much fewer and far between than around here.I have called other lilies tiger lilies, but when I saw these, it made me wonder if they are the real thing.  Does anyone know or is tiger lily just a general term as I have used it for years or does it belong to a specific one?"},

Roger stopped and we gathered /picked them....and had them two or three times as snacks over the next few days.On over in the woods, were more but most of them were done past the picking stage.  If not, we would have had some to freeze.  We have frozen them before and had good success."},

{"title": "Neal, does this bring back memories?", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2009", "text": "The other day, Neal responded to this post by telling me I forgot the smell of new mown hay--and he was right.  It is one of those smells that I love and that take me to childhood.  I never see loads of hay like this without thinking of my brothers....and them coming in all hot and dusty.  It was a hard job but they did it and never complained that I ever heard.We didn't own a haybaler or rake either, but my older brother helped two or three other farmers so much that he was always welcome to use their equipment, and I know one of them always baled for him, but don't know if they did the raking.  I think he did the raking, and they started bailing, and when George got done raking, they started the process of loading and hauling in the hay.I think they held the record for getting in the most hay in one day....Neal don't remember this, but I am almost positive I remember them putting up a bit over a 1,000 bails in one day.  I don't know who drove for them, I am thinking it might have been my other brother....but it was just George and Neal to load and haul it and put it in the barn.  That is the part that makes it a record in my opinion.  It was well after dark when they got done.....but it was done.Well, storms are moving in and Lorelei will be here shortly.  I best get moving and get this posted till I can unplug the computers."},

We decided to do part of the route on not so well traveled roads, and this house was the first thing I wanted to photograph.  Another history I wish I knew.  I can't help but wonder if it was something more than a home at one time.  And I wonder has it always been brick.  And that window in the peak--I have not seen anything like it before.  I wonder it is is original to the house, or added later."},

{"title": "Not your usual apartment complex....", "date": "Saturday, July 11, 2009", "text": "The other day while out for our drive, I took some quick snapshots of birdhouses at some of the Amish farms.  I think I  need to get serious about taking photos of these...try to get better backgrounds, etc.  Seems to me that a lot of the Amish have them.And I am trying to grow some gourds this year, but not sure if I got them out early enough to do any good.  But I would like to have something like the ones above.And I am tempted to have Roger build me something like the above one.  I just wonder if we would have birds come to it.*************I do have wrens, but they are shier than the ones we had at home.  They are the House Wren and not the Carolina Wren...I will take either one.  But deep down I wish it was the Carolina Wren...which is what we had at home.  Either one though has such a happy song...you can scroll on down on those pages and listen to them.I have yet to get a good picture of them, but am going to have to do it soon...I saw them taking in a something to feed their babies.  So it probably won't be long till they leave the nest.  I just hope the wrens stay around.  I had Carolina Wrens one year, but they never stayed...I hear one occasionally, but they are always just passing through.***********I need to get my camera out and have it ready for Lorelei...I am having her of the weekends right now.  I meant to get it out today and didn't get it done.  She is changing, but I am wondering if anyone else will see it besides us that have her.  It is partly looks, but a lot her actions. She still smiles at Shelby, really smiles at Sarah's old dog Keesha, but not so much at Otto the American Staffordshire Terrier, Otto.  She has started noticing and feeling of Roger's beard, and she was pulling my hair so bad it hurts.Otto wants to lick Lorelei so bad, and gets her feet every chance he gets.  He also manages to throw a guilt trip on me every time I am over there...he will just sit and stare at me and I know he is wondering why I don't spend more time with him.  And I would but he wants to play so bad, and he wants to get in my lap...his fun thing is for me to throw stick/toy/whatever is handy for a while, and then he wants to climb in my lap...which his mom and dad want discouraged.Oh, and Lorelei helped me feed Mama Squirrel again today.  Now this is odd...if Roger or I move our hands suddenly when she is eating...even if she just took the nut from our hand she will jump.  I was holding Lorelei with my left arm and had given her a nut or two and then laid the rest on top of a fence post and she was up there eating.  Lorelei and I were standing right there practically touching the post...and Lorelei was just swinging one arm around and Mama didn't pay her any attention at all.  I honestly wonder if she realizes that she is a baby?"},
{"title": "A little thistle here.....I think.", "date": "Thursday, July 9, 2009", "text": "Edited to add:Thanks to Mary, I now know this plant is Teasel.   I figured it had a different name, and I remember seeing the name elsewhere now that I see it again.I am assuming this is another thistle...I should have taken a picture of the leaves, but it was sprinkling so I was hurrying.  I did not know there were so many kinds, if this is indeed another thistle. The leaves were different to any I have ever seen,and the flower was bigger than any I have seen so far.    I told Roger I would almost like to have some in our yard, they were so pretty.  Almost.  I am afraid of what might happen if I brought some home.  The plant itself was as tall as me, and the leave were long and skinny....an inch wide at the most.  And prickly just like the rest of the plant.  I would not want to grab hold of it by mistake!************Last night I was warming up some leftover soup beans that I had frozen sometime back to have for a quick meal.  I put them on to heat, turned the oven on to preheat for cornbread, and ran out and got a couple green tomatoes from the garden, cut them up and put them in a bag and threw in enough cornmeal to coat the green tomatoes and sat them aside.  I stuck a pan on top of the stove with a little oil in it to heat while I quickly made up a pan of cornbread and stuck it in the oven.  Then I fried the green tomatoes....Just as everything was ready, Roger came by and I told him I felt just like mommy...she could always have a meal on the table in such a short time.  And this meal was one she would have fixed.  It may not sound like much to some people, but it is one of my favorite meals.And it brought to mind that some of the simpler things in life are really what makes us happy.  There are always the big ones like good health, good doctors, our freedom that so many of us take for granted.  Things like that.But just think of the things that gladden your heart to think of.Of course at the top of my list is Lorelei's smile...it melts my heart.  The way she looks at me and smiles when she gets here in the morning and will duck her head into her mom's shoulder and then raise back up and look at me.  Who could ever resist a face like that?  But maybe she is one of the big things in life.Hearing the wrens sing here, even though it isn't Carolina wrens, still makes me smile every morn.  If I don't sit outside before Lorelei gets here, then we sit outside as her mom leaves and we talk about the wrens.  The wrens here and the Dickcissels out at the strip pits make me smile.  I love the other birds, but something about their singing is extra special for me.And the smell of honeysuckle!  I would love to have it growing in my yard...I am talking about what we normally call honeysuckle...the vine.  I take deep, deep breaths every time I smell it...if I can, I break off some to bring home.  Smelling it takes me instantly to Tennessee...Dolly Parton sure knew how to write a song when she wrote My Tennessee Mountain Home.I guess smell plays a big part in my life...and so much of the time it is smells that take me back home.  Besides honeysuckle, there is the smell of woodsmoke!  I always wish I could just bottle it or capture it in a candle to burn.  Or the smell of old dead morning glory vines in the fall..when I was at the orchard, I would sometimes stir up that smell and it took me to the tobacco patch of my youth.  If I would have closed my eyes, I would have swore that I was there.Hearing a friend's voice on the phone....or getting a letter.  Remember a while back I wrote about how much handwritten letters mean....something to hold in my hand?  One of my best friends in life set down and wrote me a letter and I got it a couple days later in a card.  It is one of my cherished possessions.When Roger and I lived in Tennessee, she and I lived almost within sight of each other.  We talked every day on the phone, and usually even visited each other every day.  I miss those days!  So I guess I am saying that as I grow older I really appreciate friendship more.  Just thinking of my childhood friends brings a smile to my face...and I think of the things we used to do.So take a moment...and think about the small things in life that make it so much better.  I am not naming near all I should.  Maybe I will write more at a later date...but right now it is almost 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 is not too far off.  Lorelei is supposed to be here by 5:30 so I should be heading to bed.We went for a slow drive yesterday....and seen several deer.  I didn't get any really good shots, but am showing some I got any way.  The mother above had a little fawn with her, but they took flight...we figured there was a fawn with her but it was hidden until they took off.The one above is another mother....she is on one side of the road and her fawn is on the other....and we are between them.  I took a couple quick shots, even got one of the fawn but it is so dark and nothing I do in Photoshop makes it look much better.And this is a first time ever for me--seeing a fawn nursing.  Probably the first and last time I ever see it in fact.And then there were these two bucks...we wondered if they were twins....they sure are handsome fellows.***********I am probably going to Sarah's again, so I may not get any visiting in today either."},
{"title": "Things from my yard....", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2009", "text": "I am trying to get a post ready to go before I have to get ready to go to Terre Haute.  Wasn't sure what to post, but was out in the yard this morn so thought I would show you a few things I captured there.First of all, here is my handsome kitty, Cougar.  He seems to be fully recovered from his cold.  He and all the cats were out there with me.  Even Bubbie went outside, but he got in the Lily of the Valley and all you could see of him was just bits here and there.Then we have this.  Yep, it is a hornet's nest being built.  It is on our old garage....right by the sidewalk we have to use to go to the new garage.I was about two feet away taking these pictures.  Which is fine in good weather.  If we always had good weather I would just leave it.  But when storms start moving in, it has been my experience that at least honey bees and these type of bees get a little bit meaner.Do you wonder what I mean by 'my experience?'  Well, we rented honey bees and had a hive or two near the blackberries when I worked at the orchard.  They set just a few feet off the road...and lots of times I walked up to within 3 or 4 feet of them and they didn't seem to mind.  Later on in the summer, a storm was moving in, and I was down there trying to get some blackberries picked, and I was at least 75-100 feet away from the hives and they came chasing me down.  No joke.  I had to run for my life....well, maybe not life.  But I don't like to be stung.  By anything.Several times we had hornet's nests in the apple trees.  One particular year, there was one in the Jonathan's....again, normally, I would get right up to them and them pay me no mind.   This one day I was picking, and just something about the way they were keeping vigil, I didn't even pick on the tree they were in.  I got the one before it and the one after it.  I was okay...but I forgot to tell Michael who took over when I left.  So he came down the other side of the row...and he got stung two or three times.  I guess the storm was closer, because they got after him a couple trees away.Since those times, I give all bees lots of room if the weather is changing...Notice the sacs on this bee...And notice the tomatoes....not a single one is ripe.  At least of the regular tomatoes.  We did bring one of the little cherry tomatoes in.  But have not eaten it.Not sure when I will be back on...not sure if I am bringing Lorelei here in the morn or just staying at Sarah's."},

{"title": "Rainy days", "date": "Saturday, July 4, 2009", "text": "Please click and enlarge all photos to really get the feel of this day!If you enlarge the photo above, you can see the rain.  This little fellow was shy.  It was raining to hard to leave my window down, so you see raindrops on the window.  And I took a couple of him, but he would try to get behind his mama.  So, decided to go on and not scare him.We were happy to have time to take a drive over to Arthur, Illinois today.  That is Amish Country.  It never stopped raining once this whole day long.  Not even sure if it has quit now.  I wanted to go to a quilt shop, to look for some orange fabric.On the way home, we took some side roads and seen so many foals.  One farm had lots and lots of horses/mares with foals.  The only thing with driving over there is there is never any room to pull off the road, and there is always light traffic even on the back roads.  So there was no way to count how many there were.  I know at least 50-75 grown horses, and a bunch of young ones.  Just amazing to see.********************Then, I came home and got on here and have been emailing back and forth off and on all night with my one of my best friends who also happens to be my sister-in-law.  Looking at old, old pictures Neal scanned and shared with us.  From our childhood.  You can see one of them here.  My friend is married to my brother George.Each of my brothers is special to me...I would have done anything for George.  I am not sure when that started....not even sure just why I was that way by him but I was.  He was just my hero.  That about says it all.Neal was the one I always got to read me stories before I learned to read.  I also remember going to the barn with him to milk some times.  He could take a full bucket of milk and swing it all the way around--and not spill any.  I am talking swinging it overhead, and it upside down.  I thought that was magic I guess.And then there was Robert...he teased me and aggravated the living daylight out of me.  Anything he could do to make me yell, or get mad...he done.  I can't even remember what all he done now...I just remember flying mad at him.  Our mom just let us fuss, and would tell me if I would not respond, that he would quit.  And I suppose she was right.  I can remember him taking a handful of cockle burs and rubbing them in my hair.  He called me Molly simply because at that time I hated the name...he even called me that in his sleep.Yet we did things together... he had friends come and spend the day and sometimes all night and he always let me tag along in whatever they did.  He never tried to get our mom to make me stay home.  I was just one of the gang.  I cannot even remember what all we done, I just remember being glad they came.  I think we used to go to this dump and shoot B-B guns at cans and bottles, etc, and I think we would go and find grapevine swings to swing on.And Robert was always working on something...if I would have been a willing helper I could have learned a lot.  Instead, as I got older I did not want to help him on his go cart or his cars.  Now I think how dumb I was not to paid attention and learned how to do stuff.***********There just aren't too many photos of us growing up...a few taken by visitors and a few school pictures.   We didn't even get those every year.  I have two yearbooks from high school...I may be the only one of us kids to have yearbooks from high school.  And there are a few pictures like the one below that my older sisters or someone has taken.  And yes, that is me below."},
{"title": "Dragonfly", "date": "Friday, July 3, 2009", "text": "I know I posted a picture of a dragonfly very, very similar to this last Saturday, but I like this one so much better.  It was taken today, at a totally different place.  We went on a short drive and I took this near Big Raccoon Creek.********************We have had really nice weather this week....two or three of the days I actually needed to leave Lorelei in her sleepers because it never got much over 70°F, if any at all.  I didn't have her today since her mom and dad got the day off. I have told you how she grins and laughs at our old dog, Shelby.  Well, yesterday, she noticed her panting and started laughing about that.  I was in my chair and Shelby was out to the left of me.  I don't know what possessed me, but I put the mirror over on my right till she could see herself.  First she would look at Shelby and either grin or laugh...then she would twist way around and look at herself in the mirror and grin real big.  She did that over and over.I have also told you how Shelby is by her and how she has relaxed a lot about it...well, one day, I had the door to her room pushed till it was almost closed when she was taking her nap.  Shelby started going to it wanting in, and looking back at us. We looked at each other and thought 'she's awake' and went in there and sure enough she was in there just looking around and stretching, etc.  Not crying or anything.  Shelby would sure have made a good mommy...but if we had let her have puppies it would probably have broken her heart to give them up.**************For supper tonight we had grilled chicken breasts.  And I thought I would tell you what makes them so delicious....it is McCormick Broiled Steak Seasoning.  Yes, I mean steak....I think they have come out with something for grilled chicken but they are just so good with this stuff. All you do is take skinless, boneless chicken breasts and sprinkle them liberally with the Broiled Steak Seasoning and cook on the grill.  We also will brush them with butter midway through.  I have a tendency to cook them overdone, but Roger is real good at cooking them till they are done completely but still juicy.  I usually butterfly the breast till it won't be so thick through.They are delicious in a salad, or for a sandwich.  Or I prefer them just plain."},
{"title": "Want to come sit a spell?", "date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2009", "text": "Has anyone missed me?  Nothing is wrong...my niece came down Monday and just left this morning.  I just couldn't seem to get on here to visit or to do a post.I so wish I could have a visit from an old friend or two--and that we had a fireplace or  a stove to sit beside.  I am just lonesome for them.  And there is nothing better in this world for me than to sit by the fire and talk.  We actually had a stove, not quite as good looking as the one above when I was a kid.  That was what heated our house....needless to say, the back bedrooms were plenty cool in the winter.I think I have told before about waking up and yelling for my mom to come and get me...and she would come and take me to the kitchen with her where she cooked on an old cook stove.  I have been googling and trying to find a photo similar to either the old heating stove or the wood cook stove we had and did not have any luck worth showing.  I had no luck at all with a heating stove that looked like ours, but there were a couple tiny, tiny pictures of a cook stove that was similar to the one we had, but they were too small to really see any detail.  So I am not going to link to them.It was always a big deal in the spring/summer when the decision was finally made that we could take the heating stove down because the weather was finally warm enough till we wouldn't need it any more.  I vaguely remember my brothers wrestling with it to get it outside...I had the impression that it was really heavy but not sure if I am right or not.  I think we got a wood furnace when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, so my memories of the stove are sort of vague.I do remember them having to be careful with the stovepipe....not wanting to get soot everywhere.   The funny thing is, I have no recollection at all of when it was put back up in the fall...none.  What I always remember is that we could rearrange the living room when it was taken down for the summer.  Again, I know we had to rearrange the living room when it was put back up, but I don't remember that.**************Lorelei has changed since last week...hard to explain.  Just more wiggly for one thing.  And she is so interested in what is going on around her that she has a hard time closing her eyes to take a nap.  She 'sings' just a little bit every day.  Usually when she is laying across my shoulder going to sleep.  It is the sweetest sound I know.  After she goes home, I will think I hear her wake up and start to go get her only to realize that she isn't even here.  And Roger went fishing with one of his buddies Friday, and he said all day he kept thinking he heard one of her toys!Now, to fill in a little of what else has been happening.  Since Cougar was gone that one time for so long, he stayed pretty close to home for a short while.  Then he started to roam again.  Still, usually home shortly after I would get up of the morn.  Then, last week, he left one night was not home the next morn, and did not come home all day....I really did not expect to see him again.  As hot as it was, I just did not see how he could survive getting locked in some hot garage.But after the second night, I looked out the back door, and there he was.  Sooo skinny.  Nothing but skin and bones...he had lost weight after that first time, but now you could feel and see every bone in his body.  You would never dream that he was a much loved cat.  He ate two cans of catfood, and went and found a place to sleep.Next thing I knew, I realized he had a really bad upper respiratory infection.  So, took him to the vet when Saturday came and he is now on antibiotics.  And he does not want to stay inside at all.  He runs out if he gets half a chance.And remember Bubbie?  Since his accident, he had gotten back to normal.  One of the most curious cats I have ever seen.  The other day, I walked into Roger's fly-tying room, and I have two bookshelves in there that are over 7 ft. tall...he was up on top of them.  I think the only thing he hasn't been on top of is my china cabinet and that is because it has never struck his fancy.Anyway, he basically has been sleeping inside of the day and spending the night out.  No matter when I go out, he is usually laying on the front porch or back porch.  He doesn't venture far.  So, I was surprised Monday morn...he wasn't waiting at the door but he did come in just a second.  And he was slinking in, looking back over his shoulder like something was after him.He went straight to our bedroom, I went and got him and brought him out to eat but he wanted nothing do with food nor water.  He finally ate a couple bites yesterday, and actually came out of our bedroom once.  Today, he has come out several times...but is still not himself.  We cannot find any place where he has been hurt.  Nothing seems to hurt him when we press and feel of his body.  So your guess is as good as mine as to what has happened to him.  I guess he will slowly be back to normal.I guess I best be going to give Cougar his medicine...before I totally forget!"},

I have tried to find a good image of it and no luck so far.  Feel free to tell me what it really is in the comments if you know.  It was growing at the edge of a cattail pond/big puddle.  I am not sure what the correct term is...not really big enough to be called a pond, but bigger than a puddle.  I am sure if and when the frequent rains stop, that they will be dry, but for right now seem to hold just enough water to keep things going.I am enjoying a semi-lazy day...do have some things I need to do but had rather just sit and do nothing.   Roger fixed a pork roast on the grill while I cooked breakfast, so after a bit, we will have it along with whatever else I decide to fix.Roger's buddy taught him a way to fix pork roasts.  Of course there are no measurements...but he coats the outside with black pepper, sage, and garlic.  Then cooks it on low heat on the grill till it is done.  The outside is usually sort of crispy, and the inside tender and juicy, and is delicious.  I have not decided which pork roast is best for fixing this way...we don't fix them that often and I forget which was good and which was just so-so.I had best get moving, and try to do something constructive.  Little Miss Lorelei keeps me busy through the week.  She is such a funny little girl...she looks for Shelby when we ask her 'Where's Shelby?\" and she almost always smiles at her, and sometimes laughs.  There seems to be no certain thing that makes her laugh.And either Wednesday or Thursday, I had given her her mid-day bottle and had put her up to burp her.  She started snuggling down into me...hard to explain it but it is just something she does.  Then she laughed a little bit.  Well, I keep a hand mirror sitting there so I turned it to where she could see herself and she really started laughing.  I called for her Grandpa to come see and hear.  He started talking to her and then there were these big belly laughs....I had him get me the phone and I quick called Sarah so she could here.  I laughed till I cried....Then Friday both her mom and dad came to pick her up early, and Jeremy was singing the song Lorelei by Styx to her, and using a crazy voice to sing in, and she was totally captivated.  Her grin could not have been any bigger.  He is such a good daddy to her."},

If you want to see more animals or to participate, click on the badge above.As we were coming home from Illinois yesterday evening, we made just a very slight detour through the strip pit area.I had my camera with me, and stopped to take a few pictures.  I even got my first half decent picture of a dragonfly.The milkweeds had lots of activity going on...the monarch caterpillars were really active on a couple of them.  I should have counted how many there were but didn't think about it at the time.  Plus there were the other creatures.And I know I have posted pictures of the Dickcissel before, but I cannot resist these from last night.  They just seem to be one of the happiest little birds. They sit and sing their heart out.  Even if they become frightened and fly, they only fly a few feet and promptly start singing again.I am far behind on blog visits...night before last we had a storm move through.  Even though the storm did not seem that bad, we had a power outage for just a minute.  When that happened I went ahead and unplugged the computers....even though everything is on a surge protector, I just do not fully trust it.Then yesterday morn, I got up, plugged everything back in, and tried to sign on before Lorelei got here.  It just wasn't happening on my computer.  I finally got on Rogers and got signed on, but never did here.  To make a long story short, some how or other, the settings on the router had gotten changed.  I half way had it figured out, but didn't want to chance doing what I thought should be done till I talked to my brother Neal.  And to do that, I had to wait till Lorelei went home. Hopefully, I will get a visit in to everyone by the time this day is over.  I do have tons of stuff to do, though so visiting will be just a few here and a few there."},

With babysitting our granddaughter, time passes so quickly and I get very little time to be on here.Please click and enlarge for best viewing.However, as many of you know I make regular visits to a place I call the strip pit area which is a former place of coal mining.  The land is privately owned now and all my photos from that area are taken from the road.If you click on the label strip pits, you might see the reason I return there so regularly.  There is quite a bit of wild life to be seen most of the time, and sunsets never fail to impress me.  I will swear to myself that I have enough sky pictures, but I don't think I have ever came home from there without having taken some sky pictures.So here more for your enjoyment....at least I hope you enjoy them.If you want to join the fun, click on the badge at the top of this post.  Skywatch is hosted by Fishing Guy, Klaus, Sandy, Ivar, Wren, and Louise.Weekend before last when we took off on a drive, we really had not particular plans to go anywhere.  We ended up heading north....and it kind of reminded me of when I used to run back and forth to Purdue University when the kids were there.  And thinking of that reminded me of Big Pine Creek that we visited last year.  It was a creek we crossed over every time the trip to Purdue was made.So, in the back of my mind I was heading to find that creek....last year when we were there we didn't have our fishing poles with us.  Now, we almost always have them with us the same way I have my cameras.I am not sure what made me notice it, but I noticed the Big Shawnee Creek on the map...and started directing Roger on the turns to make.  I eventually told him what I was trying to find.The first place we found it, there was no place to park without parking in someone else's yard, so had to back track and find a new place.  We actually found two more places, but this was my favorite.  We did throw in our lines from the bridge, and kept getting hits on our little jigs.  We definitely want to go back sometime when we have more time.It was a very pleasant place to be, but with that name, I wondered about its history.  I wondered if Tecumseh ever crossed this creek, and how many times.---------------Lorelei was her usual cheerful self today.  She was asleep when she got here, but that didn't last long.  It was not quite so humid so we started the day sitting out on the porch in the swing, and Roger put an outlet out there, and brought the fan in from the garage before noon.  We used it later in the day.  She totally enjoyed being out there....she is her mama and grandmama's child for sure when it comes to that.And once after her bottle she just sang and sang to me...I put her up to my shoulder to burp her, and she lay there against me and just sang and sang.  Then I started singing and she sang along with me.  We honestly think she was singing and not jabbering.  I sing little crazy things to her all the time--at least that is what I call it.  And she doesn't know the difference yet. Then when I was telling Sarah about it when she called on her break, and she said that Jeremy sings to her all the time...only he can really sing.  I have never wanted a camcorder or anything like that, but I have a feeling I am really going to want one one of these days.  I would love to have a way to record her little voice for everyone to hear.  I told Roger if she does it tomorrow, we are calling Sarah even if she is at work."},
{"title": "I hit the jackpot!", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2009", "text": "The other evening at the strip pits, I seen these milkweed bloom pods so I went over to bet pictures of the bloom.  But as I was trying to take a picture of the milkweed itself, I seen movement.  I got to looking and first only seen this moth.So in taking pictures of it, I seen the other bugs. I am not sure how many different bugs were on it, but there were several.  Just click and enlarge these and see what all you see.I have not had time to look up what any of these are, so feel free to comment if you know.  I am sure I have looked the ones in the middle picture up before, but for the life of me I cannot remember what they are.-----------------It was another hot one here in the Midwest....for sure here in Indiana.  The humidity makes it miserable to be outside.  Though Lorelei and I did sit outside for a while right before she was to go home and she enjoyed it.  I got to thinking that Roger has a fan out in the garage, so am going to have him bring it for the front porch tomorrow.I did a load of clothes and hung them out and they were practically bone dry in less than two hours.  It sort of surprised me with the humidity being so high.  I still love to hang clothes on the line, even though I don't do it as much as I used to.When we were kids, mom had a wringer washer and used it even after we got an automatic washer.  Things were done in a certain way...from the washing to the hanging on the line.  Not sure I can remember just exactly how things were washed...I think sheets were washed first, followed by towels and then underwear, or vice versa, then our shirts and dresses, followed last of all by the jeans which could sure get dirty with farm work.Mom wanted sheets hung over the line of course down the middle, and towels were hung from the top...I think everyone hangs them that way....but the wash rags were hung just from one corner so as not to take up to much space.  Our dresses she wanted hung from the shoulder seams, as well as the t-shirts.  And jeans were hung from the waistband.  And she wanted each thing hung together...shirts with shirts, dresses with dresses, etc.  Not a shirt, then a dress, then another shirt.Mom usually hung a load or two  out, but would have me hang up the last loads....it just now crossed my mind that I wonder if she hung out the sheets cause she didn't want to risk me dropping one on the ground.  Probably it was more that she liked to do laundry and liked to at least hang a load or two.And we used to bring it in and a lot of it had to be ironed...we would bring a load in in our arms and either throw it on the couch or the bed, and hang what could be hung, but a lot of it we sprinkled with water and wadded it up in a ball to be ironed the next day or so.  I must say that I never loved ironing then and I don't love it now.  Unless it is to do with quilting...I think now about how much less water was used with a wringer washer...there are times I wish I had a good wringer washer now.  I still enjoy laundry as a rule...there is a smell I love when I walk in someone else's house and they are doing laundry.  For some reason I don't notice it much when I am the one doing laundry."},

It don't look too bad from this angle, but from the angle of approach, he was hardly noticeable. He eventually took off and went to the bank across the strip pit.  There he really did blend in till he was hardly noticeable.  Most of the ones I see out there take off before I ever have a chance to take a single picture.  I don't know why this one stood around as long as it did.---------------Lorelei was on the solemn side for her today.  Just quiet a big part of the day.  However, right before her mom picked her up she started laughing at Shelby.  First Shelby came up sniffing of her feet and that got Lorelei started smiling.  Then we were talking to Shelby and she was going from Roger to us, and back to him and she started laughing out lout at her.It was hot and miserable here today...so hot we didn't enjoy sitting in the swing very much.  And I think Lorelei definitely missed it.  We are talking about getting a fan to have out there to keep the air moving around a little bit...but we shall see.Right now, I am going to post this and head to bed.Please click to enlarge for a better view!If not a partridge in a pear tree.....then how about a bob white on a hay bale?I had not been out to the strip pits in a little while so decided to make a run through this evening late.  As I have said before I am not seeing near the critters that I was seeing, but still managed a few captures.  I took about a dozen of this bob white...they all were similar so I just chose these two to show. I was almost through my first run when I was headed down the hill and happened to glance at this these bales of hay and almost didn't see him perched up there.  I took several pictures from my Rav4, but then got out...the top picture is the first I took and the bottom one is a cropped version of the last one I took of him.  And it is a male...notice the white stripe above the eye and I call it a white beard. I think most of us know the standard bob white call...and I did do that and he was stretching and looking.  But there is another call that I used to could do that would for sure bring them in close...my brother George was who taught it to me.  I have never heard anyone else do it, and I have been searching the internet trying to find an audio of it, but the only one I can find is the standard bob-white one, but I did find where they have several different calls.I do think they are a handsome little bird....and does anyone else remember the book, Robert, the Quail?  I read that when I was a kid and don't really remember much about it, except that I really liked it.  Anyway, seeing this fellow brought it to mind, and maybe next time I am at the library I will look for it."},
{"title": "From the garden...over a week ago", "date": "Sunday, June 21, 2009", "text": "See that little bitty bell pepper...this was taken on the 12th.  Of this month.  They are now at least 2 inches if not 3 inches long. That little jungle of tomato plants is the little cherry type tomatoes...they were planted a couple weeks before the Super Fantastics below.  The cherry tomatoes had several little tomatoes back then but so far none are ripe.'My' tomatoes were blooming when I took these pictures, but now have several tomatoes.  A ripe one is still a long way in the future...at least for these.When I was a kid, I loved the tiny tomatoes....what we call cherry tomatoes now.   I don't know why, but we never raised them...when I was a teen, I remember some coming up in the flower bed in front of the porch.  I think they were volunteers...but by then they had lost a lot of their appeal to me.Back to when I was just a kid, you know 8 or 10 years old...somewhere along that age...we had a neighbor that lived up the road from us.  And every now and then he would bring a bag of those tiny tomatoes to us...I always had the impression at that time that he brought them just for me but don't really know it for sure.His name was Zack, and it would either be him or his son, Leonard.  Zack did not drive a car...but he had a Ford tractor.  If he needed to run down to the store, he would get on it and we would see him pass by.  If I was outside, sometimes he would throw me some change, other times he would yell something like \"Loaded for Bear!\"  I don't remember if there were any words preceding those, nor do I have any idea how he came up with saying it.  But I always smile when I think of that now.  I think it was just his way of being funny.And I am pretty sure it was him that would sometimes come down and sit on our front porch with a towel wrapped around him while our mom  cut his hair. I actually think she did this for him and one other neighbor.  She had no training, and I really do not know how good she was at it.  I don't know who cut their hair the rest of the time, but I definitely don't feel like mom cut it all the time."},

Every now and then, we would get to have a candy bar and a Pepsi...or ice cream and Pepsi.  Pepsi was our choice of pop back then.   That was back when candy bars were either a nickel or a dime.  (Remember there was a time when there was a small candy bar for a nickel and a bigger one for a dime?)  And pop was a dime a bottle...I don't remember what a half gallon of ice cream cost.  I suppose there is some place on the web to look that up but just not going to try right now.But the reason for the picture of the donuts is this.  I seriously doubt if I ever have or see donuts that it don't take me back to childhood.  Our mom and dad were friends with a couple by the name of Jot and Molly--Jot's real name was Clarence but everyone called him Jot.  I have no idea why...and don't know how or when they all became acquainted...they were friends as long as I can remember. Anyway, they would come by every so often and open up the trunk of their car...at least I remember them doing that one time.  I am assuming that is how they did every time.  Anyway, it would be full of things like white bread and donuts, and I think the little single packaged fruit pies.  And probably other stuff, but I can't recall what all else they had. We thought they went to Knoxville to buy all of it...and don't know if  I knew it then or since then realized that they probably went to a day old bread store to buy the stuff...knowing them, they probably bought it when it was too old for the day old store.But what I remember is the yeast donuts...packaged single.  I actually remember mom buying them two for a nickel.   And they were stale...sometimes we would heat them in the oven a  bit and they would come back to life a little bit.  But they were just sooo good with coffee.  I drank coffee from as far back as I can remember....actually my brothers might say that back then I liked a little coffee with my cream but I don't think I was quite that bad.  But then again, maybe I was.To this day I like to get yeast donuts and leave the sack or box open and let them get a little stale...it doesn't get much better than that."},

It was so funny---she was holding them up in front of her face and moving them around, more her left hand than her right....but her eyes would just get so big.But the fun thing I have to tell about is when Sarah was about ready to leave with her, she wanted to change her diaper for the ride home.  She laid her down and started talking to her;  remember Lorelei loves to go have her diaper changed.  She will almost always smile and jabber to me. Sarah started saying 'Jujitsu' and 'Karate' to  her and one or two other words...and she had a big smile on her face when she said them, and would do little motions with her hands.  Every time she said them, Lorelei laughed out loud...kind of a belly laugh-giggle.  Over and over!  Her mom and I had tears from laughing so hard at her."},

Aren't they wonderful?  Just so very beautiful.I have been looking at images at google...I think these are different to the thistles we generally see.  I wondered if they were milk thistle but cannot say for sure.It is getting late and time for me to head to bed...Lorelei will be here in the morning.  So I need to get some much needed sleep.  If you get time, google thistle and see if you think this might be milk thistle.  Or if you know for sure tell me.  I also seen this spear thistle, but it didn't have an image of the flower....I didn't have time to do a thorough search.Good-night for now.Yesterday morn Lorelei and I took a little walk by the side of the house....I happened to look down where one of our trees had been.There were literally hundreds of these little mushrooms...still with the dew on them.  I took Lorelei inside and grabbed my camera and ran back to take a some pictures. I actually did notice the fly on this one as I took the picture...which is an improvement for me.  I would say that at least half the time I would  not have noticed till I downloaded the picture.In the same area, there were these little tiny things also.  I would say that in real life, none of the tan ones were any bigger around than a pencil.Here is the funny part....notice the ones that have already popped open?  You might need to enlarge the picture...I did NOT notice them till I downloaded the pictures!  I was just so focused on the others. I went out later in the day when Lorelei was napping to try to get more pictures of the other little ones, and they were all gone.  I think they die down once the sun hits them because there was not a single one left.  Yet this morn, I noticed a few more--but I didn't think to look till later in the morn and the sun had done been up a little while."},

I sure look at these and smile though.She does keep me busy; and I am worn out at the end of the day.  But I miss her on the weekends.  Part of the time we are the entertainment and part of the time she is.  Sometimes I set her in the kitchen with me when I fix her bottle, and part of the time I  will turn the TV on and see if she will be satisfied with it.  (Even if she is watching TV she likes for one of us to be near.) This morn I turned the TV on and went to fix her bottle, and you should have heard her laughing...and later in the day we had her out on the porch in her little rocker-seat.

You just know at one time this was a very prosperous place to have all these buildings.  One can't help but wonder was it a farm with a big family, or did they have hired hands?I still long to know the real history of this place.  I bet it was an interesting one.The one above is one I meant to post when I took it...on May 30th--the day that Sarah called and told me to get my camera and find a place to get a view to the east.  Some of them were posted May 30.

I tried taking pictures of one of the patches out there, but the lighting was wrong I guess.  I will have to try to be out there at a different time of day.The views of the single flowers of both of these turned out better than I had hoped...the wind was blowing the whole time I was out there.  I was trying to get pictures of this other flower and am not sure I will post any that I took...all just a little bit blurry to my eyes.---------------Lorelei was here today.....she is such a cutie.  (I am not biased at all.)  She was not quite as talkative as she is some days.  And she was fascinated with her Grandpa today.  She would just stare and stare at him and grin real big if he talked to her.  She does not nap much.  Every now and then I get her to take an  hour nap--maybe once or twice a week.  Other than that she usually takes about 3 little naps per day where I am lucky if she sleeps 30 minutes.    I will try to take a few new pictures of her this week."},
{"title": "Do you see what I see????", "date": "Sunday, June 7, 2009", "text": "I am not sure if you can see why I took the picture without enlarging it...even then I might have to identify it for you.  Can you see him?  It is a male bob white just entering the grass!  Picture not very good cause I was trying to get out of the car before he was completely gone.  I just was not fast enough.I seen a muskrat(s)--not sure if it was the same one or two different ones.  In basically a big mud puddle right at the side of the road.  I bet it was not over 20 ft. across.In the same pond, I spotted this frog first thing....enlarge it and you will see a second one over at the left side.  I didn't see him till I downloaded the picture.  I also seen the grandfather of all frogs...I got a picture of him looking my way but it is not blog-worthy.  He turned to hop into the grass and I saw how big he was--he looked like one of those big frogs we dissected in biology!  You can bet I am going to go back and watch for him.  But it may not happen soon.Once upon a time we had a squirrel named Squeakers...don't ask me where the name comes from.  She didn't make any noise at all...she did get squeals from us though.Look at Roger--he is gritting his teeth in the picture below.  Her little claws are always out and they are needle sharp.  Our arms all had scratches from her running up and down us or jumping from one to the other of us.I guess I should tell the story of how we came to have her.  It was all due to Sarah.She had went to a friends house to play when she was in 7th or 8th grade....probably 7th.  So she was probably around 12 years old.  I am almost positive it was November...pretty sure we had her for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It was a cold, windy snowy day...but not much accumulation. Anyway, Sarah had went to her friends house to play...came home and came in the back door and the first thing she said was \"Now, Mom, don't be mad!\"  I had no idea what she was talking about;  I sort of expected her to have tore something up or broke something....I mean what can a girl that age do.  I mean, she was a good kid.  I really couldn't think what she would have done.So I asked what had happened.  She tells me she has a squirrel...\"a squirrel?\" I ask.  she proceeds to tell me that it was moving kind of slow so she took her coat off and threw it over it and caught it.  She wasn't bit or hurt.  By then I think Roger was in there, so we asked to see it.  It was little...maybe 5 or 6 inches long.  It had scratches like a cat had had hold of it. It had to have a cage of some sort...so we got out the cat carrier, or maybe we bought it.  I forget what all we put in it that first night...but we would get her out and pet her quite often ....or Sarah may have just kept her out till bedtime.  I really don't remember.  I just know within a couple days, she was totally at home and not afraid of us at all.The love of her short life was Roger....she would be quiet all day.  Maybe come to see what I was doing every once in a while...but basically stayed to herself.  Till Roger came in the door.  I would be where I could see her, and she would perk up and listen....and go running to him.  Up his legs she would climb. She would chase him all through the house....I would have to get her so he could take a shower.  Other than that,  she would almost always be close to him the rest of the night.  But the odd thing was, that if one of us left the room, she went with us to see what we were doing, but when we came back to the living room, she would go sit with Roger.  Sometimes on him, a lot of the time on the arm of his chair.She loved apple pie.  You just cannot imagine it.  Roger sat down to eat a piece of pie one day, and she tried to dig into his mouth to get to it...we gave her a bite of it on her own plate and she sounded just like a little pig.  (That is where I got the idea to use an apple to get Mama Squirrel to come to me.) Anyway, I cannot remember what all we fed her--peanuts, walnuts, and I think sunflower seeds.  Roger and Sarah happened to go in the woods and ran across some hickory nuts and she was crazy about them also.Remember how I said that she followed each of us if we left the room, well she was very silent in doing that and one time I stepped on her little paw.  She carried it without walking on it and went running to Roger.  But she wasn't scared of me or anything...she just wanted Roger. She died not long after Christmas...we really don't know why.  Maybe she had some kind of cold or something we weren't aware of.  Or another time she had come up behind me and I didn't realize it and I stepped back and hit her pretty good with my shoe.  For a while, I really thought that was what killed her--maybe caused her brain to swell or something because it was only two or three days later that she got sick and died.Anyway, she was a special little creature that we sure loved....and she loved us.  We were all just heartbroken when she died."},

{"title": "Almost a Sky Watch Friday post...", "date": "Friday, June 5, 2009", "text": "Saturday when Sarah called me to tell me about the big bank of white clouds, some of which are seen in the above photo, and others I showed here....I was facing east to capture them.Looking to the west, these are what I saw....there was a few miles as well as a few minutes time between the two views.  But they are amazing.  Best when enlarged of course.And the one below is the view to the south.  I think it looks like a watercolor almost!I had thought I would have the chance to post these for Sky Watch Friday, but since I won't get to visit anyone other than those I normally visit, I am not going to sign up.  However, if you are  enjoy seeing pictures from all over, it is a fine place to find some nice views from around the world."},
{"title": "What to post....", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2009", "text": "First of all, I want to state that both these pictures were taken by Roger.  The first is of Lorelei yesterday after a short nap.  That is a yawn and not her being funny.  That is what I have felt like doing all day.The one below is of Cougar...and this is what I should be doing now.  He slept so sound...I change Lorelei on my bed, and he slept there the whole day and did not even move the whole time.Last night after Lorelei went home, Roger and I got ready and I went on a hunt for a stove....I finally settled on one at the last store, Lowe's, that we went to.  It has coils--two big burners and two small ones--and they are arranged the way I am used to.We didn't take the truck last night, so this morn after Lorelei was here and settled in we took the old stove out and Roger took it to the salvage yard and went on and picked up the new one.  But as we were getting the old one out, he took the knobs off, and under them there was this smoky black...like from a fire.  I bet we don't even know how close it was to being a fire.  Probably not one cause there was nothing to burn.I was just so relieved to make a decision about the stove, but even more so that it is now here and in place.  I didn't do any real cooking on it, but have had the burners on and the oven on.  I don't have Lorelei in the morn, but go to her house tomorrow afternoon and watch her for a few hours.It rained the entire day here, sometimes a lot and sometimes just a steady light rain.  Anyway, it was on the cool side and every time we tried to sit outside, the wind would blow just enough to blow a little rain in.  So Lorelei missed that.  She really likes to go outside and sit and watch what goes on around.  I am done wondering what we will do when it is really cold this winter.I almost forgot...Lorelei and I were sitting out back after Sarah came to pick her up.  She got to help me feed Mama Squirrel.  Mama Squirrel did not seem to mind...but Lorelei was quiet.Sarah and Jeremy are trying to find a good glider swing for their yard.  One that Otto cannot tear up.  He is so rough on stuff....so we have to find a sturdy one.I will hush for now...need to settle down mentally till I can sleep."},

Soon as we would wipe it off, she would start blowing bubbles.  The above is a cropped version of one of the ones below.  I just love it like this....nothing to detract from her.and I love this one Roger took out in the swing...the rest of these were taken while she was watching a Barney video.As you can see, Barney makes her happy!You can hear her all over the house if he is on.  And when she laughs, we can't help but look at each other and laugh.Hope they get a smile from you, too!  They should all enlarge."},
{"title": "Weary", "date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "text": "A couple more pictures from last month!  From the same day as the irises I posted yesterday.  Enlarge the pictures, at least the one above and look at the old truck truck sitting under the overhang.  Right after I took this picture, someone else posted a picture with a truck in it similar to this but I don't remember who.I am weary again tonight...not so much from Lorelei as from not a good night of sleep last night, and then tonight when I went to fix supper, I was making some cornbread and I burned the first pan.  I assumed it was my fault...but I actually thought the oven was hotter than it should be.I quickly made another pan and stuck it in, and made sure I put the timer on this time.  In just a bit, I thought it smells like something is burning.  I ran in there and checked and it was burnt again!  And the timer/temp area had codes.  I took the bread out of the oven and turned everything off...only even with switching everything off, the oven stayed on.  I told Roger to go flip the breaker.He came and told me he was going to flip it back on again just to see...I said okay but I want it left off.  He flipped it on, and there was a flash in the oven and the codes popped up again in the time/temp area.  He flipped the breaker off again...and I can still vaguely smell the smell.  Not really burnt cornbread, but more like plastic or something that has been burnt.So I have been looking on consumer reports and a couple store sights trying to decide what stove to get.  I think I am just going to have to go pick one out in person.  I don't trust getting this one fixed...it is probably only 4 or 5 years old--if that.  One of the smooth tops...and I have had things sort of 'funny' with it ever since I got it.  One big burner cooks a lot slower than the other...or should I say cooler.  One burner also had this button to push that was supposed to hold something to a simmer...sometimes I had to push it two or three times to get it to work, and sometimes I had to jiggle the knob that turns on the burner to get it to change temps.-----------------Those are the main reasons I am tired.  But Lorelei was a blast today.  This morn it was comfortably cool, and I took her out on the front porch to sit a while and had our old collie dog, Shelby, out there with us.  Lorelei had sort of laughed at her when she first saw her while I was changing her diaper earlier.  So, I thought it a good idea for her to go out with us.I told her to bark, and Lorelei threw her head back and laughed when she did!  So I would get Shelby to bark and she would laugh.  Then some ladies when by on their morning walk, and Shelby don't just bark...she does this bark/talk thing.  And Lorelei laughed and laughed!  And no one was there to see it except me, though I just know the ladies had to hear her.And have I told you that Shelby tends to go sleep in the room with Lorelei when I put her down for a nap...and if Lorelei cries, she comes and looks at me to let me know I need to go get that baby.  I think she is finally realizing I can take care of her without her help, but that first week if I waited a minute to see if Lorelei would go back to sleep she would come look at me and look back in Lorelei's room.Well, I definitely need to go to bed....good night."},
{"title": "From a few days back...", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2009", "text": "I thought instead of showing more sky pictures, for the next couple days at least I am going to show pictures from the archives...things I planned to show but just hadn't got around to it.These were taken May 5 to be exact.  We were on our way home...just ready to go home.  Well, we passed this house set way, way back off the road and there were these purple irises all along the lane....and more out along the road right by the drive way.   Much to my regret I didn't ask Roger to stop there.We went on down the road, and there right beside this pasture were these planted by the light pole....there was just something about them that I had to stop and take a picture or two.  then we were on our way.  At the end of the pasture was a ravine and even down in it were irises planted here and there.  All were this color. I would love to know the story behind them.  I definitely feel like there is something significant about them all being one color.  Maybe it was only somebody's favorite color, but I like to think that  they came from somebody's mother or grandmother and they wanted to plant bunches of them to remember her by.---------------We went back to Big Walnut Creek to check out the fishing. When we left here we were going to check out Big Raccoon at Bridgeton, Indiana and at Mansfield, but we cross over the creek one time not far from here and it was really high.  So we it would be too high to wade...not that I was planning on wading. So we decided to go to the Big Walnut...and how I wished I had went prepared to wade.  We found the best place....big sandbar....nice big log jams.  Perfect for fishing.   I 'almost' caught one small-mouthed bass, and my husband caught a small-mouthed bass and what we call a rock bass.  This from the bank....and that bank was probably 8 feet from the water.  Not fun to fish from that high up.Some kids went by in kayaks and canoes, and we were talking to one kid that said he fishes there quite often.  He say he caught nice sized small-mouth in there, and he also told us on down the way were a couple of really good fishing holes.  So we will probably be going back there.I need to get settled down for sleep--little Miss Lorelei will be here in the morn if all goes well.  So I need to be rested--good-night for now!"},
{"title": "The skies again", "date": "Saturday, May 30, 2009", "text": "Sarah and Lorelei came up and spend the afternoon/evening with us.  Lorelei put on a show for us, as usual.  I think she is going to be a noisy little thing.  She tries so hard to talk.  If she isn't trying to talk to us, she is sticking her hand in her mouth.  Sometimes she sticks it so far that she gags herself....and then she looks at us as if we are the ones doing something to her.Anyway, Sarah had no more than left till she called me and told me to get my camera and go to where I could get a good view of the east.  She said the clouds were amazing.  After a short conversation, we hung up and I went and glanced eastward.  Peaking above the trees I could see the white clouds.  They just had that look that I knew I had to go.I grabbed my camera, told Roger what I was doing and took off.  These are just a sample of what I seen.  I hope you will click on them to enlarge them.  They are awesome."},
{"title": "At day's end....", "date": "Friday, May 29, 2009", "text": "My baby wore me out today....we were out of sync.  At least that is the excuse I am giving.  I actually think she is going through a growing spurt.  She just wants to eat all the time....but at least it is that instead of one not hungry.Roger noticed the sunset last night, after it was too late to even thinking about going any where it would be pretty.  I made up my mind to try to watch tonight to see what it was going to be like.  Though in all honesty, you can almost always count on a beautiful sunset here.I glanced out once when it was still to early to think about leaving...then I happened to think and glance later and it was just too much to resist.  There was a storm line off to the north and west.I told Roger I was going--did he want to go.  Who can resist a run through the strip  pits.  I still did not capture the glory of it all, but maybe this will give you an inkling of what it was like.  I wish I had taken time and got my tripod out and taken a series of photos till I could stitch them together for a panoramic shot.  We were running out of time, though, and I wanted to make it to several spots to see the view...to bad I couldn't be in two places at once.I am wondering if Lorelei is giving her mom a break tonight.  She took three naps today but not a single one of them was over 30 minutes.  She had also gotten her mom up at 3:30 this morn, and again at 5:30....so she should be worn out.  She sure had her moments today--today was the day that she wanted to watch her Grandpa a lot.  He got lots and lots of big smiles.I also put on the Barney DVD I got for her for the first time and she really got animated watching it.  She keeps us laughing so much of the time."},
{"title": "The Lorelei Look", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2009", "text": "We have all wanted to capture the pouty look of Lorelei...this is almost it!  When she is getting upset about something...such as her bottle is not ready quick enough.....her bottom lip 'squares off' as my husband says.  At first just the corners turn out, then it proceeds to this look, and then sometimes she cries and sometimes she goes between crying and smiling. and sometimes she forgets all about it.  That did not really happen here in these two in her little seat.  I did not get her bottle warm soon enough.The ones below were taken when I was getting ready to change her diaper.She almost gets her whole hand in her mouth!  Sometimes she gags herself and she will look at me like I have done something to her.She is such a joy to have around....We walked across the street to show her to a couple neighbors.  They are my husbands friends and were out in one of their garages working on a trailer.  The one guy and his wife have this dog...I need to take a picture of her.  Anyway, she is just a Heinz 57 mix...friendly...likes to ride on ATV's...not a mean bone in her body.I would have loved to have had a video of her today!  I have had collies and they always like babies...if you know them you can tell right away that their heart just melts at the sight of one.  But is is a quiet thing with them, and you have to be looking at them to tell it.  Well, Lady, that is the neighbor's dog...she was actually shivering with delight at the sight of Lorelei!  She wanted to get to her so bad, but she is in a fenced yard.  And it might have been a good thing.  But I did hold Lorelei down to her till she could at least smell her feet and legs.Shelby is easing up with Lorelei and seems to finally realize I know how to take care of her....last week, if Lorelei even whimpered a little in her sleep, Shelby thought I should come get her.  I sometimes wish she was a young dog now till Lorelei would have her to grow up with. Lorelei is jabbering more and more.  She does not like to be snuggled for the most part.  Now if it is nap time, she seems to need it.  And that is okay.   Being independent is not a bad thing.I guess I need to get to bed...I took half a Tylenol pm to try to go to sleep easier....I have been going to bed and just laying and thinking and thinking.  So good-night for now."},

{"title": "Raining and wet...", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2009", "text": "These are the pictures I went outside to take yesterday, and had planned to post them till Mama Squirrel made herself available for a photography session.  It rained and rained yesterday....steadily all morn and then showers off and on all afternoon.  I really do need to get a rain gage till I can see just how much it does rain.As you can see by this picture my peony is about done...yes, you read that right.  I only have one.  I have come to the conclusion that I do like them planted just one here and there, rather than in rows as so often seen around here.  This one is at the corner of my front porch and stands out so much more than if it was in a row of them.The picture below is just a cropped version of the one above.  I like the way it looks when enlarged.  I used to have  spring jacket almost this color and I loved it.  I was in the local grocery store one time when wearing it, and looked up and there was another lady with one on just like it.  Someone I did not know, but we looked at each and said, \"OH, I just LOVE your jacket!\"I have never been a fan of white flowers...I do not know why.  Then Sarah got me this, and it is just so pretty I can't help but love it.  And seeing some of the photos others have of daisies had sure made me come to appreciate their simple beauty.I probably won't go out and buy any white flowers--I tend to go for more colorful things.  But I am growing to actually like them.  But they will be sort of like I am by polka-dotted clothes....I actually love them on other people but cannot stand to wear them now.  Though I do remember my mom making me dresses from dotted Swiss material--does that count?-------------Spent the day with Little Bright Eyes....at Sarah's house.  She stayed home today and needed a little bit of help with Lorelei.  Not that anything was wrong with Lorelei.  Lorelei just smiled and smiled when we got there, and I sure was glad to hold that baby again.  I had really missed her over the weekend.It has been thundering and has started raining again.  It did not rain in Terre Haute today, but we could tell by how wet things were that it had rained here during the day.  And supposed to rain the next two days as well, unless the forecast has changed.  I haven't taken time to check.I will go ahead and post this, just in case the it starts storming so bad I have to unplug everything.  But I am going to try to visit a few blogs before I have to shut down for good."},
{"title": "A visit with Mama Squirrel", "date": "Monday, May 25, 2009", "text": "I was out earlier between rains, trying to capture some of the flowers with the drops of rainwater on them.  Puss Puss had come and was out following me around, and Roger came out and she started showing off for him.  I happened to walk around the corner of the house before they did and spotted Mama Squirrel...I told him to grab Puss Puss and I ran inside to get nuts and just set my camera down.  Mother Cat came in with Roger and Puss Puss, and the boys were sound asleep inside.  Mama Squirrel was waiting for me on the trailer...I took the nuts and gave her a handful and thought how dumb I was for not bringing my camera.I have never been able to quite figure Mama Squirrel's moods out; sometimes I can come and go and she is fine with it.  Sometimes, once I leave she don't want anything more to do with me.  Windy days are almost always like that...but it was not windy today and I decided to take a chance and come back in and got my camera.  I went back out there and she was fine with it.These were taken with my normal lens--the 18-55 mm one so you know to get this pictures I was right in her face with the camera!  I am always amazed that it doesn't scare her.  I was checking back in my blog, and according to what I wrote when I still remembered, she has been coming here since the spring of 2006.Even with all the cats, she still comes up on my back porch....sometimes when I am out in the yard doing something I will turn around and there she is waiting for me.  She definitely knows the cats would hurt her.  I wish I could be lucky enough sometime to capture the other end of the spectrum--she knows our old dog Shelby will not hurt her and will sometimes walk up and smell her feet if she is laying down.------------Cougar continues to stay closer to home than he did.  He left one time and was gone a long time but for the most part he is in and out.  He came in soaking wet this morn....does not like to be dried off at all.   He now has rainwater soft hair!  And that is no exaggeration.  He doesn't have what we think of as long hair, yet it is longer than the others and more plush."},

{"title": "Blackberry memories", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2009", "text": "I think this is so much prettier when enlarged.  I took it today--won't be too  long till there's berries!  A big old blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream sounds wonderful to me!Our mom always made them in a 9 x 13 cake pan.  Its another thing she made without measuring--and they were always good.  Ask Neal and Patty.  Mom always tried to make one for them when they went home to visit because they liked them so well.We did not have tame blackberries....I don't know of anyone around there that did.  But there were two or three cow pastures where they grew--uncared for in anyway.  Other than the cattle that sometimes made paths through them.Usually mom and I would each take a milk bucket...in our case a 2 1/2 gallon pail.  And I always took a little coffee can--at least I think that is what they were they were about 6 inches tall and 4 or 5 inches in diameter.  First, some of us would take a nail and make holes on opposing sides, and then we would use wire and make a handle.  And off we would go.Either of our two favorite places to pick berries were less than a mile away--one was within sight of home for the most part....the other was a little bit farther.  We would get there, and I would set my milk bucket down and take time to run my belt through the handle of the homemade coffee can bucket.  That way, when I came to a good place to pick, I could set my big bucket down and have both hands free to pick into the coffee can.  When I got it full, I would just empty it into the big pail.I don't remember how long it would take us to fill our buckets...I do know that we would go pick after lunch usually, and mom would still have time to make a batch of jelly or can the berries after we got home, and before supper.You would think the weight of all those berries would have squished them till they were mushy, but it really didn't harm them.  Maybe cause we were walking and not the constant vibration had we been transporting them in a vehicle.Anyway, to this day, blackberry picking is at the top of my list of favorite things to do.  And I don't even like to eat them as I pick.  I have just always enjoyed picking them.  My arms were always full of briar scratches and I would always be full of chiggers.  I don't remember my mom ever getting very many of them, but they loved me. If you don't know what chiggers are, or have never had them....count your blessings.  You can read about them here.  They are the one thing I would really dread dealing with now.  But if I were given the opportunity to go berry picking like that once again, I would jump at the chance!"},
{"title": "Here's another barn", "date": "Friday, May 22, 2009", "text": "I am so worn out I can't think straight tonight...it has been a long time since I have taken care of a little baby and you can tell it.  All you have to do is look in my eyes to see that I am wiped out.  I know I will not be taking near as many pictures, but hopefully I will still be able to show a few new barns.  I have a lot I have never posted....such as this one.  The top is the view we first saw of this barn....then we went down and around a couple curves and got the other view of it that I am showing below. I  always wonder about the windows in the barns.  Around here, a lot of barns have at least a couple windows, but where I grew up, I cannot think of any barn right in my area that had windows.  My first thought is that they are for ventilation, but I am not even sure you can open them.I cropped one of my pictures to show you a closer view of the windows...click on it to enlarge and see what you think about them.-------Change of subjectOne of my blog buddies  wondered if Cougar might have a girlfriend...and I thought I would just add a note that all our animals are either neutered or spayed.    So I don't think that is it...he sometimes comes home with burrs in his hair, but not the other day.  He came home starved to death...he looked like he had lost weight.  We sort of think he goes in someone's garage and gets locked in.  He has never been gone this long before, but he was gone almost 24 hours once.  That time he came home hungry and thirsty, too.I had planned on not letting them out, and didn't really think it would be much of a problem.  They had been born inside and never been out.  You would think they would have had a fear of going out, but instead they would about trip us trying to get out.  Then, my daughter brought her two cats, which did happen to be the mother and brother of our two....it just became impossible to go outside without at least one cat getting out.  So we finally gave up.My first Cougar, who lived to be 17 years old, was neutered;  he stayed in our yard for the most part so I kind of figured these would also.  For the most part, the other three almost always come when I call.  They are usually here in the yard somewhere or across the street at Kay's, but Cougar just disappears and I have no idea where he goes.  I turn him and turn around and he is gone.But, I am actually wondering if he has learned something from this, cause he sure has spent a big part of the past two days inside!  He does go out, but he is usually back within a short time."},
{"title": "Just a few more flowers....", "date": "Thursday, May 21, 2009", "text": "When Lorelei got here this morn, she and I went to look at the flowers...and I was trying to decide if this dark one is the same variety as I showed earlier.  I cannot tell for sure.  I bought it at this community yard sale a year or two ago...I forget the name of it.  At the time from the description I wondered was it the same as the dark ones I already had.I forget where this one came from....I only have two or three of them.  I have had them for several years.I wish I had taken a picture of the whole bunch of those above when they first started to bloom...again, I started out with only a couple and I have a whole bunch of them now.I had totally forgotten buying this yellow one...again it was at that community yard sale.  I had just been thinking I wanted to get some yellow ones.  I kept seeing the petals that stand up and thought that it was just another of the purple/white ones, even though the white petals had a sort of yellow glow.  I thought it was just something to do with the lighting.Imagine my surprise when Lorelei and I walked out there and it was this one!  I just love it.    Irises are some of my favorite flowers...I think it is the variety of colors available that make me love it so.    And they do smell so good!  To me, they smell a little bit like grape Kool-Aid.  Is it just me, or does anyone else think that?Anyway, I hope you enlarge them to see their full beauty.----------I don't know if you noticed that the picture I posted of Lorelei sleeping in the last post was actually taken Tuesday.  There is a sort of story behind my reasoning.  Yesterday was a hard day...she was just out of sorts.  I was trying to hold her to the schedule that we figured she would be on with the feeding.  I was not letting my natural instincts have their way.  And I paid for it big time.  She fussed a big part of the day, then when I gave her her bottle she would go to sleep before she really got full.  Then wake up in a bit and the cycle would start all over again--me trying to make her wait, her crying and wearing herself out and then falling asleep before she had her fill.  So it was a long day....in more ways than one as you will see if you continue reading.On top of this with Lorelei, my cat Cougar had went outside Monday and I didn't see him again that day, and he was not home Tuesday morn as he normally is after spending a night out.  He is usually on the back porch sitting in a chair waiting for me.  He did not come home that Tuesday at all.  We went for a walk after Lorelei went home and called for him.  No Cougar. I stayed up till past midnight, occasionally going outside and looking and calling for him.  No Cougar.I didn't sleep much at all that night, looked for him when I first got up yesterday(Wednesday) and no Cougar.  Every chance I got, which wasn't many, I went outside and called for him.  By the time Lorelei left yesterday, I had given up on him ever coming home.  I doubt you can imagine my joy when I looked up and seen him looking in the window looking for me at about dark last night!  It really isn't much of an exaggeration when I say he owns my heart....Then today I went with my instincts with Miss Lorelei and we had a great day!  I am quickly learning the tv schedule...it is fun to sit and talk to her and watch her reaction to things....so far, she really loves the two characters that are orange and yellow on Barney and Friends,  she likes Sesame Street....but not Sponge Bob Square-Pants (he doesn't do a thing for her), she kind of likes Clifford the Big Red Dog and she likes the Barnyard Animals. Kay came over after school, and Lorelei likes her....and what is not to like?  She is 7 years old and is one of the best kids.  She has a very loving heart....she is such a good sister to her little brothers.  And I know she will be so good to Lorelei.  She had to hold Lorelei and she wanted to give Lorelei her last bottle but I was afraid to try that right now. So now it is time for me to settle down and try to get some real rest!"},

I was amazed that it turned out as good as it did.We didn't see near the animals we normally seen...and most of those only in the distance.  But it was still worth going just to see the sky change with each passing moment.  It was a great way to end the day.-----------Today was a wonderful day....Lorelei took the bottle without a fuss every single time.  She only got fussy when she needed to be burped.  And Grandpa introduced her to Barney!  You would not believe her reaction...she laughed and 'talked' and grinned almost the whole time.  And best of all, her mommy called to check on how things were going and got to hear her laughing.  So keep your fingers crossed and say a prayer for us that things continue to go this well."},

Well, she came, but her mom did not go to work.  She stayed here with us, and we worked on getting her used to a bottle.  She fought it every time....cried her heart out.  So hard to see those big old tears in her eyes, hard for me knowing how hard it is on Sarah.  It is probably harder on  Sarah than anyone.But oh, is she a joy to be around.  She tries so  hard to talk part of the time.  She went to sleep in my lap, and I just sat and rocked with her.  She woke herself up laughing!  She started out with what would be a giggle for us, and then opened up and laughed out loud.  Just smiling and laughing.  I would love to know what she is thinking/dreaming about to do that at this age."},

We knew the water was up, we just wanted to see how bad.

The one above just seemed to go on forever."},

The one of the purple one is from last year, but the others were taken this year.I don't know the names of any of them...the off white ones were given to me by a neighbor.  I started with about half a dozen and now have a bunch of them.The purple and the peach I bought, and the purple have really reproduced, but the peach haven't.  I don't know the reason for the difference...-----------------Sarah and Jeremy came by yesterday....seeing Lorelei did me a world of good.  I start babysitting Monday if nothing else happens.

Again, I had heard of it but not aware of ever having seen one.  There were a few of them scattered about out there, all just singing the summer in.  Happy as could be. I might attempt singing if I could ever get rid of this bug I have....I started coughing last night before I went to bed...every breath I take tickles the back of my throat and urges me to cough.  Just thinking about it makes me cough.  Seeing some of the posts of my blog buddies made me cough...so I guess I will hush and try to think of something else."},

This flu/cold or whatever is sure is taking its slow sweet time leaving my body.  For right now, my spirit is willing, but the body is weak is a fit saying about a lot of stuff for me.

And it has rained most of the day--a light rain. No big downpours at any time. And the sky...it is overcast but not that real dark, dreary look that we have most of the time when it is raining. But I am still glad we took off for the drive yesterday. We went north, first to see Coffing Brothers Orchard, but we had missed the blooming. Again. I have tried to several years to make it up there when the majority of the trees are in bloom, but have yet to be successful.Anyway, we did manage to come across two or three barns I have never seen before, as well as this house.  I really need to get a GPS, till maybe I can figure out where things are.  I would love to know how far this place is from a town or grocery store.  My husband doesn't think anyone lives here; me I am not so sure.It really is sort of run down, but I sort of had the feeling someone might be trying to start to work on it in their spare time.  It also had a satellite dish...which I will probably show in a later post.  But for right now I thought I would show you this house.  Isn't that porch wonderful?   I would have loved one when I was a child.  I can just imagine Lorelei on it.This farm seemed to be out in the middle of nowhere...and I wondered about it.  I wondered how far they had to go to get the things to build it with.  Was it built at a time when they used a horse and wagon to go get supplies?  I kind of wondered if they had got the brick for building from the kilns shown here....they are up north of here also. Look how square everything still is...someone built it that knew what they were doing.   Someone that can build something this beautiful is indeed an artist in my book.  A master craftsman.And this road right beside the house led to their barn which I will also show in the next few days.  It was built square and true, too.  I really was impressed with the place...or maybe I should say with the workmanship of the place, and hope you are, too."},

And they are exactly how it looked.  Usually my pictures are not quite the way it looked...but they usually are different in a way that is almost better than the how it really was.  Can you make sense out of that last sentence?Anyway, these are not altered in any way....except to add my copyright/name.  They are exactly as they came out of the camera.These pictures leave a lot to be desired...again.  Yet I was so glad to get even these.  The top photo is not enhanced.  It was actually as dark as the picture seems....very hard to distinguish the features.It is a barred owl that Roger spotted on my side of the road on the way home from the strip pit area.  I used fill flash to lighten the photos till we can see the the features a little bit better.I checked the pictures on the desktop computer and they were so dark I couldn't distinguish anything so I am trying to  lighten them more.  Hope it helps.We didn't see much on our run through tonight...we heard a few pheasant but not near as many as normal.  We did not see a single one.  No Northern Harriers.  No Short-eared owls.  The owl above was after we left what we call the strip pit are.We did see a beautiful sunset....I will post a couple pictures of that in a day or two.-------------I have to tell about babysitting Lorelei yesterday.  She was asleep when we got there...didn't wake up till a while after Sarah and Jeremy left.  She was her usual cheerful self for a short while.  Then she started getting fussy.  Before I could get her bottle warm, she was crying so hard.  And did not want anything to do with that bottle...I tell you, she just broke our heart.  You could tell she wanted her mommy.I finally got her settled down and thought maybe she would then take the bottle.  Wrong!  She set in with the crying again.  Big old tears.  I get teary eyed just thinking about her little face.Well, we had noticed that Sarah had had one of her own shirts spread out under Lorelei in the crib, so Roger got it and says 'let's try something.'  He brought it over to drape over my shoulder like a burp cloth and she stopped almost the minute she seen it.  She snuggled in and took most of her bottle.She needed a diaper change...I took Sarah's shirt off my shoulder.  And when we got done I took her in the living room and was going to see if she wanted the rest of the bottle.  She started crying again.  Roger went and got Sarah's shirt, and again she quieted down and took the rest of the bottle.About the time she was starting to entertain us, her mommy and daddy got home.   So that was the end of that little adventure."},

I had no idea what it was.I don't remember how I found out what it was, I just know it was easier than normal for us to figure out.It was so dark and dreary, and no time that day to even try to capture one, but last night we decided a quick drive through out there was in order.  Let me tell you, there was not much happening.  We did see pheasant, and heard lots more, and the usual red0-winged blackbirds were abundant.  I really would hate to have to try to count them.  It would be an impossible task.I thought at first we were not going to see any sign of the bobolink, but came across 5 or 6 of them in some cattails.  I got out of the Rav4 and was slowly walking up closer to them as they sang their little hearts out.  It was such a joyous singing...you would just have to hear them to fully appreciate it.  You can go here and scroll down about half way and there is a sound clip of their song.Anyway, I am not overly impressed with these, yet happy to have at least caught these.  They are images that have been cropped.  I would have gotten closer if a truck had not came from the other direction and scared them away.  As it passed they flew away...I seen one other one one more time, but no more.We did see one other un-recognized bird last night...it was long-skinny necked out in the grassy area.  The neck wasn't as long as a crane though.  It was too far to see good, and the one flew...and I seen another poke its head up one time, but we watched and watched and did not see it again."},

And we will be babysitting Lorelei again tomorrow afternoon for a while.I thought the rain was going to be over with by tomorrow but now rain is in the forecast for tomorrow as well.  We didn't have a lot of rain today...just misted off and on.  It was raining pretty steady as I came home from Sarah's....I was just happy it wasn't pouring down when we took Lorelei shopping.So will close because I need to get up in the morn and go get our tomato plants....and have a couple other things to do before we go see Lorelei."},

It never rained really hard at any time, but misted. And if it wasn't misting, you just felt the humidity around you.  There was always this slight fog or mist close to the ground in the distance.  It was not my camera not in focus, nor is it your computer needing adjusting.Today has been a different story as far as the rain...it has rained A LOT today...and about the time I think it is done, it comes around again.  Just a little bit ago, I actually had the thought that it might be over with for today, but instead in about ten minutes, the rain moved back in and it just poured for about 20-30 minutes.  Now, it acts like the sun might want to come out, but I am not going to let it fool me for a minute.Doesn't it look lonely?  And flat. I never can get over how flat it is. I would love to know how far one can actually see.  And it is certainly a different kind of seeing than growing up in Tennessee.When I first came to Indiana from Tennessee, I sure missed my mountains.  I was just always so lonesome for them...and I guess to this day even though I have come to love some of the things of Indiana, my heart still belongs to Tennessee.  Every now and then we come to an area and it will remind us of this or that place in Tennessee...and just for a minute we can pretend to be home."},

And see the picture below, that is right of in front of her changing table....those giraffes on the wall are ones Sarah painted for her room.  And she seems to love them!  She jabbers and coos and talks to them any time you put her on the table.  If she is unhappy, take her in there and her mood usually changes.And today her Grandpa seemed to really entertain her.  She tried her best to talk to him.  It isn't going to be long till she is running us all ragged keeping up with her. ------------------Now, to the previous post...I don't know why I said I had seen grouse out at the strip pits...I meant to say I saw two male pheasants.  I have almost typed grouse before.  So I hope everyone that seen that post at least sees this one.  I have never seen a grouse in Indiana, and only one or two in Tennessee.  I don't think they are native to Indiana, but not sure.Below is the other new sighting for us...what do you think?  Is it a Great Egret?I wish these were better pictures, but am lucky they were this good.I really have trouble focusing this lens...it is a cheap thing.  I don't have near the trouble with the other lens. Anyway, if you think you know for sure if this is or isn't a Great Egret tell me.  I really do not know what birds at all."},

Roger finished up something in the garage and I was doing some laundry.  He got done, and he knew that I had been needing some fabric...don't laugh!  I really don't have very many purples or oranges in my fabric and I needed them for my new quilt for Lorelei.Anyway, we headed to Illinois, and a quick run through the strip pit area was in order, as well as one on the way home.  It is more or less a little detour to go through it.  On the way there, we saw two male pheasant--(not grouse), a couple pair of blue winged teal, mallards, a painted turtle, and the usual red-winged blackbird.  The normal sights.On the way home, we saw a couple new things, this skunk among them.  We did see one one other time, and it was white for the most part.  And though it was an off-white, it wasn't as off white as this one.  And it was too far away to get a good picture.  This one, however was close enough.  At first I thought he was going to come and investigate me, but he had second thoughts and turned and took off through the field.So that is my one new thing from out there...and I will show you the other in the next day or two.-----------We had planned to go mushroom hunting tomorrow, but instead are going to go see Lorelei. It has been at least a week since Roger has seen her and even though it was last Thursday for me, it seems an age and I can't wait to see her.I found this mushroom right outside our fence, where my husband parks his trailer.  I found it yesterday, but a day or two before when Roger was mowing the yard, he found a whole mess of morels.  He done had them inside and in water when I came home.  We had to have breakfast the next morning...emmm-mmm-good!I just had to show a couple things from my front yard....first the toadshade...then my dogwood tree.  It is not the color pink that I wanted, but I still love it.  I wanted one the color Betsy shows on her blog here.  Be sure and scroll all the way to the bottom of the post to see a picture of a single bloom.  I meant to ask her did she know what color it was called, so I bet she will tell me now if she remembers.I know I post dogwood blossoms every year, but aren't they wonderful.  The tree is just loaded with bloom.ETA:  I forgot to mention that my quest for tomato plants is over....at least I plan for it to be over.  I talked to the local greenhouse owner yesterday and they should have some Super Fantastic tomato plants this weekend.  They are an improved version of the Supersonic.  Needless to say, I am very happy."},

Actually I very seldom get a chance to even try to capture them.  Most of the time, they are  very shy, but every now and then one isn't and I wonder what the reason is.  Do some actually become accustomed to cars and some not.  Usually the ones out at the strip pit take flight if they are anywhere near the road.I have things I want to do today...going to actually call a couple more green houses.  I am kind of wanting to go this one the Amish have, but won't go unless the other two I thought of don't have any tomatoes.But first I have things to do here so I best get busy."},

I don't know if their wood is actually good for anything, and I know they don't provide much shade.  But somehow or other, I like the way their trunks stand out against the surrounding backgrounds.I guess I also find myself drawn a lot more to the single trees left standing here and there...specially when they are in the middle of a big plowed field. Speaking of plowing, I am so ready to plant a few tomato plants and our usual bell peppers.  But there seems to be a hitch this year....I bet I drove over a hundred miles yesterday, went to three green houses and one home center looking for the supersonic tomato plants and did not find a one at any of them.  Today, I checked our local Walmart and they had even less.I love the flavor of the supersonics when grown in our garden;  for some reason, a lot of the others don't have a lot of flavor.  But this year we really need to perform some tests.  We need to pick several varieties and keep track of where they are planted, and see which ones have the better flavor. Right now though, I need to tidy up the house....I have a quilt that I made that hangs in the dining room.  One of the cats has been jumping up and pulling it down, and then they all sleep on it.  I need to devise a better way of hanging it.  Yet right now, one is snuggled in it and I haven't the heart to make him move.  I will wait till he goes back outside before I do anything with it.  It is nothing fancy...I wouldn't let him do that to a 'good' quilt, but this is just one I experimented on.  You can see it here...So I best get this published and see what I can get done."},

Even with a dirty lens, the bottom one is still awesome.I took these last night when I was thinking about leaving the strip pits.  Actually, I was trying to make myself leave because it was too dark to capture anything else but the sky caught my attention and I had to make one final round and catch a few different views of it.  These were two of my favorites.I must say that I am still concerned about the Northern Harriers...in the three or four times I have been out there recently, I have only seen one, and it in the distance.  I could tell it was one by the way it flew close to the ground and seeing its white patch.  Since one male can have up to 5 or 6 females, maybe the females are all on nests.*******I spent most of the day with the Little Bright Eyes...I had to be there by 7:30, though I got there a little earlier than that.  She slept in till 9:00...got her up and we changed her diaper.  You got to understand that she loves having her diaper changed.  She kicks and talks and smiles and laughs the whole time.  Even if she is fussy, if you go change her diaper it is almost guaranteed to change her mood.Anyway, changed her diaper and then tried to give her a bottle.  She has a bit of a stuffy nose, and I don't know if that was part of the problem or what, but she was not as enthused with the bottle as she was the other time I got to give her one.  However, once we got it down, she was just a happy, cheerful little girl.I didn't try to take pictures, though I should have.  I did have Roger's point&shoot camera in my purse.  She has decided she really likes her swing, and when her mommy got back and fed her, she wanted in the floor.  She kicked and kicked and talked to us...had us totally entertained. In other news, our other daughter should be heading home from Colorado in the wee hours...they plan on leaving 1:00 a.m. tomorrow.  She has been out there for some training in crisis support.  I know she is looking forward to sleeping in her own bed again. Roger is turkey hunting...yesterday was opening day.  Neither he nor his buddies got one yesterday.  He didn't go out this morn, but went out before I got home.  It is just amazing...when we were first married, there were no wild turkeys around.  Now, we see them quite often, and sometimes big flocks of them.  I think the National Wild Turkey Federation has had a lot to do with getting them re-introduced to our world again."},

I think it is from my book and also from googling it. I am embarrassed to tell this, but it had not dawned on me that the bird below is the female version of the blackbird.  It sort of made me wonder when they act so much alike, but I had never thought to look it up.  But when googling red-winged blackbird, it appears several times.I would hate to have to count the number of red-winged blackbirds out at the strip pit.  I think it would be an impossible task.  They are everywhere you look.Two fellow bloggers, Tom and Leedra,  identified the questionable bird in yesterday's post as the  grebe, pied-billed grebe by Tom...Leedra just called it a grebe.    Now if someone would just identify the one Sunday's post...I have also ran into pictures of sandpipers and sandpiper like birds that are similiar to it.Today was a windy day...it felt like the wind came direct off an iceberg.  It was dark and dreary to begin with, the sun came out for a bit and then back to dark and dreary.  If I had not had things to do, I would have went out to the strip pits just to watch the changing skies.I saw coots day before yesterday....got two or three fairly good pictures.  When I was doing the slide show for Roger, we viewed the one above and I clicked to go forward and he says to go back.I did not notice this other one with them till he said that.  Is it a coot also?  To me it seems totally different to the others...there was at least 12 or so of the others and only this single fellow.  The shape of its head seems different, along with the coloring.  It is interesting seeing all these water birds.  Where I grew up, we didn't see many ducks or geese.  We did not have the right habitat for them I suppose.No identity on the bird yesterday...I did get out my Audubon Society field guide to birds and am more confused than ever concerning yesterdays bird as well as the above."},

I saw several of the bird in the top picture...is it a rail of some kind or is it a Wilson's snipe.  I am leaning towards snipe but really do not know, so if you know please feel free to comment.  And I saw this little painted turtle in this marshy area.  It is the first one I have seen out there that I remember.I also saw a couple pheasant, but no pictures. And an owl--I got pictures but they are not in focus.  I saw coots, and I think a grebe...I will post pictures sometime this week.  And then some other waterfowl...I don't have a good picture of it but will post it because I think it is at least good enough till someone will be able to identify it.It did start raining last night...a gentle rain.  I think it rained a little all night long and has sprinkled off and on all day.  I am not sure what the next few days are supposed to bring, but hopefully the sun will return sooner than later.  I am sitting here staring out the window and seeing my lilac in bloom...it smells so good.  Though the smell is not as strong as normal so I am wondering am I losing part of my sense of smell.I just got home from the library...I always come home with such a load...and I very seldom get many read these days.  Used to I would bring home  whole slew of books, and if they were good, they would be read.  Before  I went, I went to their website and made my list from there...at least for actual books.  For audio, I just go and browse the shelves.  And I brought home a couple Inspector Morse videos and a couple Inspector Lynly dvds.I always wonder how everyone else goes about making their selections....I used to go and just browse and I admit I found some really good books that way.  Now I usually pick a subject, and look it up under their key word feature.  Today, I used the word 'dust bowl' but they did not have many...so then I switched to 'farm.'  Today I seemed to come home with more fiction that not.For a long while, I seemed to find most of my books in the non-fiction shelves,  but my tastes/attention span are changing...and I very seldom get a book that I just can't wait to have a few minutes to read.  I miss that feeling of anticipation of knowing I have a good book waiting for me.  And I seem to be returning more to fiction, as I did when younger.Then there are words...if a title has certain words in it and I see it, I will just automatically pick it up.  A title with any of the four seasons mentioned will get my attention, as well as any month; if river is in the title, you can bet your life I will pick it up. Or rain...or Tennessee or Kentucky...harvest is another one that is apt to draw my attention.  I know there are more words but can't think right now.So, how do you choose your reading material and have you always liked to read?  I know as soon as I learned to read, my mom had to make me turn out the lights most nights.  I cannot imagine having a library to go to like I do now.  It is one of the greatest pleasures of life."},

When I look at the smaller sized picture, I lean to ugly, but when I enlarge it, I think NO, not so ugly.  Kind of beautiful in fact.  I just love their feathers.When we were kids, we did not get to go places very much.  Our mom's family all lived just a few miles away...I am sure less than 15, and probably less than 10.  Yet we only went to visit about once a year.  And when we were kids, a couple of our aunts and their kids maybe came to our house once a year. One of those aunts always had guineas.  I really do not know what the purpose of them were...I don't know if she ate the eggs or not.  Do people even eat the eggs?  I really do not know...but I do know that I wish I had paid more attention to them and wish I had asked more questions.My brother, Neal just left, and we always talk about how we wish we had ask more questions.  Our mom and dad just didn't talk about their childhood very much at all...they did not talk about what they did for fun, or what they did at holidays or anything.  And I guess if truth be told, I don't talk to my girls about what I did as a child either. One time, right before mom died I did think and ask her a question or two...She said they went to school from July till February.  I don't think she said the reason for this.  She walked about half a mile to school and came home for lunch.  Her teacher taught about 30 kids from primer through 8th grade.  They had visitors to the school every couple of Fridays just to see what the kids were doing...sometimes they had a spelling match (bee). At the end of one year, the teacher held up mom's report card and said she wished everyone had a report card like it.  Our mom only went through 8th grade; her teacher tried to get her to come to town and live with her and go to high school.  But she loved her home so much she wouldn't leave it.I ask her if they got a Christmas tree every year and she said no.  I do not know if that was common to not have one or not in that area.  She said her mom always baked a couple cakes and they would have apples and oranges and candy for their Christmas.  That is one tradition she carried on...I can remember when I was a kid mom baking several cakes for Christmas.  I really don't know if she did it every year, but I can remember the anticipation of it.  So she must have did it more than once.  And Mom and Dad always got a bushel of oranges and a bushel of apples for Christmas...Mom did say that they would have a Christmas tree at school and sometimes there would be a present under it for each kid.  She got one present that had two or three embroidery squares in it and that is how she learned to embroider.  I so wish I had started asking stuff sooner and just wish I had known what to ask.  Now, Neal and I are always telling each other to remember to ask George this or that that we can't remember...not George, the Senior Hiker but George our brother.  He can remember a lot more of the people from around home than we do.  And can just remember some stuff better than we can.I am always entranced when people start telling about their childhood, or their parents life.  I think because I missed that part of mine.  I guess I need to start talking about mine to my children."},

None of the ones I got him flying away are in focus, but you get a feel for him with this one.He was the second owl we saw.  Besides him, we saw pheasant.  Half a dozen of them...two or three of which were females.  I did get a head shot of one running away...they are so quick!  I could not get a good capture of one no matter how I tried.There were several pairs of geese out there, we saw herons flying over, and lots and lots of red-winged blackbirds, but I am kind of wondering.  We did not see a single Northern Harrier...and the last time we were out there were only saw one or two.The sky was beautiful, as you can see from the first picture.  The sunset did not seem to last as long as usual though...but maybe that was cause I was so focused on seeing how many pheasants and owls I could spot."},

I would love to know what that big thing on top is...in fact, would you just love to dig around in this place.  Look at that chair sitting there...and I would love to know what is behind the door of the little red addition.  I think that looks like it has been added later than the original...but I could be wrong...............Tomorrow our youngest daughter turns 27...I cannot believe she is that old.  She still looks like a kid.  I think she is one of those women that just won't age.  If she does it will be much more gracefully than I.  To see her with Lorelei, she looks like a kid with a kid...and I honestly bet that is what  lot of people think.We had fun yesterday...Lorelei was so entertaining.  She slept while we ate, but also was laughing in her sleep, which in turn had us cracking up.  She does have the sweetest little toothless smile!  It is enough to melt the heart.I am still in the creative mood...working with my Electric Quilt program to design another little quilt for Lorelei...I want it bigger than the other one but still not going for twin size yet.  At least I don't think I will.  What I want to do I have done before...it is a simple pattern....and old, old pattern in fact.  But it is a matter of color placement.  I have to have a 'map' to follow, and sometimes I still have to rip out seams.I have been interrupted with a phone call...I don't recall what else I was going to tell, if anything.  So will close and get busy here.  My brother is also coming down tomorrow...they want to see Lorelei and I thought it would be a good time."},

Don't know how much I will get done though.  Tomorrow we are heading to Tuscola to the outlet mall...us girls that is.  If nothing happens.  We were going to go Monday but it was too rainy and damp and cold...it is an outdoor mall we are going to.I don't know if any of us are really going for anything particular...just a time to get out and do something together.  Before Sarah goes back to work and while Rachel is on vacation.  There is a Carter's store over there, so I bet we all want to go to it.  Lorelei is going to be the best dressed kid in town....I keep thinking about making her an outfit.I always had trouble choosing the correct size for the kids when they were so tiny.  It was more fun when they were around 4 or 5.  I don't know if either one of them remember things I made them or  not but they each had favorite things they wore.  I think with my oldest it was a pair of red plaid pajamas...with the younger, it was not so much one thing as this one pattern.  A skirt pattern that had circle skirt...kind of.  A lot like this one...if not the same one.We won't say much about the poodle skirt she wanted...and she wanted it out of a specific material.  Polkadots--black and white.  I hunted and hunted till I found material acceptable to her, and made it...and she hated it once it was made.  I honestly don't know if she wore it 2 times even.  The other little skirts...I forget how many I made from the same pattern...she wore them all the time.  I could honestly say I got my money's worth out of it.So keep your fingers crossed that I settle on something to make...I feel the need to be creative!"},

Even though it is cold, dark, dreary and rainy here this day, I look out and see things blooming and the gloom isn't so all enveloping.I cannot help but wish I had a fireplace when it rains...I love sitting by a fire almost as much as anything there is.  Just something about it....when we moved to Tennessee, the little house had a fireplace.  We did close it up and get a wood stove with a blower on it.  But before we closed it, I sure enjoyed it. Sitting by a wood stove is very enjoyable also, just not quite the same.I keep threatening to turn our old block garage into a room for me...with a wood burning stove in it.  I know I would spend a lot of time in it if we did...I would want a stove and a comfortable chair or two...and a light to read by.  But then I think about how much work would be involved and how damp it tends to get...the dampness is really the part that worries me.  Roger says we could take care of it, but I am not as positive as he is.Okay, change of subject...Our dinner yesterday was filled with laughter from watching Lorelei.  She sat and grinned and laughed and made faces almost the entire time.  So much joy does she bring to our life.  And she laughs in her sleep...honest to goodness.  Sarah was the same way....she woke up laughing a lot of times when she was little.  I honestly can't remember if she did it this young though...Roger picked up this little rocker seat for her at Walmart Saturday...we put it together, all the while knowing that one of the cats would claim it.  He first put this folded up towel in it.  None of them noticed it till that night and then Puss Puss claimed it.  We took the toys off cause she wanted to play with them, and we unfolded the towel and covered the entire thing with it.  Puss Puss slept in  it that first night, but she was back with us last night.Sarah says Otto licks Lorelei's feet every chance he gets...Keesha doesn't pay her much mind.  She was a funny dog...she didn't always like kids when she was young, yet some kids could do anything to her.  Otto will be all for anything that Lorelei can dish out...though Sarah will never let Lorelei be mean to an animal.Otto and his type were at one time America's favorite dog for families...they have such a bad reputation now.  Though after knowing him, it really makes me wonder how any of them is ever induced to fight.  He is all about a good time...the closer he can be to you the better.  He just has to sneak in as many kisses as he can...I need to get busy and get some things done around here...I bought an extra ham and had it sliced so I need to get the slices bagged individually and frozen.  I also need to put the dishes up...I tell you I am loving my dishwasher.  So far, I am well pleased with it.  I put a pan in it the other day that had sat for hours, it had had mac-n-cheese in it, and that had dried on it.  It came clean as a whistle.  It cleans much better than our old one...even when it was brand new I found quickly that it was no use to try to clean pans in it.  But that was about 15-16 years ago.  I guess things have improved since then."},

When we got there, signs said there was a sale and that they were open...but no one was around and the door was locked.  So, we figured they might be having lunch, so went for a drive in the country up there. It definitely must have been wash day for the Amish...every Amish farm we passed had clothes on the line.  I only took a couple pictures but want to go back and take more.  We did wind up back at the Turkey Run Antiques, they were open, and I did buy a couple books.  But no rocker...which is what I was hoping to find.Today, I should have stayed home and had clothes on the line today, but instead we went to the woods in the hopes of finding a few early mushrooms.  I am sorry to say there was no luck in that department.  I didn't even take my camera and I so regretted that.  Things are slowly starting to come up, and even a few things were blooming.  I saw Dutchman's britches and trout lilies, and a number of things I do not know the name of.  I could have stayed busy just trying to get good images of those things.We came home, and I fixed a bite of dinner...and have since taken some pictures of things for Roger.  Now it is time to get back to my current project...and no, it isn't for Lorelei.  Hopefully I will get done in the next few days.  It is sure a slow process...."},

I usually try it with ones bigger than these...but you still get the feel, however so slight.  If I could get them the way I wanted them, the photo would be called Silent Sentinels but until then I will just call them power lines.  (All these really need to be enlarged...it never fails to amaze me how enlarging pictures improves them.)Of course these are from the strip pits...which leads me to ask if you have ever noticed the search box at the top of the page on our blogs...at least those on Blogger.  I don't even want to admit how long it was before I noticed it or actually used it.  You can type in what you are looking for in a blog, and if it is mentioned in that blog, it will bring up the entries that mention it.Anyway, I am almost ashamed to suggest this, but try searching for strip pits on my blog and see how many times I have used that term just in the short time since I restarted this blog.Changing subjects again, there are a lot of us that love to watch the birds...and I wanted to mention the Xcel Energy Bird Cams....for several years now, I have watched eagles, owls, kestrels, osprey, and falcons raise their young.  So just click on that link if you are at all interested...I think you will enjoy it.Well, we finally decided to put in a water softener...for some reason I have been sort of resistant to it.  But we really needed one, so we got one last week and Roger got things ready, and put it in yesterday and today.  Of course it isn't near as big as the one below...where he worked before had three of the one below plus had a big salt brine tank on the outside of the building.  If I remember correctly they could crawl inside these things to work on them.  Can you imagine that?  I will ask him in the morn and post whether I am correct or not in the comment section.Anyway, along with the water softener, we are also going to put in a new dishwasher.  My old one has not been usable for ages.  So I have spent hours and hours researching which one to get.  Trying to read all the reviews I could find, and also checking consumer reports.  It will come in on Friday...and Roger will put it in.Maybe with that decision made, I will get back to regular routine for a couple of days at least.  I am also in the mood to sew and would like to start a couple different projects.  So wish me luck..."},

Looking and looking at everything.The cats did not pay any attention to her, but our old dog was instantly smitten with her.  I have had several part collie and one full blooded collie, and I just think that is the nature of them. It is good we celebrated yesterday...it was rainy yesterday, but today it has turned cold and rainy.  And we have even seen snow flurries this morn.

I finished it, and it has been washed and dried.It is not really anything to brag about, but I am proud of it.Almost everything was done on the machine...except I did applique the body of the duck by hand.When Sarah was little, I was making a quilt for Rachel that was inspired by a book called The Fuzzy Duckling.  Rachel never liked quilts...and to this day she uses them in a way all her own.Sarah, on the other hand, liked being covered from the beginning.  And when I got that quilt done, she took charge of it.  And it had to go with her wherever she went.  I am not joking.  We just did not leave the house without it.  If we did, we would be coming back.So when she was pregnant I wanted to make a quilt for her baby.  I could not make up my mind what.  I started one thing, but just couldn't come to some decisions about things.  So it sat, and still sits down in the basement.  Then the idea for making her a fuzzy duckling quilt hit and I knew that was what I wanted to do.I thought I could just go and put my hands on my old pattern.  So I didn't start right away.  I forget what was going on, but I have to have peace of mind to start a project.  Once I get going if it is not complicated, it can become an escape from troubled thoughts.  Just not at the beginning.Then, when I did decide to start, I could not find our old book.  I could not find my original pattern.  You would be amazed at the treasures I have to do with quilting and sewing.  It is a chore to go through everything.  So, couldn't think what I was going to do.Then I remembered mom wanting my pattern.  I have a box of her stuff upstairs.  I went and got it to look through it, and I found the body to the duck.  I had found my original butterfly down where I thought the whole pattern was.  I could draw the legs, eyes, and beak again.  My original one did not have a barn, but I added one to this.  The original was just made of random fabrics I  had here and had a flannel backing.  And it was tied.I would show you pictures of it, and maybe I will take a picture of what is left of it if I can remember tomorrow when I go to Sarah's.  All that is left is rags.This one is is probably more well made, has better fabrics, but so  much smaller than the other one.  It is machine quilted, and does not have the flannel back.  However, it is made with love.To see more Sepia Scenes, or to join click on Lorelei (the badge) at the top.  To see this in B&W, go here."},

I have been driving the backroads of Parke and Vermillion Counties for years now, and still find new things.  They are essentially in my backyard...I don't have to take a trip to see a famous place to find something that grabs my attention.This is one we seen Sunday...I don't think I have ever been down the road this was on.  And I look at those rocks and wonder how long they have been there and where did they came from.  And just how were they moved?  Was this used as a cellar, or was it a storm shelter or what.There was an old house there that was laying there in a pile...it had just fell in upon itself.  Another untold story.

Another item was something from the pharmacy which was waiting for us.  We were going to pay for it up front, and as we were walking away, I ask Roger if he checked to make sure it was the right item...or maybe I should say right style of item.  (Lancets--there are several 'styles' I guess you would call them, and all are not made the same)  He looked and it was not...so he took it back and while we waited for them to get the correct ones, we went back to the gardening section.We did come home with the above...but I could have spent so much more.  I could go wild for flowers and gardening things.   They also had Kennebec seed potatoes...also had Yukon Gold.  But just hearing the name or seeing Kennebec takes me back to childhood.  I don't know that we always planted them...but I think we did sometimes.  I guess I just liked the sound of the name because it has stuck all these years.  (Or maybe we didn't plant them at all...one of my brothers can surely tell me.)  I don't recall the name of any others at all.And the thoughts of hickory cane corn and cornfield beans brings such a happy vision to my mind.  I don't know who of you have heard of either one so I will explain a little bit.  Hickory cane corn is a very tall corn...I am 5'3\" tall and it towers above me.  The ears of corn are long and seems to me kind of slender.  Maybe they just seemed slender...but for sure the kernels of corn are much wider and flatter than any other we ever grew.  And maybe it comes in yellow, but we always grew white.But the corn is not the object.  We grew it so we could plant cornfield beans with it!  I suppose they are similar to pole beans, but it was an actual variety.  I don't know if they exist any more--I have never seen them in Indiana.  The beans were long and oh so beautiful.  And so much fun to pick.  No bending over...but I don't even think that was the total pleasure of them.  They were just a pleasure to pick, and to eat.  I suppose it is an exaggeration to say they hung like grapes, but yet that is how I felt about them.  We could pick a bushel in no time at all.I think it is something deep within my soul, maybe back to caveman days, but I love to pick things.  And my favorite things to pick above all else are blackberries, cornfield beans, and apples."},

I wish we could get closer but they are off and running when we start getting even remotely close.  Roger wonders if they have been poached, but I wonder if it is just cause because they are not used to vehicles.We will be out there an hour or two and at the most see one or two other vehicles.As usual, it ended with a beautiful sunset."},

This is Lorelei and I, taken late with a cell phone....she loves sleeping on me like this.  We almost took a nap together earlier in the day... I was so worn out when we came home that I barely got on the computer. And I just couldn't even make a decision about what to post on here, so didn't do anything.Please enlarge these for better viewing!Today we did a little bit of yard work, and had leftover for our evening meal.  I got to checking prices of water softeners and dishwashers on here....while trying to keep an eye on the sun.  When I thought it late enough, we headed out to the strip pits.  On the way we saw deer and turkey, no place to pull over to take any photos.  But we no more than got started at the strip pits when I spotted these two ring-necked pheasants.These are for sure not the most in-focus shots, yet they are better than I hoped for.  I was sooo excited at getting to witness this.  It is a miracle I got anything at all.I have never witnessed a fight before.....and so consider myself blessed to finally see it for myself.These are in the sequence they were shot...I did get a couple more but they are not good, and by then they noticed me.  They took off shortly after this shot.  We did see one more pheasant before we came home but it was too late, and I couldn't get close enough anyway.Other than these, we saw several beaver, all in the water....had one hit the water with his tail when he seen me.  At the other strip pit we used to fish at, I seen them regularly, but that has probably been at least 10 years ago.And we saw lots and lots of deer there!  None are very good shots but will try to post one or two in the coming days.  Only seen one owl and one Northern Harrier, both very late and both were flying.  So no shots at all of them."},

I do have the little quilt for Lorelei almost finished.  But it should have been finished long ago--it is small.  It really hasn't taken a lot of time once I started working on it.  I have just a tiny bit more quilting to do, but am putting the binding on before I finish it.  I don't think I have ever put the binding on before something is completely quilted...but there is a first time for everything.It sure has been fun to sew a little bit...I have plans for more things I want to sew.  I just hope I can get some uninterrupted time to work on the projects.  I used to come home from work and sew just for a few minutes and I would accomplish a lot over time...now, it seems like if I get distracted, I get out of the  mood to do anything.And Mama Squirrel has been visiting quite a bit....I almost got a picture of her looking through the back storm door with Bubbie on the inside watching her.  Soon as she sees me she gets active and heads to the fence post or picnic table....however, I can't get out the door that quick with all the cats, and she was back and met me on the steps one time.  She ran around and around my feet on the way to the picnic table.  I keep expecting her to get brave one of these days and climb up my pant legs.I really think she might have babies, but I don't know which of our neighbor's trees they are in.  I sort of thought it was early, but she was fairly 'big' and all of a sudden she is back skinny and well, there are other signs.  The cats have sure complicated things with her....I will think I have them all in the house, and suddenly she will take off.  If I look around, I will spot one of them.   And Puss Puss chased her up the tree the other day...from  our yard over into our neighbors yard.  Mama Squirrel ran up the tree, then came back down like she was going to run back to me.I grabbed a chair and climbed on it and hopped over the fence to grab the cat,  walked around the fence to the front, and threw her in the house through the front door, and about the time I got back around back, here came Mama Squirrel to meet me.  She is just so hungry...really eats a lot.I have heard or read somewhere that spring time is a hard time of year for animals.  There isn't much left, plus a lot of people stop putting out food cause they think it is spring and that it will be easier for the animals.  Not sure if this is completely true....but it does sound likely.  Especially for the animals that needs seed/fruits.Well, it is 2:02 according to my watch...I won't be on here much tomorrow....going to go see Lorelei.  I will try to catch up with everyone tomorrow night."},
{"title": "Handsome!", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "Please enlarge for better viewing.In our rambling yesterday, we were going right slow along the road when I spotted this rooster and another one in a fenced-in area of someone's yard.  I couldn't resist a shot of him.  Isn't he the handsome one?  I don't know what it is, but I like chickens, and think roosters are just so handsome.  Not cute, but handsome or beautiful.   And colorful!  Black, white, red, orange, etc or a combination.  One I seen at the fair was this deep, deep auburn red.They also bring back good memories.  When Roger and I moved to Tennessee when we were young, my best friend/sister-in-law's dad gave us our own chickens.  We kept them in a pen for a while, then let them have the run of the place.  We always slept a little late on the weekends, and there was always this one little white hen that would go strolling by our bedroom window singing.  I have no other word for it.Also at the little place we rented, there were these little snakes about a foot long....one chicken would catch one and then all the other chickens would try to catch that chicken because they wanted to kill the snake.  Roger thought it hilarious.  There would go the chicken with the snake and a whole line of other chickens chasing her.Of course, the thing we still laugh about is the rooster.  One time Roger and one of my brothers were out in the front yard after work one evening practicing with their bows and arrows.  Not sure how to explain it, but our little house set right against a big ridge...hill, or some might even call it a mountain.  So they had bales of hay to have their target on, but if the arrow went  through the bales of hay, there was the hillside right there to catch it.Well, up the side of it were some younger trees...I cannot remember what kind.  But they were not huge...and after we let the chickens run free, they started roosting in those trees.  Well, while Roger and Robert were shooting their bows and arrows, the chickens were trying to get situated in the trees.  It was that time of day where it is just a few minutes before dark takes over.I didn't see this, nor hear the beginnings of it, but I heard the end Cock-a Doodle-Doooo and I heard Roger and Robert laughing so ran outside to see what was going on.  The hens had all settled in those trees, and the rooster was trying to get situated and Roger said you could hear him flopping all around up there and disturbing the others, making them squawk.  And in a second or two, he came falling out of the tree, rolled down the hill, and jumped up and crowed!Roger still laughs about this, and it is funnier still to hear and see him tell it.  I told Neal about it one night and he said he woke up that night after going to bed and started laughing about it.  i am sitting here smiling just remembering it...and if Roger came and went through his routine about it, I would be laughing out loud."},
{"title": "From today", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2009", "text": "Today Bubbie came home from the vet...he had to go in yesterday to have the pin taken out of his leg.  He was still too groggy to come home yesterday evening, so I went and got him first thing this morning.  He was just soooo happy to get home.This morn Roger and a buddy of his that retired at the same time decided to go get breakfast...and after they ate, Roger took him to show him a few of our favorite fishing holes.They didn't get home till after lunch, and soon as his buddy left, we headed to this place south of Linton, Indiana called Goose Pond.  It is a Fish and Wild Life Area.  It was a big area, but we really didn't see much.  We saw a few mallards, some geese, and these birds....I hope Mary or Leedra or someone can tell me what they are.  I am too tired to look them up.  These two photos are cropped sections of the same photo.From this area we went to the Greene-Sullivan State Forrest.  I must say that while we were a little disappointed in Goose Pond Fish and Wildlife Area, the Greene-Sullivan State Forrest was very nice surprise.  It is an old, old strip pit area.  and lots and lots of strip pits, and a couple or three reservoirs that we seen.  Excellent places to go fishing.We actually fished a little bit at two or three of them...but apparently we were there at the wrong time of day or something.  I caught one little bluegill, and Roger only got a couple or three hits.  I can't wait to go back when it gets a little bit warmer.I need to post this and see about getting settled in for bed.  It feels so good to be home...even though I love going to places like that, I am always glad to be back in my own home in my own chair.Update:  Thanks go out to Deb of Notes from the Cloud Messenger for telling me that these are American coots."},
{"title": "Not here yet", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2009", "text": "I am trying to be patient and wait for spring, in the meantime I thought I would post this dogwood blossom again.  Dogwoods are probably my favorite flowering tree...though I really love them all.This is in my front yard, lucky to be alive.  I don't know what happened but it got injured when it was young.  Almost killed in fact.  The bark was missing at least half-way around and probably a width of 8-10 inches up and down the little trunk of the tree.  I left it alone, not really believing it would heal itself but it did.However, the blooming was changed.  It was a pink dogwood when I bought it, and though it had only bloomed a few times when it got injured, they were always pink...at least when it was in full bloom.  After the injury, the first year or two it bloomed, the flowers were much more white with just a touch of pink.  Slowly, it has come back to basically a pink dogwood again. Yet there are usually a few blooms with a touch of white to them.  I guess in time it the white will disappear."},
{"title": "Special days...", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "text": "Yesterday was sort of a special day for me...in more ways than one.  I got to looking at this little pamphlet that Roger picked up about Indiana's recreational areas and wanted to take a drive to see one of them...but we didn't.  And I was so glad we didn't.First of all Kay came over;  she has not been over for more than a minute in a very long time.  I have not known the reason....and still don't for sure though I do have a pretty good idea.  Which is not mine to tell.  Anyway, she and her 5 year old cousin, and her younger brother came over and visited for quite a while.  Played outside, got blankets from home and laid out in the yard pretending they were sunbathing, had snacks.  Just as if they had never be absent.  So that was all good.I was sitting outside talking to them, and looked up and here came three people down the sidewalk.  It was another couple of 'our kids' that used to spend a LOT of time here.  It was Travis and Kenny, and Travis's girlfriend.  I don't remember her name...but she was a cute girl.  They are both grown up and have been out of high school for a couple years I think.Kenny first started coming over here when he was about 3-4 years old.  His grandma lives down the street, and how he got started coming to play with the girls is more than I know.  My youngest, Sarah, is probably at least 4 years older than him older.  Anyway, when the girls were young, and I worked, I always came home early enough to be here when they got home...some of the time here Kenny would come.  He would come in and sit down to watch TV and wait for them and lots of time would go to sleep.  I will have to dig out pictures if I can find them....Fast-forward a couple years and his cousins' parents were going through a divorce...so they were all staying down at his grandmas.  Even Kenny and  his family, but I don't remember why she was down there.    Their house was a full house!So then Kenny started bringing Travis down, and before long, Travis's younger brother Dustin.  Only Dustin was so quiet he literally wouldn't say a word for the longest time.  They literally spent hours and hours here...and the thing of it was they were the best kids ever.  They were never picky about food...ate whatever I fixed.  I might should  not admit this, but I am not always that at ease with kids.  I never once wanted to send those kids home, and only had to a couple times because we all had to leave.  (Kenny's younger sister was a different story--when she and her little female cousins came in, it was like a whirlwind coming through and I couldn't wait for them to come home.)That went on for several months...by then my girls were up older and stayed home part of the time when I worked and usually those kids stayed with them.   Their family's kind of got their life straightened out, and Travis's mom moved to Terre Haute, and Kenny's moved not too far from here.  In other words, he was still at his Grandma's fairly often.  And for a while, when they came to visit her, the boys would still come down.Then they grew older, and of course had their school friends, had their own life.  And we just got a wave from them.  And maybe they would stop every now and then...but that was okay so long as they were happy.Then year before last after was out of high school, he stopped and visited for quite a while with us, and after that he joined the army....and is still serving.  Yesterday was the first time we had seen him since that one good visit.  He has served in Iraq and is now back stateside.  I can not remember when he said his enlistment is up, but he wants to go to college and become a teacher.  Physical education, of course.  If you knew how athletic he was, you would know that that fits.We had not seen Travis for a good visit since he was young...he is working for UPS....the way I understood him he is still considered part time, but hopes to make full time in the future.  He had played football all during high school...I didn't ask why he wasn't going to college.  He was always a smart kid and should have went.They told us Dustin had also joined the army and is in basic training now.   I would love to have seen him also...can't wait to tell our girls about their visit.  Of course I showed them pictures of Lorelei.Well, it is time I started thinking about getting ready to take Bubbie to get his pin out...just had to tell about what a good day yesterday was.Oh, and on top of seeing the boys, I got Rachel's curtains finished."},
{"title": "Today's doings..", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2009", "text": "The following photos were all taken today...I hope you will take the time to enlarge them.  The barn for its beauty....and its colorful appeal....And these of the house.  Another of those houses that would have volumes to tell if we could only hear.What really impresses me on some of the old houses is some of the artistic work that has gone into making them beautiful.  Just look at the porch and then this window...one has to wonder what tools were available to do the work.  Or are they new enough till someone just went and got them and put them in place.  I don't really think that was the case, but even if it was, it still took time and effort to get them in place.I am not sure how good this next photo is...I had to use photoshop to make it at all viewable.  (Every now and then for no apparent reason I will have a photo turn out so dark that it has to be messed with...all these others are straight out of the camera.   And they are all at the same stop along the road.)First of all the top window pane has little panes of colored glass all around the edge...I don't know if you would call it stained glass or not.  But it is still something you don't see very often on every day homes.  And notice this window has the same work above it as the other one...but then glance on farther up at the peak part of the house...I guess that is what you would call it.  The part with the clamshell work...I don't have any idea how that is done.  But look all along the bottom of it...more artistic work.  Not sure if this is  classified as gingerbread trim or not...I think we can safely assume that this house was well loved by someone.  Don't you just wish you knew the real story and didn't need to imagine it?You know what prompted today's travels?  I think I mentioned I had to do some work on my daughter's curtains...well, in the early afternoon, I was all set to start on them when I realized I did not have the right color thread.   I ask Roger if he wanted to go to Walmart with me...he needed two or three things out there so he did.  I took my camera along, and after picking up what we needed, I had more plans...you might say I had an ulterior motive for asking Roger if he wanted to go.Not too far from here is a very small town...it has one gas station and one or two tiny restaurants, plus a little place that has a drive through or you walk up and order and sit at picnic tables...and they have cheesecake ice cream.    I had been craving it...so we went on up there we went.  And of course I took my camera...I am getting more and more till I don't leave home without it.Now from there, Roger wanted to go back where we went last week to this one covered bridge to see how high the water was...he is ready to start wading and fishing.  But Sugar Creek was way out of the banks so that put a halt to those plans...But it did lead us on a little drive and that was fun. Did I get the curtains done?  No, but I have a good start on them.  Should get them finished tomorrow if nothing else happens.  But for now, good night."},
{"title": "Camera critters", "date": "Saturday, March 14, 2009", "text": "Below is Cheep-Cheep!  I have posted them before, but thought they were worthy  of publishing again for Camera Critters.  I saw Carletta's post of robins here and it reminded me of him.I don't know if Cheep-Cheep was a boy or a girl....he fell out of nest of a neighbor during a summer storm and knowing our girls as they did, they brought him to us.  He was not near this far along.We raised him on night crawlers.  A very expensive proposition.  I cannot remember how many times he ate a day.  We had him in a homemade cage in our backyard, and soon as we walked out the door, if he was hungry there was all these little cheeping noises he made.  So that is where his name came from. And now this is something I sort of wish I had a picture of and sort of glad I don't...he could eat one and one half night crawlers, but if we gave him two, the second one came crawling back up and out!  It was gross and funny all at the same time.  (I have a weak stomach--it don't take much to get to me.)The girls would run water in a bowl and he would take baths...just such a sweet little critter.  We had vacation scheduled, and had a kid taking care of him.   When we came back, someone had left the cage open and he had escaped....we knew it was close to time and always hoped he made it own his own.  He had been free and up in the trees by our house before, but always came to be fed.  So maybe he did survive...for years, every robin we seen in the yard we wondered if it was him.If you want to join camera critters, click on the badge at the top of this post.I been sitting here fiddling with the layout on here...didn't really change anything except the picture across the top and a couple colors.  Just in the mood to try something different.  It is too late to change the whole thing around.  I finally settled on a picture to post...an old barn.  It is one from last Sunday. I spent the day in Terre Haute with my oldest daughter...we went shopping.  she wanted to get material for me to lengthen a pair of her curtains.  We went to Hobby Lobby and found material just exactly the right shade of brown, and almost the same type of fabric.  So I now have something else I need to sew.  And once I start, I will enjoy it.I do worry about getting things right.  She won't be as picky about the way it turns out as I will.  And I will be more of a perfectionist with it being someone else's than if it were my own.  It really shouldn't take too long.  I still have got back to quilting on the baby's quilt...maybe I will also work on that tomorrow.Sarah brought Lorelei up for a little visit yesterday....she is a doll.  Shelby, our old collie-mix dog was totally thrilled with her.  The cats just sort of looked and ignored her.  I made spaghetti and garlic bread for the rest of us, and sent some home with her for Jeremy. I probably make my garlic bread a little different to most people....oh, I don't make the actual bread itself.  But I buy a loaf of Italian bread, and I usually buy it pre-sliced.  I butter it, then sprinkle it with garlic salt, and fry it on top of the stove till it is toasty brown.  It is just better than baked in the oven for me.And sometimes we will get a loaf of Italian bread and slice it as thin as we possibly can with an electric knife, which is about a quarter of an inch thick or less.  Butter those slices, sprinkle with garlic salt and fry.  It is almost like eating potato chips...no one can eat just one.It is late, late.  I got to get to bed...the cats are all sound asleep.  Oh, I do take Bubbie to the vet to get his pin out Monday.  So keep your fingers crossed that all goes well."},

{"title": "From last week", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2009", "text": "Please click to enlarge for best viewing.Either I have no new sky pictures to post, or I have too  many to choose from.  This is one from last week when I went to the strip pits...the same night I took the most recently posted owl pictures.I wish I could have went out there tonight, it was beautiful enough here in town, I bet it would have been wonderful to be out there.  Since it is cold again, I just didn't have the desire to go that I would have had it been warm.It turned colder again last night...and the wind was whipping around everything.  I hung sheets out and wondered if they would stay on the lines even with using 4 or 5 clothespins.  They stayed and I bet they were dry in and hour or so.  Roger went out just to see after about 45 minutes and said they were almost dry...just felt a little damp.I did start machine quilting the little baby quilt...it didn't start out too good.  I never seem to be able to plan what I am going to do...I just go down and wing it.  Well, this time I thought I had at least one part planned, and went down there and tried it and it didn't work.  So I had a few stitches to rip out...But then, I started and this time I got in the grove and did pretty good.  Since it is a small quilt, I should be able to finish it soon.  It is always sort of hard for me to start when I have quilted in a while.  But now that I have started, I done have plans for more.  I want to quilt a top or two I already have made and I want to make Lorelei a couple more quilts...one to stay here and another bigger one to go home with her.Speaking of Lorelei, did you notice the new picture in the sidebar?  It was taken by Sarah--I think Sarah.  It wasn't me for sure.  I just love it.  And if all goes well, they are coming up tomorrow.  If they have a good night...so, I am off to bed."},

Lots of times clouds like this come and go in short order.  I would have preferred to go to the strip pits but was afraid they would be gone before I could get there.So I headed north out of town to this one road...doesn't have a very interesting foreground but had a great view of the clouds.The wind was howling like a banshee the time I was there, and I declare, if you were off balance, it could almost knock you over.  Notice I say 'almost'...it hit with such a force that it was sort of surprising and made me feel like it could knock me over.  I doubt that it really could have.Today is another windy day, and though it is late I am going to hang out sheets here in a few minutes and hope the wind doesn't blow them away.  One thing for sure, they will be dry in short order. I have a pair of Roger's jeans to patch and have the baby quilt pin basted and need to quilt on it....so thought I best get something posted before I got involved in anything else.I do hope you will click and enlarge some of these to get the full effect."},
{"title": ".....", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "I have always had a thing for single trees, and I find myself taking more pictures of them.  As well, as wondering why people will leave just one tree in the middle of hundreds of acres. The above is actually in someones backyard, or almost their backyard looking out over farmland.  I like the way it leans and curves.The above was taken just to show the clouds...they almost don't look real.This one was actually in a pasture, and it had a partner.  I wonder if they were left for shade for cattle...or what for.  They make the whole scene inviting...makes one want to have a picnic under its branches.The above photo was taken by Roger.But if you want to talk inviting...doesn't that little face above just make your heart melt?  We spent the day with her and her mom, and her daddy got home before we left.  I think kitties are cute and puppies are cute, but oh my, when it comes to babies.  They are so innocent and so adorable....you can't stand to think of them being hurt or hungry or sick.  You just want to protect them the rest of their lives.  I told Roger we better hold her all we can, because before we turn around she will be up and about and too busy to want to be held much."},
{"title": "You've got mail...", "date": "Monday, March 9, 2009", "text": "Please click to enlarge for better viewing.We went for a little drive yesterday...and came across this mailbox.  It is one I had never seen before.  I like to find the unusual and I must say this one was.I really enjoy email, and would be lost without it now.  Yet there is nothing like a handwritten note or letter.  I am not sure how many of you know that Neal and I come from a big family...there were 8 of us children.  So by the time I could remember, three of my sisters had left home, and then another one left before I started school.  If I remember correctly, I was in about 5th grade before we got a phone--it was a party line at that. (More about that later.)   Anyway, even after we got the phone, we just did not make long distance calls.  Money was too tight.  So letters was our means of keeping in touch.Anyway, the rural mail did not come to our area till later...so we had to get our mail at the post office.  When we were in school that was fine since we passed right by it every weekday and could pick it up.  But in the summer, a special trip had to be made....sometimes one of my brothers road their bike down to get it, others another brother would pick it up if he was down there.  The post office was about a mile away...not far.  If walking, we walked the railroad cause it was an even shorter distance.It was almost like Christmas to get a letter from one of my sisters, or even Neal after he left home.  If I picked one up after school, I flew up that railroad as fast as I could go.  Soon as mom got  it, she would take time from whatever she was doing and sit down and read it aloud to all of us that happened to be there, with all of us hanging on to  her every word.  Such joy that just a few written lines could bring.I mentioned being on a party line...there were four of us families on it.  I can remember who two of the others were, but I cannot remember the fourth.  So maybe I am wrong and there were only three....but that is not important.  What is important is this.  One of my best friends was on it.  I cannot remember the exact way we were able to call each other...if we called each other the way you normally do, we would get a busy signal.  I know we dialed a number, not sure if it was the right phone number or some other number, and quick hung up our phone and let it ring, and then when we thought it was picked up by the other, then pick our own phone up.You might ask was was special about that...there were 4 or 5 of us girls that had went through grade school together and we tended to stick together in high school.  Well, if there was something we were working on in school, Becky and I might talk.  We would hang up and she would call one of the other girls, I would give her time to get them called, and then I would pick up on my end and the three of us could talk.  We were ahead of the time!Even with the phone, some of us girls wrote letters back and forth...and I still really enjoy getting a letter.  Even if it is typed, there is just something about holding it in my hand.  Maybe somehow I am unconsciously thinking about the fact that my hand is holding something that a loved one's hand has held.  Not sure.  I just know I still enjoy getting a letter, but that does not happen often these days.So I eagerly await Christmas cards, and the ones that have a note in them add something to the season.  But do I write notes in  the ones I send--no.  It is usually a hectic time and I don't...though there are always one or two that I write in.  People that I don't hear from except at Christmas.  I hope it adds as much to their day as it does when I hear from someone."},
{"title": "Doors", "date": "Saturday, March 7, 2009", "text": "I took two or three pictures of the barn above last fall...the other day when we went fishing and came home a round-about way and passed it again..I took this and a couple more of it.  I just love the style of it. I like the colors, I like the lightening rods.  You know though, I just now got to really noticing all the doors.  Wouldn't you love to know what this barn was used for?  And why had I not noticed them before.It makes even less sense when I tell you that I seen this barn for the first time when I took this and a couple more photos of it.  When I enlarged it, one of the first things I noticed about it is the little door in the center...the one that is about one third of the way up.  It is a regular door below it, but it is kind of hard to tell that it is a door because it blends in so well.That little square door above it really has my curiosity up...I would love to know what it is for.  And I also wonder why I really noticed it but all the white doors on the other barn barely registered.We have went for walks the past couple of days, and taken our rod & reels...we walk, and then fish for just a few minutes.  And we went from one strip pit in Universal that is actually for the public, I think owned by the little town, to another one that is owned by Indiana DNR over by West Terre Haute.This tree caught our eye almost immediately...I think if you enlarge it you will like it better.  With all the wind that we have, it is amazing that it is still standing.  One just across the way had fallen. Then, there were a couple pair of geese...I really got the feeling that it is mating season.  Each pair was off to itself.  Normally, there are several geese at this old strip pit all year  long, but day before yesterday there were only the two pair.As for my fishing, I fished a few minutes two different days, and each time I caught one little Largemouth Bass....about 10 inches long.

Sky Watch is a meme to join and share your photos of the sky....believe me, I see some awesome shots every time I start visiting.These top three photos are more from when we went up north last week to Willow Slough and Jasper-Pulaski Wildlife areas.It was sure awesome to see the sky changing the way it did.  And I loved the silhouette effect it gave everything.Now this bottom photo was taken just last night on the way to Terre Haute...it was definitely on the way to being dark when we decided to run down there.  I told Roger  I was taking my camera cause I always regretted it when I didn't.I only took about a dozen shots and this was my pick of them.  I was shooting out my side window and when you going 55 mph down a highway, with telephone poles, it is hard to take pictures between them.  Or at least it is for me...some of the time.  I honestly think that sometimes they are a bit farther apart...but maybe it is that we just aren't going quite the speed limit.Anyway, if you want to join, or just check out the views from around the world, click on the badge at the top of the page.  Also, these photos should all enlarge and I think the bigger they are, the better."},
{"title": "Should I do like these deer--turn and run?", "date": "Wednesday, March 4, 2009", "text": "I always wonder about my experience with blogging compared to my fellow bloggers.  At least to the ones I 'talk' to a regular basis.  I wonder do you occasionally get the comments that are basically only links to lottery?  Do you get them and delete them before anyone else sees them.  It has been a while since I have gotten any, but it seems to go in spurts.  And I had one comment back when I very first began that I had a strong suspision linked to a porn sight...I can't even remember now why I felt that way but I deleted it too quick to talk about.Then I have gotten two or three emails from Justin, supposedly he works for 123 Greetings.  Here is the main part of his letter:123Greetings Studio is a unique 'platform' for  anyone with a creative flair, who want to participate and expose their  creativity to millions of people worldwide.

Please  do let me know if you are interested to take a part and I would be glad to send  you an invitation along with a Sign Up link. Once you Sign Up with the Studio,  you will get to know a lot more about itThat was the second letter I got from him, and he even mentioned the previous one in the first paragraph.  I didn't respond to either one of them.  They were two months apart.  I guess I am not a very trusting person.Then either yesterday or the day before I received this email from Tal Yarkoni:This is an invitation to participate in an online research study being conducted by Mr. Tal Yarkoni under the supervision of Dr. Simine Vazire at Washington University in St. Louis. The study investigates the relation between people's personality and the content and style of their writing, and has been approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office.  The study consists of a single personality questionnaire assessing your personality and background, as well as information about your blog (if you have one). You can choose to participate in either a short or a long version of the study, so your participation can take as little as 10 minutes or as long as 30-40 minutes.  Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any point after you begin. We will not ask you to reveal any information that could potentially be used to identify you, with the optional exception of the address of your blog if you maintain one. While there are no material benefits to participation, you do have the option of receiving information about your personality scores at the end of the experiment.  This is a one-time solicitation, and you will NOT receive any further e-mail from us. We obtained your e-mail address from your blog strictly for one-time use, and we will not maintain any further record of your contact information.  If you'd like to participate, our study can be accessed at:And it goes on to give a link to a website...now this is something that is tempting to do...the link goes to one page that is an agreement of sorts and it does seem straight forward.  And the part that makes me want to do it is it says:There are no known risks associated with participating in this experiment except for the potential for boredom or fatigue. However, upon completion of the study, you will be given the option of seeing your personality scores. Should you choose to view your scores, please note that there is a small risk that some of the feedback you receive will be unpleasant. There are no known benefits except for the knowledge that your participation is contributing to science.The part in red is the really tempting part....I have looked the guy up and he seems legitimate.  I love doing on-line personality quiz type things and would love to do one that was really a bit more in depth.  I wondered does anyone else get these kinds of things and what is your response?"},

It isn't far so I don't waste much gas, there is usually something interesting to see, and I don't see many people.  And besides, it promised to be a beautiful sunset.Please enlarge for best viewing.Tonight when I first got there I seen a Northern Harrier, actually in a tree.  I tried to ease up to it, but it flew to the next tree, and then away.  It is so unusual to see one in a tree...especially for more than a few seconds.  Most times, I see them land in the grass, and that is where they have their nests.  If there is an abundant food supply, one male may have 4 or 5 mates.  The females stay on the nests and he supplies their food. I think the reason he was staying in the tree had something to do with it being almost dark.I seen so many of these fellas--the short-eared owls.  I saw three or four of these in the air at one time.  I cannot remember how many different birds these actually are, but it is for sure more than one bird.Look at that face!!!!  But doesn't the overall appearance make you think of a plane coming in for a landing.These owls fly close to the ground, just like the Northern Harrier.  (Note to myself:  I need to check and see what their breeding habits are.)Though I probably took at least a dozen and a half pictures of three or four owls perching on post, and one in a tree, but the one below is the best picture so far.Tomorrow I get to go see Lorelei.  I wonder if I will be able to tell she is growing...it has been a week  and a day since I have seen her...the longest I have went without seeing her..  We were planning on going over the weekend, but Roger had the flu bug hit him so we stayed home.BTW, I hope I haven't confused you with my music...after giving the award to John at John's Photoblog, talking about why I first kept going to his blog was the music I had on earlier...I just had to listen to it a few times and I put it on here.Then I thought of Brooke White....does anyone besides me watch American Idol?  I actually have only watched it the past couple of years...last year was the first time I seen it from beginning to end.  Right away I fell in love with Brooke White.  She didn't win...in fact I cannot remember quite how far she got.  I had thought to google her a while back and seen she had an album.  And while I liked them, I didn't just LOVE any of them.Imagine my surprise when she appeared on Idol last week and sang the song that I have playing on here.  It is a single that is on Itunes...and I just love it!  So listen and enjoy--don't you just love her!"},

I want to publicly thank her here before it gets too much later.  And I am even trying to form the list in my head of who I want to pass them to.The Kreativ Blogger award is supposed to go to seven people, but I am limiting it to fewer than that.  I for sure want to pass it to:1. Lene @ Knips & Nips2. John @ John's PhotoblogI ran across both of these through Sky Watch Friday...I originally kept going to John's to find out who played this instrumental he at one time had on his blog...it was an added bonus that I loved his photos.Just within the past few weeks I ran across Lene's and I just happened to glance at her sidebar and lo and behold, John is her husband.  Let me tell you, her photographs are awesome, too!  I am not sure they accept awards, but even if they don't, I hope you all will check out their blogs.3.  East Gwillimbury Wow! (Daily Photo) and More of Me, Another Side....Not sure if you accept awards, it doesn't offend me if you don't mention this on your blogs, just want you to know that your photos give me great joy.4. Dot @ The World in Black and White I know she usually doesn't accept awards, but I still think you should check it out if you like B&W.   I gave this to her because she came up with concept for it.  She and Tricia of Bluff Area Daily and Mojo of  Why? What have you heard? are the administrators of this blog.Now this Friends award...Hmmm, let me see.Right back at ya, Tricia (Bluff Area Daily)...I want to send it back your way.then there is:2.  Carletta @ Carletta's Captures and Round the Bend.  I always enjoy Carletta's posts...her new blog Carletta's Capture is going to feature some great photographs...and there is always something of interest at Round The Bend.3.  Betsy @ Joyful Reflections--I found Betsy through my brother, Neal and his blog.  She lives in Tennessee, which I still consider home...it is where I grew up.  I always enjoy her posts....love it when she shares her life with us all.  Her and her husband George, met later in life and you just feel their love for each other.  Always come away with a brighter outlook after visiting her blog.4.  Barb @ *We* Quilt  Barb is one of the first people to comment on my original blog...we met through a quilt forum.  I have grown away from the forums, but we still keep in touch.5.   Mary @ Faith, Fabric, and Photos I don't remember how I first found her blog but I continue to go back, if not daily, if I skip a day, I still check out all her posts.  She always has lots of bird pictures on her blog, and usually at the end of the week she has Squirrel Sunday... She is an Indiana gal, like myself.Now to post this and go tell everyone that they have received this award...I am not posting any rules so do what you choose with them.  Sometimes rules are made to be broken.I was looking for something else and ran across these and though they would be great for a Ruby Tuesday post.If you want to join the fun, go see MaryT@ Work of the Poet.  It is a whole lot of fun and you meet a lot of nice people."},
{"title": "Contrasts", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2009", "text": "These are both from our drive north the other day.  Both are drive-by shots.Isn't there a world of difference between the two?  The top was taken very late in the evening...it was verging on getting dark and the ISO was set at 800...This was taken on the way so was in daylight...ISO set at 400.  Both are a tad out of focus...it is harder to succeed with drive by shots if looking out the side window.    It tends to show the motion more.If you look close, in that top one there is a line through it...I have no idea what it is caused by.  No idea at all.  Still, it is another where you can only imagine what kind of life has happened within its walls. I have a harder time looking at barns and knowing what went on...When I look at old houses, I can hear children's laughter ring out and sometimes I imagine I can hear wives and/or mothers crying at the loss of a child or husband.  But with a barn it is different.  I think because I don't know if it was used just for storage, or for working in, or if animals lived within its walls at any time.I always wish I could enter the barns though, just as much as I do a house.  Maybe because I had so much fun in our barn....I guess this is something I should have told a while back when telling random things about myself.When I was young, say along 7, maybe eight years old...I used to go to the barn and play by myself.  I would get up in the loft and just sing and sing....songs like Henry the 8th for one...that is the only one I remember for sure.  And I would pretend I was singing to an audience.  So there, I don't know if I have ever shared that with a soul....Or I would pretend to be a trapeze artist...on the tier poles we had a sort of swing.  It was short but wide with a 'pole' of sort to sit on.  It wasn't a board...and I have no idea where it came from.  It was probably 2 to 3 inches through and worn very smooth...no bark on it.  I would hand upside down from it, climb across the tier poles, and what all else I can't remember.  But I had fun.Some of it, I couldn't even watch my kids do now;  have no idea how mom lived with us.  Some of it she probably didn't know.  We didn't always gather the fodder in from the corn but a few years we did, and it stood on the side with no loft above it...well, I know me and my one brother would go up in the loft and jump over and out and land in it.  Not Neal, though maybe he did it too.  I just can't remember.  But I know one thing...it would have been my brother that had the nerve to try it the first time.Now one thing Neal did do was this thing--don't think we had a name for it.  But I was little then...5 or 6 years old.  He would lay in the hay on his back and raise his feet up and I would lay across his feet on my belly and hold to his hands and then he would launch  me on to the other hay.  I can remember wanting him to do it more and more.  That is another thing I don't know if our mom knew about or not.So that is another thing I think about when I look at barns...I wonder if any kid played in them."},

I really hope you will click on them for the full benefit.This one above is the one I call The Three Tenors...Wednesday was one of the nicer days this week and we decided to go north to the Willow Slough Fish and Wildlife area...we were hoping to fish a little bit but all except one small part of the lake was still frozen.  So, we decided to go to the Jasper-Pulaski Fish and Wildlife area....I was hoping to see the Sandhill Cranes.  In talking to another visitor there at Willow Slough, he said his friend had called him and said the cranes had started returning.So even though it was later in the afternoon, we headed over there.  It was only about a 30-45 minute drive.  I must say it was so worth the time and effort.I know what we saw was only a drop in the bucket to what it will be like later.   I cannot image what the sound will be like cause it was so noisy with the ones that were there...I would think there was a hundred or two of them and these are just a few photos of them.Don't you just love their landing still...it made me want to laugh out loud to watch them.  They remind me of someone in a parachute...do they you?  Time after time we seen them land like these.They have a wingspan of almost 7 feet...and are around 3 1/2 feet tall.The ones here were closet to the viewing stand...We were there about and hour--till closing which is at 4:00 p.m.  All that time they were coming and going, but for the most part coming.We were walking down the ramp and heard all this noise. We turned around and almost every single one of them had taken flight and was leaving. There were deer there also and they took off running, only to pause and look.I can only say I want to go back!and remember to click on these photos to enlarge."},

Icannot remember if I have ever published them...I know I had it planned for July 4th and think I forgot them.  But I may have published them later.I totally love both the top mural and this flag...just something about someone that can do something on this scale.  Actually, that they can do them on any scale.  I don't have a lick of talent when it comes to drawing....my husband does and so do the girls.

{"title": "Look at Me!", "date": "Monday, February 23, 2009", "text": "Look at me.  I mean really look at me.  I know I am not much too look at now but at one time I was the  answer to prayers.  I was loved.   Someone once saved and scrimped to have me, and was so happy when they could finally claim me as their own.  I was one of the high points of their life.  They worked and did all kinds of stuff just to have me.  They planted flowers and bushes for beauty to surround me.  I had a family….I heard the laughter of the children along with their quiet talks with mom and dad.   I heard the children playing on my porch and in the yard. They had a swing in the old oak tree that used to stand out to the side here.  They caught lightening bugs in the dusk of summer evenings…finally, after growing tired they would settle on my front porch to plan for another day.I was home to them...I kept them warm in the winter and sheltered them from the storms of summer.  I was the place they took refuge in when life got hard.  I saw them through the Great Depression, I was here when the son came home from WWII.  I saw one daughter sneak her first kiss in the swing on my front porch.  Another left here to be the first to go to college.Meals were cooked in my kitchen, Thanksgiving and Christmases were celebrated, friends came and went.  I was at the center of their life.  My living room was a welcoming friend at the end of a long day's work.  I was the holder of their dreams.What led from then to now, happened so gradually I was hardly aware of it happening…the children grew up and married and had homes  of their own…after several years the dad died, and not too long after that the mom passed….you can sort of imagine the rest.  I was going through my own grieving and was hardly aware of time passing.    Now I am in this state and an eyesore to some, while a few others look at me and wonder what tales I could tell if I could talk."},
{"title": "Cold......", "date": "Sunday, February 22, 2009", "text": "Just thought I would show you proof of how cold it was the other day at the strip pits.I tried to think of an appropriate title for the post, maybe I should have called it 'Frozen in Time' or something like that.  Either I saw that on someone else's blog the other day or someone's picture made me think that.  But I don't want to copy someone unless I can give credit, though frozen in time is a common enough saying.All of these shapes were at the same pond or strip pit.  Around here we will say we are going to the strip pits, but once we are out there we say we are going to this or that pond.  It is all a matter of where you are when you are talking about them.BTW, this is the pond the swans were on in Saturday's post.Or maybe an old boot?  I have been seeing these old boots for I don't know how long.  They are on fence posts a couple hundred yards apart on the road to Paris, Illinois.  All this time though, I thought that the bottom of the boot sole was like the tongue of a work shoe hanging down.  I guess I just assumed since it was at a farm, that it was that kind of working shoe.It is not your eyes with that top photo..it is a tad bit blurry...it was taken the other day when it was so bitter cold.  The wind was cutting right through me.  Of all days, I did not have on good layers of clothing.  I did have on pantyhose, but they don't help much on days like that.  That requires long johns of some sort under the jeans.  And maybe even the pantyhose on under them.  And preferably either a heavier coat or a couple layers under the carhart hoodie I had on.I would love to know the story behind these shoes...I know they have been there well over a year.  Are they a joke on someone or are they to remind someone of something?  I suppose I will be wondering for a long time to come.But I have felt like an old shoe the past couple of days...have tons of stuff I need to be doing and instead I do nothing.  I have been fooling with my cameras...the other day when we were at the strip pits, my zoom lens started this thing of when it focused, it did seem to focus but the motor keep running...and the focusing ring on the lens just kept moving back and forth ever so slightly.  I have looked on line to try to find what to do and can find basically nothing...I did find one sight talking about another brand of lens that suggested pressing and releasing the lens release button a few times to do something...I forget what.I did that...no help.  I changed the battery in my camera hoping the one I had in was maybe getting too low to run the zoom lens.  It did seem worse if I had it out to 300mm...but that didn't help.  So, even though I hated to, I took the lens off the XTi and put it on my digital rebel...it did that thing on it, only maybe not quite as bad.  So, I took the lens I had on the Rebel and put it on the XTi, and it worked fine...to me that indicates it is not the camera itself.  After all that, I switched the lenses back to the way I had them.  So my mind has all this running in the background.  Wondering what to do...It snowed just a bit today--I really thought we were going to get the 1-2 inches predicted by the way it snowed this morn, but it slowed down, then quit, and the sun came out off and on for a little bit, then we got just a bit more snow...but only enough to cover the ground.  The wind has blown the entire day, and now it is snowing as I speak and it is going almost sideways.A cardinal is on the bird feeder and it almost dark...Puss Puss is sitting here beside me watching it through the window.  I think the cardinal has its eye on her also..it is taking its slow, sweet time in deciding whether to eat or not.  Or maybe it is that the wind is so strong it has the feeders swinging back and forth more than it likes.The cats are another thing...with it being so cold they go in and out, in and out.  A lot of the time one will want out and when we open the door for them, and they feel the cold, they turn around and walk away from the door.  They don't want any part of it...or if they are brave enough to go outside, they want back in in about 5 minutes.So, today and yesterday has been made up of cooking and washing dishes, a little bit of picking up and straightening up, a little laundry, and letting the cats in and out!  And I am worn out from it all.  LOL"},

What do you think they are...are they trumpeter swans?  I took several pictures and this is the best...it was so darn cold I couldn't hold the camera steady.The calves above are on the way home from the strip pit...at least on the long way home.

I hope this summer that I can see someone out and talk to them though I am pretty sure by now that they have figured out I mean no harm.And do you know what kind of cow the brown one is...I have seen a few here and there but am not really familiar with it.  I have been doing a quick google, but being that I have no idea what it is I am not having much luck.And I just had to include the ones below.As I have told you before, Puss Puss really loves Roger.

I had noticed that we weren't seeing many geese here at home and I had told Roger I think they have left and I think from what we seen they headed north.  I think this is as far south as they come...lots of cornfields and quite a few strip pits...today we seen very few geese and all winter there have been so many.    Too many to even begin to count.  Today, I didn't see but a couple in flight and not many more on the water.However, after we had been there we started seeing the hawks...does anyone know for sure what the one above is?  I have looked and looked at my books and cannot really decide...he doesn't match anything exactly.  Yet from the sound of both books, there are always variations within a species.  I don't think he is one of the Northern Harriers...he just was not flying as they normally do.  Most times when I see them they do not have their tail fanned out as this one does and if this is one he is a variation.The sky was interesting...maybe not as pretty as other times but still beautiful.Depending on the direction you looked, you could get a totally different look.  these two were taken within minutes of each other but just looking different directions.As was this one...just a minute earlier the hill was bathed in sunlight...but a cloud shaded the hill about the time I decided to take a picture.  I sat there a few minutes because I thought the cloud blocking the sun was going to pass but it didn't.  You can tell by the brilliant blue sky though that it was still there.And then there was this fellow...isn't he handsome?  I think he is one of the Northern Harriers..we seen so many of them today.  On one of the pictures of it, I think I can see the white patch on its rump.If you want to join the fun of Skywatch, click on the badge at the top of this post."},

Needless to say, I am not disappointed.  I think both are best if clicked and enlarged.  This was taken south of Terre Haute....Now that the weather is starting to swing back and forth between cold and kind of on the warm side....I think the other day it was into the upper 50's, maybe lower 60's....and today back down to the 20's. Anyway, when it is like this, that is when I really start to long for spring and warmer weather. And I changed my header back to a summertime picture from the strip pits...it seems like it has been forever since I have been out there.  I am hoping to get out there maybe tomorrow.  If I don't make it out thee tomorrow, I have no idea when I will get to go. Tomorrow Lorelei goes back to the doctor for her first check-up...she is still the best little baby.  She just sort of squeaks and chirps...I have yet to hear her cry.  She is very animated and makes all kinds of faces.  She is a living doll.I have yet to see Otto with her...when we go down he is just so excited to see us that we keep him outside or in a different room.  But when it is just them, he wants to sniff and sniff her.  I told Sarah that he is implanting her smell on his brain...I really think he knows she is theirs."},
{"title": "Remember this??", "date": "Saturday, February 14, 2009", "text": "It has been a while since I mentioned Bubbie...one of my best friends was asking about him the other day and I thought then that maybe I should show him in all his glory.  You can see from the above which leg was broken. I brought him home the day before New Years and each day he seemed to shiver worse.  We ended up calling and meeting the vet at the office on the Sunday night  following New Year's Day.  I had an appointment on Monday and was afraid to wait because he could not keep from shivering.The next weekend we were having our daughter's baby shower...and I felt so under pressure.  The doctor wanted to keep him and I told him I was done thinking about them keeping him for a few days.  I had not been getting any sleep to speak of for fear of him hurting himself.  The pictures below are his normal sleeping actions, but for some reason when I brought him home the first time, he wanted on the couch or chair almost all the time, and thought nothing of trying to jump down and I was afraid of him hurting himself, so I was trying to sleep on the couch.  And was jumping awake at movement from him.I took these pictures just an hour or so ago...he still carries his leg kind of funny, and it is stiff.  I am not sure if that has to do with the pin still being in it, or if it is from not being able to use it.  But I have a hard time keeping him out of things.  It really doesn't slow him down much.  I have caught him trying to make jumps that scare me.  And he sleeps in the middle of the floor just like this a lot of the time.He comes every morn to get me out of bed.   He jumps up on the bed and walks on me, over to Roger, back on me.  He will settle down for a short time and lay down next to me.  Then he has to get up and keep pestering Roger till he gets him awake.  That is, unless I get up and feed him.  He is still a little piggy when it comes to food.  That will settle him down for a bit...but it so good to have him getting around so good."},
{"title": "Lorelei's room", "date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "text": "I did think and take a couple or three pictures of the baby's room when we were there letting the dogs out the other day.I don't think they quite do it justice, but I don't think any camera would quite capture the color.  It is in the tan family, but it really varies with the lighting.  Sometimes it has almost a flesh color, other times more of a gray, and I swear to me in certain light it has just a hint of light, light purple!  I don't think anyone else sees it that way but me.They wanted to do it in a neutral color so that if they end up moving with their jobs, it won't be something people would look at and think they had to do over right away.  The pictures over the changing table are pictures Sarah did, but she had a sketch to go by.And see that framed thing on the wall with the window...Rachel had it made for Sarah.  She got this poem printed and then went and picked out a frame and matting and had it double matted.  And to one side, she had them cut three cutout areas in the top frame for putting pictures in.   Below is the poem..Wynken, Blynken, and Nod (Dutch Lullaby)by Eugene Field (1850-1895)  Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night   Sailed off in a wooden shoe---Sailed on a river of crystal light,   Into a sea of dew.\"Where are you going, and what do you wish?\"   The old moon asked the three.\"We have come to fish for the herring fish   That live in this beautiful sea;   Nets of silver and gold have we!\"                     Said Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod. The old moon laughed and sang a song,   As they rocked in the wooden shoe,And the wind that sped them all night long   Ruffled the waves of dew.The little stars were the herring fish   That lived in that beautiful sea---\"Now cast your nets wherever you wish---   Never afeard are we\";   So cried the stars to the fishermen three:                     Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod. All night long their nets they threw   To the stars in the twinkling foam---Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,   Bringing the fishermen home;'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed   As if it could not be,And some folks thought 't was a dream they 'd dreamed   Of sailing that beautiful sea---   But I shall name you the fishermen three:                     Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod. Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,   And Nod is a little head,And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies   Is a wee one's trundle-bed.So shut your eyes while mother sings   Of wonderful sights that be,And you shall see the beautiful things   As you rock in the misty sea,   Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:                     Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod."},
{"title": "Cornbread anyone?", "date": "Thursday, February 12, 2009", "text": "(Scroll on down for Sepia Scenes.)Here a couple or three weeks ago, I ran out of cornmeal...I was at the local super Walmarts and all I could find was the boxed kinds of cornmeal with sugar already added.  I don't know if all southern gals are like me and my childhood friends, but the kind with sugar just does not fill the bill.  I was sort of getting desperate, thinking I was going to have to have my sister-in-law/best friend mail me some.  However, when I went to our local IGA, they still carried the above in 5lb bags.  I was tempted to buy two or three and put the extras in the freezer....but not real sure if that would be the thing to do.All I could think though, was how times have changed.  When I was a kid, I think all the women in and around our community bought cornmeal and flour by the 25 lb. sacks.  I think all  of our moms made biscuits every morning of our life, except maybe my mom missed a couple days a year if she was sick.  My mom always loved White Lily flower...and I remember her being upset when the stores quit carrying that brand.  And my friend's mom always loved Three Rivers brand cornmeal...I don't recall what brand of cornmeal my mom preferred.And when I still had three brothers at home, mom always made two pans of cornbread every day of the week.  And a bigger pan than the one pictured above.  Probably ten inch pans...and it was eaten for the most part.  If there was any left, it went to the dogs or the pigs.  But my brothers and my mom always loved to crumble cornbread in a glass and pour milk over it and eat it that way...that was one thing I didn't care for.  And I don't even know if I tried it, I think it was partly that it wasn't visually appealing for me.When I first came to Indiana I finally got till I could eat the sweet kind but it was never satisfying.  Then my husband and I moved to Tennessee for a year and a half back when we were young, in 1978.  Since then, I seriously doubt if I have eaten even one piece of the sweetened cornbread.  I just don't like it.  And for sure not with the foods I want cornbread with.Now it took my husband a while to actually like my kind of cornbread, but he does like it.  And both my girls like both kinds, and my youngest requested a cast iron pan for Christmas and has actually  made some cornbread of her own.  She is like me and likes it just for a snack every now and then. I have two favorite meals that require cornbread....I love wilted lettuce and onions and cornbread....my mouth just waters thinking about that.And  the other is something that no one else here eats, and that is spinach (or mustard or poke salad) and bacon and cornbread.  I don't fix it very often, but every now and then I will have that for breakfast if it is just me that will be eating.  Or supper or a midnight snack.  No matter when I have it, it is delicious and I eat way too much of it."},

(Pronounced with the long i sound on the end.)We ran in to the hospital today to see the baby...it rained the whole way there and almost the whole way home.  We took a little detour on the way home and the barn above is a drive-by shot.  If you enlarge it you can see the puddles in the road.  Water was everywhere...most creeks we crossed were almost to the flood stage, and any low places anywhere had water standing in them.  The wind has been blowing so hard it almost sounds like a train...and yes, I did go look for a tornado.Tomorrow the rain should be stopped.  Let's hope that it is because the baby should get to go home then.The top was taken when she was about an hour old and the one below was taken today.This is our first grandchild, a little girl born February 9--she is a joy to hold.  She has not cried since her birth...you know, she cried when she entered the world but not since.  If she is awake, she is wiggling and makes little noises that are soooo sweet.  And her hands and arms have to be free.  She sleeps with them above her head a big part of the time.I am posting this for anyone that might try to access this blog and that doesn't know I did away with it for a week.... I am really regretting doing away with the original blog.    Not sure when I will get back to regular posting...maybe sooner than I thought.

{"title": "A place for all seasons....", "date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2009", "text": "I was looking back through the archives, looking for something to convert to sepia tones for Sepia Scenes.I noticed these pictures from the strip pit area...every time I see them I wish I was sitting out there drinking in the view.I don't care what time of year I am out there, I am wishing that the land belonged to the Dept. of Natural Resoures for all future generations to enjoy.If I were to turn and look back the other way, there would be a house or two in view. I do understand why people post the land...but I long to walk through the tall grass, and see what is over the next hill.Or to sit by the edge of the strip pit and just see what comes along.  At some of the strip pits there are beaver houses...and at strip pits we used to have access to, we seen beaver quite often.  Now the roads that run past that particular strip pit has gates across the road and everyone is locked out.  I can only see it from a distance.If we were to ever move from Indiana, my heart would miss this area shown here more than any other.This is the first time for me to do a Ruby Tuesday post...it is hosted by Mary at her Work of the Poet blog.  I just couldn't resist joining, even though this has nothing to do with an office.This was a capture from a couple days ago...the best so far for me of a cardinal.When I was a teen-ager...maybe even before that, we would take an empty plastic milk container--the gallon size--and cut out holes in the sides about twice the size of a playing card, but leaving 'corner posts.'  We left the bottom about two inches deep.  We would use a rag strip or piece of baling twine, or whatever was handy to tie the milk just to some of mom's lattice at the end of the front porch and then would fill the bottom with a mixture of cornbread crumbled up and maybe some corn.  I really can't remember using anything else.  But the birds would just flock to it.I can't remember what we used--I think it was a piece of tin on a board and nail it to the top of a fence post out in  the back yard.  We would put the same stuff on it as in the milk jug...I can remember counting as high as 9 male cardinals at the same time.  Carletta had a post the other day that reminded me of that.  Here I am lucky to see the male and female at the same time...I think in all the years I have lived here, I have seen a couple male cardinals at the same time a very few times.I think they like more cover than is available here...if it is not that I don't know what the reason is."},
{"title": "Kilns for sure", "date": "Sunday, February 1, 2009", "text": "When Barb,  Abraham and EG mentioned kilns, I thought I might as well show what I know to be real kilns.We were out for a drive and came up on these guys...this place is right beside the road in a small town about 15 or 20 miles north of here.  The owners give tours, and I had planned for us to go back and get an actual tour and maybe even take notes or something till I could have lots to tell.However that was September 1 of last year and we have yet to make it back up there on a weekday.  I was so impressed with it that I was all eyes, trying to take pictures, and just so in awe of it all.I did come away with a couple of facts that I remember for sure.  This is a family owned business that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year.  It was very hot the day we were there and the heat coming from this place was intense.  I worried about getting too close and the heat damaging my camera.Though these pictures do not show it, there were heat waves surrounding the place.  I cannot imagine doing this for 8 hours a day!  The two guys did take turns digging out the clankers.Anyway, the clay to make the bricks is right there on the property not far from the kilns.  I am not sure of the word...do they call it digging clay, or is it mined...I don't know.I still hope to go back someday and have a slower, more informed tour."},

{"title": "Camera Critters featuring the short-eared owl", "date": "Saturday, January 31, 2009", "text": "I showed the short-eared owl once before here.  Those were taken really late in the day--just a little while before dark.However, when we were out there Wednesday what should we spot but more owls.  This time it was not even close to dark.  I just checked the time they were taken and these and a few more were taken right at 2:30.  We only saw 4 or 5 that day.  How many do you see in the photo above?  I have to tell you, I had taken two or three pictures, and we were just sitting watching. As I sat there, I thought is that another owl?  I looked through the lens and sure enough, there was a second owl!  At least I spotted it before I got home...there have been several times when I didn't see things until I got home and downloaded the pictures and started looking at them.Another difference, they did not seem to be the least intimidated by us.  The one above sat there and sat there...it did finally leave of its own accord.  But the ones in the top photo--I waved and waved my arms.  I wanted to try to get a picture of them in flight.  They finally flew, but after I had done give up...I got a couple pics of them in flight but they are all blurry.So, this was my entry for Camera Critters...if you want to join, click on the badge at the top of this post.

{"title": "The strip pit area...again", "date": "Friday, January 30, 2009", "text": "I cannot resist going to the strip pit area if I get the chance...no matter what time of day.  I would even like to go out there on a moonlit night.  I took the one above some time back...just to show you one of the strip pits...the one above is looking south and the ones below are looking north.  I thought I had better pictures but I cannot locate them now.This is the same strip pit area(north view) taken Wednesday, after the major snowfall.  A big proportion of it is frozen over as you can see.  But see the dark areas--they are not frozen.  And they are so crammed full of geese and a few swans that I don't think another could fit in.These are not good pictures...I am not sure if it is operator errors or the cheap lens I have.  But being that I sometimes get good photos with it I tend to think it is me.  It is very hard to focus sometimes...hard to fine tune it say when I am trying to focus on eyes.Still, the ones above give an idea of how tightly packed the water was with birds.And I just have to show you a couple that I really like.  I thought about saving the above shot for sepia scenes...it has not been altered at all.  Do you think it would have fit the theme?And here is one looking down the road...isn't it beautiful?Today has been a busy day for us!  Our older daughter moved out to her own apartment.  We moved most of her small stuff and clothes last night after she got off work.  Then I went with her grocery shopping--I won't tell you how much she spent.  Lets just say it was a lot...but she was buying spices, and just stocking up on the necessities.Being that Friday and Saturday is her days off, she wanted to get all the moving done today...so a friend of ours took the day off to help move the furniture.  He is just one of the best...my husband has a knack for picking some really good friends.  They start out as his friends, but always end up feeling like family.And I guess I should mention what good neighbors we have also...we had shoveled the sidewalks that are used...the ones out back and the ones in front for the mailman.  But yesterday evening here came one of the guys across the street on his 4-wheeler cleaning off the sidewalk here at the side...there was just a small portion of it that we hadn't done.  Then he tells Roger that if Roger doesn't care, he will clean out Rachel's parking space better!I really and truly think all news shows should have to feature at least one uplifting story like this every time they air.....about the good that people do.  Does anyone else remember Charles Kuralt  and his show On the Road?  That was one of my favorite shows.  And if they aired them today, I would be glued to the TV to watch them again."},

{"title": "More scenes from my chair", "date": "Tuesday, January 27, 2009", "text": "Even though we got snow today, I ended up just staying home.  And to be honest, I didn't do much here except fix our meals and do dishes.  I did try to capture some of the birds though.  The geese above were taken yesterday and today...and this is just a small portion of what I noticed.  Every time I glanced out, or was outside I seen/heard geese.How do you like my thing to hang the bird feeders on?  I wanted one a little bit taller than normal so Roger took rebar and a long length of pipe and designed this for me.  I am 5'3\" tall and I will need a step stool to get the feeders down to fill them.  At least one of the cats cannot jump up and nab a bird.The cardinals were here today--in all the snow.Doesn't he look cold?We got done with the baby's room just in time...I have yet to take any pictures.  It will probably not be what you expect, thought it is really pretty.  But I don't think my camera can capture the true color of it.This coming weekend my other daughter moves to her own apartment...and guess what?  We have snow--a winter storm warning is in effect.  And it is worse the farther south you go.  Last night when the news was on, Terre Haute had 2 inches of snow and up here about 20 minutes north, we only had a skim.Tonight, when Rachel was heading home, she called to tell me she was leaving the gym.  She thought they had maybe 3-4 inches of snow, and at the most we have 2 inches.  But more is coming tonight and tomorrow.  And I think there is a chance of snow Thursday and Friday, also."},
{"title": "As I sit here", "date": "Monday, January 26, 2009", "text": "As I sit here and contemplate about what to write, I have been watching numerous V's of geese fly over.  Not huge V's but still, it seems like this is becoming more and more of a pathway for them.  I do not know where they go, unless it is to the river.  Maybe tomorrow we can take a drive and figure it out.I am also watching the birds at my feeders that my older daughter got me for Christmas.  I have had so much pleasure from them.  There are cardinals, juncos, nuthatches, different sparrows, titmice, and I am probably leaving out something but they are not all out there right at this moment. Right now it is the female cardinal and a couple juncos.We have a town hawk...not sure what kind it actually is so I just call it a town hawk.  How's that for a scientific name?  It was sitting in a tree across the street.  I got on my old fake carhartt jacket and with camera in hand went out to try to get a photo of it, but it had taken flight before I got out there.  He has been in this area for several years now.  Over by the railroad is some open fields, and when I used to take our dog over there for a walk, I would see it hunting over there.  That is only a block away, but I have seen it flying over the yards in the neighborhood also.So much has changed...and some of it for the better.  Just in my lifetime, in our area I have seen an increase in geese, and I had not seen a wild turkey till some years ago.  I even think there are more deer and more hawks than when we were first married.  And I had not noticed a Northern Harrier hawk till just 2 or 3 years ago.  There is a difference in them that you notice.  For one thing, they have a longer tail and a white patch on their rump, and just their general flight pattern is different than the other hawks.  Whatever the reason, I really enjoy seeing all the animals."},
{"title": "The signal", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "text": "If you are here for Camera Critters, that post is below this one, though this one fits also.At my house, it is a signal to Mama Squirrel when I open my dining room curtains.So many times, I open them and in just a few minutes here she comes.  And she gets on the fence post and stares until she gets a reaction from me.Sometimes, she meets me on the back porch, and others if I am not out there instantly she hikes back across the street to the trees.  I don't know if she spots one of the cats in the window or what.  But this morn was one of those times she ran back across the street;  I was slow cause I was actually putting on my coat and getting the camera.  But it was for the best cause I got some shots of her in action, running to see what I had.She was just a bit shy of the camera, maybe cause it is all black.  My other rebel has a lot of silver on it and she did not seem to mind it.  Or maybe it is just the weather...who knows.I just thought it would be fun to feature her again...I cannot think how many years she has been coming here...I think it is finishing up 3 years but it could be 4.She is such a sweetie...as you can see she don't mind touching me...but still won't let me pet her.   Though sometimes when she is standing in my hand like this, I will use one of my fingers to scratch her under her chin, or whatever it reaches.  There are times when I think she would almost jump on to my arm to get to the food.As an added note, as you can see we are getting another skim of snow this morning.  Up to an inch is predicted."},

{"title": "A couple more from Bridgeton", "date": "Friday, January 23, 2009", "text": "At the beginning of this week I posted a single picture of the covered bridge and mill at Bridgeton, Indiana.  I had meant to post it and these two at the same time.  I usually don't like Christmas decorations after Christmas is over, but there was just something about this big wreath on the side of the bridge that I couldn't resist.  I had thought I would post it for the Ruby Tuesday, but they were doing macro, so first thought I would save it till next Tuesday.  Instead, since I am again so tired I can't think, I am posting it because I had it ready.And I thought I should post the old mill while I was at it...I like snow pictures.  And I think this is one of the better ones I have of the mill...I think I would almost like to have this one in jigsaw puzzle form.We have been working on the grandbaby-to-be's room.  Roger and Jeremy put a new window in there...and we had to do the trim inside.  And Roger about had to custom design it.  It turned out real good...it would be so much simpler if Roger's table saw was easily moved.  But it is a very heavy duty one and it is all he and I can do to move it a few inches at a time...and that by scooting it across the floor, not lifting it.And he has been making the other trim...it isn't really that hard of work, but time consuming.  And it would be so much easier if we could have taken his table saw.  We have had to put the dado head on the saw and use it to custom fit things.  I say we when I should be saying Roger....I just watch.  Anyway, would be so much easier if we could take it with us, cause for two or three nights in a row, we have had to bring something back home with us for him to use the dado on.And then there is the painting...the trim is to be painted so we have been doing that as we go.  Again not hard...but paint and let it dry, then give a second coat.Hopefully, by this time tomorrow, it will be done.  Except for the new carpet which will be done Monday."},
{"title": "Unclassified", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2009", "text": "Have you ever seen anything like this?  I guess I should explain.  This is a tree across the street.  After I met and made friends with Mama Squirrel, she had three sets of babies here beside my house--2 sets per season.  The 4th set she had across the street in this tree.  I could have stood on a step stool and I would have been able to reach inside to touch the babies.  But I would not let myself...Then last spring/summer we watched to see if she would use the tree above again, hoping she would since we had had the one she used over here cut down.  We did not see her around it...then I forget who noticed, but the honeybees used it.  By the end of the fall, I felt like it was full to the brim with honey.  I always meant to go take a picture of the bees and just did not get around to it...for one thing I was not about to use flash so I am not sure if they would have shown up.Now to this, I broke off a piece of it and brought it inside and put it on a plate...it melted and was mostly water I think.  But it was sticky so it has to be part honey...I don't know if rain has blown in the hole, and thus making the tree so full it expanded or what.

Not that there is anything wrong with barns...at least for me they are always great.  But I realize some do not share my love of them so wanted to actually do a sepia scene post without one.I kept trying to think what I had that would do and it finally dawned on me to use a picture or two from the Newport Hill Climb that takes place the first weekend in October every year.  I have posted regular color photo of the bottom truck here.  And I used it for Paintbox Pictures here.  You have to scroll down for the version there though.If you want to join, or just see more Sepia Scenes, click on the badge at the top of this post.As an afterthought, I got to thinking about texture so went and played with these two photos adding texture...just thought I would show you how it altered them."},
{"title": "Alphabet Meme", "date": "Monday, January 19, 2009", "text": "Over at Joyful Reflections, Betsy did the alphabet meme...I thought it sounded like fun so she assigned me the letter:  N.  I am now supposed to list 10 things that I love that begin with the letter 'n.'  If you want to join the meme, tell me so in a comment and I will assign you a letter.For the first thing I am going to list that I love, it is1.  My brother, Neal.  (Betsy gave me the letter N because of Neal--she knows we are brother and sister, and I sort of met her through his blog.)  I thought it fitting that he be the first thing I listed.2.  Nieces and Nephews....several of my nieces and nephews are close to my age and feel almost more like brothers and sisters, but in reality they are all my nieces and nephews and I love them.3.  Newborns.  I have always loved newborn calves or kittens.  And I totally enjoyed my newborn babies...you know how you sort of dread hearing them cry to be fed in the middle of the night, but once you are up with them, you could sit and hold them forever and just look into their tiny faces and marvel at their tiny hands.  (And if they don't cry, you jump awake to check on them)...but anyway, soon, we should have our own newborn grandbaby to hold.  The due date was February 26th, but last week the doctor told her she could go any time and he really doesn't expect her to last till the due date.4.  Newly fallen snow--like in the picture above.  I love to get out and tramp around in new snow...where my tracks are some of the first tracks to be seen.   I loved eating snow where it is heavy laden on pine tree branches or off the top of fence posts.  When I was a kid, I could never be out in a new fallen snow without eating my share of it.  Now I am almost afraid to do that with all the pollution, but sometimes I still can't resist.5.  Nature.  As you know from my post the other day, I sure do enjoy nature.  Again, I used to be out in all kinds of weather seeing what I could see.  And I would like to get back to more of that.6.  New.   That doesn't sound like anything, yet it is.  I love find a new author that I haven't read, one that I can't wait to read everything they have written.  And I love hearing new songs that I want to listen to over and over.  And I love picking out new pens and paper....I knew one of my nieces loves pens and paper as I do, but just a while back Neal told me he loved pens.  They don't actually have to be new, just new to me.  It really is hard for me to pass by those aisles in the store and not want to buy something.  And I love my new camera my husband got me for Christmas.7.  Neil Young...I really love a lot of his songs.  Some of his music I don't care for at all, but some of his songs are some of my lifetime favorites.8.  Neighbors.  We have been blessed with having good neighbors most of our life and I am thankful for that.9.  Needles.  Yeah, I am grasping at straws but truthfully, they are one of the first things I thought of.  I haven't been doing much sewing the past year or so, but that is so not normal for me.  I almost always have something I am sewing on.  And I do enjoy hand work a big part of the time.  Some people hate that last bit of sewing on the binding on a quilt but I really enjoy that last part where you are stitching it down by hand.10.  North Carolina Wrens...they are one of my most favorite things.  I cannot hear one without smiling.  I know in a way they fit in with nature, yet they are special to me.  We always had wrens at home.  They almost always had a nest on the front porch or back porch.  One time they nested in my mom's wandering jew...I don't know how it survived cause we didn't really water it.  Our dad had muscular dystrophy and was disabled.  He sat on our front porch a lot and the wrens finally got till they would perch on his foot.  Just for a few minutes, but that is still special.  Or if one of us was sitting in the swing, they didn't mind perching on the chain right above our head.  Either the last year I worked or the next to last year, the wrens built a next right above the washer.  Thankfully, they were leaving the next about the time we started picking.  I actually got to hold one or two in my hand--they were flying around where we worked so we caught them and took them out back where they would be a little bit safer.I did have a hard time coming up with ten things that begin with 'n'--I bet once I post this a dozen more will pop into my head.  I am glad this isn't a contest.  If you want to try your hand at the Alphabet Meme, don't forget to say so in a comment."},

I know they are sort of drab, but that is how the day was!In previous posts I have talked about how the wind blows here...and I know it probably blows as hard and harder other places.  I tried to capture scenes that show the snow moving...forming its own little mini whirlwind as above,or just the sideways blow...the kind that you don't know if it is actually snowing or just blowing the snow around that is already there....and this one going down the road showing how hard the wind can blow.These cows were cold.  They were all laying there huddled together till we stopped and I got out of the car.  They jumped up, on the alert.  I am not sure if they were afraid or if they thought I might be bringing them something good to eat.These starlings along with some doves were eating at one of the feeders.  Someone had thrown grain on the roof of the feeder.  I assumed on purpose."},
{"title": "Time....", "date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "text": "It is time to pay the piper...only that sounds almost negative and I don't feel that way at all.  I have been tagged at different times for different things and have yet to respond.  As my husband is watching Battlestar Galactica and I am not a big fan of it, I decided now was a good time to work on this.Back in December, Mary at Faith, Fabric, and Photos tagged me to do this meme:List the Five Greatest Joys I find in nature.  I have thought and thought at different times, and then proceeded to forget how I have wanted to word this.  I feel like I am just saying in different words part of what Mary had to say, and that is one of the reasons I have been so slow to respond to this one.  But here goes...1.  I think anyone who knows me hardly at all knows that I love the changing skies....with all the varieties of clouds and the sunsets and sunrises.  I never tire of trying to capture all the different views.  I would say that I probably have as many pictures of the sky (sunsets, sunrises, clouds, rainbows) as I do anything else.  Except maybe barns.  And I would actually have to count to see.2.  I love the colors of nature.  I love the brilliant colors of the flowers and the foliage in the fall, the butterflies and the birds, again the brilliant colors that come and go in the sky, oh, just all of it.3.  I love the wings of nature...especially the butterflies and the birds.  I always think God must have had a lot of fun making the winged creatures...I think He outdid himself when he made the birds and the butterflies.4.  I LOVE the sounds of nature.  Be it a thunderstorm in the spring, or even the howling wind in the winter, or the sound of a babbling stream--I enjoy them all.  I have always loved storms, actually been afraid in only one that I remember.  Other than that, I have always loved them.  I always loved picking apples in the rain--there was just a kind of hush--a peacefulness that is hard to describe. And the other place I love to be when it rains, is in the barn!  I guess it is the sound of the rain on the tin roof that I love...gee, how I love that sound! And I to hear a wren sing or the sound of a hawk calling or the geese honking from high above--they give me such joy.  I always pause what I am doing just to listen and maybe try to spot them.  There are just too many sounds to name them all...so I just named a few of my favorite ones.5.  And for the 5th favorite thing, I love the seasons!  I get tired of cold weather and I get tired of real hot weather, but I would not want to be where there was no variety.  I like having a change to look forward to, and even though I think fall might have the edge in being my favorite, I am never real positive of that. I seem to have something that I love about each season...love the way things wake up in the spring and begin to bloom, love the lazy days of summer when I can sit in the swing on my porch or go wading and fishing in the creeks, love the colors of fall and just the general feel of it...and I love winter in that it so makes me appreciate having a warm bed to sleep in.  But I also love it when snow comes and makes the world look new in a different way.I am not tagging anyone at this time to do this...Then Tricia over at Bluff Area Daily blog gave me this Butterfly Award...I want to publicly thank her. I really enjoy the awards--they give me joy to think someone thinks enough of me or my blog to give me one.  I am trying to think of who I want to receive it....and I just can't decide.  Some that I would like to give it to do not like to mess with awards....and others I have hit recently with another award so I don't want to make a pest of myself.  Just know that if I have taken time to post multiple comments on your blog, that I really, really enjoy it.And my brother Neal tagged me to go the fifth folder and pick the fifth photo and post and describe the picture.  If he only knew how hard that was...fifth from what point.  Since I had to reformat the old computer...that got things slightly out of order...then I had to move them all to this new one...and they are even more out of order.  I tried going to the fifth folder both from the beginning forwards and forwards going back and with digital pictures, and neither of these folders had a fifth picture.  So I went to the fifth folder, which contains some scans of photos, and some photos that have been re-sized.The fifth one in this is this barn--it is the same barn that is my header photo just a different season.  In this instance it is a cropped version that I had as my header photo at another time.  I have several photos of this barn...it is a neighboring barn to our old home place.  It is a place I remember from childhood on.  We raised the tobacco that went with the place so I have worked in that barn.  I also remember mom going up there to get dirt to go in the ground of some of her flowers...it was old, old manure.  I think she said from sheep....I wonder if either of my brothers ever remember sheep being raised up there.  I am just sure that is what she said, but I don't ever remember anyone else mentioning that sheep had ever been a part of that place.  At one time it belonged to our Grandpa."},

{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "text": "First off, I have to tell one more thing about the baby shower...after we were done with the shower, Sarah wanted Jeremy to come out front with her.  Then they called his mom and me to stand up there with them.  Since the baby will be the first grandchild for his mom and me both, they had gotten us a necklace with the birthstone of the baby!  This does not do it justice...I tried to take one last night, and then this one is from today...and neither turned out very good, but you can see what it looks like.  It did catch us both off guard.Now for today.  We were supposed to wake up to nasty, icy roads and maybe get an inch or so of snow.  Did not happen.  I am fine with the no icy roads, but sure would have liked a little accumulation of snow.  We have had snow flurries off and on this entire day.We took a drive over into Illinois...I was hoping by going west that we might get into some real snow, but all we did was go in and out of snow flurries.We would go for a few miles of it snowing so hard that you couldn't see much of anything in the distance, then they would give way to almost sunny skies.  It was just a strange sort of day.I thought today I would post these showing how hard it was snowing.  And later on I will post some with no snow.I have always liked reading journals and diaries, fiction and non-fiction books about the pioneers that came before us.  And for some reason, when I get over into Illinois, I always think about them more.  I think how excited they must have been to find all that rich, fertile, flat land.  And then on days such as today, when the wind cuts right through you, I think what hardships they must have endured and I really wondered how they survived.  I really wonder if I would have had what it took to build something from nothing.It gets cold and the wind howls here in Indiana, but over there the land is even flatter, so it hits even harder.  I told Roger that soon as you get into Illinois, the farms are much more spread out.  I really want to get my tripod back in the Rav and take some photos and stitch them together for a panoramic view of some of the land over there.  I don't know if I can do it justice or not...but I do want to try.We have been home a couple of hours, and I am still not warm through...so imagine what it would be like trying to keep a fire going and trying to stay warm in the primitive conditions of even a hundred years ago!  I was just in and out of the car to take pictures...never out for more than 10 minutes at any one time.It makes me so thankful to come home to a home that has water and warmth--just by turning a dial or handle."},
{"title": "Did you think I was gone for good?", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "text": "I am sorry for not posting or visiting the past two or three days...I plan to try to get around tonight.  Just thought while I had a minute I would update you on all that is here.My daughter's baby shower was Saturday afternoon...talk about getting a lot of stuff!  I cannot begin to name it all.  It took their car and our car to get it all home.  They were packed full.  I did not take pictures, simply because I got gone without my camera...I didn't have it on the list and was done down the road a few miles before I thought.  Besides that I don't think I would have had time.  However, two or three others took pictures and I should get some of them.  I just don't know how long it will take.Neal, his wife and daughter came early and helped Rachel, Sarah, Christen and I set up.  Yes, Sarah helped set up her own shower.  But it was worth it just to hear the guys and Allison get this one game ready....you know, the one where you melt candy bars in the microwave and put them in pampers and they look like you know what.  They are passed around and guests have to guess what kind of candy bar it had been.We could not hear all that was said while they did it, but we could sure hear the bursts of laughter.  And we would look at each other and laugh...we decided they were having way too much fun with that game.I had been so stressed about the party--I don't know why I get that way.  I worried about having enough food...that was the main thing.  We probably had about 8-10 people at the most actually tell us they were coming.  But I understand that--when it is that time of year, I don't like to make definite plans.  So I wasn't upset that people did not call...just didn't really know how much food was needed.  I ended up having more than enough, which is a lot better than not enough.One of my other nieces from over at Indianapolis came, and she came home with us and spent the night and yesterday.  That is one of the reasons I have not been on-line.  Then last night after she left, we had a major power outage.   The power went out about 6:00-6:30 and didn't come back on till after 10:00 last night...by then I was too tired to think about getting on here.We have been gone this entire day...to Sarah's to get some measurements, to Gander Mountain for Roger to spend a gift card they got him, by this one park in Terre Haute that I had been wanting to check out, by Harbor Freight, and to get a bite to eat.  So I am totally worn out again.Bubbie is doing just wonderful!  I really cannot believe how well he is doing.  He takes it easy, but does do some stuff.  He does get in the middle of the floor now and sleep in his normal way part of the time, all stretched and twisted on his back.  Arms and legs extended out each way--you just cannot imagine how good it is to see.  Our house feels complete again.Us three humans are all doing better, though not totally over the sinus thing yet.  But feeling better every day.I am going to cut this short, and hope to visit all of you sometime later tonight!"},
{"title": "Look who's home!", "date": "Friday, January 9, 2009", "text": "Scroll down if you happend to come for the Sky Watch post.Rachel stopped and seen Bubbie yesterday--she said he purred so loud you could hear him all over the room.  Louder than he has ever purred before...which doesn't take much.  Usually the only way we know he is purring is to feel his chest.Anyway, she wanted us to get him today, and being that I had most of the running done for the shower, and feeling some better, I thought we would.  It feels so right to know he is here.  The first thing, he went down in the basement...and stayed.  He never goes down there to stay unless one of us is down there.I first brought him up, and he went right back down.  So we let him stay most of the afternoon, then went and got him and shut the door for a while and made him stay up here with us.  Soon as we opened the door, back down he went.  Somewhere during this time, Rachel got home--she went and got him....and I think he has been upstairs ever since.  Unless he has gone back down in the past few minutes.  He hasn't been wanting on the furniture, and has been laying in around and stretching out on his back as in some of his earlier pictures.He does carry his back leg a little bit abnormally--and you can tell it is stiff.  But he does get around.   And he ate and he drank and he has ate some more.  Even dug in the food which is one of the things he does.  I am so happy that he is home."},

Not any measurable snow!  I guess I should be happy with Sarah's shower being this weekend.This is a boring post, but wanted to post something.  I took a tylenol pm last night till I could sleep.  I cannot remember how many times I had to get up or what for...but I know I was up at least 3 times but I went back to bed every time and right to sleep.I am not worse than yesterday, but not well either.  I didn't sneeze the whole day through though, so that is an improvement.  My daughter's sinus thing is coming back on her, and Roger feels bad.  When it rains, it pours at our house!  Maybe by next week at this time, it will all seem like a bad dream.I did go and pick up some of the stuff we need for the shower, but will have to make another shopping trip for it.  I half plan on doing that in the morning.  Then Friday I can do a lot of the preparations.  I am sure then I will find things I haven't bought and will probably have to make a couple runs to the store.  Even though I have tried to make a list, I know me well enough to know that there will be something I forget.I did try a little something else in sepia, but I couldn't totally forget barns!Since blogger does not want to upload pictures for me, I am just going to tell you to go the Sepia Scenes blog to join or to find links to more places to visit."},

I don't feel quite normal, but I don't feel horrible either.  Roger, on the other hand, had his sinus problem start either Christmas day or the day after, and he cannot seem to shake it.  He even went to the doctor about 5 days into it.  Has been through the antibiotics, and it just won't go away.  I really think he needs to think about going back.I did put on a big pot of chili--with lots of onions.  I always feel like just smelling something cook that has onions helps me.  I have no clue if it really does, or if it is all in my head, but it does smell good in here.  At least what I can smell..."},
{"title": "Update...", "date": "Monday, January 5, 2009", "text": "Last night Bubbie got to shivering so bad, and we could hear his breathing so called and met the vet at the office.  They kept him, but I was out there today and our regular vet said he is doing fine and that all looks good.  Said his lungs are clear and no temperature.  I swear I feel like an idiot but I don't remember exactly what he said about the shivering...I think kind of a reaction from the surgery, but I am not sure.  Anyway, he had rather I call and it be nothing than to ignor things.  I am letting them board him a few days till the baby shower is over with.  I just could not do anything with him here...had to keep my eyes right on him.Normally, he sleeps on the floor most of the time, other than he gets up beside Roger and then sometimes takes over that chair.  But the biggest part of the time, he sleeps in front of the tv.  The first two days he was home, he was in the chair or on the couch almost constantly, and I had to watch him like a hawk to keep him from jumping down.They took the bandage off and it stays off...everything looks really good.  We can go visit him.  So will do that daily, I suppose.  I have had such a scared feeling about this, but the vet seems confident that things are going to be okay.  So I will try to keep my courage up.I have not been out to take any pictures in ages, so am resorting to a couple from the summer of barns. These are different barns, but they sure remind me of each other.  They are not in the best of focus...I used the sharpen tool on both I believe.  These were taken as my husband drove us down the road."},
{"title": "Mixed bag...", "date": "Sunday, January 4, 2009", "text": "This is basically a mix of this and that....first off, I am sure some are wondering about Bubbie. He is getting around better every day. He is learning to deal with that bulky bandage...still eating and cleaning himself. He pulled out all visible stitches Friday, but the wound did not gap open, he did not bleed any so we were not concerned about that. He is even about to master going to the potty by himself...still needs a little assistance in propping himself up but not much. He does worry me that he does not drink any at all...I have started using an eye-dropper and giving him some with it. And he still shivers. He is scheduled for a check-up tomorrow as is Cougar.Cougar is doing fine...his abscess was and is not slowing him down any at all. It was just a knot under the skin right beside his spine. When I was putting him in the cat carrier to take out there, it had already gone down so much. I actually feel it is useless to take him back, but will go ahead with it.Now, for a total change of pace, I had meant to include this little tidbit of information on my New Year's post and forgot about it till later. I think I got my digital camera in November of 2004...at the end of December of 2007 I had only taken 2519 images with it....at the end of this year, it has taken a total of 7,049, (that means I have taken 4,530 photos with it just this year), plus I have taken 196 images with my new camera, and I think it was around 80 images I have taken with the little point and shoot. That is getting up close to 5,000 shots in one year. Thank God for digital..I would never have taken near that many with actual film. I could hardly believe it when I seen the numbers.These pictures were taken January 8, 2005...they have not been converted to black and white but I think they look it.  The last image is just a cropped portion of the one above it.  I like the way the snow is stacked on the little 'balls' of the sycamore tree."},

When growing up in Tennessee, it was an event if I seen geese flying high overhead...let alone up close and personal.   The ones above are some of the locals that stay down at the river down town.  Where I see them in great numbers is out at the strip pits.Almost always we take this one road away from the strip pits that leads past this pasture.  If I stop to take a picture of something, these horses always stop and look.  Sometimes they are clear across the field but still look to see...I think they must be treated very well by someone cause you can tell they expect something good to happen.I don't know why the picture below turned out the way it did...I am thinking it might have to do with there being so much actual black in the picture.

{"title": "As another year ends...", "date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2008", "text": "I want to wish everyone a happy and prosperous year to come.  I guess most of all, I hope you have good health.  As we get older, we begin to realize just what a blessing it is to be able to get up and function normally every day.  I complain and whine a lot of times, but I have no serious health issues.  I should be counting my blessings.....One blessing is this--Bubbie got to come home today--that is a good thing.  I think.  Not sure how this bandage is going to work out.  He really cannot maneuver well without help.  He is also shivering sometimes which concerns me.  But then a lot of his fur is gone, and it IS winter.  Earlier when he did that I laid down with him in the living room floor and snuggled up around him and he was happy with that.  We put a heating pad in a box but I think he is also just tired of being confined by his limitations.  I am hoping and praying that this takes and he feels better soon.Believe it or not, he has done been trying to sleep in his usual way as pictured here.  He cannot do it too well, but he does try.  I think it is a good sign that he tries.  And he has ate and also cleaned himself.  So those things alone are a real positive sign in my book.On to other things; one of my daughters got me the books on hawks above.  The one by the National Audubon Society has owls in it as well.  I am done wishing I had another set of these books just to keep in the Rav4.  They are so nice to have.And my husband got me the Rebel XTi....I have the original digital Rebel DSLR....and I had the lens pictured here.    Well, I don't like changing lens...the sensor on my original rebel done has dust on it that I can not get off without going and getting some kind of kit.  And I may do that now.     So there were times when I wouldn't change the lens just because I didn't want to risk getting any more dust on the sensor. But there are times I want the wider angle it has, plus just being afraid that the lens above would interfere with the flash.So my husband got me the second body till I can have either one whenever I want it.  Plus, on my original, the time it took to actually turn on seemed like forever, specially when you are all set to take a wildlife photo.  On the Xti, it is instantaneous, or almost so.  So close you can't really tell.That is a little of what is going on here.  My husband has had a sinus infection, and I had him to the doctor yesterday.  I took Cougar in to the vet today as I picked up Bubbie because he had an abscess on his back.  I have not got to visit anyone today but will make up for it either later tonight or else over the next day or two.I will leave you with a forerunner of the sunset pictures to come in the future.  I hope you are not disappointed in this one or the ones to come."},
{"title": "\"ee\"", "date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2008", "text": "Please click and enlarge for better viewing.I really am having trouble deciding what I want to post.  I could post for a couple weeks just from the other evening/night at the strip pits.  I was thinking how Jeopardy will have clues and the answers will will contain certain letters, so thought the 'ee' would tie these two subjects together.I cannot begin to count the number of deer that I seen...the first picture was taken just a few minutes after I got there.  The second one was quite a bit later, right around the time I found the owls,and these last two were so dark that I have messed and messed with them to try to get them light enough for you to see the deer.  It was dark enough till if I had been out on a road that was traveled any at all, I would have needed my headlights.   These are different deer, and definitely not all that I seen of this herd.I think saying there was 15 or 20 deer is almost a conservative guess.  I couldn't help but wonder if those in the first photo had came back and were a part of this herd...it was close to where I seen them.Right after I got there I started taking pictures of geese;  the sky was alive with flocks of them.  The sky was beginning to show signs that it was going to be beautiful.  I took several pictures then, but they seemed washed out compared to what I actually saw.I don't know how it happened, but I took most pictures in the RAW size, and they seem much more accurate in color.  I was really aggravated at first, but if images like these are the result, I might just start using it all the time.  I took 165 images that night, 29 were in the jpg format and the rest were RAW."},

{"title": "Another strip pit discovery!", "date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "text": "I have been noticing every evening that the sunsets are just beautiful, but I have not had the chance to try to capture them.  As I mentioned before, I have also been trying to get a good shot of the Northern Harrier.I thought I would kill two birds with one stone this evening...I waited and headed out there soon as the football game was over.  Still light enough till I should have plenty of light to capture a hawk, but late enough till I should be out there when the sunset came.I seen hawks, but I could not get close enough to get a good capture.  The first time I was out there and saw them, they did not seem to mind the vehicle and it didn't seem to bother them if I pulled to the side of the road and got out.  Now, they must feel my desperation and will not stick around at all.At first I became totally occupied with watching the geese...just unbelievable numbers.  I took a lot of pictures but nothing close up.  I went on and left there to run on over into Illinois to check out some of the cornfields.  I was hoping they would be close to the road in them, but did not see a  one in the normal place I see them.  So, I turned back around and headed for the strip pit area again.I made a new discovery--owls!  Numbers of them!  I bet I saw at least 8 or 10 of them, but I really think there were more.  I think from the one of the books one of my daughters got me that it is a Short-eared  Owl.  And from the description of its flight and living area, it all points to that being what it is.  Not to mention the yellow eyes.These were take really late in the evening.  I had the ISO set at 1600, and I had trouble and could not seem to get them in focus.  I have probably two dozen shots with these being the best.  I seen more owls this one time than I have seen in my entire 53 years!I leave you with one that was taken really late--I used fill-flash to lighten it and hope I got it light enough for you to see."},
{"title": "How about a goose?", "date": "Saturday, December 27, 2008", "text": "Monday, the day before Bubbie came home hurt, we had went for a short drive.  I don't care much about shopping or going places where there are people, but sometimes I just have to get out to see and observe nature a little bit.So we headed to the strip pits--the one pictured here is so close to the Indiana-Illinois border I am not sure which side it is on.  But I absolutely love to go out there and drive the roads.  This day was no exception.Geese were every where.  And when you enlarge the one above, notice the white geese.  A couple of them have bands on their neck  I didn't know they banded the neck...in the original size you can make out the number of one of them.  I think it is 68C...if I remember correctly.It was soooo cold that day...I do not see how they take the cold.  I know they are made to withstand the cold, but I do wonder if they feel it at all.So we left there and headed on west...just a short distance.  There is a farm that has cows and horses and I always feel from the horses and cows reactions that they are someone's pets like ours were.  The horse especially raise up and look if I stop, just to make sure I am not bringing them a treat.  And one day one of the cows started mooing softly...just so much like home.Anyway, I heard this noise and looked and it was all these geese...you could actually hear their wings and they were a good distance away!  Kind of like when you hear a storm moving in..These are not great pictures, but it does show just a little inkling of what we seen.  I would love to know how many there were.  There were hundreds and hundreds in flight I felt like, and about as many on the water.The strip pit(s) is really long...I don't know if it is two strip pits or if the road is built over it  I am about positive the north half is at least a mile long, and the south half is almost as long.  And at the far ends on each side, the water was almost solid with them.  I do not know how to describe how it makes me feel to see so many...it is always thrilling for one thing.And I don't ever really want to leave, I just know I have to.  I do not know who owns the land, but I would dearly love to have permission to walk the land and walk the edges of the strip pits.  At all times of year.Out there are all these Northern Harrier Hawks...I have yet to get a good picture of them.  I want one so bad of one hovering...I consider them the helicopter of hawks.  They have the ability to hover over one little spot and it is fascinating to watch.  Maybe one of these days I will get one.As for Bubbie, have not heard a word today...Rachel wants me to ask if we can go visit him...and I really would like to.  I just don't know if they will allow it...and it might get his hopes up.  I am wondering though if it took him so long to get back to normal after the other, how is this time going to effect him"},
{"title": "Be careful what you say...", "date": "Friday, December 26, 2008", "text": "Remember the post I did the other day of Bubbie watching television?Remember me talking about him being at the vet and that he was just then really getting back to his normal self?Then remember me saying that I didn't want to leave him out there again unless it was a desperate situation?That desperate situation came the very next day.  It was a warm day, especially if compared to the days that had just passed.  I had been refusing to leave and leave a cat outside for fear we would end up getting detained and it was miserable cold.  I just didn't want them left out in the cold with no way of getting inside.  But Tuesday morn arrived and it was not to bad.  We had to run and pick up a few last minute items at the grocery.  Bubbie wanted out and I thought he would be okay.  We were only going here in town, about a mile away.We came home, got the groceries in and in a few minutes Roger went to let Puss Puss out, only to discover she was staring at the door because Bubbie was on the other side wanting in.  He came in with one of his back legs useless.  So to the vet we went.  Our vet thought he had a broken leg, but no other trauma.  No blood, no temperature.  Nothing.  And we could not see any other mark on him.So he wanted to keep him and x-ray him later and would call us.  Well, we (Roger, Rachel and I) talked that night, and basically decided not to invest too much money in him.  When the vet called, it was with the news that it was a bad break.  But he could fix it with a pin...the price of this operation he figured would be about $775.  Roger looked at me and Rachel, and I shrugged my shoulders.  If it had been $500 even I would have said do it.  Oh, and there was other things I would have said do it.So Roger told him we didn't want to do it for that kind of money...to put him down and not let him suffer.  Well, doc says he wants to watch him over night and see how he does.  With him being a young cat and cats being so resilient.  He said he would call us before he did anything.  I cannot tell you the thoughts that went through my head.  If I was working, I would not have hesitated.  Just a bunch of ifs...I couldn't be at peace with that decision though...I kept thinking how if it was this or that pet that I have had that I would give anything I own to be able to have them again.  And I thought I would regret the decision we had made.  So we tried to call him the next day--the day before Christmas and no one was out there.  Did not hear anything from the Dr. Christmas day, either.  Didn't hear anything this morn, so we called--by now I was convinced that he had been put down and the Dr. just didn't want to tell us till we were past Christmas.When we called this morn and he is still alive...and the 'nurse' said doing okay.  Doc was going to call us back, and has since I started this.  It is not too late to have him fixed right, and that is what we are doing.  He thinks he will come through it fine.  He will call us this weekend and let us know how he is doing.I know some will think that is crazy to put that much money in a cat, and some will wonder why we ever hesitated.  I actually wonder the latter part...I know me.  My mom always said I was foolish about animals and she was right.  Personally, I feel like my cats are worth their weight in gold."},

{"title": "Bubbie and Yellowstone", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2008", "text": "Last night our local PBS station aired a show about Yellowstone National Park in the winter.  I missed the first part of it, and was actually thinking about turning it off to go to bed early when something about it caught Bubbie's attention.  He sat spellbound for about 15-20  minutes.  He looked away for a second or two a couple times, but the rest was spent just as you see him here.  When the show was finished, he got down.The one picture bottom-center is just one of him on the back of my chair.  Look at his poor little nose.  It is gradually looking just a tad bit better and he is back to his normal self of just looking for something to get into part of the time.  Last night he was tackling Shelby, trying to hide under a box--one of those folded ones you get for an item of clothing.  You know the size--about 10 inches by 12 or 14 inches.  He thinks if his head is hid, that you cannot see him.It is sure good to see him acting normal...I told Roger and Rachel that it is going to be a desperate situation before I leave an animal overnight at the vets.  The vet is a good vet, but it took Bubbie so long to trust us again.  He has just the past week or so started coming and getting in bed with us.  He still doesn't sit beside us as much as he used to, but he does occasionally.Speaking of bed, remember Puss Puss aka The Princess and Cougar.  The little one is the Princess.  She now has the habit of waiting for me to come to bed, and then she has to get under the covers between Roger and me for 30 - 45 minutes, sometimes more than once a night, but always when I first go to bed.  And she purrs so contentedly.And Cougar has the habit of wanting out about 5:00 in the morning...he won't leave the mini-blinds alone in our room.  Just anything to wake me up."},
{"title": "Through the windshield again", "date": "Sunday, December 21, 2008", "text": "This is from the skim of snow we had a couple weekends ago.  I know and have read that the Amish do not like to be photographed...I have never talked to any of them about it person to person.  But I could not resist snapping this picture.  There is no face showing...even if he wasn't behind the horse, you could not have seen his face if you tried he was so bundled up against the cold.And I have read of others talking to them and them not minding.  I think it probably has to do with the attitude...or maybe what the pictures are for.    But I so would like to document some of the stuff they do.  For Neal and I grew up, he more than me, doing farm work the way the Amish do  it.  We all the time talk about wishing we had pictures of this and that from our childhood.  But that time is past, and there is no going back to take pictures.  So, I want to record it while it is still there to record.Some of the Amish used to come to the orchard where I worked...and one of them told my boss that he would love to be a gourmet cook, but he couldn't do that and be Amish too.  And he chose to be Amish.  He and the other Amish man with him had a twinkle in their eye and you could tell he enjoyed joking and teasing.  I was starting to go on with some sort of foolishness, and stopped because I wondered what he was going to think...then I saw that gleam in his eyes and knew he enjoyed it as much as the rest of us.We had this big pole barn there...and the cooler was in part of it.  As more of the trees in the orchard got more mature and started producing, we started using bins instead of crates to store the apples in.  Using bins required using the forklift...remind me later to tell you about that forklift.  Anyway, using the forklift required concrete since ours had pneumatic tires.So, we were clearing out an area to the side of the cooler and putting in a big pad of concrete that went around the front, one side and back of the cooler just to have a place to stack the bins and move the bins of apples around when having to get in the cooler.  Well, we worked and worked, but the boss just could not get the ground around the cooler/pole barn graded right.So, he was having some of the Amish actually pour and finish this concrete....one of those guys got on the tractor and had the ground prepared in no time at all.  I did not get to watch them do the concrete, but let me tell you it was a job well done.Now to Bessie, the forklift...actually, I called it Nellie and I think it was Sandy that called it Bessie.  It was old--I mean really old.  It has bit the dust since I left there.  But the last few years of its life, it did not have brakes...talk about a fun job.  You just always had to be aware of where you were...the concrete was not finished perfectly flat...you wouldn't know it to look at it.  But you knew it when you were on the forklift. You just always had to keep in mind that there was no stopping unless you dropped your load real quick...I think more than me forgot and got the front wheels off the concrete, but it was always out front where it was not serious.  And the tractor could pull it back on.Out behind would have been a serious matter because the land fell away from the back....John would go just zooming around there but I always half way just crept along.    Now when I got to Menard's and see the boys flying around on the forklifts, I wonder what it would be like to drive one with brakes.  And wonder if I had had brakes, would I ever have became comfortable enough to zoom around like that."},
{"title": "Remember what blue skies look like???", "date": "Saturday, December 20, 2008", "text": "Notice the date on the photo above.  I have taken pictures most days since then and not a one has had the really blue skies like this.  There were a couple times when the sky was clearing...but it was not this color blue at all.  And I am not sure it ever got all the way clear.And seems like towards evening some of the time it tries to clear.  There have been sooo many beautiful sunsets.Though I would like to see sunshine, I am still wanting a good snow.  There is a chance for snow again Saturday night/Sunday, but again they are not talking any accumulation.  I guess I will just have to be happy with the skims we have been getting.We went shopping today...I got just a few more things for Christmas and got them wrapped when we got home.  I still have to wrap for Kay and her little brothers.While out we ran by Kmart...I picked up Christmas cards for next year....actually enough for the next couple of years.  I liked them so well, I didn't even know if they were on sale and I was still bringing home 7 boxes....it was a nice surprise to discover they were on sale for half the price.I did get a little bit more of a start on a quilting project...I cannot tell about it or show it for a while yet.  But it feels good to get a start on it.  It has been weighing on my mind.  If  nothing happens, I am going to spend quite a bit of time on it tomorrow.  I guess if I want to get up and work any at all, I better think about going to sleep."},
{"title": "Newsflash!", "date": "Friday, December 19, 2008", "text": "I am seeing actual sunlight for the first time in days!  Yippee!The photos have the date they were taken on them...seems like it is nothing but gray skies around here.  Wednesday was nothing but a sheet of ice everywhere, except late in the afternoon the main roads were a bit safer to drive on.Right now, we are getting some rain and it seems to be melting some of the ice and snow, but it is supposed to get colder before morning so it is apt to be another sheet of ice.  At least we don't have to get out in it, and my daughter don't go into work till later in the day.  That is a good thing, cause normally she is leaving here between 5:30 and 6:00.I did get presents wrapped today...I still need to do just a bit more shopping.  I am not sure if I will try to get out tomorrow or not.  I definitely will not go on the weekend.  I won't go on the weekend unless it is absolutely necessary even in normal times.Every year when I wrap presents, I cannot help but remember when we were kids...wrapping paper was not something we had in any large amount.  If it comes right down to it, neither were presents.  I don't remember if my brothers tried to take their paper off and save it, or if my mom and I just went through it and tried to save the best of it.  But we did save wrapping paper from year to year to reuse.And then there was the Christmas tree.  I only remember my brother and I going to hunt the Christmas tree.  Not Neal and George, but Robert.  Though I am sure they were the ones that went when I was really young, I just don't remember it.  Down where we were from, if a field had been cleared and not taken care of or cultivated, cedar trees would start growing at the drop of a hat.  So our Christmas trees were cedar...seems like I remember having pine a time or two, but not real sure.  Maybe Neal or George will tell me...But when Mom would finally let us go get one, Robert and I would take off and the hunt was on.   We had acres and acres to look on--all belonging to neighbors cause we didn't have any cedars on our property. (The neighbors didn't mind.) It really wasn't all that far to walk, but it would be by today's standards.  Anyway, we would search and search till we found the perfect tree.   Or as near perfect as we could get...I don't think we ever found a perfect one.  But that was one of the highlights of the year for me.  I think all we had for decorations was a few of the big colored lights, maybe some tinsel, and the silver garland, and a few bulbs.  So these thoughts were going through my head part of the day.Later, my little sewing friend, Kay, was over after school for a while.  I don't so much try to teach her, unless she asks me specifically to show her something, but I do take her down to the sewing machines and let her just sew.  She is content just to sew straight lines.  Or to fold pieces of fabric and sew...just anything. Other times she wants to work on sewing squares together.I know that is how my mom got me started sewing...she just showed me how to run the machine basically, and let me have at it.  Of course, that was with a treadle sewing machine, so I feel just a little bit more security oriented with electric machines.She found some old crochet needles 3 or 4 days ago, and has been so intrigued by them.  I don't crochet; I do know how to make some stitches and at one time I half taught myself to read instructions, but was so slow at it I just decided I had enough hobbies anyway.  So, Kay kept wanting to know how to use them...so I showed her how to do chain stitching...then she decided she could do that with her hands alone.  So that occupied her for a little while.  I think though, that the sewing machines is going to be her one true love.I do try to teach her little bits here and there, but I also like that she just enjoys sewing.  I actually think if she keeps it up, she could really be an artist with the machines.  Right now she has no fear.I am gradually getting sleepy, so will go read a bit.  Maybe a book, maybe blogs because I haven't had time to check on any of them today."},

I had to use auto contrast to make this picture worth viewing...the original was much to dark.  I worked on it with fill flash and the hue and saturation, but auto contrast got the most viewable picture.It is a VERY cold day here in Indiana...the wind just howled last night.  I got up this morn and the house was cold...someone had turned the heat off yesterday!  I thought it a miracle that the thermometer read only 64 degrees F.

I had had to replace the batteries in the point&shoot and forgot to reset the time and date.  Anyway, I just thought a fun picture would fit today's post...this is how he sleeps 90% of the time.I have been tagged by Deborah over at The Cloud Messenger to do this fun meme--\"Six Random Things About Me.\"  I have been trying to decide what to tell...at first I could only think of two or three things, then last night when I settled down to finish the list, I had a hard time narrowing it down.  So here are the six random things about me:1.  When I am driving I LOVE to sing, and don't much care too much if people see me and think I am strange/stupid.  I cannot carry a tune in a bucket, so I only sing when I am alone.  I also used to sing when I worked at the orchard and out on the machinery that was louder than my singing.2.  Almost any song that mentions Tennessee will make me cry, actually a lot of songs make me cry because I think them so beautiful, or they tell a sad story.3.  When we go fishing, or just out messing around, I sometimes pick up rocks to bring home.  Not pocket sized rocks, but maybe from softball size on up, though I have not brought any real big ones home.4.  I cannot stand to mess with a turkey to bake it...the smell makes me physically sick at my stomach.5.  I love ink pens and paper...I always have a flashback to childhood when the school supplies come out each fall.  I will stand and examine EVERYTHING in the pens and paper division.6.  My brother, Neal dropped me on the fireplace hearth when I was a baby.  I think on my head.  So that accounts for a lot;-)Now for the rulesThe rules for Six Random Facts are pretty straightforward:1. Link to the person who tagged you.2. Post the rules on your blog.3. Write six random things about yourself.4. Tag six people at the end of your post and link to them.5. Let each person know they've been tagged and leave a comment on their blog.6. Let the tagger know when your entry is up.Right now I am only going to tag my brother Neal at Photographic Memories....some of the ones I would have tagged have already did this.  Others seem to be more or less just a photo blog, so I am not sure they would want to participate in this.  Heck, Neal might not want to, but if he don't,  I could probably come up pretty easily with six random things about him."},

I guess I was always focused on the barn and did not really take in the obvious--it has a public road that leads right past it.So I got to photograph it yesterday...and I am pretty well happy with the results.  Oh, they could probably be better but I am just so thankful to have finally captured it at all.I am still trying to gather my thoughts together enough to do the 6 random things about  myself.  I have got a couple picked out that I am pretty sure I am going to use...but other than that not sure what else I will tell.  I will try to get it together sometime during the coming days."},
{"title": "Decisions...", "date": "Saturday, December 6, 2008", "text": "This above shot is one of the roads we traveled down today...click to enlarge and enjoy.I hit some of those magical keys that published this against my will.  Every so often I manage to find the correct combination to do something, having no idea what I actually did.Anyway, I have some decisions to make, and while they are not all that important in the overall scheme of things that really do matter, I still have troubles making them.First, because of other happenings we actually got to go for a drive today... and I did get some photos I really, really liked and think you will enjoy as well.  So choosing one to post, or one series is going to be hard.Then I have been tagged for the 6 Random things about myself by Deborah over at The Cloud Messenger.  I want to do it but not sure it will get done tonight.  But I am thinking on it.  It is one of those that I have seen before and thought would be fun, but was never officially tagged so never done it.I have finally chosen pictures...I really thought the old truck I might should save for Sepia Scenes, but it just didn't work out as well when I tried it as some of the others so I am going ahead and posting it.As you can see, we got a little more snow today.  It was quite fun to be out in it, on the back roads of Parke County.  We have driven all over that country up that way and today we were still on roads we had never been on before.I tried to mess with this one and the one of the tree in photoshop the get the warm glow from the lights but didn't do too good.  I was using the point and shoot and did not think to try different settings.I absolutely love the wreath--well, she actually made two of them but they look basically the same.  And as for the Christmas tree, Otto has only ate one snowflake so far.  I am here to tell you that his stomach is made of iron...he has gotten into so much stuff and I think she ran him to the vet the first time or two and basically they didn't do anything.  Nothing ever seems to slow him down.Yesterday we were down there and I was just sitting reading..I am not sure how I had my hand.  But he was sitting back staring at me intently.  I just motioned with my forefinger for him to come to me and he was there in a second. I did not say a word other than to look at him and do that.  I am about convinced that if you will let a dog, you can almost communicate without words.....And it is so funny, our old dog here can be laying about sound asleep, or she could, she is getting so old that she really is out of it when she is asleep now, but we could start talking about her without ever saying her name and her tail would start wagging.  I can look at her and smile and she starts wagging her tail.Oh, and Keesha's radar is still on...yesterday she came out to see Roger and me, but then went back to her bed in the bedroom and didn't come out all the time we were there.  Till about 20-30 minutes before Sarah got home.  I have watched that all her life where Sarah is concerned.  She used to always know when it was time for her to get home from school, and Sarah went to Florida a couple times with friends of ours.  Both times, the evening of the day she was getting home, Keesha would start pacing and watching out the windows, going outside and going over to the gate and just staring down the road....Oh, Bubbie is home!  He has lost weight and he is on antibiotics.  He doesn't like them too well, and I almost think they upset his stomach.  He has acted very strange...didn't want anything to do with us.  He finally came and got in bed with us this morning, but then I had to get up and give him his pill so now  he is upset with us again.  Plus I wonder if the antibiotics makes his stomach feel bad like some meds do ours.Well, that is the report from here today...."},
{"title": "Cows...", "date": "Friday, December 5, 2008", "text": "Cherry Blossom and the front half of BetsyThese are scans of old Polaroid shots...not good quality and I didn't take the time to try to improve them with photo shop.   I have not got to stay home one single day since Thanksgiving and I am running on fumes.  I am not getting my daily fill of blogs, and having less time to work on mine, so please bare with me.Starting from the cow cut off on the left hand side:Betsy, Shorty (I think she was Betsy's daughter a year or two previous to taking this photo, can't remember for sure,) the Red Devil (what my future  sister-in-law later called her) and then one of a set of twins that was Betsy's and by the way, it was hersecond set of twins.I don't know how many have noticed that I always say cows, I very seldom use the term cattle.  I think it is because when I grew up, we lived on a farm, and just had a few cows.  It wasn't like they were all a certain breed...not sure if we had any two the same mixture.And each one had a name, and I think most knew their name.  Each had a distinct personality.  They never had the run of the barn, but when it was winter, they were turned in at night and each had it's own stall, and they always went to their own stall.  I don't know how they knew which was their own, it wasn't like we spent time teaching them that.  They just seemed to know.Besides these, we had Daisy, Sally, Jinxie, I think one we called Blackie that was never really a pet, Patsy, and I know I am forgetting one or two.  I really wish I had a picture of Sally...she was half Charolais and half Hereford--at least I think she was.  Maybe one of my brothers will tell me if I am wrong.  But if you just seen the front of her from her front legs on, you would about think she was a bull.  She was tan with a white face, and her neck was thicker though not exactly like a bulls, but at first glance, I don't know if you would notice, and she had a big wide set of horns.But she was sweet...just always gentle.  And the Red Devil was her calf...and grew to be the only cow we owned that I was ever half afraid of.  I can't remember her ever doing anything to me, but I just never liked her.  I felt like she would not have minded harming me if I got in her way a little bit.  Why she was that way, I will never know.One of my other favorites was Shorty....she was born out in the pasture and a horse bit her neck.  It had a big scab come off it in the shape of the bite and my mom and I doctored and doctored her neck to get it well, she had a scar the rest of her life.  She was probably the most like a true pet....I remember going out in the pasture to see her calf when it was first born.  I started back home and she started bawling and bawling....I went back and picked the calf up and took it and her to the barn and put them in their own stall and she was content.  That probably sounds a little bit far-fetched, but it is the honest truth.  She just stopped bawling when I went back.That is just a little bit about the cows, each one was an individual to us, and we never thought about butchering one when I was home.  And even though we knew the calves were to be sold, we always hated parting with them.  About half the time, we kept the calves in the barn and turned the cows into them and let them stay in over night.And those calves that were raised in the barn were really spoiled...going to the barn was never a chore for me.  I never had to get up and go milk before school or go feed before school though.  I know Neal did, and probably my older brother, George, did too at one time.  But I fed and milked in the summer and after school as I got older.  We usually just had one cow that we milked at a time...just enough for us.And my mom sometimes sold milk and buttermilk.  I think for a dollar a gallon.  I don't know if she ever sold butter or not....It is getting late and I am rambling, so I will just hush for the night."},

{"title": "Bubbie and other stuff....", "date": "Tuesday, December 2, 2008", "text": "How is this for relaxed?  My husband has been meaning to build these cats some houses to play in, and just keeps forgetting.  We think that they would really play in them.  So, to kind of get an idea of how they would react, he went and cut cardboard and taped it together and brought it in.He no more than sat it down on the floor till Bubbie crawled in it...and it has an upper level and PussPuss crawled in it.  She didn't stay though.  Anyway, lots of time we look around and Bubblie will be sleeping in it, or else half in and half out like the pictures above.Right now he is at the vet's office and it is awful lonely without him.  Just quiet...he is the rambunctious one...the one most apt to be picking at someone or some other animal.  Rachel went to wash his face--yes he gets out and gets dirty and she will wash his face. Anyway, she noticed a sore and it all this junk came out of it.  She has doctored it here, but thought it was getting worse, so she took him to the vet.  And though he don't have a temperature his breathing is not normal so they are keeping him a day or two.  He had caught a mouse the other night and we are thinking it might have bit him...it is some kind of puncture wound.  And it was also sort of like it had bit through the bridge of his nose and it was starting to seep stuff.I had the picture below ready for sepia scenes last Wednesday but didn't know if it was quite good enough...so I used a couple of other pictures.  And I have a different one ready for tomorrow if I remember to get on in time to post it.  So just thought I would post it here for fun.This was originally in color.  Digital.  I removed the color, reduced the blue and increased the red.  Then I added noise.  I kind of think it fits with the way the barn seems to be on the way to falling down.  This is not too far from home...probably a five minute drive."},
{"title": "Christmas past", "date": "Monday, December 1, 2008", "text": "From scanned slides...first a couple from Bridgeton, Indiana.  I love to go for drives and look at Christmas lights.  However, it has been a while since we actually done that.  Seems like the time just flies as I get older.And these are the blurred images that I ran across the other day that inspired me to take the photo that I posted Thanksgiving Day.  I think these are best viewed when enlarged.When we first moved here in 1980, or oldest daughter was just 5 months old.  Not sure how long it was before we met the lady that lived two houses down from us.  Veronica was from Lithuania and spoke very broken English even though she had been here for years.  There were all kinds of rumors about her, which we will never know if they were true or not.  One we know for sure is not true--she wasn't mean to kids.  I had people that grew up here tell me that they remembered being so afraid of her when they were kids.I don't know how she found out my husband could do stuff, but she would have problems with this or that and come ask him to help.  Things like a leaky faucet, or the belt on her treadle sewing machine broke, just a few little things here and there.  I know there were other things but right now I cannot think of them.  And every so often she would get him to take her to the Chicago O'Hare airport.  She was going back over 'there' for a visit.  She went to Moscow.She told us  of her and her husband running and hiding under bushes and she witnessed  her husband being shot.  She came to the USA then and left two children over there...or that was what we understood her to say.  At Christmas she would buy all kinds of clothes for children to send to relatives (grandchildren??) over there, and she would have us or this other neighbor write down a list of everything that was in the box, so whoever she was sending it to could tell if they got it all or if things had been stolen before it got to them.She also had an old man named Walter that lived with her...one year he had a daughter come over from Russia(?somewhere in that area), and she brought her husband and one of their children...a little girl about 5 or 6 years old.  They were not allowed to bring their other children for fear they would try to stay here. Her name was Elana...she was a kindergarten teacher.  Her husband was Alex but I don't recall what he did...they did not speak a word of English and of course we didn't know a word of their language.  But Elana had books that converted from their language to ours and from ours to their language.We got the bright idea to take them on a drive...we had this little Dodge Colt.  So there were us four adults and their child in that tiny car, and we took this big long drive just showing them the country...I showed them the orchard where I worked, and I cannot remember where else we took them. I think we showed them the other places we had worked.  Elana and I would use the books to communicate and really enjoyed each other's company.  I know we came home late enough to see the Christmas lights, so never does a Christmas pass that I don't think of her and wonder how she is.Oh, and back to Veronica for a chuckle or two at my husband's expense.  I told you he would take her to the airport sometimes.  One time he went to pick them up, and it may have been the time when Elana came home.  He forgot to pay attention to where he parked, and he came home telling about it...he was telling it and all I could picture is a duck with its ducklings following behind.  Every where he went, there was this line of people following right behind him.  I cannot do it justice...he was telling me and making gestures...he finally got them to understand and just stay in one place while he went and found the car.And another time he picked up Veronica, she had been drinking.  And she had it in the truck with her.  Well, we don't drink...and she kept trying to get him to take a drink, and it was something strong...not beer. She  just couldn't understand why he didn't want any.   And all the time he was praying that he didn't get stopped by police cause they would never believe he had not been drinking...he said the truck smelled like a brewery.  He was so relieved to get them home--I think Walter had went with him to pick her up.So that is one of my Christmas memories...."},

I took Roger's little point and shoot camera today and snapped these of him and Sarah.  She was feeling under the weather today with a cold coming on.Oh, and that top photo is what it looked like around here this morning.  It was just a skim of snow--just enough and wet enought to stick and cover everything.  But by the time we started home it was almost all gone.  We are still supposed to get an inch or two tonight and tomorrow, but so far it hasn't started."},
{"title": "Heading our way", "date": "Sunday, November 30, 2008", "text": "I just found these photos the other day...I have posted a different picture of the barn before and I think I have posted a photo similar to the others.  Even though I don't really like being cold, I am excited cause snow is supposed to be heading our way.  That does not guarantee we will get any, but I can hope.  I love snow pictures...it is hard to mess up a snow scene.  Snow covers a multitude of things.As for today, we didn't get home till around 7:00 tonight...and we plan to go back tomorrow.  I wish we could have got more done today, but we did go and Roger and Jeremy got measurements done, got the list made and we went and got the things needed.  They did mess around with the electrical outlets.  Not sure of the correct terms...but you have to have an adaptor to use a 3-prong plug so they want to put in the right ones and connect the ground wire.If Sarah had not been so tired I would have liked for her to download some of the pictures of Otto off their camera and send them to me.  He is so much fun...and he just adores Jeremy.  Tries to keep up with Jeremy's every move.  And she had some of him laying with her  and some of him laying with Jeremy on the couch.  They don't generally let him up there, but at times he can give them a look that 'guilts' them into letting him up.  And he acts as if he is their baby.It is getting late, and I am so tired I cannot think straight.  I owe emails to friends and need to make out bills, but you know what?  I don't think either one is going to get done tonight."},

On top of that, Roger went to hook the trailer to the truck and found that our radio/CD player had been stolen.  So, we filed a police report.  We are probably lucky that that is all they got.  Just in our little surrounding community, there has been a rash of theft.I don't buy into that it is poor people/bad economy bit at all.  It is thieves and nothing but thieves.  We grew up about as poor as you can be but we never thought about stealing for a living.  People work harder at that kind of stuff than they would if they just got out and got a job.We (a nephew and I) caught someone in our neighbor's garden once when I was a teen, and I was too young and stupid to look around before I let him go.  He said he just had to use the bathroom.  After he left I found boxes where stuff was gathered out in the garden.  He could do that and at the same time have one of those big 16 oz beers in his hands...if you can buy beer you can buy food.  If it comes to that, I don't know of a soul that I grew up around, if you wanted a mess of beans, corn etc from the garden, they would have given you one.  All you had to do was ask."},

On the other side of the highway is another smaller power plant that only runs at peak times from my understanding.  It stays lit up even if only running with a skeleton crew.  It was about 7:00 p.m. and almost totally dark but it is well lit.  I thought to myself I would see what a picture would look like from there.I knew it would be blurred but I thought it would be interesting all the same...I had the lens wide open I am sure...I looked at the info on the picture to get that the shutter speed was 1/5 second.  Keep in mind that we were probably going 60 or 65 mph down the road.I kind of like the image...I keep meaning to do more of this type of stuff but don't think about it till it is the only option.  I happened to run across some pictures in my slides a bit back that reminded me that sometimes photos like this can be kind of fun."},

{"title": "Willow Slough Fish and Wildlife area", "date": "Tuesday, November 25, 2008", "text": "We went to Willow Slough just to see what it was like...we didn't really read anything about it.  I have since found out that it is 9,956 acres of land which includes 1,800 acres of water.I think I told earlier that the guys from the DNR that worked there said most of the water was about knee deep.I am not sure how many duck hunters were on the water...I think we could see about 4 floating duck blinds.  I have to admit that I didn't realize what they were at first.  The first one I noticed honestly looked about like a beaver's house.Then I saw the big ones and realized what they were.  Why I didn't take a picture of one of them is more than I know.Camping is allowed there, and there was lots of places to just fish from the bank.  But I have a feeling the entire place is covered with moss in the warmer months.  Hunting is allowed for most things if I remember correctly; you do have to sign in.  One area is reserved for dog training.  And there is a shooting range which is run on a first come first served basis.I am anxious to go back there in the spring...cannot imagine all the bugs and stuff we would see.  But I had fun Saturday...I kind of like seeing the place bare."},

These are fresh--from this year's crop.They were taken at Willow Slough.  I definitely want to go back there some time in the future.After these I have just a few more to show from there, and none of them spectacular, but hopefully I will have time to write a little bit about the place.Right now I am having trouble finding the time to post or visit my regular blogs.I think I might have created a monster...the little girl from next door has always loved going down in our basement with me.  I have my sewing machines set up all the time, and she always gets up to one and pretends to sew.So the other night, I just set down with her and let her  play while keeping an eye on her...I don't want her sewing her finger.  She had been here quite a while, and her mom called so I sent her home.  IN just a little few minutes, she was back over here saying she could stay an hour.  I told her well, not an hour, cause the Colts game was coming on.  Still, we were down there for a while after it started.Besides that it is a night before school night and she needs to be home and getting settled down.  Then last night here she came and she looks at me with this gleam in her eyes, and says 'You're probably going to get mad or aggravated--I forget her exact word, but she wanted to go down and sew.  So soon as I finished we went down there and played.My question is, how much do I just let her play and how much do I really try to get her to do things right?  Right now, I try to teach her for a little bit, then I just let her play.  And by teaching it is things like teaching her what the pressure foot is, how to put it down, and I am trying to teach her to sew a straight seam but not having a lot of luck with that.  But then we have only began.So this is part of why I have been MIA; and right now we are getting ready to go do some shopping for stuff for Thanksgiving.  Plus stuff I am out of."},

{"title": "Day trip..", "date": "Sunday, November 23, 2008", "text": "Yesterday we decided to go on a little excursion to the north of us. We were headed to this Willow Slough Fish and Wildlife area which is about 100 miles north of us.  Just a little while before we got there, this is what we began to see.To the east of the road we were traveling on, we began to see windmills that were being installed.  I honestly think that saying there was 200 of them is a very conservative guess.  It was a dark and cloudy day, and visibility was not that good.  But they were as far as the eye could see.  Just in one little area, Roger counted 40.  And those were just the ones that were close to us.  There were many, many more--all the way to the horizon.I took a variety of shots, but never seemed to be able to capture in the photos what we were feeling seeing them.  I was hoping to give a feeling of how big they were by shooting this semi beside the one above.To the west of the road were windmills already in operation...notice they are all facing the same way.  Again, too numerous to begin to count.  We almost felt like we were in the middle of a sci-fi movie.  It was an other worldly feeling.I just have to show this photo...I almost missed the guy working up there and was barely able to capture him...going 60 mph down the highway on a dark and dreary day is not the key to to spot on focused pictures.This photo doesn't show how cold it was...but at least the wind wasn't howling as it sometimes does.  I would have went to see these alone, and can't wait to go back on a less dark and dreary day."},

Or his clone.  It is a combination of Puss Puss and Bubbie.Scroll on down for the real Camera Critters post.It is time for camera critters again...I can't believe I remembered.  So far, so good.  Tomorrow I have to try to remember to go sign up when Misty opens the link page.The first shots are of  some of the geese that was at Dobb's Nature Center in It was already evening and overcast part of the time.  I really do wonder how birdsTerre Haute a few days ago.stay warm in he winter, especially the wading and swimming birds.These all seem to be in good health...it is against park rules to feed them.  I am assuming because most people would feed only bread, and any kind of bread at that and that would not be nutritional for them.Yesterday morn, I started to brush my teeth.  I didn't have the light on in the bathroom, but had the door open and was just going to brush my teeth from the light coming in through the door.  There was this 'stuff' which I thought was tiny bits of hair all over the sink.I immediately thought 'well, I have not trimmed my bangs followed by the thought maybe Roger trimmed his beard.  But his beard is white so even though I have not technically been declared insane I reverted back to my bangs...but I just had my hair trimmed.  So reassured that it was not my hair and still half asleep, I tried to rinse it on down the drain..it didn't go.  I just thought I would clean it up later.Well, later, when I was a little more awake, I remembered I had seen Bubbie asleep in the sink, and it was his dirty little foot prints in there.  I haven't seen him curled up in the sink in quite a while so I don't know what thoughts went through his head to want to sleep in there.Oh, and now that it is cold, he and the other cats still want to go outside...they just want back inside quicker.  With the inside doors closed,  he is the only one that hasn't devised a way to really get our attention to let him in...Mama Cat scratches on the storm door loud enough for us to hear, while Puss Puss and Cougar gets the screen.When I realize Bubbie is out, I will start checking on him, and even calling for him.  But I think I have discovered the right way to bring him home.  I have happened to turn Shelby, our dog, out two or three times when I  have been waiting for Bubbie to come in.  Well, when she is ready to come home she always gives a couple little barks.  (Her little barks are still quite loud.)  If I wait just a couple minutes after Shelby barks, Bubbie is usually there and through the door before she is.So this is my post for camera critters.

I feel like this vulture is looking over his shoulder say, \"Hey, you want to come over to my place?\"  I don't know why, but that is the first thing I think when I look at it.Anyway, I would estimate that 95% or more of the trees in this area are bare...just one with color every now and then.  When we were over in Paris, going down a street where there was no place to park, there was one tree that was almost a red as brilliant as the barn in the last picture.At the local strip pit, most of the moss was gone, but there were still these lily pads.  When I first got close, there were lots of bubbles coming to the top..we wondered was a turtle down below or what.As for this barn, it really is this color red.  I did not alter this picture anyway.  It is a color red that will about knock your eyes out in real life.  And notice the mower in the foreground...when I was a kid we had one of these that was for horses."},

The ones below are actually two different images...one taken with flash and the other without.  I am not sure which I liked the best.The other day, Don posted a picture of mushrooms on his blog and it reminded me that I had taken these.So, being that I am running late and didn't have anything on my mind to publish, I thought I would show these.  And at the same time, if you are like me and enjoy good photography, I would suggest Don's Slackwater.  I just a few days ago finished going through all his photographs.  They are wonderful.  I will probably go back from time to time just to look at them again...I wish I had kept a list of my favorites."},
{"title": "A different train of thought....", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "text": "I was wondering around in blogland one day and came across someone's photo of their Alaska books...so it got me to thinking.  I have a stash of books about the north country; at least that is what I call it.  I am not sure when I developed this obsession.  I really am not.  I cannot remember if it started with Tisha by Robert Specht as told by Anne Hobbs.  (By the way, it is a true story.)  I know it was one of the first books I ever read about Alaska...Or it might have started with an old movie I caught on television called O Rugged Land of Gold.  The next time I was at the library, I did a search and they had the book....again a true story, written by Martha Martin.  Whichever started my obsession, it is one I really enjoy.  I have not read all of the Robert W. Service poems--at least not at one sitting.  I tend to pick them up and read a poem or two when I am in the mood.  Also not read at one sitting, but I pick up and read bits and pieces in the Biographies of the Alaska/Yukon.  And I have not read Innocent in Alaska...not sure why. I do keep forgetting I have it.  It will do for some winter reading.But I have read all the others, most of which are nonfiction...and several of them I have read numerous times.  And will probably read a few more times in my lifetime.Then there is probably my favorite poem of all time...it is long, but I ask you to please read it through.  I was browsing in the bookstore one time and picked up a book of poetry...I was looking for another poem and happened to come across The Spell of the Yukon by Robert W. Service...I had tears come to my eyes by the time I read it through...I thought it so beautiful.  I cannot pick a favorite verse, but oh the last one just grabs my heart so.  So I hope you read it and enjoy it just a tiny bit...The Spell of the Yukon            Robert W. Service           1874--1958I wanted the gold, and I sought it; I scrabbled and mucked like a slave. Was it famine or scurvy, I fought it; I hurled my youth into a grave. I wanted the gold, and I got it -- Came out with a fortune last fall, -- Yet somehow life's not what I thought it, And somehow the gold isn't all.  No! There's the land. (Have you seen it?) It's the cussedest land that I know, From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it To the deep, deathlike valleys below. Some say God was tired when He made it; Some say it's a fine land to shun; Maybe; but there's some as would trade it For no land on earth -- and I'm one.  You come to get rich (damned good reason); You feel like an exile at first; You hate it like hell for a season, And then you are worse than the worst. It grips you like some kinds of sinning; It twists you from foe to a friend; It seems it's been since the beginning; It seems it will be to the end.  I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow That's plumb-full of hush to the brim; I've watched the big, husky sun wallow In crimson and gold, and grow dim, Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming, And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop; And I've thought that I surely was dreaming, With the peace o' the world piled on top.  The summer -- no sweeter was ever; The sunshiny woods all athrill; The grayling aleap in the river, The bighorn asleep on the hill. The strong life that never knows harness; The wilds where the caribou call; The freshness, the freedom, the farness -- O God! how I'm stuck on it all.  The winter! the brightness that blinds you, The white land locked tight as a drum, The cold fear that follows and finds you, The silence that bludgeons you dumb. The snows that are older than history, The woods where the weird shadows slant; The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery, I've bade 'em good-by -- but I can't.  There's a land where the mountains are nameless, And the rivers all run God knows where; There are lives that are erring and aimless, And deaths that just hang by a hair; There are hardships that nobody reckons; There are valleys unpeopled and still; There's a land -- oh, it beckons and beckons, And I want to go back -- and I will.  They're making my money diminish; I'm sick of the taste of champagne. Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish I'll pike to the Yukon again. I'll fight -- and you bet it's no sham-fight; It's hell! -- but I've been there before; And it's better than this by a damsite -- So me for the Yukon once more.  There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting; It's luring me on as of old; Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting So much as just finding the gold.  It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder, It's the forests where silence has lease; It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder, It's the stillness that fills me with peace.Just realized earlier that this is actually the first post for today...don't ask me how I got so mixed up.  Yesterday was not such a good day...had a BAD headache all day...and sore from something else.I posted these at one time on my other blog.  They were taken long before I had a digital camera.These are scans from slides which was developed in October of 1994.   This was just a single old tree along the side of a country road.  I could not believe my eyes when I spotted these babies up there.I think this last baby is just soooo cute."},

I could find it before but it would only allow me to embed 30 second sound bites.  I really don't understand how that works.For those of you familiar with Frankenstein and Free Ride by The Edgar Winter Group, let me assure you this is nothing like those.  If I had not actually had the album in my hands and played it myself, I would never have believed it was the Edgar Winter Group.  But then I was never a great fan of theirs....I could listen to them. But I either tend to love a song with all my heart and will listen to it over and over, or else I don't care a thing about listening to it.Anyway, I love the song and these pictures were taken on the way home from Merom last Friday...can you believe the difference between the posts I did from earlier that day and these images.  They are typical winter skies.  They are all drive-by shots...so just a tad bit blurry if you look close.  Well, you don't have to look close at the one with the crows.  But they give the  mood of the song and the mood I felt when I took it so I am posting it anyway....The dogwood is probably my favorite of the flowering trees/shrubs...not sure what its exact classification is.But I love how we go from the above look of spring....to these glorious colors of the fall."},

This first is not such a great picture;  it is a drive-by shot...you can see the dirty windshield in it.   And I feel like it is just a tad bit blurred.  It isn't a great shot...but I still just love this house.  I wonder how old it is...it is surely old.    But even if it isn't, I love the fact that is made of rock.  Just LOVE it.The one below was taken early in the fall...I do love the color and simplicity of this shot.Look at this...just look where it is growing.  First this closer view....Then this one where I am not zoomed in.Now, this is not a true macro or anything like that.    It is just a cropped areafrom the shot below.  I like feathers.....When I worked at the orchard I would sometimes collect hawk and turkey feathers and stick them on the tractor...I did not know that it is totally illegal to have them in your possession.  I think it is a federal law...and though I may be mistaken, I think only Indians are allowed to own the real thing from a bird of prey.  I just did a quick search;  check out some laws here....I just learned that we are not supposed to have bird nests in our possession either.  I'm not sure if that includes all nests or not.All the time I worked at the orchard there was a pair of hawks that I seen quite often...probably would have seen them every day had I noticed.  I watched them enough...I considered them 'ours' as if we owned them.  But they stayed there, and they raised their young there...and I am sure they killed dozens and dozens and dozens of mice in the orchard.  I loved them for that reason alone.  Once or twice, one of them landed in an apple tree not too far from me..I got down off my picker to see how close I could get to it.  That was two trees away--probably about 20 feet from it.Sometimes when we mowed under the trees, the hawks would follow not too far away.  I didn't know it till I worked there, but mice are hard on apple trees.  The burrow in and around the roots, and and can do a lot of damage to the roots.  You just would not believe the runways they will have under the trees."},

But we glance to the back and attached to the back was a welding shop.From there we went on south, then east and back up through some country we had not seen before.  We came across this sort of unusual looking barn...and be sure and click and enlarge and look at the post the mailbox is on.

I was afraid everyone might be getting tired of fall photos, yet I just could not stop till I posted these.  I was going to post all of the ones in the collage separately, then thought maybe it would be better to post it as a collage.  I am hoping it will enlarge big enough for you to get a feel for the photos used in it.I could not post without including the wonderful sweet gum...I think it is my favorite of big trees--the leaves turn all colors.  It just happened that I didn't take a picture featuring all the colors.  A lot of them will have a range of color from bright yellow to a purple that is almost black...with every color in between.Even so, aren't these all so glorious?It is wintry feeling here in the Midwest today.  I cannot get over just how much like winter the air feels.  It isn't freezing cold, but it is cold.  It is just the look of everything and the feel that is in the air.My kitties tend to stay inside a bit more.  And that is good for all concerned.  Yesterday I was sitting in the living room and thought I saw a bird fly across the yard down low...and thought it was the size of a blackbird or robin, but I haven't been seeing any.  I got up and looked out the window and didn't see anything.So I went outside to have a better look, and it was Puss Puss aka The Princess with a little bitty bird.  She took off like lightening with me right behind her...I chased her around to the back and got her cornered and she let go of the bird and it flew away.  I did not get a good look, but was so afraid it was a wren.I sometimes wish I didn't like cats so well, or that they would all be as lazy as my original Cougar was...he sure didn't spend much time hunting.  But they are not.  I still love them, though, and cannot imagine life without them.  Every night, my new Cougar comes and cries and wants me to sit down and hold him for a while.  It is so relaxing.And heaven forbid I go in and find one on the bed of the day...I just have to lay down with it for a few minutes.However, there are the times around 11:00 or midnight, when they are outside and come to the door.  I get up to let whichever one it is in, and they turn around and go the other way.  They are wanting me to come outside with them.  Here about a month ago, Cougar did me that way at least half a dozen times....Roger was laughing at me.  And him.So, after Roger went to bed, Bubbie wanted out about the time Cougar was at the window again.  So I let Bubbie out, and went outside talking to him and not paying Cougar any attention...I got close enough to Cougar that time and snatched him and brought him in.And then there are the times it is raining, or supposed to rain and I am out searching the yard and surrounding area at midnight trying to get them all rounded up and inside.  I call myself the cat herder..."},

That time we were cloud chasing...Yesterday it was just some place to go to that was farther south, and I thought there might be more fall color left there.  And there was some...not a whole lot more but it was still worth the trip.You can tell by looking in the distance as well as under these tress that most leaves are down.  I do have more color from here to show you tomorrow.  But first I thought I would show you the reason it is called Merom Bluff.You can see the Wabash River way down below....and the land across it is Illinois.And this is the road that leads down to the river.  I would not want to lose my brakes on the way down, nor have to come up it when it was icy.No matter, I still think it really beautiful.These photos are all supposed to enlarge, so I hope you click on them to get the full effect.I thought I would show you some of the rock formations or cliffs or whatever you want to call them.And when you get to the bottom, there is a place to launch your boat into the Wabash River.  This is looking upstream.  I wonder just how far it would be to Terre Haute if going up the river instead of driving?Here you go, probably one of the last roses to be seen around here.  This was taken today while on a little road trip...down at Merom Bluffs.  I will show you a few more scenes over the next couple or three days.  But for right now, I wanted to show you this rose....followed by a yellow world.It is the ginkgo tree....I love the shape and the color of the leaves.  Not sure what caused the brown spots on some of the ones above.My husband thinks this leaf looks like a crane taking off in flight...I must say I agree with him.This last picture though gives the true feel of what it felt like to look up through the trees.  They were younger trees, and actually in the edge of someone's yard but I didn't think they would mind.  The first time I ever seen a gingko was on the campus of Lincoln Memorial University.  From that time on, I have thought it a beautiful tree."},

{"title": "Just a swingin'", "date": "Monday, November 3, 2008", "text": "Is there anyone that doesn't like to swing?  I honestly wouldn't mind having a swing in my house.  A friend of a friend of my husband did have a swing in his house.  I never saw it, but Roger came home telling me I would have loved his house.That is the thing I can't wait for in the spring--it being warm enough to sit in the swing on either the front or back porch and sit and visit with friends or family.  Or sit out there when I talk on the phone.My love affair with swings started when I was a kid.  We had a fair sized walnut tree, and always had at least one swing in it. And most of the time there were 3 0r 4.   No tipping over the swingset for us.  But every now and then the rope would break....or, I think part of them, if not all of them had a chain that went around the limb, and the rope then attached to the chain.  I can remember very clearly one time the piece of chain coming loose and coming down hitting me on the head.  It was not the typical porch swing chain...it was an actual working chain, not super heavy duty.  I think about like the chain used to connect horse to plow.It was before I was in school...I know there were no leaves on the tree, and no one else was around.  I think I cried, but don't remember for sure.  Oh, and at least part of the time, if not all, our 'rope' was actually baler twine.  And we didn't call it baler twine...we called it grass string.I think we plaited it sometimes...not sure if we did all the time.  But we did at least double it or triple it..That walnut tree seemed huge to me then...."},
{"title": "If it is like this now....", "date": "Sunday, November 2, 2008", "text": "I can't help but wonder how much longer we will have this kind of color.  The first two photos are north and west of me one block.  I have been seeing them for quite a while now.It was a little late in the evening when I finally decided to try to capture the color.  I am hoping I get back there tomorrow at a better time, though I do like these.  But it is just hard for me to capture how glorious the trees are.  They almost seem to glow from within.But I look at them, and the other trees and notice how many more leaves are on the ground and I can't help but wonder how far off scenes like the ones below are.  At least I am hoping for at least one good snow.Though I hate being cold, I am not sure I could ever live where it didn't snow.  I love getting out when it snows better than almost anything.  Oh, I don't like having an appointment that I have to keep, don't especially like to go shopping then.  But I don't like general shopping at any time.  However, I do love to get out and ramble around on the back roads at a slow pace.I have always loved getting out in the snow.  When I was a kid, I couldn't wait to get out.  I loved going sledding...and no store bought sled for us.  I can remember my brothers building sleds out of just whatever lumber they could find.  If Neal sees this, maybe he can give more detail...I just remember them being heavy.I can also remember the brother that is between Neal and I in age--he and I got some old car hood and used it.  Talk about heavy!  I think it came from a car that had been left on some property of ours, but not real sure.  We had several places where we went sledding, and it is a wonder to God that we didn't get killed at a couple of the places.  Especially this brother I am talking about being between Neal and I in age...he had no fear of anything and still doesn't.And if I didn't go sledding, I loved taking the dogs and just taking off.  I guess people today would call it hiking.  But we didn't especially follow a path...I liked trying to track rabbits.  Not to kill them or anything, just to try to find them and watch the dogs chase them. I never can keep it straight which way they are going...whether the wide apart tracks are the ones in front or behind.  I guess I should look that up when I get off here.  Now I call what we did rambling around, but back then I just called it 'going to play,' but I did until the day I moved to Indiana...and that was in 1975.  I had my twentieth birthday that year.Those dogs are long gone, and though I could still ramble on a big part of the land, there is quite a bit of it owned by people I don't know.  And though my two brothers that still live in TN does know them, it is not quite the same...I would not feel free to do as we did as kids.  Neal and I both talk about how we would love to be home one more time when it snows.  But I am not sure it is ever going to happen."},

I have debated and debated on how to do this...back in July while we were gone for a little get away, my friend Carletta at Round the Bend gave me this  Super Commenter award...I cannot remember what all was happening, but I kept putting off acknowledging it till I was embarrassed about it.  But it has always been there in the back of my mind...I visit Carletta's blog almost every day of the week...seriously, there have only been a handful of days that I haven't visited.  I felt and still feel honored that she gave me this award...and Carletta, I am sorry I was so long in acknowledging it.And just recently I started visiting the Tuscaloosa Daily Photo Blog and she gave me the award below and I have not did anything about it...I really do appreciate it, but not sure if I am going to pass it on.And then there is Ms. Hays at Bluff Area Daily Photo...I found her through Sky Watch Friday.  And I have visited her every day since.  And will continue to do so.  Again, I am not sure if I am going to take the time to pass it on.  Mainly because I am so indecisive about who I would give them to.But I do want you to know that I feel very honored to have received them and I wanted to publicly acknowledge them.Change of subject....I showed you a couple knives and sheaths that Roger had made.Well, he had these three knives finished then also, but did not have the sheaths made to go with them.He finished the sheaths 3 or 4 days ago, and they are done at their new homes.  Due to things happening these are the best shots I got.They have also been given to their new owners.I think I am safe in saying that everyone is happy with them.Roger worked on them all at the same time and I think he decided he would rather work on knives one at a time.edited to add:  The dollar bill is pictured with the knives for you to have something to go by to imagine their size."},

I guess I will go with the pictures since they fall first.This is the cottonwoods across the street.  When I was trying to round up my cats the other morning, I happened to notice how the sunlight was hitting the first of three cottonwoods.  I loved how the leaves just seem to have a golden glow.Since I was having no success in calling Cougar home, I came in and got my camera and tried to capture that glow...I didn't succeed.  I don't know why I didn't bracket some shots....I do that all the time when taking snow scenes but didn't think to do it with these.I think I have got them adjusted till they will show up right on the computer, but not real sure.  After I publish the post, I will check it out on the desktop computer and see how they look there.Now for today.  I am not sure, but don't think I mentioned that a month or 6 weeks ago...my husband stubbed his little toe on his right foot.  Not once, not twice, but three times.  Each time was almost harder than the time before.  The last time he went barefoot out in the garage for something and kicked a cast iron jack stand with it, and moved it 5 or 6 inches.That little toe gradually started bothering him worse and worse--felt like someone had hold of it squeezing real hard.  He could not stand for the covers to be on it, and most shoes bothered it, especially if he was walking on uneven ground.  So he had an appointment with a podiatrist 3 or 4 weeks ago.  The doctor suggested surgery.So today we had to be in Terre Haute at the hospital at 6:30 this morn.  The doctor cut out a nerve, as well as a sort of spur on the tip of one of the bones.  We were back home by 11:00 a.m. or so...the surgery itself only took about 15 minutes...we got there early in order to hurry up and wait.  I no more than got home till I realized I had forgotten to drop of the prescription for pain meds, so I had to turn around and take that to the pharmacy....had to wait an hour for it to be filled.And though the story is not mine to be made public, will just say that we also spent Wednesday at the hospital with someone else.   I don't know about anyone else, but just sitting in the hospital tires me a whole lot more than an actual job.  I am relieved that today is over with...I know it is going to be hard on my husband to just sit around....but surely he can manage that till the 10th, which is when he gets the stitches out."},

I just didn't do a good job in the first photo of capturing what I saw and though I have messed around with Photoshop, I cannot seem to recreate what I saw with what I took, so left it the way I took it.If you want to join Sky Watch, click on the badge at the top or go HERE.

In Parke County.We took a drive last week and ended up passing by it again.  I took the opportunity to stop and take some new pictures.Information in the book A Round Indiana by John T. Hanou states it was built in 1895 and believed to be the first true circular barn built in Indiana.I am so glad that it is still standing.  At one time, there were 8 of these round barns in Parke County.  Now there is this one, and maybe one other if nothing has happened to it since the book was written.

They have been an encouragement to me in blogland.Now to my post for today...I worked for years at an apple orchard.  The picker on the left side of the row of trees was my picker for years.  (that is not me on it.)  If I am out there to visit, it is still my machine.  The tractor pictured is not the tractor I started with...it is only about 7 years old as I speak.  It was bought new, ordered with tires as small as they come till it would fit through the trees when they are loaded down with apples.These are just a few of the apple trees...the ones above are some of the younger trees.  I probably helped set some of them.  The orchard is a small orchard--it had about 2,000 trees.  In those 2,000 trees we had 20+ varieties.favorite job I ever did out there, or maybe for all time, was grafting.  I felt like I was creating something...but I sure loved picking and didn't mind the pruning except sometimes the cold got to me.  When I was pruning I felt like an artist at work.The above was the the first variety picked at our orchard;  they are EarliBlaze.  And the ones below are Blushing Golden, picked a bit past mid season and they are probably my favorite apple.These below are Arkansas Black...they were picked at the very end of October, and at that time we only had the Granny Smith apples to pick after, though we did plant some Pink Ladies before I quit, and they have an even longer growing season that the Grannies, as we called them.The Arkansas Blacks are gourmet cooking apples...but a lot of people love them because they are so hard and crisp.I hope you enjoyed seeing a little bit of where I spent years of my life.  The orchard is still a working orchard, and I still visit every now and then."},
{"title": "Something simple", "date": "Sunday, October 26, 2008", "text": "I like this picture...I am not sure if my husband understood why I wanted to take it.  I can't even explain why I like it.  It was definitely the wrong time of day to take it but I have to take pictures when I have the chance.  Also, since getting this laptop, I have a real hard time knowing if the picture is too dark or too light.  Does anyone have a sure-fire way to deal with that?This leaf was trying to float in the small amount of water in the stream that the covered bridge below spans.    The second photo is the original...I was trying to make the water look more like what I remembered but then the leave has  exaggerated contrasts.  So try to picture something in between the two images and you will come nearer seeing what I seen.This is the Marshall Bridge in Parke Country, Indiana.  One of the shorter bridges--56 ft in length.When we were kids, we had Gap Creek that bordered our farm in Tennessee.  Every summer, well, it wasn't actually every summer, but at least 2 or 3 summers or possibly 4...my nephew that is the same age as me came down and spent the summers with us in Tennessee.In my memories, we played in that creek every single day of the week, except maybe if it stormed and flooded.  We turned over rocks in search of crawdads, hunted for fresh water mussels....not to eat or anything like that.  It was just fun to search for them...and we did sometimes move them from their sandy spot in the water to a spot of our choosing...I don't really remember if they ever stayed or not.I may have told about this before...so forgive me if I am boring you.  These are just some of the happiest memories I have.  I don't really remember our age, but we had to be up around 10 years old I think...just going by some of the other things we did.On the other side of the creek a huge sycamore tree had been uprooted, I assume during a storm.  It lay out over the neighbor's pasture--his cattle could walk under it with ease.  The tree itself was so big around that we could neither have put our arms around it.  Anyway, he and I would take such things as mustard and onion sandwiches and get out on it and sit and watch the cows and laugh and talk.I don't remember if I had chores back then or what they were if I did....yet I can't imagine not having something I was responsible for.  I know one thing I had to do and that was wash the supper dishes...mommy did the morning dishes, we both worked on the dinner dishes.  (We always called lunch dinner, and the evening meal was always supper.)  But other than that, I don't know what else I did.Anyway, any time I am at a creek, it immediately brings to mind my childhood....or that of our own daughters.  We don't have much of a creek near us, but there was a few years when they were kids that we went fishing quite often at Bridgeton and Mansfield.  Roger and I fished, and they fished some, but they played more as we waded.When we were doing that, we always got one of the hard plastic kiddie pools and kept in our backyard each summer, and they would bring home their treasures...crawdads, pumpkin seed bluegill, tadpoles, and some kind of bug that I can't remember the name of right now.  But it was a water bug.   I feel like I am forgetting something else but for the life of me I can't think what it would be. Now, neither of them have much time to enjoy the outdoors, but both still love it."},

I just couldn't wait any longer to post these.They are two of my husband's latest creations.  The one in the top two photos is for a good friend that he worked with for years.  This friend has not even seen it yet.  The friend did supply the deer antler for the handle.  He has had both the knives shown finished for a few days, but did the sheath for the top one day before yesterday.(Don't you just love those kitty paws in the photo above????)This knife in the bottom two photos was given to the son of another very good friend. Roger made the sheath while he and his dad were here visiting this evening and sent it home with him.  I didn't think to get a picture of the sheath but it was simple made like the one above.I really need to start laying a ruler by the knives or something till an idea of their size can be had.  The knife in the top photo is quite a bit bigger than the second knife.  I also need to develop all the views I want to take of the knives.  I tend to get a little bit excited about things and I end up forgetting something.Such as I wish I had taken a picture looking down the 'spine' of this...not sure what the correct term is.  Roger did some file work on the edge of the back of the blade--it was his first time trying that and it turned out rather well.  Just a little bit of cosmetic work.I know I am a little bit prejudiced, but all his friends tell him he should sell his knives...they offer to buy them.  I think it is amazing that he takes a flat piece of metal and makes a knife from start to finish.  He usually doodles and comes up with the shape of the knife on paper first.  He cuts the metal to shape himself, and does all the heat treating in his gas forge which he built himself, does all the sanding and grinding and buffing, makes the handles from whatever material.As I type this, I realize I know so little of the process itself...so I am going to have to start taking notes when he tells me stuff.  And maybe at some later date try to give a more accurate description of how he makes his knives."},

He was a very interesting guy to talk to...I cannot even remember all the jobs he has held.  But he had been a school teacher for one thing.  I assumed he had retired from that.Here is a view leading up to the house from the side...remember I told you I didn't get any actual pictures of the house itself.I seemed to get bits and pieces of it in my photos, just never got the house itself.  I took this one because of the ironwork...this was leading from the front where Lowell was getting ready to take us inside.....to the back porch which this is taken from.  That is Steele's studio we are looking at from here.The photos above and below are just what you look out on from different areas around the house...don't they look just so peaceful.  Makes you want to go take a walk and sit and rest a spell.And this is their final resting place.  He and his wife, and I think her sister, and two or three others were all cremated and their urns buried here, and the headstones set directly on top of the urn.I am adding this late...should have been my first comment.  Day4plus informed me that the plant/flowers shown yesterday was Hydrangea paniculata 'Grandifolia' or Peegee Hydrangea.  I am so glad she told me the name...I didn't think it was a snowball bush, but didn't really think for sure that it was a hydrangea.  I guess I have either never seen this variety or else never seen one when it got this big.  And Mary at Faith, Fabric and Photos had told me they were hydrangeas."},

Steele State Historic site.I do not  know what this is--is this a snowball bush?  Mom had one but I don't remember it ever having any hint of color.  I really can't remember much about it...it was not a favorite of mine.  However I loved this shown here...it was at the T. C. Steele State Historic site. Steele was an American impressionist painter who was born in Owen County, Indiana on a farm in 1847 and passed away at this historic site in 1926.I had heard the name before today, though I don't know where.  It just had that familiar sound.  So how did we arrive at this place?  We were going for a drive to what is commonly called Little Nashville, or for real Nashville, Indiana.  I was hoping for a nice leisurely drive, but everyone was in a hurry...it is a two lane road a big part of the way.  I seen a sign saying something about T. C. Steel  State Historic something or other...I told Roger to take it.We eventually came to the entrance shown in the top photo.  Who could resist entering through that?  T.C. Steele and his second wife bought this 200+acre farm...today it has their original home, his studio, their guest cottage, and her flower gardens.  I am sort of upset with myself.  The house--I did not get a picture of the house...and the house had a name....it is called The House of the Singing Winds.  Now tell me how I did not get a picture of it with a name like that?  So I foresee another trip down there.And I will probably post a few more pictures from there tomorrow.  It was just such an awesome thing to stumble on..."},

We were places that we didn't know where we were.  Oh, we knew we were in Illinois or Indiana, but to honestly be able to say go here and turn right and go so and so and turn right again--no, we didn't know that.  We did know if we headed east that we would eventually come to a road we recognized.  Thank God the sun was still shining to tell directions by, though I do have a compass in the car for just such times.The above is the first picture that I took...while my eyes were riveted on it, my husband was looking elsewhere.  He asked what this was....I told him I thought it was what my daddy used to call Wahoo...I seen it on another blog a bit back and got to looking for it on the web and found that it is also called the strawberry bush.I can remember the first time I ever seen it when I was probably 10 years old or so...I thought it such a different type of bush.  It was a little bit farther along than this...I know I broke off some and sped home with it to show my mom and dad.I must say that I still think it a pretty neat bush!As fall approaches, almost everywhere we go, we notice the Virginia creeper climbing trees.  I am always trying to capture its beauty, but feel the photos always fall just a little bit short of the actual beauty."},

My husband had a doctor's appointment in Terre Haute today...we were almost rendered speechless by some of the trees that were beyond description.  Just so glorious in their autumn colors.I don't know if it was my imagination or not, but it seemed to me that there was more color right along the highway than when looking farther off the road.  I really hope I can get time to go for a few drives over the next few days."},

It is beginning to look a lot like this around here right now.  I would love to have the time to just get out and drive all the back roads real slow.  I bet I could drive for days and not get my fill of the autumn colors.Now, to sort of change the subject...maybe even a couple times.  First of all, I wonder how everyone else keeps up with what photos they have posted on their blogs.  I know I can go and check the web albums, but that is slow going through all of them.  I am in the process of trying to make a numerical list of the images I have posted....but still not really satisfied.  I have the photos from the first 5 months or so, and have over a hundred photos.  And there were several days back then that I did not include photos.I just kind of wonder if I am going to wonder later what date I posted them on.  I think the last time I looked at my web albums of blog pictures that I had used over 500 photos...and that was at least a couple months ago, or more.  So, wondered what other people did, or if they do anything at all to keep track of their published pictures.  So, trying to go through and make this list has me on the weary side.Plus, today my younger daughter and I went to yard sales looking for baby stuff...we found a few things.  And I found my husband two new camo pants for hunting.  One of which was practically new...the other needs some repair but they are still in fair shape.  We were gone all day, with a little stop by her friends house...I got to see Noah for the first time.  He was born on my husbands birthday...and is adorable.  Just such a happy baby.  He has not reached the shy stage and was perfectly content for me to hold him.I seen two old singer sewing machines...one of which I would have liked to have but I need it about like I need another hole in the head.  I did not even ask the price of it.  And seen a lot of stuff I would have liked to go through, but we were on a mission to see what we could find for a baby.  The time is approaching faster now, and beginning to feel like things need to be done with the babe being due in February.And I have been trying to go through and pick out a new header picture/banner or whatever you call it, but instead put up an old one I have used before.  It is one of my favorite pictures, though.  And maybe some of you have not seen it.  So hope you enjoy it, even if you have seen it before.That is it for now..."},

Luckily I had taken a big ziploc bag and could put the camera in it.  We just left the woods...I didn't want to stay there till the rain really began...at least not with my camera.So instead we took a little drive that rambled around part of Parke County.  I first wanted my husband to point out the heron rookery to me.  But with the leaves still on the trees, we could not see them.  He showed me where it could be seen when the leaves are down so we will head back there then.So we just rambled around, I took a few pictures.  None are fantastic...for one thing it was so dark and dreary I had to set my ISO up to 1600 to be able to handhold.  And even then I did not have much depth of field.It didn't start to rain real steady till we headed home.  And it has been raining ever since.  Not a downpour or anything like that.  Just a solid, steady rain.  And it is just cool enough to make one not want to have to go outside in it.It is a good time to snuggle and get warm and read a book.

It was gorgeous....but then everything we saw, we thought that.  I would love to have an old truck like this...not sure if I would drive it or not.  I think I would though...why have it if you can't drive it.  Yet I know I would about die if someone hit it with a car door, or a shopping cart!I wish I had been thinking straight--I would have gotten the year of each car or truck.  I really don't know why I didn't think of it.I think you need to enlarge these to see the smoke rings.....I was standing a distance away and seen one of these rings but just thought it was just a fluke...something I would probably not see again if I waited a lifetime.We went on and seen the other cars and then eventually came back to see some of these old engines...this one used to run a whole machine shop.  And it was the one the smoke rings came from.  And they happened on a regular basis.I have got to get over the thing of being embarrassed to ask people to let me take their picture...the guy that owned this got to talking to my husband and they introduced themselves to each other.  And guess what?  One of his childhood friends was one of my husband's cousins.   I think a first cousin to his dad, or second cousin...isn't it amazing how small a world it really is.  Oh, and that is not all, this guy's wife--she had been married before and her husband had passed away....my husband also had met her first husband.  Small, small world.They said over a hundred thousand people came to this event;  the little saying about Newport itself is that it has a population of 700 when you count all the dogs and cats.   So imagine what an impact 100,000 people makes over 3 days.   But you know, small towns are great.The town I live in is bigger than Newport--I think its population is 5,000.  But it still has that small town, good neighbor feel.  Where else will the owner of the local hardware give you his cell phone number till you can reach him after he closes if you are desperate?  And he wouldn't charge extra either.Or take today...I stopped at the local IGA, forgot something and had to run back.  Of course, it was a beehive of activity by then.  I had to get in line behind people...well, there was a gentleman in front of me with one item, and in front of him was an elderly lady with several items.  The cashier finished with the customer she had, and she was just a sweetheart.  She came out around and told that lady that she would help her get her groceries out of her cart.When she finished their transaction she asked the lady if she needed help out to her car.  Just so considerate.  This particular cashier is a kid...she may be out of high school...but I don't think she is.  And that is just typical of the kids that work there...she is not the first I have seen just be so considerate of others.Wow!  That was not in the plans to write...I really didn't know what I was going to post.  I think as I age I am getting really sentimental and seeing kids be so nice really makes me feel good!"},

It takes place annually in Newport, Indiana and is sponsored by the Newport Lions Club the first weekend of October.  The first hill climb took place in 1909...can you imagine that?I hate to admit this, but we have lived here since our first child was about 5 months old and have never went.  I am here to tell you I got more than I expected!  There were dozens of beautiful old cars and trucks....all spic and span, with not a fingerprint to be seen anywhere.And shiny where it should be shiny...and overall just wonderful.  I am having a hard time picking out the words to describe it.Kind of the worst and best thing at the same time was the number of people...it was hard to get shots without someone in the way.  If I was bold, I would  have liked to ask some of them to stand posed, but I don't like my own picture taken so have a hard time asking others to do something I don't want to do myself.I had a feeling the gentleman in the red and white ball cap belonged with this truck.  Isn't it wonderful?  And some of them had that old vehicle smell...you don't normally think of that as a good smell, but it was today.And something I really enjoy is just looking inside the vehicles...the dashboards of the older cars is one of my favorite features and I an not even sure why.  Maybe they remind me of simpler times, or maybe it is just the way they are made.  They seem so clean-cut...bet you never thought you would hear that to describe a car dashboard, did ya?For a while now, I have been wanting to start photographing weeping willows. I just don't seem to see that many around here...oh, there are a few.  Just not a big number of them.Up north, I had ample opportunity though!  I honestly think there are a lot more up there.  Could it just be the distance that we traveled...possible.  Yet I don't remember noticing a lot of them till we got up to northern Indiana and from there on.I don't know why I like them so much, but I do.  These are a few of the ones I captured this time.I think at least one or two photos I have already posted from the trip had some weeping willows.And then there is this thing...not a weeping willow, but interesting anyway.  Does anyone have any idea why it would grow that ball at the top of the trunk.  We passed it so quick, I was lucky to make this capture.  I don't think there were any others like it, but not sure.  Roger didn't know what I was trying to capture till I downloaded the picture and showed him."},

Part of the walls of the fort are on a hill higher than the rest of the fort, and this is taken while walking up there.  I think I like it cause I am sort of on a level with them.  And I sort of like the motion the blur of the wings makes.This grasshopper was taken up on the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin...we were stopped at this little place created to pull of the road and view the lake...I spotted him and he let me get several pictures.And this turkey was also on that peninsula I think...I am lucky it is this good cause again I was in the car.And now this one is going across the upper Peninsula of Michigan I think...and it is blurry as were sooooo many of my pictures.  I took close to a thousand pictures, and at least 75% were from the car.  And so many of them are just a bit blurred...it is very hard not to not blur shots taken to the side....looking head-on through the front windshield is much better if the road isn't too rough."},

He really tries to keep up with Jeremy...if Jeremy is in the garage fooling with a car, Otto is perfectly content to go out there and just get in the car and wait.He also has this thing of seeing a squirrel or bird out in the yard.  He will spot it and do this exaggerated sneaking walk to within a few feet of bird or squirrel and then make a mad dash to try to catch it.  I have seen it once and cracked up laughing.  So far, any time he has met young children, his demeanor changes and he settles down and becomes very gentle.

These are from the trip...I almost wish I had asked to turn around and go back where I got the last photo shown.

I was lucky to get this of just one of them, but I will always wonder what the story behind the churches are."},
{"title": "Icebreaker Mackinaw", "date": "Saturday, September 27, 2008", "text": "This is the Icebreaker Mackinaw, decommissioned in 2006.  It has a length of 290 feet with the lower hull being constructed of steel plates 1 5/8 inch thick, and steel beams being 16 inches apart...just like the studs in our homes.  Instead of cutting through the ice as we normally think of, it is made to be propelled up on the ice and the weight of the Mackinaw breaks the ice.It can carry 46,910 gallons of diesel fuel, has 6 huge diesel engines that provide the electrical power to turn two 14-foot diameter stern propellers.  It also has a brow propeller that is 12-foot, weighs 7.2 ton...it first draws the water from beneath the ice ahead, which weakens it...thus sagging under its own weight..and it sends water back along both sides of the hull reducing ice friction."},

I just love this one...not sure why.  It is another one from Illinois....as are all the others.Fields were/are starting to be harvested.  We seen this plume of 'smoke' off in the distance, only when we got closer we found that it was dust from this combine.I may have found a new thing to photograph...grain elevators.  I wished I  had counted how many we seen....And got to photograph a corn crib...And this picture just makes me smile to look at with all those birds on top.I have been busy today doing laundry and I mowed most of the yard.  And I  made a big pot of chili which I will probably be mine alone.  Other than the one bowl Roger ate, that is.  I wanted to make chili before we left, but no one else wanted any.  So all the time we were gone, I craved chili.  I did have a bowl at one place that tasted a lot like my own...it was good.  There was just not enough of it...when I crave chili or vegetable soup, I make a pot and eat on it all day long.  I told Roger it was the first thing I made when I got home, but it was actually the second, because I did fix a bite of breakfast this morn."},
{"title": "Home at last!", "date": "Thursday, September 25, 2008", "text": "We headed home yesterday, the long way round so to speak.  We headed west across Wisconsin because we just wanted to see the countryside one more time.  I would love to know how many barns are in that state!  There were times when I could not see all that were visible...there were times when there were just too many to see while driving.  I took 281 pictures yesterday, many of which has reflections in them or the windows so bug splattered that I don't know if I will ever get them clean enough to use on here.  But I will still enjoy looking at them for the memories.We came across and hit the Mississippi River right below Eau Claire, Wisconsin and followed it down into Illinois a ways.  I do not have one decent shot of it because the sun was just at the right height and we were there at the wrong time.  It was still fun to see, though.  We did not cross it;  both of us were just ready to head for home.These are a few scenes from the drive...I love that vine covered silo or crib or whatever it was.  It was in Wisconsin.  The others I am  not to sure where they were...I think Illinois.  the northwest corner is so beautiful--big wide valleys with rolling hills.  It felt like you could see forever.  And there were a few places that really looked and felt like Eastern Tennessee.We ended up in a run-down motel last night...I will leave the rest to your imagination.  I would have taken over the driving, but that would not have did much good.  We were out in the middle of no where, with no major road to get on and just go...we both had to be awake for one to navigate and the other to drive.  I guess I should put a GPS navigation thing on my Christmas wish list!I am so weary...I am stopping on this now.  It may take me a day or two to get back to normal.  But I will catch up with everyone."},

I read it's name, but think it left my mind the minute I read it.  I haven't a clue to what church this is.And this house below was not too far from the above church...we passed by it so quick I was amazed I got even this shot of it.  I do not know if it was a private house, or if it was used for a business.We were driving up to the tip of Door Peninsula...we explored a couple of side rows, and this is the scene that met my eye as we were approaching Lake Michigan....believe me, this picture does not do it justice.And I just had to add a little more fall color!  Right here in Green Bay, the city itself, there doesn't seem to be quite as much color as there was up on this peninsula or as much as in norther Michigan.The two photos below are on the main road to the tip of the peninsula...taken through the windshield of course.  I tried to clean them up a little with Photoshop but could have did a better job if I had been in the comfort of my own home.  At least I think I could have.Take a close look at the silos!  There were a lot of them made this way on our drive.  I have never seen any like these that I remember.And here are a couple of barns...I think I could spend a year on the peninsula alone and be lucky if I got all the barns photographed.  I have been in Wisconsin before and I remembered liking the barns, but I did not remember there being so many of them.  And they are all so unique.  I really wish I had at least a month up here to just roam around at my leisure taking photos.I didn't even attempt to take any pictures of the orchards we seen.  Just no opportunity for even a half decent shot....I am pretty sure there was one peach orchard, and then there was another orchard that I think had hundreds of young trees that might have been cherries.  And we seen some apple trees as well.That is all for now...I hope I am able to connect to the internet tomorrow night but I have no idea where I will be.  We are heading over towards Minnesota tomorrow..we may stop at the Mississippi River though and head south.  Not sure.  We are both getting weary.My Cougar kitty got hurt the other night, but it doesn't seem to be serious.  Just a small gash near his nose, he was bleeding, but doesn't seem to hurt otherwise.  I know it is silly to be so attached to a cat, but I am not sure how I would handle it if anything happened to him."},
{"title": "Autumn is flying her colors!", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "text": "We crossed this bridge this morn.  It is the Mackinac Bridge....I did not realize it until my best friend/sister-in-law mentioned it that it is 5 miles long.  I knew it was long but had not really estimated it.  It was opened November 1, 1957....the height of the main towers above water is 552 feet.  The total length of wire in the main cable is 42,000 miles!  Hard to imagine.  But if you want to read these and more figures, go Here.Most of the drive today was along a road which at times had Lake Michigan on one side and woods on the other.  The closer we are to the lake, it seems the more cedar and pine trees there are with just a few hardwoods thrown in.  All the dead trees are some kind of pine or softwoods.  The day was overcast a big part of the day, with a slight haze to it a big part of the time.My pictures aren't the greatest but maybe you can still get a feel for what it is like.  We are now in Green Bay, and it is quite a bit warmer than it was in Michigan.  One of the highways we came in to Green Bay on is being widened, and where we could see the soil, it looked like good, rich loam...the kind you would like to have for a garden.  The kind that is pure joy to dig into.And there were these...I have had no opportunity to get a really good picture of them...we saw so many going into Mackinaw City the day we arrived but we were on the interstate, so no stopping there.  I got this today from the car, but I still like it.  I think they are paper birch, but not positive.  A lot we seen over in Michigan had yellow leaves.I just had to throw this one in simply because I like it...I would love to know what it was/is used for with that chimney.  I wondered if the chimney was for a forge or something.That is about it for tonight.  I don't know why, but I had a hard time connecting.  But now that I am connected, things seem  to work fine."},

I did not get any more pictures because we went up to the Fort Mackinac and spent almost the entire day there.Trinity Church was right near the entrance to the fort...I took pictures from street level as well as from up at the fort.There was another church I seen in the distance but did not get to visit because we were running out of steam...."},

As we were leaving the area I glanced up and what did I see?  And eagle!  I could hardly believe my eyes, but if you enlarge this you can see its white head.  It was just so awesome.We toured the ship and then took off on a rambling drive.  I first heard the geese, then finally spotted them.  I only had one good shot of them before they disappeared again behind trees. The gulls were walking along the edge of the water at this public beach area that is out away from town.  This is the first picture I took of these two and did not realize till I downloaded it that I had caught them both preening themselves.This was on farther down the road...we came around a slight curve in the road, and there it was.  I was so thankful that there was no traffic behind us!  We pulled over and I got out to try to compose a few pictures...these were my favorite two from there.I sort of like the name--Just a Plain Farm.That is all for tonight...I want to touch base with a couple of my childhood friends  and then settle down for the night."},

We left before daylight this morn, and I was hoping to see a wonderful display.  Little did I dream of what a display of color I would see.  It was very frustrating though, to be traveling and not able to stop and take my time composing some shots.  But see that dark streak in the sky on the right side starting at the trees--that was actually there; we do not know what caused it.  Just wanted you to know it wasn't my camera or me....All of these were taking while traveling the back roads of Indiana and Michigan...I know the sunrise shot was taken in Indiana, and the second shot in Michigan.  But as for the barns, I am not sure which were taken where.  I don't think they are too bad considering we were going 60 mph almost every time I tried to take a picture.  As you can imagine, there are some that are not suitable for publishing, though I think I will use a few for Paintbox Pictures.These are just a forerunner of what I hope is to come.  I have several from this morn that is going to be for Sky Watch Friday the next time I am lucky enough to participate...which will hopefully be next week.  And I have even more barn shots.  I would have never made it this far had I allowed myself to stop and take pictures.  I seen so many awesome barns that I could spend the next month taking pictures of nothing but barns.And on up here in Michigan in some spots, there is much more color to the trees.  They were too beautiful for words.  With them and the fields being ready to harvest, and just the fall feel to the day--it made me feel like I was part of the autumn glow or something.  I don't think I have ever had so much fun traveling....but for now my bottom is sore from sitting so long.  My husband is done asleep...I need to get some sleep myself, but have a photo I want to post to The World in Black and White before I get ready for bed."},

I hope that link works...Anyway, the road led back to this area...I am sure I have some other pictures of it somewhere but I just can't find them right now.  Big cliffs were there on either side, and a small creek ran through the valley.  We would take hot dogs, smoked sausages, or whatever we had to roast over the fire.  I will tell you right here and now there is nothing better than a piece of ham speared on a stick and held over an open fire.  It is simply delicious.  Add chips and a coke and you have a meal fit for a king in my opinion.The kids would play in the creek, or swing on a big rope swing that used to be there.  My husband usually took some kind of firearm to target shoot a little.  I took books to read and hand sewing.  But sometimes I just hunted ginseng, if it was late enough in the fall.  We now have a season on it...when I was a kid you could hunt it all summer long.And this old outhouse was there....what other convenience could you ask for.

We want to go north, so want to go before too much later.Anyway, I spent some time on here checking about hotels, did some calling, and in the end we are heading to Mackinaw City towards the end of the week.  I am planning on taking this laptop so if all goes well, I won't miss too many posts.I was going through the photos on here and kept coming across things and messing with them for Paintbox Pictures.   I finally decided it would be easier to scan some of my slides.  It is a good thing most things are made idiot proof these days...I kept trying to scan the slides and it kept telling me...well, I can't remember the words but basically that something was set wrong and the driver was going to close down.  I finally thought and opened the scanner.  I had it set up for documents!Anyway, these are some of the first slides I opened....they are from July of 1994.  It is the one and only year that we had an apple crop failure in all the years I worked at the orchard.  This is a farm not too far from the apple orchard.  Or maybe I should say farms...the one that is just a field of wheat is out there but it is not the one being harvested.  I sat and watched the one being harvested and on the other side of the road were the cows watching me watch the farmer."},

We were on  a road on top of the damn, with the water being to one side and the vultures the other.But back to the drive, I have went this road one other time that is a different way to get to Mansfield, Indiana but it has been years.  This barn was almost at the very edge of the road.  Surrounded by bushes and trees.  These really don't portray the feeling it gave me, but that is hard to capture. We were talking and I was wondering what it had been for, and Roger pointed out that probably when it was built it was built to hold a lot of hay.It just takes me back to another time when I see old barns such as this.  Just think about what a job it was to build.  Transporting the lumber would have probably been a big job...and it just the beginning.  I wonder if the owner built it himself, maybe with the help of family, or did neighbors pitch in and help.  Right now where it is located, there sure are not very many neighbors.  And I always wonder how they did such a good job with the limited tools they had."},

But in our round about way of going there, we took this little side road.  It came to an end at this cemetery...it didn't have a name that we seen.  We got out to look around a little and these are some of the first headstones I looked at.  Click on the pictures and enlarge them...then see if you even begin to imagine what the mom/dad must have felt.  There were several Kempers buried here, so I wondered were the young ones from only one family....either way I cannot imagine losing a single child, let alone two....or three or four.  Even if they were just cousings, that would be a lot within a family.There are a lot of times I feel like I would have liked to live at an earlier time, but I almost always state that the one thing I would not want to give up is our medical advantages.  Then to see little children's headstones only re-enforces that feeling.That is about it for now...I will have more from this drive over the next few days, and am even contemplating a Buzzards and Blue Skies for Sky Watch Friday--not very pretty I am afraid.  And a lot of my shots were blurred, but a few are keepers.I am sure I have passed these before, but I sure don't remember them.  They are about 5 minutes from my house.

{"title": "From last weekend....", "date": "Saturday, September 6, 2008", "text": "Last weekend my daughter and I headed out to hit a couple antique/used furniture places.  The first thing we seen a baby bed at a yard sale here in town.  Being that I will become a grandma next year, I have wanted to get things to have here for the baby...and a baby bed is among the things wanted.  Rachel spotted it, and told me to go around the block.  It was a solid wood, very well made...still sturdy after going through 4 babies...and they only wanted $30 for it and also the mattress.  I had been thinking depending on where/what I found that I might end up buying a new mattress.  I don't think I will have to now..this was a local couple that don't live that far from me....heck, if you live in Clinton, you are not far from each other even if you live at the opposite ends of the town.I came home and got the truck to go back and get it...and even though it was just a babybed the mom insisted that her husband and buddy load it, which we appreciated.  We came home and unloaded it, and Rachel asked if I was sure that I didn't want to take the truck....I didn't.  So we got back in my Rav4 and headed to the nearby town of Rockville, where we went to antique/used furniture places.  We didn't see a thing there that we really wanted.When she got her divorce, she had a big black lab that she had to find a home for.  And by big, I do mean bigger than the average lab--he was her dog, about a year old at the time.  He could not come here because he would have just been to rough for our old dog.  So a friend of her sister's took him.  We didn't really know where the guy lived, but in one of my drives to go see my sister, I seen this dog and I just knew it was him.  You just don't see labs like him every day...so on the way home I was able to see the name of the mailbox and it was the name of the people who got him.My daughter wanted me to take her on to show her where he lived, and since we were already half way there I did.  And being that we were that far north, I thought I might as well go on and visit one of the covered bridges.  But there were so many canoes there that I didn't want to stop.  We thought we might as well continue on the backroad and see where it led...Out in the middle of nowhere we seen a sign for antiques and used furniture...down this dusty gravel lane was a big barn...not the one picture but it was that color red.  And the barn pictured was the actual barn of this place.Inside was used furniture and antiques, and some junk.  It was owned by the Amish...furniture, etc. was on the ground floor and upstairs was more furniture and books.  We only bought one thing, but if I had had the truck there was a china cabinet that I would have been very tempted to get.  and Rachel seen a an old dining table, maybe not quite an antique, but still well used.  But it is more than she really needs right now, but I don't think she will soon forget it.  It just had that well worn, well loved look and feel to it.  And had enough extensions to make a huge table.But back to the barn.  It was built till the level we pulled up to was ground level for us, but it was built into a hill side and had a level below us that the people lived in.  She had all kinds of hummingbird feeders and all kinds of humming birds were buzzing around.  I would never have known any of this if I hadn't happened to glance out a window and seen it.Anyway, the images above are from that place...I ask if she minded if I took pictures around and she said no.  I wanted a picture of the antique place itself but her little children came outside to watch me...and I know they are not supposed to like their pictures taken so I just felt I shouldn't.Edited to add:  I do not know why the pictures are cropped in the collage...I did it with Picasa and have never had this happen before.  It still gives a feel for the place though."},

I would love to know the history of this old barn...it almost looks like it has been part house...I don't know that I have ever seen that before but look at the bricks and look at the windows upstairs.  I bet that this was a well loved place at some time in its life.Coming from tobacco raising country, I always wonder what kind of life the barns up here have seen...what they were used for, did kids play in them, was there a house near at some time or other.  I always think a house should be near, but that just isn't the way it is anywhere.  In fact, I think probably people did not want to be near the barns.  I could see why if it was a pig farm, but I love the smell of a cow/horse barn."},

We were out in the country and grasshoppers were everywhere.  That is until I would try to get close to one, and it was as if they would disappear from the face of the earth.  So I would focus on something else, and soon I would notice the hoppers being around again.  Still no luck.After one such stop, I got in the Rav and got buckled in only to notice this fellow on the windshield.  I took a picture or two, and we continued on.  He stayed with us.  For several miles in fact.  I finally thought to get this close-up before I buckled in on one of the stops.  I think he flew away before we stopped again.As for the top two photos, we pulled up to a stop sign and Roger says look; at the base of the stop sign someone had planted these hollyhocks.  Even though it was the middle of the day, they made for some fair shots."},

The gentian's bluest fringes                       Are curling in the sun;                       In dusty pods the milkweed                       Its hidden silk has spun.                                         The sedges flaunt their harvest,                       In every meadow nook;                       And asters by the brook-side                       Make asters in the brook.                                         From dewy lanes at morning                       The grapes' sweet odors rise;                       At noon the roads all flutter                       With yellow butterflies.                                         By all these lovely tokens                       September days are here,                       With summer's best of weather,                       And autumn's best of cheer.

I think it is the Bronze Copper, as seen here, but not real sure.  If any of you have any other ideas as to what it is, feel free to tell me in the comment section.  I also wondered if any of you noticed the Junebug in the fifth photo down from the top yesterday.  I did not notice it at all when I took the picture, and I think it was the second or third time I viewed it on my computer before I noticed it myself.  If I had noticed it when I was taking the photo I would have gotten a better one of it.It took a while to find what one of  today's entries is, but as you can see by the title of the post I got it figured out.  I thought that I came up with a clever title for the post;-)  Of the butterflies there, the Painted Ladies seen in the first photos seemed to be the least bothered by my presence.  I have been trying for at least a month, if  not longer to get some half way decent shots of butterflies in general.  I do not know what the difference was out there, but after I would get out of the car for a little while, they seemed to accept my presence.  All except the Buckeye, and I honestly think there might have only been one of those.  There were several of the Monarchs and even more of the Painted Ladies.I thought the butterflies with its wings together was a Red Admiral but I am wrong....I am correcting this on this late date of October 12--but better late than never.There honestly was a different butterfly there, but these are just painted ladies..  I made the discovery when I was visiting The EG Tour Guide earlier..from there I did a google search and was even more sure I was wrong."},

I just don't remember ever seeing one this orangy-yellow with the black dots. Of course, I am so forgetful that it is possible I have seen one. Anyway, this is one of two pictures I got of him--the other is not even as good as this...................Then there were the monarchs. I just could not make up my mind which others to post of them.

I have been having some issues with noise in my photos and been trying to solve that mystery.  Although most were taken at high ISOs which would cause it, I have a few that were taken at the lowest ISO.  Anyway, due to messing with that I have not visited and commented on any blogs, but will get back to that shortly.  I have decided to try to sit back and see how the next few shooting sessions pan out.  I really think if there was something wrong with my camera/equipment that I would not have got the good photos that I did today.I went on a mission this morn to take more photos and came home after taken 107 in about 2 hours.  I ended up heading to one of my two favorite places to skywatch;  I almost did not make it to those places...the road pictured could have been name Butterfly Boulevard just as easily as Insect Alley...or even Bee Street.  I chose Insect Alley to cover them all.  Today was one of the best shooting days I have ever had for butterflies...I did see a Buckeye that I could not get to capture.  However, I did get lots of monarchs and another that I do not know the name of...as well as this one little one I will show you sometime in the next week that I have never seen before.I do plan to do Sky Watch so it will probably be Saturday when I start back with the butterflies.

{"title": "A stroll through the orchard", "date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2008", "text": "I had opportunity to go through the orchard that I spent so many years at;  so many happy hours.  I was asked to give my former boss's spouse a ride to the doctor, so soon as we got back to the orchard, I took off to see what I could see.The first thing I saw was a deer taking off at the other end of a row of trees.  So quick I did not see if it had antlers or not.  And when I got to that end of the orchard, I saw a flock of turkeys.  I actually wondered was it a mom and her almost grown babies.  I was too far away to take good pictures, and by the time I got closer, they were long gone.It was the middle of the day--sure not a good time for taking pictures but I snapped a few anyway.  The orchard has been sprayed not too long back--you can see it clearly on the apples.  I hope I can make it out there at a more opportune time before the fall is over.Visiting out there sure made me miss the good old days.  The original boss I had was so much fun to work for and with.  The song that I have playing sure makes me think of when I first worked there.  We didn't eat out under a maple, but we did sit around the dinner table and he would tell us tales of their childhood.  As well as tales of when he was an insurance man.I bet it is one of the only jobs where anyone would ever come home sick from laughing so hard.  When I first started working there is when his youngest son got married.  The girl he married and I have been friends from the moment we seen each other.  Even though they lived in another state, she used to come home in the fall and spend it helping them grade apples.  And later it got till she would come for different periods of time at different times of the year.Well, he would have us as an audience when we were working around the grading room, or greenhouse, etc....jobs where you could carry on a conversation.   And he would get us laughing till we could not do much work...and there was a time or two where I became physically sick from laughing so hard:  headache and stomach ache.  And yes I remember the stories but I just cannot tell them the way he could.  And his wife would add comments to the tales to elaborate on some of the details.This is just part of what I miss...he is gone now.  Passed away after I quit, but he had had a stroke in 2001 and not been able to talk since.  There are times though that I can just hear him making one of his witty comments...he would always say, \"You could be more like me if you tried\" or some such nonsense.   Oh, and if I or anyone mentioned having a headache he would always tell us that if he had a head like ours his would hurt, too.I will close now...the song that is playing just always makes me think of him and his wife....and the old John Deere tractor.I also got this fellow last night...my husband spotted him.  Looks like he has had a pretty rough life.We went out to my usual place to watch the sun set tonight...There is a drainage ditch on one side that is dry so I got down in it walking along to see what I could see.  I seen a very small frog, but it hopped into the weeds and disappeared  with one jump.  However, I did find some luck, at least according to superstitions.  I think the luck is in finding a four-leaf clover.  I used to always find them when walking through the orchard, but these are the first I have found in a long time.  And I found the 5 leafed ones in the same clump of clover."},
{"title": "A hunting story....", "date": "Sunday, August 24, 2008", "text": "(This is my second post for today--the other one has pictures.)Abraham Lincoln of the  Brookville Daily Photo  wrote a story about one of his hunting excursions.  Being the wife of a hunter and sister to hunters before that, I could identify with a lot he said.  About 5:00 being the witching hour for hunters, or for my husband when he is meeting fellow hunters it is sometimes even earlier.  Also, unlike rotten apples to disguise the human smell, hunters now have doe urine.  I wouldn't want to mistake that for my perfume, now would I, but that is besides the point.This is a story of one of my husband's hunting trips.  A few years ago he decided to hunt out on  property near the orchard where I worked.  It actually belonged to the brother of my boss.  A day or two before the planned hunting trip, he and his buddy went out to decide where they were going to put their tree stands, and in so doing had to hack out a path through some of the undergrowth.On the morning of the hunt, they met here before going out there...it is at the  most 10 minutes from here.  They get out of the truck out there and the farm cat greets them.  It is young, not even a year old.  Roger pets it just a second and he and his buddy proceed down the path...they get to the  'y' in the path and his buddy goes one way while he goes they other.  The cat follows my husband.He is hunting with bow and arrows, and hunting from a climbing tree stand.  So he gets to the tree he has chosen to use, and gets his tree stand situated on it and climbs up the tree.  I am not familiar enough with the process to paint a good picture, but it is a tree stand that he does the physical climbing with.  It has two parts....one part is the actual seat and the other is the part he stands on....THIS is a video from you tube and does show how his works.When climbing up to a tree stand, he always ties his bow to a long rope and once he gets up as high as he is going to go, he pulls the bow up with the rope.  He gets up and gets situated...he hears this meow.  It is still practically dark, so he kind of looks but doesn't see anything.  He sits back, and he hears it again!  And he can hear it so plain...he does not have the best of hearing.  So he gets his flashlight out and bends way over the tree stand while shining it all around and still doesn't see anything.He sits back again and hears it again!  And he felt something on his legs...he looks down at his feet and there sits the kitty!  It had sat by his feet as he climbed up the tree.  It proceeded to climb up into his arms, purring all the while, and doing the rubbing thing that cats do when they are happy to see you.  He held it out at arm's length and dropped it!Did it run for home you might ask.  The answer would be no.  It played around the bottom of the tree my husband was in, chasing leaves or anything else that caught it's imagination.  After a while of playing, it climbed out onto a dead log and went to sleep!This is an honest tale; I don't have the imagination to make something like this up.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg--things like this continually happen to my husband, my older daughter, and my husband's cousin.I tried to get some new photos of the cats the other day, but needless to say they did not cooperate. I do sort of like these....they were out having fun. The collage is from when they were young, followed by Bubbie who is my daughter's cat. He is all about having fun--he likes to play tag/chase through the house. We beat his bottom and take off running and he chase after us. We try to tag him when he sees us but he takes off like a streak of lightening. And so we go till one of us is breathless.The next in photos is my baby, Cougar, jr. I do not know why, unless it is that he reminds me of my first Cougar but he just totally owns my heart. I am not even sure what it is about him that reminds me of Cougar unless it is the fact that he likes tomatoes, and the first time or two I fixed chili or vegetable soup, he came running. My original Cougar loved anything with tomato flavor.In the next two comes little sister, PussPuss. She and Cougar are still best of buddies. They don't sleep together as much as they used to, but I think that might be due to it being summer. My husband is still probably her favorite person.Unlike any other cats I have ever had, these come only when I call and they think it involves food! I still have trouble getting used to this part. My original Cougar came from anywhere when I called his name...he knew the meaning of 'no' and 'get down' to name a few. These cats all look at me as if to say, 'you can't be talking to me' if they even bother to look my way."},

Though I really don't think I could find it again.  There is just something about it that I really, really like.  And I wish I could find it again.  I would love to see it in the snow.  I would also like to know if this was a cattle farm at one time; if you look at the weather vane you will see that it has a cow on top of it. I don't think it was this barn, not even sure it was this day, but I think it was...I was out taking a picture and Roger told me to watch out for the dog.  It was a huge Great Dane...and he would have gotten in the car with us.  So far in my adventures I have only had friendly meetings with dogs.  Last winter, I was out and didn't even think the house I was near was lived in.  I was not paying attention and suddenly realized I had a dog at my side at which time I started talking to him only to have two or three more surround me and all were wanting to be petted.Oh, this reminds me of one day at work a few years ago.  For some reason I had to leave early.  I went to get in my truck and there is this strange dog there...I spoke to it and went on.  Soon as I opened my door, up in the truck he hopped!  I went over to the other side to get him out....he jumped back behind the seats.  (We had an extended cap with the little jump seats behind the seat.)  I had to go get help to be able to get him out and keep him out till I could get in and leave.  I always swear I am going to start carrying dog treats with me.  One of our Fed Ex men carries treats with him for the dogs he meets on his rounds.  I used to always carry some in the car when I worked cause I always took something to the dog out there...I had known him from a pup and always liked to spoil him a little."},

The road ran between two cornfields, and along the edge of the road was some clover and other weeds and grass of course.  There were all kinds of these butterflies, but this was the best I could do at capturing them. Even the grasshoppers did not want to cooperate...they would try to stay on the back side of weeds and grass to hide from me.   I finally managed this shot and the first thought that ran through my head was can you see me now--a little license with the the commercial for Verizon cell phone service that says 'can you hear me now?'

By 10:00a.m I had been to Walmart, mainly to pick up cat and dog food, and just a few more items, stopped by the post office to pick up a priority mail box and the form you fill out when sending stuff to our soldiers.  Actually it is probably for all things shipped out of our country...too tired to think of the right word for it but I do know it.Anyway, I stopped and picked it up on the way home from Walmart, came home and filled it and got it ready to mail, took it back to the post office to send it to JT in Iraq.  From there I went to the grocery for a few things.  Came home and moved clothes from washer to dryer...and that all before 10 o'clock.  I took a little break before making the recovery disks for this computer.  I was so glad I had picked up some dvds a week or two ago...it only took 2 of those but would have taken 16 cds...Besides that I did another load of clothes and hung them on the line, fixed supper, and I got the form to fill our for jury duty.  I have been on a jury a couple times....but haven't been chosen since the 80's, even though I have had to fill out that paper several times.I really will be glad to get everything squared away on here.  I have yet to get my photos and music loaded on here.  Plus a few documents that I don't want to lose.  I did go down to the junk store as we call it and look for some small table to put this on but no luck.  I  had searched on line and cannot find anything that I think will suit me in height, etc.  I will go look in  person one of these days...I also want it to be big enough to set my scanner on.  It will work better/faster with this computer.For right now though, I am closing down for the night.  I think the local news is  coming on.

And what is more, on the way there we saw a maple tree with some spots of color on it!I want you to know that I am back in business--I hope for good. I have a new HP laptop with a 17 inch screen, and after taking the router back to Office Max and them just switching mine out for a new one, I finally got the router installed. Not without mistakes on my part, but considering that I only slept about three hours last night, I am not complaining..........This morn I told Roger that I just thought the cable was bad or something wrong with the router...last night the ethernet light on my modem would not stay lit up--it continually blinked off and on. I finally timed it just right and was able to connect to the internet one time. So, he actually listened to me, and him being the way he is, he went and got a flashlight and a loupe and started examining it. And he could see where there was an actual 'mistake' in how it was made. It is almost impossible to explain...lets just say he insisted on taking it back to Office Max and all the time I am thinking they won't let us return it........We ask for the manager first thing, the manager looked and he could see what we were talking about. He went and got a new one, and he told me he was going to take it out and compare it to the one we brought and I was so glad...if he hadn't I would have before we left the parking lot. But it was manufactured with no mistakes.........My younger daughter and her husband were having drain/sewer problems. So this afternoon Jeremy went and rented a big rotor rooter, and we went down to their house. Roger helped him get it down in the basement, and the work began. He and Jeremy fed the line into the sewer pipe and I ran the control. I am so relieved...we got out several big gobs of roots...I don't even remember how many times we ran the line, but the last one it fed through fairly easy and came back clean. So now I feel like that that is taken care of for good....or at least for a few months. But they will get the root killer and use it so it really should be done with.........On the way there I got so excited to see a few leaves getting color...I could spend hours and hours driving in the fall. And as I sat outside tonight talking to my brother, Neal, the sounds of fall were all around me with all the bugs that were 'singing'....So, I go get my new computer today...and I get a wireless router.  I cannot get the wireless router to work for love nor money.  I tried and retried on my own....then called tech support and just wanted to pull his hair out as well as my own.  I finally just hung up.  Tomorrow if I stay home, I am calling and trying to get someone that understands me as well as me understanding them.  And just start over.For a while I could not even get back on here the normal way and was just getting ready to call my isp provider when I thought I would try it again and I was able to get on.  I don't even necessarily think it is the router...this Dell computer has always been such a problem any time I wanted to do anything.  And it was a higher end computer.So wish me luck tomorrow!"},

I just hope I make a sensible decision when I do get one.I am not sure how often I will post for the next bit...but I find myself with a little bit of time here and there.  I am in the process of trying to decide on what kind of laptop to purchase so if you have one that you are really pleased with, feel free to tell me in the comment section.  Or if you know a good graphics card, I wuld be happy to know that.  This computer slows down soooo much when I am in the mood to play with my photos--trying different filters, etc.I have had some kind of flu or allergies that have really had me down physically--just slowed me down so bad.  Then there are three of us trying to use one computer so I am either going to just post when I find a minute or else try to develope some new habbits.Anyway, some of you may recognize these photos from my other blog...I am going to put my favorites from it on here because I think they are worthy of a bigger audience than it had.  So click and enlarge and I hope you enjoy them."},

But I still sort of like them. they are from Mar of 95, though I accidentially saved one as March 96. I will have to remember to correct that.The first one is not a fire or anything, it is just late evening and the mist starting to rise. I love to witness this, but have never got any good pictures of it.The next two are sunsets, with the last being a double exposure. But I cannot remember where I was. Maybe I will play with it in the photosoftware and see if I can come up with something for Paintbox Pictures.Otherwise, I have not done much today. Fixed a big pan of chicken stir-fry for us to have...and late this evening we went and got our trailer and headed over to Brazil (in Indiana, of course) to look at a couch and chair for Rachel. An individual had them for sell...I would not have carried them home had she given them to us. She was asking $100 for the loveseat, chair and ottoman. They were in horrible shape. I am sure I missed some because I seen enough early on that we didn't want to spend anything on them. The cushions had patches in several places and there were holes where the fabric had just worn totally through. And the chair arm and ottoman had definitely been worked on by a cat. Just thread pulled every where.I would be about ashamed to set something out like that for free, much less ask for money for it. With the looking we have done for stuff for her, I have come to the conclusion that I am crazy for throwing anything away. Someone will always want it. Which, we do put things out and put a sign on them that says 'Free.' Usually, even though the sign is on them, people will come to the door to make sure it is free."},

So thought I would go ahead and post it.   I really love finding a new round barn--well new to me.Round barns were supposed to cost less than a four sided barn to construct for the same amount of space....and were supposed to withstand the storms of the  midwest better than a rectangular construction.  At the time they were being promoted, they were said to be more efficient than a regular barn.I love seeing them and hate how many have been destroyed or razed....but I suppose they really aren't efficient now.  And maybe they are super expensive to roof.******On to other things for just a minute.  My older daughter is trying to get stuff together one more time for her own household.  We have spent the weekend shopping/checking out new and used furniture, kitchen stuff.  She is quickly getting stuff together.   It just makes me sick to think how she worked before and bought all new stuff....and now is having to do it again.  She is hoping to be ready to move back on her own by the end of the year or first of next year.  She just has to get all her ducks in a row, so to speak.Anyway, we have been to the outlet malls in Tuscola, IL several times, and today I made a distinct effort to watch in the distance and I really think I spotted another round barn on the way home.  We were all too tired to go find it, but I bet I am over there in the next month sometime checking it out.  Hopefully sooner.I was quite surprised when I found the photo of the writing spider in action...most of the slides that I come across, I don't remember taking.  There are a few that bring back vivid memories, but even those are more of the emotions of the moment rather than remembering exactly when or where. From what someone else told me on another post, what we always called a writing spider is actually an orb spider.  Very harmless, except to the victims that get caught in its web."},

I really have no idea where, except they are in Indiana.  I just love fall...the only thing about it is I know that cold weather is not far behind.I am late posting today because I spent the night with my younger daughter last night.  We talked till midnight....just about life.  And we laughed.  At Otto, her Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  He is a nutcase--just totally lovable.  He just cannot contain the joy he feels when they have company.  And his tail about beats you to death it wags so fast and furious.I was up before her and took him outside.  She has a concrete bench...one of his loves is for someone to sit on it with him.  So I sat down, and he came and climbed up beside me...I asked him to sit down instead of stand, and he did.  Not so much proudly, but just happy to have someone with him.  He watched everything that moved, and would just sniff the air to see what he could smell.  Just totally content.As we were sitting there I was noticing the leaves on the ground from her crab apple tree, and it got me to thinking that fall is approaching.  I am hoping for colorful trees and crisp, clear days, with some sunshine mixed in.  And I hope you enjoy the little previews of what I hope is to come."},

{"title": "The Day is Done", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2008", "text": "I spent some time scanning in a few more slides today...I came across this one just as I finished a book by Jo Anna Hold Watson titled A Taste of the Sweet Apple. Sweet Apple being tobacco...actually a brand of chewing tobacco. It is her memories of growing up on a farm in Kentucky....her dad was a doctor who had a farm which was run by a black foreman. She went with the foreman everywhere...and she idolized him. She tells about the first time she road the tobacco setter, about the first time she drove the John Deere, and takes you through the death of her dad and mom and Joe, the foreman.Well the book got me in a sort of homesick mood...Kentucky is right next door to Tennessee. We raised tobacco, so I was familiar with a lot of what she talked about. Then I came across this photo and it made me think of fall and the plants eventually starting to change color, only to eventually lose it all. And just the whole mood I was in made me think of this poem by Henry W. Longfellow. It is a favorite of mine and my sister-in-law....in fact she knew the lines of the last stanza and it sounded vaguely familiar to me but I don't know if I would have ever thought of it again. So she mentioned it and we got to searching and found the whole poem. I don't know much about copyright but since I see it all over the place on the web, I really hope it is okay to post it. (Check out the altered version of this photo at Paintbox Pictures.)The Day is DoneThe day is done, and the darknessFalls from the wings of Night,As a feather is wafted downwardFrom an eagle in his flight.I see the lights of the villageGleam through the rain and the mist,And a feeling of sadness comes o'er meThat my soul cannot resist:A feeling of sadness and longing,That is not akin to pain,And resembles sorrow onlyAs the mist resembles the rain.Come, read to me some poem,Some simple and heartfelt lay,That shall soothe this restless feeling,And banish the thoughts of day.Not from the grand old masters,Not from the bards sublime,Whose distant footsteps echoThrough the corridors of Time,For, like strains of martial music,Their mighty thoughts suggestLife's endless toil and endeavor;And tonight I long for rest.Read from some humbler poet,Whose songs gushed from his heart,As showers from the clouds of summer,Or tears from the eyelids start;Who, through long days of labor,And nights devoid of ease,Still heard in his soul the musicOf wonderful melodies.Such songs have a power to quietThe restless pulse of care,And comes like the benedictionThat follows after prayer.Then read from the treasured volumeThe poem of thy choice,And lend to the rhyme of the poetThe beauty of thy voice.And the night shall be filled with music,And the cares, that infest the day,Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,And as silently steal away.-- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"},

For the most part, Illinois is just so flat. I always wonder just how far I am actually seeing. Well, we were taking this one road, and it turned into rolling hills. And we found this state park/wildlife area. For the life of me I cannot remember the name. It really wasn't much of anything, except there were a couple places to pull off the road....I thought the sumac in the top photo was just so lovely...but it was midday so the lighting just about ruined all the pictures I took. So I will definitely be on the lookout for it in better lighting. I don't know what the plant/flower is in the bottom two but I think it quite lovely.

Today was the day.This is what we found--an oblong barn/grain bin with a smaller circular one on each side.  I really have no idea if this is a true barn or corn crib or what. Ot definitely looks like ventilation to me. It was a ways off the road and though I wanted to go examine it, I just cannot do that when I don't even know who owns the property.Now, I definitely want to go back when the corn is gone from the fields and I can see better from the interstate...cause I still have a picture in my mind of two barns.

I did think and use Firefox and it opened fine. So, I started investigating and found that I had to remove Sitemeter....In trying to find another webcounter, I discovered that I could not even open Sitemeter's pages at all from IE...so I closed IE down again and went to Firefox and accessed their site and I discovered they are getting ready for a change on their end of things. I figured that it was to do with that, but went ahead and wrote them a nice letter. Just to make sure they were aware of the problem.I kept checking throughout the day, and finally was able to access their site while using Internet Explorer. So I open my blog and removed the temporary counter I had used, and I went and got the code for sitemeter and put it back on and all is fine. About the time I got done with doing that, I got an answer to the email I had sent them telling me that they had become aware of an incompatibility issue and that it was fixed. I just really like Sitemeter better than the others that I looked at. . . and that is my story and I'm sticking to it.As for the following pictures, they are more from Monday morn...I have not tried to put them in any particular order....I just think they are all so beautiful. Roger and I kept telling each other to look! look!--if it was not one of us saying it, it was the other. So I hope you enjoy them just half as much as I do.

I had visions of going to the air museum during the day and going for a drive in the hours after it closed.  Didn't work out quite that way.However, due to our early start, we got to see a wonderful sunrise.  Roger stopped a couple times for me to take pictures...the ones I am showing are just some to whet your appetite.  I hope.    I also took some while moving...and they turned out better than I expected.I am having issues with my computer...or to be more specific with Internet Explorer.  I don't know if it is temporary or what...but I cannot open either of my blogs, or The World in Black and White which I participate in.  And I cannot open Strolling Through Georgia.  I can however open Paintbox Pictures--another blog I contribute to occasionally.  So right now I am using Mozilla Firefox, but it makes me wonder how long it will last with it.  I have not checked all the blogs with Internet Explorer...I do know that I can open some with it and these I mentioned I for sure cannot.  I think there were two or three others I tried and couldn't open, but I forget which ones they were.Anyway, I hope you enjoy these pictures...I should have got some of them up for SWF, but knew I didn't have much time to visit others, so just skipped it this week.

We should be leaving here in a few hours...You see, we will be celebrating.  Come July 29th, this Tuesday in other words, we will be married 32 years.  What is more, you won't believe this, but you can ask my brother Neal if it isn't a fact...we dated a month, decided on a Monday to get married on Thursday.Roger and I worked at CBS, in different divisions and had actually said hi to each other about twice....that is no exaggeration.  I thought he was sort of cute....and apparently he thought I was.  I was dating someone else at the time.  When we broke up, Roger asked me out.  We have seen each other every day of our life since then with the exception of times he has had to be gone for work. And that hasn't been real often. The longest we were ever parted was for 3 weeks for his initial training for the job he just retired from.I will sure miss seeing you guys...I will probably be back for SWF at the latest.

I was looking through my older images and realized I forgot my kitties' first birthday...my daughter ask me what I would have done for them.  I told her maybe take their 1st yr. photo, or maybe cut up a piece of lunchmeat just special for them.  She seems to think they are spoiled enough.   Anyway, I did pause on their pictures but think I have posted a good portion of the good ones I have of them.  So I kept looking and came across these three.

This top photo is scanned from a slide of early 1994, so it had to be the fall of 1993. It is one of my favorite barns in our area. I bet I have 50-100 pictures of it. No one is ever near it when I am there...if I ever see anyone there I am going to ask permission to look inside. The other side had storm damage this spring, not too terrible, but they are repairing it for which I am thankful.This leaf was actually taken just a few weeks ago....on one of my cloud chasing trips. Seeing it sort of made me long for fall.And this is from another slide--1998 this time. Isn't that tree gorgeous! I think fall is my favorite season. Just something about all the colors and things sort of slowing down. Kind of sad in some ways...yet it makes me look forward to staying inside and maybe sewing a little or settling down with a good book. Or something I have done since getting the internet a few years ago is to look up old diaries, journals, letters, and photos from the early settlement of this country. Reading and seeing some of those early times sure makes one appreciate the ease with which we heat, keep clean, cook, travel, etc."},

I know I am posting this even earlier than normal, but I am figuring I am going to have to reload some of the photos till they will enlarge.

Even after all the years of pulling it away from the apple trees at the orchard, I still think it beautiful.  It should be my own personal enemy, but I can't help but love it on its own territory. We not only went to this area Monday but went back yesterday evening...I could just sit out there and watch the sky all day.  Not only that but there is just so much more to see as in the little yellow flowers as well as the purple one...along with maybe deer every now and then.  And yesterday evening was amazing...I have never seen so many dragonflies in all my life.  They were literally swarming....I bet hundreds of them.  I got to watching and told my husband, LOOK! Watch the other insects and watch the dragonflies....they were snatching dozens and dozens of insects out of the air.  One can't help but hope that it was mosquitoes. This was right before sundown and soon as the sun was gone, the dragonflies disappeared.  I could not spot any anywhere...not on the weeds nor anything else.  You may be sure we will be going back out there.  And don't forget to watch tomorrow evening for Skywatch Friday's post...it will have views from out there.

We were kind of hurrying home when I spotted these coneflowers growing by an older abandoned house. I had to stop and take a few pictures, but didn't take a bigger view and wish I had.

This was taken in the middle of the day, so definitely does not make for great photos. But thought I would show it anyway...we thought it almost looked like it had been built in two sections, or else started at each end and worked towards the middle.While at the bridge, I noticed all kinds of this flower. Actually, we seen it all along the way almost. I think any time I stopped, I could spot some of it. I have been looking for the name for it and having no luck, so if you know, please respond.Anyway, I know these are not great sharp, in focus photos, but I think the insects would have had to be dead to catch a good photo of one. I don't care what kind of insect I seen on them, they worked around the flower so quickly that it was almost impossible to capture even a half decent shot.I don't generally care to get super close to bumble bees, but they are so intent when they are on the flowers they seem to have a one-track mind.And I captured these guys, again, they were working very rapidly. I think this flower is made up of many tiny flowers...and they paused at each one for just a second before quickly moving around the head to the next.Each photo is supposed to enlarge when clicked. If you want to see more from the Sunday drive, there are a few more on The Road Less Photographed.I am late posting...we had storms start to move in around dark last night, so I unplugged the computer. I figured it would be one of the quickies that come and move on in short order. NOT last night. Lightning flashed all around for at least a couple or three hours--sometime seeming far away and others near at hand. With the thunder rumbling in the background.I fell asleep watching a quilt video, only to wake up in just a bit--sometime right after midnight and the storm was going full force. The power was knocked out before I could get up and do anything. And the wind was fierce....this is the second time I have been really thankful that we have those two big trees down.I stayed up a while till it slacked off and started looking for my three cats that like to spend the night out. Mama Cat came almost instantly but I did not see Cougar, Jr. nor his sister. I went outside and called and called for them...no show. So finally I went on to bed. I wanted to wake early to make sure my daughter did not over sleep with us having no power. I got up bit before daylight, thinking I would go look for my babies, but Roger had already been up and they were in the house already.I need not have worried about my daughter cause she was awake when I went to make sure she was up...how fun can it be to get up and have to get dressed by a flashlight and have no electricity to do anything like fix your hair. Her hair actually looked fine...she is lucky in that respect.I talked to her later and she said there were trees down every where on her way to work....she said there were all kinds of tree limbs in the median that looked like they had just been sheared off. And she said down the side roads you could see trees on top of trees. One of the guys called her and warned her not to take her usual route to work cause the road was blocked off.My husband called to check on a buddy of his and a tree had fallen on one of his vehicles...so Roger has gone to help him. He got almost to his house and called and said he was going to have to find a different route to get to him cause there was stuff across the road. He must have finally made it cause I have not heard from him and so far he hasn't showed up back home.I called out to the orchard to see how they survived...as far as the orchard itself one old plum tree blew down. But a big limb had fallen on the hood of one of their vans, and there are two new, beautiful homes near them that were built right around 2005...I watched one of them go up the last year I worked there. Big old trees had fallen on each of them. And another girl I worked with that lives south of the orchard had trees down in her yard, but none had hit anything.So what a night it was...."},

I wanted something besides a tree in the picture with the moon.  I went to a church that had an interesting outline but could not get in a position to get it and the moon.  So on down the road is this little graveyard.  So we pulled in there and here are some images from then.  I like the last one simple because when enlarge you can clearly see an old jet stream.As a side note, in this cemetery is a big tall headstone.  I can't remember if all four sides has a name on it, but I know two sides do.  One is someone killed during the Civil War while in Cumberland Gap, TN.  Cumberland Gap was my mailing address for a big part of my life...we lived on a farm, though, not in town.And on another side of this same headstone his brother was killed a couple days later in Tazewell, TN--that is the county seat of Claiborne County.

And I think the water part is pretty well accurate, so who knows about the actual sky.Sky Watch Friday is an actual blog that Tom and friends started just for our benefit.  I am not sure who all was involved in developing it but I am thankful to them.  So if you want to join, or just want to see some great pictures go to Sky Watch to find lots of links.  You won't be sorry.Click to enlarge photos.I spent a good part of the evening scanning slides...when I first do them I think they are great. Then I come back later and feel sort of ho-hum about some of them. However, barns always find favor with me whether taken by me or someone else, so I am posting two or three views of this barn. And will post a different barn on The Road Less Photographed. I know this one was north of here, I think still in Vermillion County, Indiana but not positive. I didn't have much choice on where I shot the picture from...it was a narrow, winding dirt road. But something about this barn just seemed so huge. I wish I could find it again to see if I still had that feeling."},
{"title": "Big Pine Creek", "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2008", "text": "Click any photo to enlarge.I hate to see what this post turns out as.  Everywhere I go I see that dreaded red x where photos are supposed to be.  So while these appear now, I wonder if once I publish it if they will be there.  If they are not, I am still just going to wait a while and see what happens.The top two photos show a bridge over this creek--it is Big Pine Creek.  When we used to take our daughters back and forth to Purdue University, we passed over this creek fairly often.  Only on a well traveled road.  Where we first saw it was right at the edge of a town called Attica, Indiana. It was way, way down in this gorge.  We always wanted to investigate it farther, and hopefully fish it someday.So last summer we decided to investigate farther, and found two or three places where we would have easy access to it.  But this was one of the best views to be had of it.  It definitely looks like a creek just waiting to be waded.If life ever slows down, maybe we can try it later this summer.  We sort of had plans to go fishing a while today, but last night our back door lock decided it would stay locked no matter what.  So Roger has to get a new one and put in.  I need a few other things from the store, so it doesn't look like we will be going anywhere very far from home."},
{"title": "Through the windshield again...", "date": "Tuesday, July 15, 2008", "text": "I tried to post last night but blogger would not upload my pictures, not even singly.  I am finding it hard to find time to post the past few days.Yesterday we left here shortly before 10:00 to head over to Indianapolis for test at IUPUI on our oldest daughter.  Did not get home till about 4:00 yesterday evening. IUPUI is a big teaching hospital complex for Indiana University/Purdue University.I had Roger's little camera in the car and wondered why I hadn't taken it inside...it was just beautiful to look out from the fourth flour at all the white puffy clouds.So on the way home, I snapped a few more shots through the windshield.  Ignor the time stamped...I didn't take time to correct it.By the time we got home, the clouds had gotten much smaller and risen higher in the sky.  And then a lot of them disappeared.  I didn't have the opportunity I thought I would to get out and take some with my good camera.  The little point and shoot does not even have a view finder to look through--depends totally on the screen and it is very hard to see when outside.Today soon as my younger daughter gets home from a doctor's appt. we are headed over there again.  So I will be pressed for time to even visit my normal blogs."},
{"title": "Walking home...", "date": "Monday, July 14, 2008", "text": "This is another shot 'through the window' from the other evening.  For several days, I kept running across pictures of trains and/or railroad tracks when I visited other blogs.  And I was going to scan a picture from some of mine, but never got around to it.Anyway, any time I see RR track pictures, it takes me back to childhood.  Instantly.  We walked railroad tracks most of the way to school, almost every single day we went to school.  At that time, what they used to go between the railroad ties on our tracks was old coal cinders.  Maybe a few of rocks at different spots...I cannot remember for sure.  But I know most of the way was cinders.  And where my socks would wrinkle would always have black dust settle into them.Our tracks were more grown up with briars, bushes, etc along the sides, and the sides were steep--about 4 or 5 feet higher than the surrounding for part of the way.  Anyway, if the train happened to pass we had to hurry and find a way to get off the tracks.  But there was always the hope that they would throw out some kind of candy to us.  I really only remember it happening a time or two to me, but still a kid always has hope.  But that made train men kind of hold a special place in my heart.  And of course they always waved to me...they actually waved to everyone.  But being young I thought I was special.But back to the socks--I also remember trying to wash them out at night and laying them over the heat register to try to get dry before morning.  When in high school, I had 3 or 4 pair of the knee high socks, and that was it.  So I always had to wash them.  And to keep them from falling down, I used a rubber band up near the top and folded the top inch or so of sock down over them.  And others I knew did this, too, it wasn't just me."},
{"title": "On keeping computer unplugged", "date": "Sunday, July 13, 2008", "text": "These photos are through a dirty windshield--I haven't had time to clean them up but wanted to post them.  We had been down to my daughter's house day before yesterday and this is some of the sky that we saw on the way home......................Yesterday this computer was unplugged a big part of the day, so couldn't work on photos even when I was home. A round of storms would go through, then clear up. I would plug it back in...only for another round to go through. I finally just left it unplugged. I do have everything on a surge protector, but I just don't always trust them. I have had a couple friends end up with their computers down because of lightening, so while I am sort of lost without it while it is storming, at least when the storms are over with, I can get back on.Other than that we went to my daughter's house in Terre Haute and helped a little in getting ready to paint yesterday. We did a little bit of the priming...she is going to paint the trim white. When they bought the house it was painted dark, dark green so she wants to prime it before she paints it. And the windows each have several different panes of glass, so they are time consuming to do. But they are all primed and all the woodwork is primed now so they should be ready to paint."},
{"title": "This is where I have been....", "date": "Friday, July 11, 2008", "text": "(They are much better if you click and enlarge them!) This is where I have spent the past couple of days--well at least half of the past two days.  This is called Green Valley and is near West Terre Haute, Indiana.  It is a small state recreational area...when my husband and I were first met and married, his mom and dad used to camp here.  It was free to the public, but now camping is not allowed.  But the fishing is still there.Day before yesterday, there was one person there when we arrived and he was gone before we left and no one took his place.  Today there was one person already there--that is the boat you see in the above picture.   We did not get near enough to him to speak to him.  Shortly after we got there, another gentleman came, and right after him, still another.Then later after we were on the water, another couple guys came together, and later still, another single man.(Please click and enlarge this picture, even if you don't the others.  Do you see anything weird about it?  I didn't see it when I took it, thinking it might be something to do with my polarize filter.)Today, I think my grand total was 4 fish, and only a couple of those would have been keepers if we had been keeping them.  I used several different lures, different colors, different sizes, and even fished with worms a little bit and nothing seemed to be a good choice to get any amount of hits with.Yesterday we did choose to keep, and came home with about a dozen...notice I say about.  We were having to double up on the stringer and one got off, on two separate incidents when we were putting the second one on.  Besides what we brought home, we caught all kinds of crappies.  A lot of people would probably have considered them keepers, but we let them go to grow bigger.  And we caught several bluegills we considered too small.As for what I fished with yesterday, when we got there I had a little jig on with a dark green, lighter green tube worm...not chartreuse.  I cast it a few times, but since fish were hitting the top of the water, I changed to this little top water lure that is blue and white.  It has two sets of treble hooks...I caught two good sized bluegill on it.  But I have trouble with having patience to fish top water lures, so I switched to my usual weedless jig with a blue and black tube worm and did not switch the rest of the day and got hits continually.  I took the worms but never took the time to sit and fish with them any.I have not got to visit near all the people that joined sky watch, and not sure what my time is going to be like over the next few days.  But I am very thankful to Tom and Jane for hosting it...I did visit a few when we got home today and noticed Jane is filling in for Tom.  (Thank-you very much Jane--I know I appreciate it and am sure others do, too.)"},

{"title": "How about seven and more songs....", "date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2008", "text": "Click to enlarge     While I am posting favorite music, I thought it appropriate to post a favorite photograph.  To be able to have a good version to post on here was what led to me getting the new scanner.  This is from a slide I took when I was at the orchard, and their grandkids and our kids had all been playing and had these crates out.  They had been scattered about but before the day was done, they had stacked them up.  And that maple tree!  Everything was just golden...even the air felt golden. I was tagged by Carletta of Round the Bend to do this meme about 7 songs I am into right now. Here are the rules: List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they’re not any good, but they must be songs you’re really enjoying now, shaping your summer. Post these instructions in your blog along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to see what they’re listening to.It is hard to describe how I am about music...Neal and I are both really into music and photography. We are continually sending each other links to music or people with photography that we like. Anyway, for the past few years I very seldom listen to the radio. I hear bits and pieces on tv and manage to look them up...either I will recognize the artist or there will be a phrase I look for. The main way I find new music is by my kids, my brother, my nephew, and a very close friend that sends me things to listen to or tells me where to go to find it.I had a hard time narrowing it to just seven--there are eight on the playlist at the side simply because the place I get my playlist did not have two or three more. I chose the following:1. It's Not My Time by 3 Doors Down. I just tend to like certain songs by 3 Doors Down...this one I did have to listen to about two times and then I totally loved it. This is a group my girls introduced me to...2. In The Sun featuring Michael Stipe with Coldplay. I think it speaks for itself. I heard it for the first time earlier this year on Austin City Limits on our PBS station. 3. Vivalavida by Coldplay...Coldplay is another group that I think I heard of because of the girls originally. If they come in and say 'Hey, mom, you should listen to this or that' you better believe I listen. But this song I heard in a commercial on TV a while back, and knew who it was....not sure why I like it. But it will be one I never tire of.4. Friday I'm in Love by The Cure...if I have listened to this song once I have listened to it a thousand. It and their song Just Like Heaven makes me feel like I can conquer the world. Great music to work by. I guess these would be my power songs....you know the songs you get in your head to give yourself courage. I thought it belonged on this list cause every time I mow the yard it and the following song are on a tape I play while mowing.5. Drive by Incubus....Another song I bet I have listened to at least a thousand times. When I worked at the orchard I would make tapes of random songs to listen to while I worked. This is one that popped up on most of my tapes...6. Good to be Home by The Everybodyfields, and no that isn't a typo. It is probably my all time favorite song...for now and forever. It is one I found through my friend Deb, in Pennsylvania. We grew up together in Tennessee. I loved her before but she holds a special place in my heart for leading me to this group for this song alone. 7. Wait a Minute by Seldom Scene. Don't know why I like it....it is bluegrass and the music is kind of haunting for me. 8. Old Habits Die Hard by Mick Jagger. I heard just a bit of this while in The Gap shopping last year I think, or the year before at Christmas. I had to think to realize who it was, but it has been one I have played over and over. The line in it that says Old habits die hard, old soldiers just fade away just breaks my heart....This list is in no particular order....in fact Good to Be Home would be at the top of the list were they in the order of favorites. And if Playlist had had 10,000 Lakes it would have been on it...that is why I posted the You Tube video earlier...plus I love my brother's photography in it.It would be followed by North Knoxville by Todd Steed and the Sons of Phere--this is a link to a blog that has it within it. Click on the accoustic version. It is another I have listened to over and over this summer.Another song that I just found today while messing around was Sunday Afternoon by Jay Clark. This link takes you to his My Space page and on the side he has this song in his list. And if I could have found it anywhere, I would definitely have listed his song, Goin Home. It is another that I have listened to over and over.And there are several more that should be on this list....just so good. Oh, one I found on another blog...I don't think he has it playing any more but he told me the name of it....Sun Lounger...Chill Out mix. It is an instrumental that I totally love.As for tagging people, I have no idea who to tag...So feel free to do this if you want. It is definitely hard to narrow it down to seven songs. It is definitely a challenge to narrow it down to a certain number. I did not even mention Stephen Ashbrook or Tim Grimm. I found both of them at CD Baby, I bought 2 albums by Stephen Ashbrook and 4 of Tim Grimm's. This is one of the most beautiful songs(instrumental) I have ever heard...I cannot hear it without crying.  My brother, Neal, used his photos from in and around our home in Tennessee to make this video.  I loved it from the moment I heard it, long before the video--can sit and listen to it over and over.  The name of the piece is 10,000 Lakes;  I don't know who it is by.In about 7 or 7 1/2 months I will be entering a new phase of life...that of being a grandma! Our youngest daughter and her husband will be having our first grandchild if all goes well. Last week they called us cause they had a plumbing problem...so we ran down there for Roger to see what was up. They actually did have a problem, but I went up into their kitchen to set my purse on the counter and there were two baby bibs laying there; one said 'I Love Grandma\" and the other one said \"I Love Grandpa.' I looked at her and she nodded her head yes.Her dad came in and went directly into the basement...Jeremy told him to come upstairs because he wanted him to see something. When he got up there, Jeremy handed him the Grandpa bib and told him he might need that. Needless to say there were tears of joy all around."},

I thought that it was going to become a common thing to see big old fields of sunflowers growing.  It was not to be.  I think they raised them that year and maybe another and I have yet to see another big field of sunflowers.I wonder if they had trouble harvesting them before the birds got to them.  I know that the sunflowers I usually have sure don't last long.  Of all the years, this is the one year I don't have a single sunflower.Click photos to enlarge.I love this big sunflower head with the morning glories wrapped around it....just something about it appeals to me."},

{"title": "Want to make some fishing lures?", "date": "Saturday, July 5, 2008", "text": "We used to fish a lot, and with my husband being retired, we will probably begin to go a lot more than we did for a while.  In order to save a little money, he makes a lot of our jigs and also spinner baits.It all starts with lead.  He has friends that will bring him lead from tire weights, etc.  These he places in a lead pot...I am not sure how hot it gets but plenty hot to melt the lead.  I have done that over an open fire.  One thing you do not want to do is let one drop of water hit the melted lead because it will splatter everywhere!Anyway, the lead pot has a spout in the bottom that is controlled by a little 'stopper'.  I don't know what else to call it...it is long and runs all the way to the top and has a wire connected to it.  ( I use the term connected loosely--I think it is more like a notch is cut into the stopper and the wire runs through it.)  It is a stiff wire, and has a handle that is lifted to open the spout, and allows lead to flow out.  My husband has jig molds and buys hooks, you place the hooks in the open mold, which has one side laying flat till the hooks will stay put.   You thing carefully close the other side to it, and it looks like the photo below.With the mold above he makes 8 jigheads at a time.  They will each have a little bit of excess lead that he has to trim off, and then he paints them one at a time.  He uses model paint, and I think he discovered that he could use touch-up paint for cars and it dries fast.These are all lures he made over a couple or three days.  It is time consuming to sit and paint the eyes on.  He don't always paint, but really prefers to.Then for spinner baits, he has another mold.  He also has to buy wire, blades, swivels, and living rubber.He bends the wire to the desired shape he wants and chooses what blades he wants.  This is a smaller spinner bait, but he also makes the larger ones.The photo below shows the spinner bait just before the living rubber is added.And here is the finished product."},

I have been so disgusted...there are three girls in the neighborhood that have broken off most of the blooms, and on one clump of the plants there is nothing left. The plant is gone all the way to the ground. They are big girls--at least 10 years old. Part of me is just so angry, and part of me wants to get plants and go get them and have them come help me plant them...try to teach them and myself a little about them. The little girl next door comes and asks for my flowers, and I have given her some of everything but these....I thought it being their first season that maybe I should let them bloom as much as they would. She was fine with that...I am almost sure she is a future gardener. She asks what takes shade, and told me that her grandma had to have plants that need shade. She is maybe 7 years old..."},

I was hoping with the air being clear that I might get some photos I liked.Merom Bluffs is approximately 20 miles south of Terre Haute and are high above the Wabash River. These photos below does not really do it justice, but I got to concentrating on the clouds so much I forgot the original intent of going there.I am not how far we can actually see from up there, but I am sure it is miles. Probably 5-10 miles at the least. And you look down on the Wabash...thinking about how it was a major route of travel for pioneers.Then on the way home, I photographed these clouds as we were heading north. I thought sure we were going to get a major storm but it cleared up without anything but a few big drops of rain."},

By the time I got to this place to take the photos the second rainbow was starting to fade a bit....I have tried to manipulate the photos a bit but just could not do much with them.

I was going through some of my slides and scanning a few in over the weekend and I came across these two.  I laughed--even though they are sure not an exact replica, they sure remind me of Carletta's Round the Bend Blog.  Her header photo to be exact. Does it affect anyone else that way that visits both our blogs?  My husband didn't really see the similiarities that I did.  Maybe it is because I have been visiting her for a while and know we like a lot of the same thing.I posted both pictures for two reasons.  I like the coloring better in the first photo...but I like the second one because I was not quite at the side of the road when I took it.  I would have liked it better if I had been in the center of the road.  I don't know why I didn't take one from the center...but these were the only two photos of this scene."},

The third picture is taken from the other side of the creek, I think.Click photos to enlarge.This is the Narrows Covered Bridge, one of many in Parke Country, Indiana. It was built in 1882 by J. A. Britton and is 120 feet in length. Britton is interesting to read about...he read law had been admitted to the Kansas and Indiana bars, but that occupation did not satisfy him. Bridge building did. I suggest you follow the link--it is a short read and I cannot say it better.The bridges were made of locally available timber, such as oak or tulip poplar. And part might be laid out in a nearby field and constructed first."},

It has been so long since I worked with it, I cannot remember much about it. I am pretty sure I underexposed each exposure by one stop and that is about all I remember. I think I have a few more multiple exposures that I messed around with but I don't think I liked any as much as I liked this one.You can accomplish the same thing with digital just by doing a collage...I am sure most programs have some way of accomplishing this. But the one I first started to use that is free on-line.  It is Picasa. It is so simple...choose the photos you want to use--after you pick one, click on hold down at the bottom. Choose your next pictures and click hold after each one. Then click the button Collage and choose multiple exposure. Below are two photos I chose and the last photo shows them layered together as a multiple exposure. In digital I have not worked with more than two exposures, but in film I would sometimes do 3 or 4...and some time I will probably end up playing with more in digital."},

I think this might be right, but not sure.It is going to take some time for me to learn the ins and outs of scanning slides and just learning this scanner.....I could not remember which side of the slide film was the 'right' side. By the right side, I mean the side that you view it from to get the correct view. I had to hunt for a photo with a house that was familiar to me to figure it out."},

Since the storm hit in the late afternoon, I kept watching to the east to look for a rainbow, but no such luck. I think the sun was still just a little to high when the conditions were right for a rainbow. I got the bright idea to look to the west! I grabbed my camera bag and my husband did the chauffering...Please click to enlarge--it really does change things!This is a couple photos from the first stop. The bottom one is sort of grainy--I think the proper term for it in digital is that it has noise. But I still think in terms of film a lot of the time. Anyway, I had the iso set on 1600....that is the reason it looks like it does. I wish I had taken one with a lower iso, but I do like this one.Be sure and check my other blog, The Road Less Photographed. I know soon as I get done here I am going over to it to post a couple photographs there from this drive. As an added note, I had a heck of time getting these uploaded...and when I finally accomplished that feat, they did not enlarge to the size they should.  So I deleted them and uploaded them again one at a time.  If they don't enlarge now, I don't know what else to do.  They should be almost full screen sized when opened."},

It had belonged to the mom of her landlady. And this pink rose had belonged to the landlady's mom.She was there for two seasons's of blooms...and she had several the first year. And the landlady and her brother could not get over how well/good it did under my daughter's care that year. This is from her second season with it.

{"title": "Refreshed", "date": "Friday, June 13, 2008", "text": "Click to enlarge....Husband and I went fishing yesterday morn for a while...we came home with these bluegill plus one more that he had filleted before I got the camera. Notice one or two are really small--well, they are about as tiny as they look. But they had swallowed the hook/lure and retrieving the lure damaged the fish so they would have died anyway. And the monster second from the left is the first one my husband caught. We caught several more that we threw back because of size, plus a couple bass that were under the size limit. My husband was using a small spinner type bait when he caught that big one, but I don't think it was a beetle spin which he caught some of the others on. I used some of these little things that we call tube worms-- I like to them use on this type of hook with a weed guard. Those 'tube worms' are hollow and fit over the hook and you push the head end up over that barb to keep it on the hook. Not sure that the one pictured is the size I use...just showing it to show my favorite thing to use. I almost always start out with Black and Blue tube worms but they are getting hard to find. I just now noticed that Bass Pro doesn't seem to carry that color. So I don't know where I will get them...I originally got them at Walmart. They stopped carrying them, and the only place I could get them was at Bass Pro. After the blue and black, I like the chartreuse with black or red....plus two or three other colors.If I am fishing near the bank where there is a lot of moss, or where I am apt to snag the hook one thing I really like a Johnson's silver minnow, only I usually start with it in gold, especially if the water is more muddy or murky than usual. (I am not employed by Bass Pro or anything, I just knew I could find pictures of the lures we used there.)And I even took some nightcrawlers and a zebco type reel and fished a while that way. I did not want to come home...and I wanted to go back this evening. There is just nothing like fishing to relax me. It was so peaceful, except for this duck that was mad at us--if you could have heard it you would have thought it was a cartoon. It sounded about like Donald Duck on speed. I wondered if we were near its nest, except I figured they were done nesting. I don't really know much about ducks, and it was too far away for me to tell what kind."},

The top is the before photo and the bottom one is after fill flash. In one sense, it don't look real, but that can be good or bad depending on the mood I am in. I really like it most of the time, though I think it has more the look of an old time post card than a real photograph.

I wanted to take a photo of the railroad over the river that was in the photos on my blog on April24 of this year.This is showing some more of the farmer's fields under water...And if you click on the photo below, you will see a 'family' of bats up in the very top of the roof...I happened to notice the bat guano on the floor of the covered bridge and looked up and there they were. This is the best I could do, but it isn't too bad of an effort. I do not know what a group of bats is called and I actually wondered if this was a family. I think there are seven of them...The photo above is the covered bridge at Bridgeton and down below is the old mill at Mansfield.  I have seen these two places in all kind of weather after lots of floods, but I have never seen the water this muddy!  We had more rain last night, but I think about an inch was all we got."},
{"title": "A few views after the flooding...", "date": "Monday, June 9, 2008", "text": "Click pictures to enlarge!We are starting on my husband's first full week of retirement. It still has not sunk in that he is not on vacation or something. He stayed very busy the first few days he was off. On one of the days last week, one of the 'bosses' asked Rachel what she thought her dad would think if they called him in to work...I forget what was broken/not working, but they were missing him.However, he has missed a lot of excitement by being retired...his former place of employment almost lost their new powerhouse. They sandbagged the place today, and also hired someone with a backhoe to dig a big drainage ditch around the powerhouse. They also had to lock down because they lost the alarms on the fence.We mowed the yard this morn--I did most of it while he repaired our outside light fixtures. There was a little bit of the yard left to do, and I have had a stupid cold or allergies or something, till I just let him finish. He feels weird with me mowing the yard, but the only time I haven't mowed the yard was during the last few years I worked. So I feel weird if I don't mow it.After doing that, and a couple household chores we decided to go get a bite to eat. I took my camera 'just in case.' And walked outside and immediately knew I was going to be happy to have it along. We wanted to go on a drive in a nearby county, but I was not sure the roads were open...the paper said they were closed unless for emergency. And I firmly believe in staying out of the way when so much else is going on.So instead we went for a little drive near here...and these are pictures of some that I saw....for one thing, the only brick road I know of. You can tell that the water was up and over it by looking at the plants laid down by the flow of water. This is not a place I see when it rains, so don't know if this is normal or out of the ordinary.But I feel confident that the fields had been planted, and I think they are a loss. Poor farmers. There is all that expense of seed, etc. plus all the time it took to get the crops in the ground. So much time and labor lost."},
{"title": "The boys", "date": "Sunday, June 8, 2008", "text": "Click to enlarge for better viewing!I haven't shown the babies in a while...so here are the boys.  About the only time they are still is when they are sleeping.  Bubbie, on the top does a lot of sleeping.  However when he is awake, he likes to keep things stirred up.  If nothing else, he likes for us to play chase with him.  And he loves Shelby, our old collie/shepherd mix.Cougar, who I first called Chunky Monkey is still very close to his sister.  He reminded me so much of my original cat called Cougar that I was all the time slipping and calling him that, so just decided that was his name.  He is even lanky like the original was.  He likes to play with his sister, but does not like to play with Bubbie cause Bubbie is too rough.Like the original Cougar, he can smell fresh hamburger a mile away.  They all will eat it, but he begs for it.  I tried to snap a couple pictures of the Princess, aka Puss Puss but she just cannot be still.  The only way almost to catch any of them is when they are sleeping.  I will try again in the coming days.We have started letting my two kitties and Mother Cat outside, but we make Bubbie stay in.  I would rather have them all stay inside, but the two females will run you over to get outside. It is understandable with the mother, since she was an outside cat the first two or three months of her life, till my daughter took her home.Besides having a fear of one getting run over, they have really interfered with Mama Squirrel.  She only comes about twice a week now...and even then is not quite herself.  She will come running when I see her and call her name, but once she gets here she is very leery of everything.  So I really miss her easy companionship.  We used to sit at the picnic table or I would sit on the edge of the porch and she would sit beside me...and she will sit at the picnic table but just not very long.  Before she would sit there as long as I was feeding her."},
{"title": "Things I found today...", "date": "Saturday, June 7, 2008", "text": "These are definitely best enlarged!Even with all the rain, and there was a lot of it, I noticed the first of my Asiatic day lilies had started to bloom. Then walking out the back side walk, I noticed something laying on the concrete. On closer inspection, I discovered it was a petal from my neighbors poplar tree. So later, when my daughter and I took a walk, we picked up three or four and this is a couple of the pictures. But I regret not noticing when it bloomed--their flower is absolutely beautiful! Maybe next year I will watch for it. ...........As for the rain, it is over and we actually had sunshine this evening. But oh, it was so hot and humid when we took that walk. Later we ran to the store and saw where Feather Creek had been up out of the banks south of us about 7 or 8 blocks. I think some people had to be evacuated. It makes me so thankful to be where we are--we didn't even have trouble with water in the basement. Even if it don't rain very much, there is a spot or two just a little comes in. But as for it being a worry, it is not enough to worry about with the dehumidifier down there. And the rest of it is totally dry. ..........Terre Haute had some really major messes. They were calling for anyone with a boat to come help....and calling for neighbors in different areas to come fill sandbags. Some of the major interstates around Indiana were closed due to flooding....and even a state road that is the one my husband always took to work was flooded in one place. Something I have never seen or heard of in the 28 years I have lived here. Edited to add: I don't know how many times I have changed the appearance of this blog today. Bare with me while I get it till I can live with it. I am also having trouble with spacing between paragraphs....I usually just skip a line but tried that numerous times and would publish it, view the blog and not space between. So I tried indenting the paragraph, only to have the indentation disappear. I finally came up with the periods at the beginning of a new paragraph, but I sure hope I don't have to continue with that."},

When I met him, he had just sold this Harley Davidson to buy a Honda 750 motorcycle. He kept reading articles about how to make your Harley run like a Honda, so he thought why not buy a Honda. This was a 1953 Panhead with a rigid frame. Not comfortable to ride.    Anyway, it is strange for him not to have to think about what he has to get done at work tomorrow...to not have to get up at 5:00 in the morn....and though he has plans for tomorrow...he don't have to do anything. I am sure it will be somewhat of an adjustment for both of us, but so far, it seems like it can only be good."},
{"title": "Childhood entertainment", "date": "Tuesday, June 3, 2008", "text": "I do not know where this book came from--it was in our home as long as I can remember.  It provided me with hours and hours of entertainment when I was a kid.  I think when I first began looking at it, I was almost so small my mom had me set down and she would give it to me then.  I would go through it sometimes from cover to cover, but sometimes I skipped over the things like fleas and cockroaches and worms...I was in it for the feathers and the fur as well as butterflies, moths and snakes.I can remember looking at it before I could read....totally loving the animals.  I don't guess it is any wonder that when I was young, I would have loved to have had a job with Jim Fowler and Marlin Perkins of Wild Kingdom fame.  I never wanted to be a vet so much as an animal handler or naturalist.  I just loved fooling with animals and still do.And this picture of the bat always gave me the creeps, and still does.   When I was a kid I don't remember seeing very many bats...I don't know if they were not there or if I just didn't see them.  I would assume the latter. Here, it is normal to see them out every evening at dusk.  And when I worked at the orchard, sometimes they were in the barn, and sometimes in the big cooler before we cleaned it out and closed it and started the refrigeration.As I got this book out, I wondered what it would be worth on Antiques Roadshow...it has definitely seen better days but it holds a lot of memories for me."},

I could not post a comment, I could not go to my blog or any blog.

I just the other night got out my slides and now I am really looking into a scanner that will do a decent job of scanning slides. I thought I only had a very, very few photos that I would like to have in digital format, but I only went through 200 or less slides and found I have a lot I would love to have.I have made 5 or 6 quilts since starting the blog...some from scratch but some just the machine quilting part. And I have made a few quilt tops that awaits the magic of machine quilting. And hopefully I will get started again with that before the summer is over.And I have come across blogs which went into my list to check daily, some of the bloggers I really consider friends, and just a couple or three months ago I told my family and friends that I have the blog. I was sort of afraid they would read it and sort of afraid they wouldn't ;)Anyhow, just thought I would post a couple more barns...some of you have noticed how I love them. When I was going through my slides I seen barns that I have no idea where I was when I took them...some I could vaguely remember the area around them but not how I got there!

I have looked at it, but not enlarged it very much till tonight.  When I did, I noticed the drops of dew on the bottom of the mushroom.  And those petals on top are from locust blossoms.This barn was on the way home...it and the barn down below are okay.  They don't capture the movement of the grass as I tried to.  But I thought I would show them anyway.  I think you can almost catch the movement.  It is just something I wish I could capture...till you could almost feel the wind by looking at the photo.And not far from that first barn, I came across another field of gold...and I must say it is the goldest field I have seen thus far!  This is a pretty good capture of what I saw...it was just such intense color.  And so much of it that I had to share it, even though I have done posted some, and seen them on other blogs. I have tried to find this version of this song for years...when I worked at the orchard I made myself tapes--tapes of all types of music.  And over the years I worked there, I wouldn't even want to guess how many times I listened to this song.  And the copy I had, I taped off a radio show years ago.

I am not sure what kind of locust it is--it only had buds and no open blooms at the time I took this.  I think it is a honey locust, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  I know my mom and dad always said locusts made good fence posts.  What I don't know is if that applies to all types of locusts.Just thought I would show you the thorns that were growing on it.

Also, the ones with the real blue sky are not from photo software, but were not quite that way in real life.  Almost, but not quite.   I think it is from my polarizer, but I have never had it work this good....or maybe it was just a fluke of my camera in the good direction rather than how every now and then a picture or two will turn out totally wrong...today I had a couple that the color was totally washed out--no way to save them even with software.

{"title": "Time gone by", "date": "Monday, May 26, 2008", "text": "These photos were taken long before I even thought about a camera, and at least the top two maybe before I was born. But I am not sure about that. The top is our horse, Old Bob, and that is our dad. Neal nor I know who is on the horse...not any of us kids. And if you look close you see a little girl standing behind Bob. I have no idea who that is either. Bob looks like he is either getting ready to go to work, or coming in from working...notice the collar, etc.I did not think I had a picture of Bob, but my nephew reminded me of this one. And I had it...but I did not have the one I wanted and of all the photos I took once I got a camera, I cannot find one picture with him in it.The photos below are taken looking down the hollow from our old home place....all the fields you see plowed up were probably all the work of Bob...as Neal mentioned in his blog, Bob probably kept us from starving. And though these fields don't look very big, it is still a lot of work for one old work horse.I am sure my brothers could tell you much more about it than me.  Each year the ground would be turned over with a plow, which a friend did that had a team of horses, followed by Bob pulling the disc harrow, and maybe pulling a drag over it after that. I barely remember the drag...I don't even have a clear picture in my mind. So I hope Neal or George will pipe in here and explain it. I guess you would call it an implement to pull over the ground to level it out more and maybe to help get rid of the bigger clods of dirt....I know this picture I am painting is about as clear as mud, but still maybe you will feel some of the same feelings I have when I look at these old photos. It is a time gone by that will never be again. And especially for us that know this place, it does not even look like the same place today. It seemed so big back then, and now when we go up there, we wonder how they raised all the food that they did there.Plus there was tobacco to raise and field corn for the animals, and probably corn to raise to for cornmeal. I don't know if we raised hogs when we lived up there, but I think we did. When we moved to the new house...we raised and butchered 4 hogs every year...or at least most years. But I will save talking about that for another day.It is later....I wrote the above this morn and I have just got off the phone with my brother.  We were reminiscing.  He reminded me a bit back about how Old Bob did not like to be spit on...I don't know if anyone ever actually did.  But he got mad if you just made the sound like you were spitting.  You ask how do you know he got mad?  Make no mistake--he had body language.  His ears went back and you could tell as plain as day.  I can remember seeing him get mad at someone, but don't remember who or what for.  The funny thing about it, I told Neal I never had him get mad at me...I think he would have bit someone had he thought he could get by with it when he was mad.  But I tended to spoil him what little I could.  He was done getting age on him by the time I got very old.   I can remember riding on him a few times when I was very little to get from the old place to our new house and I can remember my older brother plowing the garden a time or two with him...but basically I remember him being retired for the most part since I was old enough to start remembering much."},

I must have drove my brothers nuts,But with four of us, we could always play somethingWe didn't own a baseball bat,but would find a stick or short board and whittle a handle,That served the purpose just fine.The three siblings that were close to me in age were my brothers George, Neal and RobertSo some of what I like about myself is due to themI am not a woman that is afraid of her shadowI can use an axe or gun or rifle as easily as my sewing machinesI come from a home that had guns and huntingand that was just a part of life.We were taught to be responsible from a very young age...We didn't get fireworks on the fourth of July--too afraid of starting a fireOur time for firecrackers was Christmas--at nightWe always hoped for snow, but it didn't matterJust build a fire andhave a brick of firecrackers and a few M-80s to made a big bangSpecially when you collected the firecrackers that didn't go off the next dayUnroll them and collect all the powder, get a piece of fuse, bore a hole in a piece of wood, poor in the powder, place the fuse, and make or find something to make a plugand Presto, you have an even bigger bangAnd we survived it all!"},

I have always been a person to play a song to death, over and over, but usually it is replaced from time to time, with a new favorite. But I never stop loving those favorites...just a new one will take centerstage for a while. However, I don't know if any will ever replace this. I will leave it on for a bit, and hope that someone else will like it just a little bit.One of my childhood friends, Debbie, that now lives in Pennsylvania liked another song by The Everybodyfields and had me listen to it...well, I got to listening to their other stuff and I will forever thank her because through her I found this song. Their My Space page has a different version than the one heard here...I definitely prefer this one. You can get this version from Emusic.Anyway, listen to the song and read the words--SO GOOD TO BE HOME by The EverybodyfieldsI was sick about the time we hit Virginia,I had tombstones down both sides of my face.Driving all night home from Boston,I was so tired of being away.Thinking about summer time and heat wavesAnd a town, it hardly ever snows,Hitting apples with a baseball bat in August,That's where I want to go...So good to be home.Well sidewalks down here, they go foreverand they always seem to meet you with a smile.If they don't park the cars out where they shouldn't [??]I believe you can see clear for a mile.Well there's a tree on Maple St., it turns so yellow,it turns lose the leaves; the ground, it turns to gold.My car, it always knows what gear to be inand my feet can always take me home.So good to be home.Well the lights here, they can spin the head of a young maninto thinking that the whole town loves you.But your heart is not protected from the cityit might help to get you through.Well the downtown has given me some problemsand we've all had some growing up to do,walking on cars and across the tops of buildings,I think that God was probably laughing too.So good to be home...Down the street my neighbor's son is walking,the north side is getting bigger all the time.I owe the girl down at the library some money,she says she's just gonna let it slide.In my mind every single day is sunny,it's so bright it almost hurts my eyes to see.When the rain is pouring out over the gutters,thank the lord just to be here in Tennessee.So good to be home...Half a mile now from the border,half a mile just to roll my windows down.Sitting, staring at the windshield,telling myself \"not too much further now\".I call David up to see what he is doingand I pass him as he's getting in his car.Down the road and take a right down State of Franklinand we'll p__ the night away down at the bar.So good to be home..."},

I held him trying to snuggle him and get him warm but he died while I was cuddling him to me.  I could feel the congestion in his chest.I had the thought where I wondered if he caught what I had, but I know when Roger first brought him to me, I did  not think he would live cause he coughed a time or two and I felt it in his little chest.  I was really beginning to think he just might make it, but I never felt sure.  He was just so tiny.  And just a couple days ago, so alive.  It was hard to get him to be still long enough to eat. The day has sure seemed empty without him...."},

I took it after I took those moon shots the other night. I suppose the leaves of the nearest tree are lit so well because my neighbor had her outdoor light on. There was just a bit of fog, but it doesn't show in this shot, but it is the reason I took the shot. I wish now I had taken more cause I like the coloring in this.Otherwise, Clover is definitely growing. He wants to get loose and when he does I don't know that I will ever be able to catch him...he definitely loves clover. I think I can tell he has grown since the weekend. He cleans himself just like the cats--he will lick his paws and just scrub his own little face. So darling.And Mama Squirrel has babies that are up fairly big--much bigger than I thought they would be. They race around so I cannot tell if it is three babies or two babies and Mama playing. But I really think it is three babies. So far she has not brought them over to see us, and I don't think she will since the big maple is gone. Last year, she had her last litter across the street but soon as they were out and moving, she brought them over here to us and our tree. She still comes to eat, but I don't catch her as often. And honestly, the past two or three days have been so windy I don't think she has come...she never likes the wind. I don't know if it is confusing for her, or if it brings more noises to her ears. Either way, she is always much more skittish when it is windy."},
{"title": "Neighbors...", "date": "Tuesday, May 13, 2008", "text": "When I hear the word neighbor, my thoughts go immediately to this woman, Lilly Partain. We met in 1980 when we first moved here. My introduction to her was having to go ask to use her phone first thing. Her answer was \"of course, honey, help yourself.\" It was the start of a lifetime friendship that I dearly miss. I do not even know where to begin. I think being sick this weekend brought to mind how sometimes when one of us was sick, she would fix a big pot of what she called goulash and call one of us to come get a bowl of it. It was always so good--it was sort of a chili mac dish. And tasted so good...hamburger, onions, garlic, tomatos--especially if you had a cold or something like I have had.She is pictured here with our youngest daughter. I am sorry to say that I think this is the only photo I have of her...but it shows her just like she was. She spoiled these kids as if they were her own grandchildren. When our oldest daughter started kindergarten, for some reason, we had to take them as well as pick them up. No riding the school bus.Sarah did not want to get up and get dressed just to deliver her sister to school. So every morn, I would call Aunt Luddy as the kids called her and say, \"she's on her way\" to let her know Sarah was coming over. Sarah went over and had cookies and milk while watching Scoopy Doo. That was the morning ritual about 90% of the time.Lilly did not drive, so when I went to the store, I always called her to see if she wanted to go or needed anything. If she wanted to go, she could be ready in about 5 minutes flat cause she always got up, got dressed, and was ready to meet the day. Her house was always just spotless. She liked reading, but she loved bingo and lottery tickets!When our children were really small, we did not always have a lot of money, so every now and then she would call me and tell me to get ready and we would take the kids to Dogs-n-Suds--her treat. Dogs-n-Suds was just a little restaurant that served burgers, fries, and root beer in ice cold glass mugs.We always had each other to 'borrow' from...it probably only happened a couple or three times a year but you just cannot believe how I miss having someone to call and say hey, I need a cup of milk or do you have vanilla extract. I hate being all ready to make something only to discover I need a key ingredient. And we always worded it as 'borrow,' but both knew it would not be actually paid back...other than being there when one of us needed something the next time.And when I mowed the yard, a big part of the time I would look up when I was half way through and there she would be on her front porch with an ice cold coke for me. I would go and we would sit and visit while I drank the coke.She has been dead about 4 years now and I think I miss her more as the years go by. It seems like we don't have time to be neighbors like that any more. Everyone is so busy working and trying to do just what they have to do.  When we are going to be gone for a few days we have good neighbors that we tell. But, it just isn't quite like it used to be and I miss it."},

I still have not made it to every one's site but will probably still try to make a few more visits.  At least this week I am not sitting here trying to type with one hand while I hold a baby bunny with the other.I am going to try to take a picture of Clover during the next few days.  I would never have dreamed that having little bunny would wear me out, but it does.  Yet it is worth it.  Its eyes opened earlier this week, I have been feeding it just a few three-leaf clovers, which she/he totally enjoys.Part of what wears me out is the fact that the cats will not leave the cage alone, so I no more than sit down till I have to get a newspaper after them.  They can't really get to the bunny, but I want them to get the idea that it is out of bounds.  Bubbie is so hard headed I am not sure he is ever going to learn.Now for the pictures below.  On his way home from work, my husband happened to catch a glimpse of these 'tree' mushrooms growing on a rotten tree not even a mile from here.  He turned around and went back and got them.   The National Audubon's Mushroom book calls them oyster mushrooms.  He has hunted them all his life and these are the biggest he has ever seen...and for sure the biggest I have seen.The color on top is different at different times of the year.  Here and here are places that has really good pictures of them growing--at the first link, the top two pictures really give you a good view of how we find them growing.   We like to clean these and usually just tear them apart along the gills into thin strips and coat them with flour and fry until crisp and brown.  These were so big they had to be cut a little more.We had some last night, then Roger took some to work and in their shop they have a stove and he and the guys fried and ate a bunch at work.  And we have two or three bags frozen for later use.  I like them almost as well as I do morels...they have an almost slightly nutty taste.  Usually they don't have as many of those little tiny bugs as morels, but this bunch did."},

{"title": "A time set apart...", "date": "Tuesday, May 6, 2008", "text": "I debated on posting about this but I just want to share it, though I doubt if I can make you understand the way I feel about this place.Once upon a time, when my husband and I were young and had stars in our eyes and thought all things were possible, we decided to quit our jobs here in Terre Haute, Indiana and move to Tennessee, my home state. We moved to the little house/cabin in the top picture. I have no idea how old it is, but I have loved that place since I can remember. I still love it, and would move there in a heartbeat--though I don't know what I would do with all my sewing and my husbands things would not fit anywhere there. But there is no house on earth that I would trade that place for if it were mine.The other picture is one of the views we had from our front yard. And you go on up the holler past that barn to get to the place that Neal and all of us lived...he was actually born there. I, however, was born in an actual hospital. And I only lived up that hollow about 3 or 4 years.When we lived up there, my mom's best friend lived at this house pictured here.In our case, my best friend/sister-in-law lived less than half a mile on down the road from us, and my mom a little bit farther. I visited with both daily, either by phone or actual face to face...and it took me forever to be broke from that when we moved back to Indiana. But it was so good while it lasted.Out by the barn, I had a garden that would be by most standards a big garden--I had potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, hickory cane corn with cornfield beans growing up those stalks, bush beans , cucumbers, and what all else I cannot remember. I canned beans, and sold beans, and canned sliced green tomatoes and made tomato juice. We bought peaches and I canned those. My husband could shoot his guns off the front porch if he wanted, though he always got out in the front yard and used a picnic table as a rest. He could get in I think 500 yard shots to sight in his rifles....he could shoot his bows in the front yard as well...it was the ideal for us.I got to stay home while he first got a job at a local college, and from there a lumber yard, and then he got to go to a vocational school and learn to weld. Well, being a little older than the students out of high school, he got along real well with his teacher who was a wonderful man.There was also machine shop classes taught there--and it had a remedial course it taught two nights a week for people that needed refresher courses. Roger talked to that teacher and he agreed to let Roger come and set in on those...he would not get credit or anything but he would still have some knowledge of lathes, etc. So he really took advantage of everything he could there and it has served him well throughout his life. I do not know what the hold is that this place has over me...most of the time autumn makes me so homesick for it. And I dream about it...not as often as I used to, but often enough. And I don't like to wake from the dreams. I always try to go back to sleep and dream more. There is just a feel to the place...it has always had a hold over me.When we were kids, the owners of this place lived in Michigan and we mowed the yard for them. I loved having that excuse to go up there and go in the house. It never seemed to get hot enough to matter in the summer...about all we ever did when we lived there was open the window in our bedroom and open the back door. The cool air coming off that mountain cooled everything out.Enough reminiscing--I need to go feed Clover, whose eyes opened today.ETA: I don't know what I was thinking last night--apparently I wasn't thinking. Neal was not born up the holler from the barn--he and I were the only two of all us kids that were born in a hospital."},
{"title": "Rabbit review and more....", "date": "Monday, May 5, 2008", "text": "I will start out with an update on the bunny...first of all, my daughter came up with the perfect name for it: Clover. I like it because it could be for either gender. Not sure how good I will be at calling it that. The miracle of it all is that it is still alive, even after last night. You might wonder what kind of parent I am after I tell you, but it just has to be told. I feed it every 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours during waking hours, and probably the most it has went is 5 to 5 1/2 hours at night. I usually try to time its last feeding before I go to bed to be around midnight...Saturday night the timing was off and it was between 10:30 and 11:00 when I fed it. I was up for just a short while afterwards, and went on to bed. I woke up at 2:30 knowing I should get up and feed it, but was just so dead tired I wanted to go back to sleep. Yet I knew if I did lay there that I would not wake till morning so I made myself get up and warm its formula. I took it to the living room and placed it on the end table and went to get the bunny out of the cage. In this case it is not a real cage, but a cat carrier. The 'door' to it is wires of a sort. They are heavy duty, but spaced about 1 1/4 inches apart.Well, Clover has been traveling inside the carrier but he usually just snuggles deeper into the towel I have in there. Not this time! I felt back in the folds--no bunny! I took the towel out and unfolded it. Still no bunny! And you have to picture this...but everything I am doing I have at least one cat trying to help me. It is comical to think of now, but at that time I was getting agitated.You don't even have to think to know what I was feeling. I was just sure a cat had gotten the baby. I got my flash light and peered under the couch right by the cage. No bunny. I don't know why I stood up, I was planning on turning around to look under the other end of the couch, but I just stood up to glance around and see if I could see any remains of the bunny. And I happened to look down at the end of the couch and there it was right at the corner of the couch--its little nose just working and sniffing! (Still has its eyes closed.) I was so happy to find it...I fed it and just sat and held it for a bit before hunting a box to place it in, inside the cage! _________I forget where I originally got this little sketch/diagram, but at the time and even now, it sure fits me. Especially the part about time spent looking for things I just had.Jack-in-the-pulpit in the first two photos and Solomon's seal in the last two.Jack-in-the-pulpit is a stemless plant, 8 inches to 2 feet tall, that grows in the woods. It has one or two long-stalked, 3-parted slick and shiny leaves; and at the tip of its flowerstalk, which is not quite as long as the leaves, it has a peculiar flowering structure, tinted shades of green, greenish-white, and purple. The plant contains calcium oxalate crystals in all parts, and because of this consumption of the raw plant material results in a powerful burning sensation. It can cause irritation of the mouth and digestive system, and on rare occasions the swelling of the mouth and throat may be severe enough to affect breathing. Cattle should not be allowed to forage where Jack-in-the-pulpits is among the few green things growing.If the plant is properly dried or cooked it can be eaten as a root vegetable.A preparation of the root was reported to have been used by Indians as a treatment for sore eyes. Preparations were also made to treat bronchitis, rheumatism, and snakebites, as well as to induce sterilitySolomon's seal is a perennial native herb found growing in moist sandy, loamy or rocky woods and thickets. Stems grow to a height of from 18 inches to 2 feet, or even more and bend over gracefully. Large, light green, and broad ovate leaves grow alternately on the stem, clasping it at the bases. Flowers bloom April to June.The dried herb is supposedly a laxative and restorative, and is good in inflammations of the stomach, indigestion, profuse menstruation, lung ailments, general debility, bowels, piles, and chronic dysentery. A medicinal poultice of the fresh roots is said to fade bruises, also applied to cuts and sores."},

This is the little rabbit's second full day under my care and he seems to be surviving. I am afraid to say too much, I don't want to get my hopes up only to come in and find it passed on. I have not even tried to decide if it is a boy or girl. I have discovered it seems to eat best if I wait at least 3 1/2 hour between feedings. You would not believe how strong the little babe is--just wouldn't imagine how it can reject being fed if it don't want to be. I actually think it is beginning to associate my voice with feeding. I really don't know if that is possible, but I honestly think it.Other than that, I didn't know what I was going to post tonight...then I remembered these that I took the other day. They sort of caught my breath when I took their picture...the first two are from the tracks...the railroad runs a block from our home. I take Shelby, our collie mix dog over there for her walks. Don't let the second one fool you--it is a seed and is maybe the size of a dime. I think it is the seed of an elm tree. The second two are more of my dogwood--notice the color change from a few days ago. It actually goes from that dusky pink to an almost bright pink.And the last picture is a flowering bush of a neighbors--I don't know what it is but I like it.Again, I remind you to click pictures to enlarge...I am always amazed at the difference.  Also, I wondered if they all enlarge for everyone.  They do when I click on them, but some blogs I go to, when I click on the pictures, not all enlarge.  And you can tell they are supposed to be clickable...the cursor becomes the 'little hand' when placed over the pictures.  But clicking on them still gets no result so I have really wondered do all of mine enlarge."},

I mow right up to the edge of it. Then my husband came home that night and tilled the garden spot. Right at the edge he turned up a nest of rabbits. He put all the babies in one spot near the nest in the hopes that the mama would find them. Neither of us really know much about rabbits. So I have no idea if one would come or not. I seen him do it, and I just did not have the heart to go look.Then last night he came home and camelast night he came home and came in carrying this little fellow...and handed it to me.  It was very lively but very cold.  I held it a few seconds, and handed it to my daughter and got on the phone to call the vet to see if they have any type of rabbit milk formula.  They didn't.  So I called stores in the surrounding area and a farm store in a neighboring town had formula that was supposed to be for rabbits and dogs.   I ran and bought some...looking at it closer today I discovered that even though it has pictures of rabbits, the wording does not include them.  But it is all I have to work with...I have no idea if the baby will survive or not.  At least if it does die, it will be warm and safe.  And on the positive side, it has done lived longer for me than any I ever had as a kid.  Of course, usually those had done been very traumatized by a cat or dog catching them."},

I was totally in awe of it....someone told me there were about 400 acres in apple trees. At one time when I was taking pictures, one of the family stopped and my husband talked with him. I don't recall if he is who told us that or if it was someone else. I try to make up there every spring in hopes of catching it all in bloom at one time but so far that hasn't happened. It is a rare occurrence for all the varieties of apples to be in bloom at the same time.There is no place to get a good picture of the whole view...it is just amazing. Acres and acres of apple trees on gently rolling hills. It is one sight I never get tired of seeing. It is at least a 40 minute drive from me, and I seem to be drawn up there just to see it at least 3 or 4 times a year."},

The top one was taken in southern Indiana last summer.  I love the looks of it--love the rounded roof and the little addition with the same style of roof.This one was one I seen today on a drive...it seems to have been built so sturdy, but it appears the weather is starting to warp the boards.  (You should be able to click on any of these to enlarge them for better viewing.)The one above is living proof of the winds we have around here.  I wonder if the farmer will eventually get around to repairing it...right now I would bet money they are working night and day almost to get the fields ready and planted.And the one below is not far from my house and is just always so well groomed.  You would think it stepped directly from some kind of barn make-over.  And it is that bright red in real life...this is not adjusted with my photo software."},
{"title": "Fireplaces & Woodstoves", "date": "Sunday, April 27, 2008", "text": "These pictures were taken at the pioneer village at Spring Mill State Park. I don't know what it is about a fire, but I don't think I know a single person that doesn't like to sit by a fire of any kind. We don't have a fireplace in our home, but I sure wouldn't mind if we did. Everyone else always thinks about the dirt and dust, but I could easily put up with that. I know I am one of the few people my age that can remember their mother cooking on a wood cookstove....but I do.We had linoleum on all the floors...and they were cold of the morning. Mom was the first one up, of course. And I would wake up next--I don't know if it was all the time or just some of it. But I distinctly remember hollering, \"Mommy, come and get me.\" She would come and carry me from the bed to a chair sitting at the end of the cookstove. There I would sit and stick small splinters of wood in through the draft at the end...while she made biscuits and cooked breakfast.The wood cookstove had a thermometer on the door but it was broken, however my mom could bake biscuits, bread and cakes and pies with no trouble. I recall seeing her open the oven door and sticking her hand in to get a feel for the temperature. And she never used a timer of any sort. (I cannot remember anything without a timer these days.)Our new house was heated with a coal stove for the first few years...not sure how many. Probably at least 3 or 4. I can remember sticking potatoes in the coals to bake as a snack. I think I was in 3rd or 4th grade when a coal furnace was installed. I am not sure what happened to that stove, but the old wood cookstove sits in the basement of the homeplace. At least it did the last time I checked....that has been a while ago.I do not know what it is that draws me to the old times...I cannot imagine doing all my mom had to do with as little as she had to do with. But at the same time, I think these days stuff almost owns us...I think there is medium that I have not achieved. I have more than I need but hold on to stuff because I feel like as soon as I get rid of it, I will need it.But looking at the bottom picture of the fire place--the utensils around it are probably all a lot of women had to cook with. And they made do with it fine. I for one, admire the women that came before."},

I have dishes with roosters on them, I have salt and pepper shakers with roosters and chickens on them, I have shot glasses with roosters on them, and I have chicken and rooster figurines.  At one time I had over one hundred chicken/rooster items.  I have basically quit collecting, but I hang on to what I have.  That being said, I guess it is normal for me to take pictures of them when I go to the fair.You would think it would be an easy job with them being held in cages, but it isn't as easy for me as it looks.  They are constantly on the lookout and the least little thing makes them bob their heads, etc.I do not know what kind of chicken the one below is...I don't remember the first time I seen one.  But I know I was an adult.  So if anyone reads this and knows, please leave a comment.  I have looked some on google, but not did an in depth search.Now, the ones above and below are just handsome guys, don't you think.  Look at that black--it is so black it is almost like oil in that it reflects other colors.  And I bet there are women that would dearly love to have hair the color of the rooster below...I know I sure wouldn't mind."},

I notice I start to avoid leaving comments because I feel like I am repeating myself. When I start to do that, it is time for me to walk away for a while and come back to it later. I think I would still feel the need to try to view them all, even if I didn't post a single picture.Anyway, does anyone ever look through their lens and it totally out of focus and you like it anyway. Well, here is a couple versions of one out of focus shot, taken off my front porch this morn. I cannot get it to look like the view through my out of focus lens still, but I sort of like it. The darker one is what came off my camera without anything being done to it in photo software. The other is just adding fill flash.And below are in-focus shots. I have been trying to get in the habit of walking, but on my way to the park, I ran by the river to see what the sunrise was doing there. I cannot pick a favorite so am posting more than one...I hope you don't mind. It is sort of strange seeing the Wabash river calm enough to have reflections in it, as well as being within the banks. It has been flooded for a lot of the spring. It is kind of nice to be seeing things get back to normal."},

Anyway, this picture was taken in 2000. The picture is somewhat the worse for wear as you can see by the scrathes, etc. But I wanted to use it because I thought this might be a fun post. This is one of our daughters holding him...if you rubbed his side or belly he would lean into it. And if you rubbed right above and between his eyes he would close his eyes and hold ever so still.I am wondering if we will see him this year or if something happened to him last year. Last year we only seen him two or three times early in the year. The last time I held him, he completely filled my palm width wise--he was one fat healthy boy. My palm is at least 3 or 3 1/2 inches wide. We would knock bugs/moths down for him. If we actually killed the bug, we would place it in front of him and blow on it to make it move, otherwise he would not attempt to eat it. What's more, as a kid, we had a toad that came up on our porch almost every night in search of food...we all know how lights attract bugs at night. Only down there, he had to climb up a flight of 6 or 7 steps. After I moved to Indiana and told my husband about him, he kind of thought I was being funny or something till we went home and he seen it for himself.Anyway, we all really have a soft spot for toads...if I am mowing and see one move, I stop and catch it and move it out of danger. With the exception of one summer, seeing a toads here is sort of rare. That one summer, I think my daughter and I sat outside with a flashlight and could 10 or 12 small toads. That had never happened before and never since."},

I took Shelby for a quick walk today...over by the railroad.  It is turning into more of dumping ground than usual.  So you have to look past the junk to see the beauty that is there.The remainder of my day was spent messing around at home, after running out for a couple of items this morn.  I got our front porch and the chairs and swing out there all scrubbed down, as well as I planted my wisteria.  I fixed chicken stir-fry for supper--supper is the souther word for the evening meal.  As soon is it was done, I sat and enjoyed my clean porch for a short while.This is the butter churn that I grew up with. It really wouldn't be worth a plug nickel if I tried to sell it--it doesn't have that ping when tapped. The bottom on the inside is very damaged. But I would not take any amount of money for it. I am somewhat sentimental. The dash is one my dad made...I like to think about that my mom's hands and my sister's hands used this dash long before I did. And I know my brother Neal sometimes had to churn. I don't think my other two brothers did, but not sure. He can probably remember that better than me.I think we churned about once every week to two weeks. Let me tell you, it was not my favorite job. Just sitting there, up and down, up and down with the dash was a boring job. Thank God for radios. Sometimes it would take forever...others seemed to go faster.I was never a buttermilk drinker, but others were. And my mom made two pones of corn bread almost every day of my life till I was out of elementary and then I think it dropped down to one sometime around then. Anyway,they were as big as a dinner plate. Buttermilk was used to make corn bread. So besides drinking it, it was used for that.And sometimes there were a couple women that liked to buy any extra we had. If I remember correctly they gave a $1 per gallon....I cannot remember for sure how they transported it. I don't know if they brought their own container or if they took my mom's jugs and just returned them each time.We used the butter that was made each time...sometimes mom used a mold and others she just shaped it by hand. I remember working it trying to get all the liquid out....that was a part that I did enjoy. And of course, I enjoyed the butter itself...loved buttered popcorn. I don't know if anyone else does this or not, but when I pop popcorn, I always pop it in at least half butter and oil...maybe more. It is a little bit different taste...and sometimes we will add butter afterwards and sometimes not.ETA: I stand corrected--my sister-in-law, who also my childhood friend, just informed me that my oldest brother also had to churn sometimes. Now, I would like to know if my other brother ever had to...I just don't ever remember him having to and I think I would have cause he was next to me in age."},

Since I got my Juki, I love machine quilting.This is out youngest daughter, Sarah and Otto. And below is her husband, Jeremy talking to Otto. My daughter turned 26 Thursday, but didn't want to have her birthday dinner till today. Her request was for a fried chicken meal, followed by what we call a pudding cake. The bottom layer is a crust made from 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1 1/2 stick of soft butter. That is mixed and flattened out in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.The second layer is 12 oz. of cream cheese softened to room temperature, mixed with 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 6 oz. coolwhip. Mix these ingredients well and spread on the first layer once it is totally cool. The third layer is for us a layer of either lemon or chocolate pudding...2 boxes of instant pudding of whatever your flavor choice, mixed with 4 cups of milk. Pour over the cream cheese layer. I always let it set in the fridge a little while and then go back and spread a layer of coolwhip on like frosting. This has been both my daughter's and my choice of birthday dessert for at least 20 years! I make it every Christmas and Thanksgiving, and their birthdays. And maybe a time or two in between. I know it has other names but this is just what we call it. And there are other measurements given but this seems to fill the pan the best. Project Looking Through by Mark...this is one more contribution for the project.  I have not looked through all the contributors so hope I am not repeating someone's idea.I thought I might as well go for a second day with a church--again a little church out in the middle of no where. I really hate to admit this but I cannot remember the name of this church. I took the picture at least a couple weeks ago, and thought if I was ever near it again, I would go take a picture of the name. I knew it had Kidd in the first word of it...I think Kidder but could not say for sure. The other day when I took the drive after the earthquake, I came across a sign pointing the way to this church. I thought now I will remember that this time; guess what, I could not remember it by the time I got home. I really wonder about myself sometimes....I have absolutely no short term memory. But notice the window above the door--it is fancier verson of the window pictured yesterday. Now I realize I should have taken at least one more photo of this church--the window was on what I think is an addition to the church that must have taken place quite a bit later than the original church was built. You will just have to take my word for it since I failed to take one."},

I always wonder how long they have been there...just think of all that their walls have seen come through their doors. Weddings, baptisms, potluck dinners,and funerals... Oh, notice the outhouse in the background of the third photo.  As some of you may or may not have heard, we awoke to a small earthquake here in the midwest. I had done been up about 3 times with the kitties, so was not asleep. It was a strange feeling to say the least. It took me a second to realize what was going on. There is a railroad about a block away and a train had just passed, and while we feel the vibrations, this was just a bit more. Then it dawned on me what I was feeling.

They did a pretty good job of cleaning up and though I miss them, I do not miss the worry when it storms.I am only showing the one tree...I was a little emotional when they first started on the other tree. Just sort of sad to see them go, even though this is probably for the best. It will be less mess in the gutters, not all those seeds, no more close calls on vehicles that are not in the garage. Still, it is sad to see them go.I was also kind of worried about how Mama Squirrel would react...I thought I might have to make a mad dash across the waters and adopt Hazel ...but not sure if Tom would be willing. Anyway, as you can see here she doesn't seem to mind in the least. This was the next evening...it was misting rain and she was all wet and bedraggled...but she is still my baby. Unlike Hazel, I cannot get her to set on me. But I really would miss her if anything happened to her. I would miss seeing her looking in through the back door looking for us...or miss seeing her come running when she realizes it is us.Now, if I can just get the computer situation under control I talked about in an earlier post, I will be so relieved.

It is something that I came up with--sort of own my own with a little inspiration from a couple sources.  I started it probably the last part of 2004 or early 2005 when I was still working, and finished it in 2006.Then today I happened to finally notice that I do have some daffodils blooming...I have two blooms.  I am not sure if the rest are going to bloom or not.  These are two different blooms, with the bottom bloom that was not fully open really being cropped.Of course I cannot forget the golden yellow of ginseng in the fall...you have to see it in person to appreciate it.And of course, when I think of yellow, I think of Tidy Cat cat litter--with four cats in the house I go through quite a bit of this stuff.   I am so glad I have a basement:-)A new use for broken down shopping carts.Roger did dig this shopping cart out of the dump.  He had to make it sturdy enough to hold this gas forge.  He built the gas forge from 10 inch pipe--not sure of the particulars.  He got the plans off the internet...it uses propane to heat with.  With it being on this cart it is easy for him to roll it outside while it is being fired, and does not have to wait for it to cool down to bring it back in once he is done with firing it.It is lined with Kao-wool--at least I think that is what it was called.

He took charge of a Whitley Foundry in Springfield...then moved to Dayton, and then began his own company with one or two employees on January 7, 1958...they began to manufacture bells in 1875.  From what I have read, this bell was probably made 1905 or later...I have only give a few very basic facts taken from THIS page, but the reading is so much more interesting HERE.The company, now located in Tiffin Ohio, is still in business making hammer mills, glass crushers, conveyors and other equipment.  If you want to see their website click Here.This is a barn I found several years ago...I have often wondered what its original purpose was.Any ideas? I first thought maybe a horse stable, but the size of the doors confuse me. Were they for the groom to enter and the horse entered from inside the barn. And besides that, what about the opening above each door? Curious minds would like to know.Also notice in the foreground of the first picture the water standing in the field. Seems like most of the farmer's fields have standing water somewhere. I am sure they are getting anxious about getting out in the fields."},

I am sure in hopes that it doesn't disturb her too bad when we get these trees cut down.  This is her third season with us.I went for a drive and though I didn't end up with any outstanding shots, I got some fairly nice ones.  More barns are among them.  I actually have thought about starting a blog with nothing but pictures of barns...but then what would I post here?  It was just so nice to be out and about in good weather.  Though I was on the lookout for vultures, I missed the one and only chance of a picture of one today... I could kick myself.   It would have been an excellent one...like the big fish that got away.I also got a couple pictures of llamas...one of which I am showing here.  There are a few places around here that have them, but I don't know their reasons for raising them.  A friend my husband had down home in Tennessee had one or two to help guard his sheep.  But the ones here are not near sheep.  I read they they make excellent pets and are good pack animals, but that don't seem to fit with the ones I see.  So maybe people are using their wool.  Whatever their purpose, I think they are beautiful...be sure and click the picture to enlarge and look at the eyes.  Just beautiful.Then my other picture I am showing is one that I just can't get right...it just does not do the real life scene justice.  It is of the power lines and I when I see them one right after another as far as the eyes can see as in this picture, I think of them as Silent Sentinels.  I wish I had a bucket truck that I could get up in and get a view from higher in the air...just to see if it would give the feeling that I get when I look at them.  It is almost an other world feeling...again be sure and click to enlarge to get the real feeling of the photo.I can't help but wonder what of our modern conveniences will be left two or three hundred years from now and what will future people think of them.  Will they know what they were and their uses?Isn't she lovely?  Isn't she wonderful?I had wondered if she would be afraid if I had my camera with me to take pictures but she wasn't at all.

Such as we have two maple trees on the south side of this house.  One is older and really needs to be taken down and even the other one is continually having a limb break out of it.  Here a month or two ago, a limb about 5 or 6 inches through broke out during a storm and  just missed our daughter's car, and only missed our house by less than 10 feet.So we have been trying to find someone to take them both out.  And both my husband and I would rather have someone that was recommended to us.  So, we got the name of a couple different people, and I started calling.  No luck.  I left messages....no luck.  I thought maybe since some students are on spring break that maybe they had taken off with their kids.So, I started again this week...and I had seen an ad in our local paper and called it.  He wanted more than what I had expected for either tree.  The old tree we really preferred it to be taken totally down, but the other I would have been fine with topping it.  Anyway, to totally take out the huge old tree that is really beginning to scare me, he wanted $1200, or to top it $800.  And to top the other tree he wanted $650.  So I told him I was checking with a couple other places.Well, the one never did call me, but the other one I managed to get in touch with and he stopped by tonight and talked to us.  He will take down both trees for less than the other guy wanted to take down just the one old tree.  And I felt confident in his abilities and that he would do it when he said he would.  So that is one huge thing off my mind...maybe in the next day or two I will have something that is new to both me and you to show."},

I had rather the post be on the right side in this photograph...I like things to lead into the photo from right to left. When I take pictures of my husbands knives, I much prefer the handle to be on the left with the blade towards the right.That being said, I still like this photo and this is the way nature did it so I will be satisfied with that. I always think it is sort of ironic just how beautiful poison ivy becomes in the fall! And sometimes I almost only have to look at it to get it! There was one period in my life when I wasn't allergic to it, then it came back with a vengeance and I try to stay out of it at all costs, or if I get in it, I go wash off with cold water as soon as possible."},

Two or three summers my nephew spent the summer with us.  I think we played in this creek ever single day, unless it was raining too much or something.  We caught crawdads and muscles, skipped rocks, shot b-b guns, and stayed cool while doing it.  This creek never got even a hint of warmness to the water, even though it was quite small.And at the watering gap for the cattle, on the neighbor's bank of the creek, there was a big uprooted sycamore tree.  I have no idea how big it actually was, but in my mind I remember it as huge.  We would take snacks and climb out on it and eat, and laugh and watch the neighbor's black angus cattle.Our girls did not have access to a creek this good as they grew up, at least not every day.  But we did spend a lot of time at the creek pictured below.  We fished and they waded and fished some.  Every summer we bought one of the cheap wading pools for toddlers and it set in our backyard.  The girls would bring home crawdads, pumpkin seed bluegills, and tadpoles and have some all summer long, or until a coon would discover them."},

I just got to thinking about when I went for my drive the other day...everywhere I went I seen buzzards.  The above vulture is the first I captured, I missed a good photo of one on top of a barn with its wings outspread.  I am not sure why they do this...I am currently trying to find the reason they do this.  If you look close at the photo below, there are two vultures on the roof towards the right side...I didn't notice them till I had done taken the pictures and I was there probably 4 or 5 minutes.  And below this is yet again another covered bridge.  It is another one in Parke County, Indiana.  It spans Sugar Creek--a place my husband and I plan to fish this summer.  We have fished it some in years past but always on the weekend.  Canoeing is very popular on this creek so not much fun to fish on the weekends.  But husband will be retiring the first week of June so we should have all the time in the world to wade this creek.He will probably use an ultra light most of the time, but I know he will fly-fish it some.  I don't fly fish...I have never tried.  If I try to picture myself fly-fishing all I can see is a wad of line back in my face.  But who knows, I might give it a try sometime.  I have an ultra light rod and reel combo that you could not buy from me--specially the rod.  They don't make it any more.  I done broke one--no, not on a fish, but during fishing.   To make a long story short, we went to the two sporting goods stores in Terre Haute, and to the Kmarts and whatever else carried rods and reels back then.  At the last Kmart we went to, they had two rods, on sale because they were the last of them, and my husband wisely insisted on buying both.   I tend to use these little jigs with a weed guard, or Johnson Silver Minnows, and sometimes beetlespins....I never fish in the creeks with live bait...though every now and then I like to take worms and go to a strip pit and throw a line out and just watch it.  Though even then, I will have the line and bobber out, but will be casting about with my ultra light.ETA:  Just found that people believe the reason vultures will stand with outspread wings are for multiple reasons:  warming the body, drying the wings, and/or baking off bacteria."},

You know, you get hold of the right end and pull and it all comes out.  I have been opening cat food and dog food like this almost since I left home 30+ years ago, and it never fails to remind me of mom.  In fact I may have said that on here before.  Back then I don't think I ever saw the string any color other than white or off white.My mom had a ball of string, only she called it twine.  And she never threw any of it away.  She used it to baste her quilt linings (backing we call them now...) into the frames.  I know she used it for other stuff, but I can't for the life of me remember anything else.  Doing the backings was the primary use.And yesterday I left my rotary cutter open for just a second and was reaching back to get it and of course, I cut myself.  Just a tiny cut, but it wanted to bleed like a stuck pig.  So I came upstairs to get a band-aid.  And that brought back that we very, very seldom had a band-aid in the house...unless it was some that company left there.  I think maybe in last year or two we might have...maybe my brother Neal will chime in here and say if he remembers.But she usually kept old sheets, and back then they were almost all white.  If one of us needed a bandage, out would come the old sheet and it would be ripped to fit the need.  If we got hurt, it did not slow us down much.  But I digress...I got to digging around in some treasures from my mom today.  She would decide she wanted to make some quilt or wall hanging and she would sit down and sometimes trace a figure, but just as often as not she would just start cutting.  Above is some of her leaves she has sat and cut...I have a whole box of other pattern parts and not sure what they go to.This is a picture of the rest of the stuff in the tin box...notice how shaky her writing is on the envelope that says Double Wedding Ring.  Late in her life her writing really did get shaky...I have a letter or two and you can really see it in it.  But back to the double wedding ring...I cannot remember how many of those she has made since I have been alive, and I know she made some before I was born.  I remember seeing an old black and white photo of quilts and I think one of them was a double wedding ring.  She had no fear of curves...or anything when it came to sewing.When she had things she wanted to save, a lot of times they were folded and rolled up and tied just like the two things above.  Actually, the one thing is a bonnet torn apart to be used as a pattern.  My mom always wore a bonnet when working in the garden...well, maybe not always but a big part of the time.  She was one of the last people I know of that would wear bonnets.   And I even have an apron or two of hers that I kept.  She was never without an apron, but I think I have told about that before so won't repeat myself.  She had the attitude that she could make anything that anyone else could...and one of her favorite sayings was that if you hadn't ever made a mistake, you hadn't done anything.  Which is pretty much true if you think about it.."},

As always, I encourage you to click to enlarge the photo.But I came up over a little hill and down, and here were all these buckets...someone is tapping the maple trees.  No one was around to talk to or I would have asked a few questions.  I am sure it takes a lot of sap to make a gallon of syrup.  I wondered as I looked around how they collected the sap...do they have a tank of some kind that they bring and fill.  These were not near a house or building of any sort so it has to be transported some way.Then the other thing today was all these lambs...I wanted to go around and pet them so bad.  But I literally know nothing about sheep.  I didn't know if I might disturb the mamas (ewes) or not.  I know some of our old cows did not like strangers around their calves, so I wondered if sheep might be that way also.  But the babies got up and started bleating and running my way...I left before they got any more worked up.  I really think they thought I should have some kind of treat for them."},

The girls still rode the bus home and about15 minutes before it was time for the bus, this dog, Keesha and our other one would be watching out the window in anticipation of their arrival.  The bus dropped them off one block west and one block south of us.I think dogs have some kind of bond with those they love.  The daughter that has the dog pictured in yesterday's post is also this dog's mom.  (This dog is still alive and lives with her.)Anyway, when  our DD was in high school she went to Florida with a friend and her parents a couple different spring breaks.Both times, on the day she was to arrive home, late in the evening or early night this dog would start pacing and watching.  Somehow or other she knew her mommy was getting closer to home.It was not my imagination.Otto, the dog of yesterday has done the same thing when I have kept him a couple times.  Both times when  the kids would be due to  start heading home, he has started going to the window and whining.  He had been perfectly happy the rest of the day.I don't remember what show on TV did a study on dogs...they set up cameras and watched dogs when their owners left.  They were in contact with the owners as they watched the dogs.  Each time the owner told that they were heading home, the dogs would go to the window and start watching.  I know some of the times, the owners had just went for a walk, but I think it also showed some that went to work, etc...."},

I just totally love this picture of him.And this is from today--my SIL had him here for a little bit and I tried to snap a picture of him.  It is hard to catch him still long enough to get one that isn't blurred.  I think in a short amount of time he and Bubbie would be best of buddies.  For some reason Bubbie really likes dogs, and part of the time our Shelby will put up with him, but other times she is nervous and jumps up and finds someplace else to be.  But Otto doesn't run...except I could see them chasing each other once they got used to it.But he has no desire to hurt at all...They take him to the local pet store with them and when he meets a new dog, a lot of the time the first thing he does is sit down, all the while his whole body wiggling with happiness.  I think it is the same thing with kids.Okay, change of subject.  Most people probably have heard of the Owl Cam--why most people call it the owl cam I don't know.  Maybe others do call it the bird cam I don't know...anyway, I have watched it for years.  If you click on the links at the side, you get to watch eagles, falcons, kestrels, osprey nest.  It is too soon to see all, but they are fun to watch.  This year they even have live video.Also, in our own state of Indiana, in Indianapolis right downtown the falcons have returned...read and see about them HERE.  Just totally amazing to me.  I don't know why but birds of prey are fascinating to me.  I love about all birds and fuzzy animals...we even have a toad that we love.  Or did...I only seen him a couple times last year so am afraid he has died.

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, March 21, 2008", "text": "More of Tennessee...Barb asked me if I had always like photography, and the answer is yes. Not quite as long as I can remember but I would say from 3 or 4th grade I wanted a camera. I am not sure how old I was when I got my first camera...I got it with Top Value stamps. Does anyone besides me remember them? I think they were red and yellow, you received so many per so much money you spent. I cannot remember how many you got per $1--but I think there was thirty pages to a book. And each page had to have a value of 50 points in it... I am not explaining it very well so will move on. My first camera was a polaroid camera...you know the kind where you pull the picture out and it develops itself. I was totally thrilled to get that camera. Just couldn't afford to take very many pictures cause I didn't have the money to buy film.Then I think in high school I moved right uptown and got an instamatic made by Kodak that took the cartridges of film--mine was the 126 size. And these are pictures I took with it. I think I still have that camera. Then I went a year to a local college and the second semester there I took a coarse in photography where I learned to develop black and white film. I actually bought another camera--it was a Canon 35 mm, but not an SLR. While there at college, I would also set in on another photography class sometimes and saw some neat ways to alter pictures. Multiple exposures is one I really remember standing out, and then there was another way of working with the negatives and ending in a very stark B & W photo--no shades of gray. I was so stupid then...that professor would have let me do anything. I should have taken advantage and sat in all the classes. And would have shown me how to do any of it. Anyway, these are photos from when I was a child....I thought my family would get a kick out of seeing them on here."},

I am one of the two that was born in the hospital. The rest my mom had at home. We did not have electricity till I was 2 or 3, according the my brothers and sisters.This is not from home, just a picture I took somewhere here in Indiana on some of my rambling around. I think getting out and just driving and literally not knowing where I am exactly is one of my favorite things to do. I always head out with a full tank of gas because sometimes houses are few and far between, besides being miles from any gas station. I am pretty sure this is from the northern part of Vermillion County, but I could not go to it. Just sort of remember being north when I came across it.This is Old Bob's collar--he was our old work horse. He wasn't a draft horse...just normal size. They got him long before I was born when he was 5 years old and he lived till the ripe old age of 32/33...I think I was 16 at the time he got down and could not get back up. We had to have the vet come put him down, it was cold weather and he was out in the pasture. Could not get up to come to the barn. I think if I remember right that my brother took bales of hay and built a wall to block the wind. And one of the coon hounds guarded him and growled when the vet came to put him down the next morn.I don't think I have a picture of him any where...he was white. And just part of the family. They built the new house about a mile away from the old place...at first if he was lose, he would go back up there. Then after he became used to his new home, my dad and another man had him up at the old place doing something. When lunch time came they must have unhooked him...or maybe my dad just rode him up there. Anyway, they dropped his reins just to let him graze. He took off and went to his new home.He was retired most all that I remember. And in later life we would let him out of the pasture to some of the grass that was not under fence but was still ours...he would never have dreamed of leaving home. Nor did he wander into the road. We did have a close call with a train though. And it put a stop to his being outside the fence.See, the train normally only went up the holler and down late in the evening...and for some unknown reason it came along about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon. Totally earlier than it ever came...and he was grazing right near the track, and the train blew its horn...if it had not blown its horn he would have been fine. But getting right on him and blowing the horn scared him and he took off running....luckily he ran away from the track eventually.As to the piece of chain with the collar, I have no idea what it is for. Maybe someone out there can tell me.Another tale about him, one time we sold a calf. It was out in the pasture and my dad just told the guy to go ahead and get it if we weren't there. Ended up he came while we were gone, and went out to get the calf, and Bob chased him out of the pasture...would not let him near the calf. If he would have stood his ground, Bob probably wouldn't have done anything but he would bluff a person if he could. And he could, so the guy had to come back when we were home."},

I almost think there is a little fairy that lives down there..I was changing threads yesterday or the day before and threading it as I had threaded it for the quilting.  I do not know how many times I have had the thought that the way I had threaded it did not follow the path of most machines I have used.  And I have glanced at the book numerous times.  And I mean NUMEROUS times...I looked at the way I threaded it and I thought that just is not right...and looked at the book one more time even though I thought it was useless.  This time I clearly saw that it should be threaded the way I thought it should be threaded!  They say confessions are good for the soul, but this one is sort of embarrassing.Anyway, now I am anxious to try quilting something else....I would like to get enough crumb blocks made to assemble into a small quilt and try quilting again.  I cannot believe now that it quilted as well as it did with it being threaded wrong...it only seemed to break when I was going over a place where 4 points met."},

Well, I can but I don't get the expected photos...it is too weird and too long to try to go into detail.  And I spent too much time with the clone tool to go back and scan them in at a smaller size.I tried using my software to get a better photo out of this but I couldn't.  It is the Narrows Bridge in Parke County, Indiana.  It was built in 1883 by J.A. Britton, and retired from use in 1960 when a regular two lane paved bridge was built next to it.   The bridge  is still sound.I thought I would show some of the structure of the bridge since I had these photos that really show it well.  This is the bottom of it--can you imagine building this in 1883?  I really wonder what kind of tools they had to accomplish this.The picture above as well as the two below show the inside of the bridge.   I love to imagine the sound of a horse walking through it...I am not sure how long the bridge is...if I find out later tonight I will edit and add the length here.There are different views as to why bridges were built covered, some of the reasons being:1.   to protect the wood structure of the bridge.  In ways I tend to think this might be the right one.2.  I have heard it thought it was to keep the bridge from getting iced over in bad winter weather.  I think that is even sound reasoning.3.  still another reason is to keep horses from being scared when walking across them....I know I have read of other reasons but right now these are the ones that stick in my mind."},

When my husband got home, we put up new clotheslines...so now I can hang sheets, and towels outside when the weather is nice.  There is just something so nice about going to bed on sheets that have hung in the sunshine.I have also got to try to be prepared to get a picture of Mama Squirrel and Puss Puss, aka the princess.  She comes up on our back porch to eat sunflower seeds and to have me feed her nuts.  She realizes that Shelby, our dog will not hurt her.  She will be sitting on one side of me and Shelby on the other and she is fine with that.However, Puss Puss wants out so bad...if the inside door is open, she is always sitting looking out the storm door.  Tonight, I fed Mama Squirrel before we put up the clotheslines.  As we were working on that, I looked toward the house, and there was Mama Squirrel nose to nose with Puss Puss with only the glass separating them!  I do not know if it was because Shelby was also there, or if she was actually just teasing the cat.Then after I came in, I happened in the kitchen and there they were again, but she was gone before I could get my camera.  I would like to know what goes through her mind...and I am wondering will she have babies again this spring.  We are wanting to have this old maple tree cut down, or at least topped real good.  So I am kind of wondering how she will react to that.  We are really hoping it doesn't bother her...last fall she had her second litter across the street in a different tree."},

{"title": "From Fowler Park", "date": "Sunday, March 9, 2008", "text": "First let me say that if not for Paula, I might not have got these posted...I had tried going down to just two pictures at a time with no luck, so when she suggested I try just uploading one I iddn't have anything to lose.  As you can see it worked!  So a big thanks goes out to her.Roger and I went out for breakfast this morn and then for a short drive to Fowler Park south of Terre Haute.  And the following are some pictures I took there.  I am not saying that I love this picture, but I would dearly love to have this cabin for my own.  Still not my reason for showing it to you,I wanted you to see the cabin to show you what building this chimney belongs to.  I just love this chimney!  We could not go inside, but did look and it has the regular fireplace part, but also to the side is an oven area.Again, not a great picture, and this is NOT the cabin above, but I like it.  I took it, as well as the two below it through a window.  This window was not glass--well at least the one you see through on the other side was plexiglass...or however you spell it.  I didn't really notice when I took this one.I like the two pictures below also...normally the reflections would aggravate me but I thought it is probably the only way you will ever see a picture of me on here.  I hate my picture being taken, especially posed.  If someone snaps a picture of me doing something I don't mind so much.  I usually hate it if they tell me to look and smile though!I am have a time with uploading my pictures...I have tried numerous times in the last few minutes and I keep getting the message to try again in 30 seconds! As I was sitting here waiting for the pictures to upload, I was looking at the small calender that I have by the computer.  It has the  initials  N.M., F.Q., F.M. and L. Q.--as any sane person probably knows they stand for New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon and Last Quarter.   Since I am a quilter and we have our own language, I seen the F.Q. and immediately thought Fat Quarter.  Which is a different way of buying a quarter yard of fabric.  Instead of a 9 inch cut across the width of the fabric, the fabric is first cut 18 inches which is half a yard.  That is cut down the middle length ways giving you a piece of fabric 18 inches long by 22 inches wide.Of course instead of thinking full moon for FQ, my first thoughts were free motion quilting.  The feeddogs on the machine is dropped, a special hopping foot is put on and at least on my Juki, but not on my Pfaff, I take all the pressure off the pressure foot.  So I can guide the material through and go any direction I want...the feed dogs do not pull it through.  Which also means I am in control of stitch length, too, another story in itself.The LQ need to be LQS--but still the LQ made me immediately think of Local Quilt Store.  I had the opportunity to go to mine yesterday but I didn't need anything and didn't need to spend the money so thought it best if I avoided the place.  She has the most beautiful selection of fabric anywhere and I can never enter and leave the place without buying at least a half yard of fabric and lucky if that is all.Still no luck uploading the pictures.  I will try again later tonight...not that they are anything great.  Just wanted to share something with you."},

I am not complaining!  Although it is very tempting to head south for a drive.  When I was a kid, and we got some of the deeper snows, one of my favorite things to do was to take bites of snow off everything.  Be it a fence post, or the branch of an evergreen tree.  When the snow was heavy laden on the branches, it was too much to resist.  It would make me so thirsty--more so than working in the hot sun most days.Or joy of joys, if we were allowed to make snow cream.  We would get a mixing bowl or pan of snow, add evaporated milk, sugar, and vanilla flavoring, then mix well with a spoon....and emmm-mmm good!   In our mind, it was the next best thing to ice cream."},

The binding is approximately 300 inches long by 2 3/8 inches wide...it has to be folded in half to make it 1 3/16 inches wide. If I sit and finger press it first while I watch tv or something, it then does not take long at all to press with the iron.

I guess it is still there, but now it has snow added to it.  It started snowing after dark and we probably got an inch or two.  I am debating on getting up and going for a drive tomorrow morn.  I don't worry so much about my driving...I would take my husband's 4-wheel drive truck.  But other people can really drive crazy.The top picture is the tip of a branch of my crabapple tree and the bottom is the top of a 'post'--a post made from a railroad tie.Anyway, my daughter got home this evening and asked me what had happened this morn out on the highway.  Traffic was stopped and backed up when she headed to work.  So I got the newspaper in and someone had ran into the back of a semi truck that was just taking off from a stoplight.  The vehicle got stuck under the semi and the semi dragged it for about 400 feet.  They had to about take the entire top off the vehicle to get the driver out.They said road conditions did not seem to be a factor.  Of course my thoughts are is someone had their ear glued to a cell phone--I have had a few too many close calls with people headed straight for me while talking on their cell phone.  Anyway, it might not have been that at all--maybe someone had not had a good night's sleep and fell asleep.  Who knows?  Just glad it wasn't me.And I must say that it is quite the opposite of what usually happens at these two stop lights.  Usually it is the semis that run the redlights and hit someone...my husband had a friend that was hit when one ran one, I have a friend that was hit, but not hurt bad.  My husband's friend was off work for a LONG time....and there have been several other accidents which involved semis running the light. On to another topic for just a second...I did start FMQing the other baby quilt.  I am still using my coats and clark thread and still having problems.  I just don't want to go buy more thread.  I really wish some of my Essentials quilting thread matched but it doesn't.  I have had really good success with it without it costing me an arm and a leg.I have used Aurifil and really like it, but not any better than the Essentials...and I have bought one spool of Sulky and just about swore off it because it was the worse I have ever had!  And it was the thread...I switched machines, needles, etc, and nothing helped till I went to a different  thread.  Someone told me it was because it was variegated blue.  Something about that particular color and the amount of dye used.  So, I may give it another try someday.  But probably not as long as I can get the color I want in another brand."},

Right now, I don't have a preference, yet I know if I wake tomorrow to 3 or 4 inches I will probably feel the thrill that school children feel at the possibility of school being canceled.  And I will want to take a few new pictures.And this is one of the things I did today...actually, they just came out of the oven a few minutes ago.  I make my pie crusts from scratch, and don't know what I do different.  But I always seem to tear them getting them on the pie.  They are still light and flakey...still delicious.  But I used to never have any problem whatsoever.... I am debating on having a piece.  My husband will take at least one to work for him and his buddies.  I actually owe one of his best friends a pie.  He loves my apple pies...these are made from Granny Smith apples.This friend is always one of the first to volunteer if my husband needs help carrying something down into our basement.  He helped on my first big office desk/sewing table.  And had volunteered for the last one, but other buddies close by came and helped.Other than the pies, I did cook supper.  And earlier in the day I got the other baby quilt pin basted, but have yet to do the first stitching on it.  I will probably start on it tomorrow sometime.  It is so nice to not have a deadline on it.  But I do want to get it done till I can work on something else."},

I started about 9:00 a.m. and finally finished the binding at 2:00 a.m. Not a mistake on the time--I started 9:00 on Friday morn and just finished a couple hours ago and it is now Saturday. It has been washed and dried....I always have to wash a quilt the first time. I have a fear of one either falling apart or the colors running. If this doesn't make much sense, I am too tired to think straight.I use a spray bottle and make a mixture of retayne and water and spritz the whole thing down, plus I use a color catcher in the wash. So far, I have had good luck this way. These are not very good pictures but at this time in the morn, I was making myself get these cause I know it leaves here early tomorrow morn.

Every time I run across this picture I almost laugh out loud.  They were just totally passed out...have that goofy look with their eyes half open but they are really out of it.  They had been playing hard!Otherwise, I didn't start quilting till tonight...I am just doing a loop-d-loop design with 5-point stars thrown in.  I should have spent more time warming up, cause some of the quilting is kind of herky-jerky.  But it will hold the layers together and be fine for a baby to roll around on.  It is a bit more than a baby quilt...should call it a kid quilt.My thread started shredding before I got done--I seem to have problems with Coats and Clark thread when free motion quilting...but it was all that was available at Joann's the other day.

It also might be that I was getting tired.Maybe I will have something finished tomorrow.this is my new iron--I really, really like it.

I am even ready and willing to mow the yard again! I am so ready for tomatoes out of my own garden. (Yes that is tomato blooms in the second picture) And I am ready to hang out clothes again--at least when I want to. I could now but they would be coming in frozen stiff as a board. And I do remember when my mom had no other choice. I can remember her bringing in jeans that would stand on their own. But I don't remember what she did with them when she brought them in like that.Speaking of jeans, I also remember having to iron them...I remember when almost everything was ironed. Speaking of ironing leads to todays challenges...I had laundry going and was going to make the backings for the baby quilts. I had to iron the last two borders on the last baby quilt. I ironed the first and sewed the second border on and was trying to iron it...I discover that my iron has quit. I switched plugs just to make sure...no luck.I came upstairs and checked on the QYW forum to see what others had recommended in the past...while doing that I happened to think about consumer reports. Their tests were from a year or two past, but the highest recommended was one of the Black and Decker models...so with it in mind plus the other two best buys recommended, I headed to our local Walmart. The shelves there were almost bare!I decided to come home and call a few stores to see what I could find...it did take me at least an hour to check with 6 places. Everyone seemed to be working short-handed. So it took longer....but finally found one at Sears. The one with the highest rating...so I called my husband to stop on his way home from work and pick it up for me. I just did not feel like getting back out in the cold. It did make me appreciate the fact that I didn't have to, that I don't have to hang clothes outside in weather like this, that I have a warm and safe house to sleep in....yet I can't help but be ready for spring to arrive."},

Even though they were lifelong friends I never heard my mom call her anything other than Mrs. Hayes.  (Also, when Mrs. Hayes referred to her husband she always called him Mr. Hayes)  But that is not the point.These two women loved to quilt more than anyone I know.  And that was long before the invention of rotary cutters, and quick strip piecing methods.  I would love to know how many quilts either one of them made, but especially my mom.  She almost continually sewed on something.  She would see a quilt she liked and sit and fiddle with it till she got a pattern made.   Her template was cardboard--like what is on the back of a spiral notebook.And she did not sit and trace around the pattern for each piece...it was made with the seam allowance included and she would layer 3 or 4 pieces of fabric together and just hold the template pattern and fabric together in her hand and cut around it...sometimes she might use one pin but more often than not she didn't use any.Mrs. Hayes was a neighbor until I turned 5 or 6, and then she moved a few miles away.  It might as well have been 100 in some ways.  My mom nor dad drove--dad couldn't because he had muscular dystrophy and had not the strength in his legs to use a clutch.  Mom was too nervous to drive.  Till my brothers had their own cars, they always had to depend on a neighbor to take them to the doctor or to the grocery.When there was finally a vehicle in the family, we still didn't do much visiting.  Maybe go see Mrs. Hayes two or three times a year at the most.  By the time I was driving, she lived in a town that we sometimes shopped in and every time we were there, we stopped if we had a little bit of time.  Probably once a month.And almost every time we stopped, I would have her drag out all her quilts and quilt tops and show me...she never seemed to mind at all.  Her and mom would talk quilting and talk about old times.  But you never got far with Mrs. Hayes for when she told a story, she told all the tiniest details...if she mentioned a name she would tell who their mom and dad were, who they were married to, etc etc.  But I would give anything to be able to relive a little bit of that time.My mom passed away in 1996, on February 20th to be exact.  Sometimes it seems like a lifetime ago, and others only yesterday."},

That is when all the trees bloom at the same time and every bloom opens at once....I had broken my leg and had on a walking cast so it was definitely too wet for me to get out in the orchard. It was absolutely one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever in my life witnessed. And wonder will I ever see it again.I set and looked trying to decide if I know which rows of trees these are--I think the row on the left is red delicious and the row on the right is yellow delicious. As long as I worked there and as many trees as I had to climb down out of, you would think they would each and everyone have a name.I will try to change subjects now...think I have just been missing the place and I for sure miss my boss. He passed away last year after a long----I don't know the word. He had a major stroke and was never the same. It happened in 2001, he lost his ability to walk, talk, eat. Yet his face just glowed with happiness when we were all in the house at lunch and talking and laughing. When he was well, it was always very entertaining...He always sat and told tales of his childhood, or else told stories on his own children. Or tales of when he was an insurance salesman. I would give anything to have recorded the conversations. He has made me laugh till I was literally sick from laughing so hard. His daughter-in-law and I can still get to laughing over tales he told us...and they were all true is what makes them even funnier.Now, to what is currently happening....it's another cold, cold day here in the midwest....I don't think it got out of the 20's the entire day. Of course that is not cold compared to some. Knowing that does not make me appreciate it any more.I did sew quite a bit today on the baby quilt tops. I should have had them done but kept getting detoured by little things. For one thing I paid to download Norton 360 to my computer last night. Nothing is ever simple for me and this computer...it literally took a couple hours to do it. And it was NOT that it was slow to download. At first would not accept my name, email, etc. Had to go back and start from scratch more than once. Then I had to un-install some things. You name it, it will happen to me.Then today every time I got on it seemed like the connections were taking so long. So I would fool around and look...found one article that stated that it did not support theFirefox browser...don't know what the heck that means exactly. Finally wrote the tech support and I think it means basically that I have to have internet explorer as my default web browser to get the live updates. I had never changed that. And I haven't done anything different really, but it seems to be working better tonight. So maybe it was ISP having problems....Hopefully tomorrow I will have pictures of the finished tops to post....if nothing else happens."},

The owner went in business with a friend not far from the orchard.  There we raised these beautiful blackberries, as well as strawberries, raspberries, watermelons, cantaloupe, pumpkins, decorative gourds, and we raised tomatoes one year.  Oh, I forgot we had blueberries bushes that started baring fruit.We planted these peach trees the first year I worked there year round.  I don't remember how long it took to get this crop of peaches and nectarines...not very long at all.  Out of probably 8 years it was the only crop that survived our harsh winters.  Both my boss and the other guy had health issues; these trees along with five(eta:  I don't know why I wrote five--it was more like 10 or 12 ) long, long rows of peach trees that his daughter-in-law and I bud-grafted were bulldozed out.  The strawberry rows were plowed out...a sad but happy time for me in so many ways.  The strawberries all had drip irrigation, and were planted on small ridges covered through the plastic film that has become popular here in the past years.  The drip tube was buried in the ridge under the plastic film layer.  One of my many jobs was to get the irrigation going once spring rolled around.  The ground was almost pure sand so irrigation was a must.  That was the chore that I was not going to miss.    The first patch had 50 rows of strawberries that were 400 feet long, then we added to them each year.  The rows added were 800 feet long though.  I do miss working on the irrigation at all...the only way I survived it was to look at it as one giant puzzle! I had to walk the row to the end and feel the end of the irrigation line to see if water was reaching the end.  As many times as not, it wasn't.  So then I would walk back and every so often dig down to find the plastic drip tube.  When I found where the water was, then I had to figure out where the leak was--sometimes it was easy to find cause there would be a big, noticeable wet spot.  But lots of times there were numerous places where mice had chewed, or maybe a deer had bounded through and the hoof sunk deep enough to cut the line.  No, repairing irrigation lines is not my favorite job.Sampling the fruit was never a chore--one of these peaches would not be a bad thing right now!  Since I worked there, fruit bought in stores just never tastes quite as good.  And apples are never as good as when you reach and pick one and eat it!"},

You might see one or two here and there in the orchard, but there are always more on the Fujis than all the rest of the orchard combined. Anyway, Arkansas Blacks are a gormet cooking apple, the taste will vary with how much rain we have had, and they are the hardest apple I have ever seen. I know I have NOT seen half the varieties, but believe me this is a solid apple. The people that tried them at the orchard seemed to either love them or hate them--no in between.Now this picture below would probably be in the top ten favorites that I have ever taken...don't know if it that the picture is that good or if it is because I LOVE these apples--they are Blushing Golden. They are such a full rounded flavor...and so juicy. It was after the harvest one fall, and I was cleaning out under the trees--using a weedeater, etc. I was back in the farthest corner from the house and getting so hungry, but didn't want to stop before I finished. I found one of these apples, ate it, and have loved them ever since.These apples are EarliBlaze--an early cooking apple. We used to could count on starting picking them around August 20th. The past few years what few they have left is usually picked right around August 1...these are not necessarily a favorite apple of mine. I just like the picture."},

As anyone who has been reading this for a while knows, I have a couple baby quilts I need to make.  I have been having a hard time getting motivated to do any of it though.  But over the past week or so I have started...and while both tops should have been done in a couple days, I have been dragging my feet and had a couple other problems thrown in.I decided the other day that the time is NOW to get them done.  So yesterday and the day before I devoted a big part of my day to them.  What happened the first day was all my fault...I made six blocks, and went down that night to do some preparation work for yesterday only to discover I had sewn the wrong red fabric in two blocks--even with my  road map I messed up.  That was frustrating enough--I spent a while ripping out the wrong fabric and I did sew in the correct fabric.Last night I was working on the last four blocks, on the last round of strips, and when I pressed one open, I noticed that the previous color I had pressed was scorched!  Looked bad!  How did that happen?  I had not left the iron setting on it at all, I had merely gave the strips a quick press to press them open.  I had no idea if it could be washed out...thought I would give a little rub with a damp cloth.  The fabric TORE!The fabric was used in four blocks, two strips to each block.  I ripped it out of every one of the blocks, and am contemplating ripping out this other fabric.  I am just so disgusted.  It is fabric from Joann's and while I thought it was cheap, I thought it was a step above some of the really cheap fabric.  But I would hate to make the tops and them fall apart once the quilt is finished.  But the other color is on the edge of the quilt and I don't know if there would be that much stress on it or not.  What do you think?"},

I must say that the service from Thousands of Bolts was excellent....I thought shipping a bit high but I got 15 1/2 yards of material for a total of $67, which includes shipping.  I didn't so much mind the shipping--I ordered Sunday, got a call from them Monday asking about the 7 yards of fabric I ordered.  They had a 6 1/2 yd piece and a yard piece, and could I work with that or did it  have to be in one piece, and they would give me the 7 1/2 yards for the 7 yard price....I didn't even have to think about that and said yes.  I got the fabric yesterday--so you can bet when I need something again I will think of them.Of course, those prices were not as good a deal as a $1 a yard that Laurie and her TSB(another Laurie) found.

If it is Mama Squirrel she will come running from across the street or down the street when I call her...this is her baby because it knows my voice, and perks up if I peck on the window.  It knows to stick around for food.  Mama will also come up on the back porch and hang from the storm door letting me know that she is hungry...she will sit with me at the picnic table or I can sit on the edge of the porch and she will sit beside me and eat....but she will not allow me to touch her still.  Though she still feels entirely free to grab my hand and pull it to her to see if there is anything in it.Now to quilting, this is one of the best hints I have ever heard for quilting.  I thought taking pictures would be the best way to show what I mean. I am not sure where I heard it first, but it is NOT something I thought of.  And I have seen others do something similiar but they don't carry it this far.  I have seen people mark their rulers by sticking post it notes on the top side of their rulers, but the very best thing is to use at least a stack of three post it notes and stick on the under side of the ruler on the exact line you want to cut.When you have your fabric layered, and after you make the first squaring up cut, you just butt these up to the fabric.  You can feel them meet almost, and for sure see easier.  And you don't make near as many mistakes cutting the wrong size.I have to have a 2 1/2 inch square but for my current project, I found it easier to use my little 4 inch ruler marked this way because it is easier to hold on to than to hold the little 2 1/2 inch ruler without moving it.If I am cutting across the width of the fabric, I will use at least three stacks of post-it notes on the under side of the 24 inch ruler.  And if it is bigger squares, I use what I feel comfortable with to get the exact size I want.And this is one of the blocks I have made...so you can kind of see what I should be doing instead of playing on here."},

I had planned to sew today, but instead had to run errands to pick up animal food and a few other things at Walmart.  And then by the grocery.  I came home and decided to clean out the fridge...it had lots of odds and ends in it that needed to be taken care of.So, since my sewing machines and all that is all in the basement and I never made it down there...I didn't know there was a problem till my hubby got home.  He had gotten so dirty at work, that he went directly down there to take his clothes off and throw them directly in the wash.There was a huge puddle of water...to make a long story short..in the end we found that the actual sewer drain was not draining.  He had to go to the chiropractor tonight, came home and we ate a quick supper, then ran to a Harbor Freight store and just bought a rotor rooter.  We decided since we have this problem every so often, instead of paying to rent a machine and have the chore of getting it up and down the basement stairs, we would just buy one and it could stay down there.There were tree roots in the sewer...got them out. Then cleaned up the huge puddle down there.  I always take bleach water after that and scrub down the whole floor...then dry it again.  NOT fun.But I am so thankful to have a husband who is capable of taking care of things like that and I don't have to live with them till we can call someone in. .I actually know how to do it myself--just not sure I am strong enough to do some of it.  When you feed the coil of the rotor rooter through you have to hang on to it or it can really whip back out and cause some damage. It is too hard for my tired brain to explain right now...and I still have dishes to do and need to finish  that load of clothes."},

It is always a thrill to find it.  When I am in my actual photos I will try to watch for a picture to scan of it after it turns gold in the fall--I can't remember if the ones I have have berries on them or not.  When I was a kid, digging it was allowed all year long....now there is a season just like everything else.  If the summer is been extremely dry, it will be gone by the time the season rolls around.Robert Morgan has written two or three books--the first I read was Gap Creek.  It is a work of fiction.  Of course I had to read it--that is the name of the creek that ran by home.  Even though the author is from North Carolina, he disappointed me.  He talks about finding ginseng in the attic of the house--I forget the number of roots found but it was a ridiculously low number and he said they made 3/4's of a pound.The other thing, in Gap Creek, he has the the family rendering lard on the kitchen stove.  And it splashes out and catches fire.  This is the part that really got me...everyone I knew always rendered their lard outside for a number of reasons.  Safety was one...at least while people still used wood burning stoves.  Probably later, it was just to conserve on electric bills.   When my mom made it, she used a huge cast iron kettle and it was usually full of cut fat.  It would have taken two or three days to do as much in the kitchen.I kept telling myself that it was a work of fiction....to read it and enjoy the rest of it.  But then he came out with a book about Daniel Boone.  Again he mentions ginseng...this time he says it is hard to recognize in the winter without the leaves or berries.  I feel like saying DUMMY!  There is nothing to recognize in the winter.  It all dies back--there is not one thing left to recognize.  I think he has heard people talk about berries and immediately thinks in terms of blackberries, raspberries, etc that leaves the briers.  I did not read the rest of the book, even though he surely did more actual research about Boone.  It makes me wonder what all I have read and took as fact that was not at all true."},

I have been having trouble lately settling into any book.  It is an uncomfortable feeling;  reading is as necessary for me as sunshine is for flowers.

I took the boys to the vet to be neutered yesterday...so that is done.  Both boys and girls now lack the ability to reproduce...so many people will not get boys fixed...but that is just as important in my book as the girls.

I don't know just how he got my brother out of the mess into safety, cause it was only the two of them there, but he did it.We also got my husband's paperwork for retirement mailed in...that is a big load off my mind.  I am so glad  to have that done.  He is supposed to retire June 3 of this year...hopefully we will get in plenty of fishing this year.  I have sure missed that over the past few years.  When I worked I did not have the energy left over to go...then the past couple years I go a few times by myself or with my daughter, but feel guilty cause he is working.

Today was warm enough till a light jacket was the most needed to keep warm, and not even really necessary.  Then tonight about 6:00 p.m. the wind started rolling through and has howled.  I think the weatherman said there were gusts up to 50 or 60 miles an hour.  There were tornado warnings in some areas, and severe storm watch the rest of the counties near here.  It went from around 50 degrees at noon, to 10 degrees F. right now.  The roads are icy and slick.  Just a few flurries, but it rained before it turned so cold and that froze.I have been fooling with this summer sausage my husband and his friends made from deer meat and pork roasts...I had to bake it for 4 hours on a low temp in the oven.  Then it has to cool out completely at room temperature before we put it back in the fridge.  He and two of his buddies and one of their sons worked about 6 hours Sunday making it.  He brought home so much that we will be having to find people to give it to.Last night I did go down and kind of get my sewing area cleaned up a little...I had planned to sew today but other things come up.  Tomorrow is another day...but I done know two jobs I have to do.  One is to got to the post office to mail in my husband's retirement papers...and I need to go buy some groceries.Three views of the same barn....it is another barn that I really, really like. A few years ago, I was afraid it was starting to go downhill because part of the roofing was torn loose, then last year some doors were blown almost off and hanging by one hinge. I was surprised and very happy to see the roof repaired--can you imagine who had the nerve to climb up there. It was on the very top peak that the roofing was blown loose. And they took the doors down, so it is still a handsome barn."},

To be more specific I want to go back to Bridgeton and get a new shot of the covered bridge there...this one is the new rebuilt bridge.  Notice the ice in the picture at the left side, below below the dam....that gives you an idea of how cold it has been.  The thought that crossed my mind when I first noticed the ice was tree mushrooms--called oyster mushrooms in the National  Audubon's book of mushrooms.From there we went to Mansfield and north from there.  We saw wild turkeys, several hawks, blue herons, and this guy here....a young bald eagle.  We saw him once right below the damn...I had seen him from a distance the other day and at first assumed he was a buzzard.  This time he was right over us and we could see he was a bird of prey and not a hawk.As we left the place and was starting to pull out on the main road, I saw an adult bald eagle taking flight across the way....so we proceeded back the way we had come to follow the creek and hopefully see the eagle.  We had not gone very far when my daughter spotted this guy...these pictures are cropped and reduced in size...if not for that you would see how blurry  they are.  Still a very exciting evening for us.One thing that totally surprised me, he was not as easily spooked at the blue herons...they take flight at nothing.  Part of the time I can slow down, but soon as I start to roll my window down they take flight.  This guy, he just sat.  I got out of the car and walked a little bit nearer, and finally waved my arms to get him to fly.  I wanted him to fly one way, but instead he flew the other.When I was a kid, I would never in my life have dreamed I would get to see bald eagles in the wild.  For that matter, didn't think I would see wild turkeys.  Or coyotes.  I see the turkeys on a regular basis, see coyotes fairly often, eagles not so often.  But you can bet I will be heading back to this place every chance I get...I just wish I had a longer lens!  And that I didn't get so excited..."},

We were just sure he belonged to someone--I posted pictures around town looking for the owner and no one ever called.  He could always be found laying up against our front door every morning.  About the time I became convinced no one was going to claim him, he disappeared.  I drove every street in this town and alleys too, looking for him.

I finished the cutting Sunday I think...I would have finished a lot quicker if I had used common sense.  I have no idea why I did this, but I cut all the reds and part of the greens, a single strip at a time!  I have no idea what possessed me to cut that way.  I cut the rest stacking my fabrics as usual--4-6 fabrics--then cutting the strips.  I really prefer cutting about 4 strips at a time...but did do 6 a time or two.  I am really happy with the varieties of fabric I have except for the reds...I sure could have used more variety in them--they all read about the exact same tone of color.

Near the end of October....they were taken in nearby Parke County, Indiana. It is famous for its covered bridges, 31 of them the last I heard. Every October, starting the second Friday in October there is a Covered Bridge Festival. Crafters and vendors set up in every little town in the county....there is food galore. People come from miles and miles to visit. I think the estimate is in the millions. I know one couple that come up from Missouri every year to go...she buys a lot of her Christmas gifts then.And all roads for miles around are lined with yard sales...if you had the time you could find almost anything you every wanted...the key word here being time. I think I like the yard sales as much as the crafter's and vendor's booths. And I for sure don't have much luck with the food, though there are a couple places I always have good luck with. It is just when I decide to try something new that I make my mistakes.The bridge picture above is older--it is a photo scanned in. In 2005, an arsonist burned it down.

So to get myself calmed down and farther design it in Quilt pro...it shouldn't be hard.Not sure when I will get to it...I want to get up tomorrow and do something in this  house.  And I have got to start on the retirement papers for my husband.  I cannot delay too long on that.  So, guess I better hush here and think about settling myself down till I can sleep!"},

Next,  just to come to the decision how I want to use them...that is the hard part for me.  The second one down is the one that my daughter wants me to use for her secretary.  I got enough of it to do two baby quilts.  I think the scenes on it are just about, but not quite 7 inches square.The top one is going to be harder...I haven't measured them but they are big--about 9 1/2 inches by 12 inches...I wish I had had my camera to take a picture of the top the store had made from it.  It was quite interesting...Now the jungle animal one I thought to lay a ruler on it so you can kind of get an idea...and even two of the others have their own tape measure printed with them, just not sure if you can read it in the enlarged picture.And this bottom one--these are small squares.  I can use a 4 inch ruler and it will give seam allowance without cutting into the picture if I remember correctly.  They are the perfect size to use as the center of a log cabin....or I can see using them in a 9-patch.I know I only have two baby quilts I want to make, but I thought I better take advantage and buy more than I needed...good things like this don't come along every day.  Each one had a good feel to the fabric and that made them even more hard to resist....BTW, it is STILL raining...it has not totally stopped all day.  Sometimes it rains harder than others but never actually stopped."},

Come summer time, we will be wishing we had some of this.  So I am trying not to complain....actually, it just makes me want to snuggle in a quilt and read a book. I keep feeling like I am coming down with the sinus thing my husband just got over and my daughter now has.  Part of the time I have to constantly have a kleenex with me, and my chest feels so tight.  I just don't feel like doing much of anything.I did make myself a new pair of pjs...I cut them out a few days ago.  No big chore there--they consist of one pattern piece!  So quick to make.  I used slinky type of material....I didn't notice to see what it was actually called.  It is not even 1% cotton...a big departure for me.  And it would have been cheaper just to go buy a pair.  However, I need the satisfaction of making something every now and then.So, for seaming them together, I decided to drag out my serger.  That was a first for a long, long time.  So I took the old thread off--it had gathered too much dust.  Though not too bad considering how long it has sat...it sets on a shelf in my sewing desk that can be pulled out.  But it has set there with the door shut for a few years.Anyway, I had to get the book out to re-thread it...and my boy came down.   He tried his best to help but he is all paws and no thumbs!  He was just into rubbing on everyhting and trying to look and see--reaching in with his paws.  Finally, when I wouldn't let him do anything, he got bored and left the area.  It took a couple tries for me to get it going.  I sewed the crotch seams one night and did the edges of the top of them and the bottom of the legs till they wouldn't ravel.  About that time daughter went to be so I stopped cause my sewing is directly beneath her bed...I was down there for something yesterday and sewed the leg seams...then ran down last night and did the hemming and putting the elastic in the waist.  It feels good to actually make and finish something.Daughter and I did run over to Arthur, Illinois over the weekend.  I found good stuff there...not Winnie the Pooh, but several different cheater squares to work with.  I will try to think and take pictures after while.  Not sure just how I am going to use them, but I sure like what I got...check back later to see if I have posted pictures."},

They are approx. 4 feet high.  Then if this door is open, he jumps to the top of it and walks back and forth...and he will walk on the door casing above the door, also.  This is old, old woodwork...it is not just straight frames around the doors.  There are all these little extras.  Anyway, the top part of the door casing--it has the board that is directly around the door...that lays flat to the wall.  Then on top of the piece across the top, there is an additional piece that is routered....not good at explaining this.  Just trying to get to the point where you can understand when I say he has a two-inch width to walk on so it is possible.    But he didn't do it when I was taking these pictures.Bubbie has discovered that he CAN get on top of the fridge--and has been up there two or three times today.  For what reason, I do not know.  Unless it is just because he can.  He is a very adventurous cat...and plays with my husband when he comes home from work.  They chase each other through the house.He and the Puss Puss still race Pops to the bedroom when he goes in there--any time he heads in there they think it is PLAYTIME--even if he is going to bed.  They try to race through the door before he closes it.Sewed a few lines on my scrap blocks, but they just do not capture my heart.  And I still have come to no decisions about the baby quilts I want to make.  I am trying to not dwell on it so much and hoping that it just comes to me.  I really would like to mainly use fabric I have in my stash, but would not mind buying some.  Something with characters I could fussy cut or else have little cheater blocks I could built around....we shall see.I may head over to Arthur, IL to look at a couple fabric stores there in the next week or two.  I love to go over there--it is Amish country."},
{"title": "Buttons", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2008", "text": "I must tell that this post is inspired by Barb --her picture and what she has to say both.This shows my button box--or button tin as is the case.  It contains buttons both from my mom and also Grammy...my husband's grandmother.  This was Grammy's button box/tin.  She wasn't much of a seamstress--didn't own a sewing machine.  She could sew on a button or manage to hem a pair of pants, and that was about it for her.The button box when I grew up was a tin box also but rectangle in shape...it was about 7 inches long, 4 inches wide, and probably 3 inches deep.  As a child, sometimes my mom would have me dig through the buttons to try to find 4 or 5 that matched...she made almost everything I wore, except underwear and socks.  Other times, I liked to just dig through the buttons and try to imagine what they had originally been on. (In fact, every now and then I still do this with this button box.)Sometimes I would just go through seeing the biggest number of matches I could get.  I wonder now where they all come from--I assumed as a kid that mom must have cut them off of things that wore out.  And that is probably correct for the most part...but some of them were too fine to have come from anything in our life.I guess we were really bored back then;  I don't know what would ever have made me do this, cause my brother always ended up with it.  I would get one of the bigger coat buttons--ones that were at least an inch wide.  Then get a piece of string about 25-30 inches long--that is another little story in itself.  Regular string is what is needed--similiar to crocheting thread.  Put it through one hole in the button and back through another and tie the ends together....then pull the button till it is approximately in the middle.  You grasp the ends of the the string and pull till the string becomes slightly tight--the button starts spinning.  You just sort of let up and it will spin the other way....sort of like when you sit in a swing and twist yourself round and round and let your self go, you go back to the starting point and then twist on beyond it in the opposite way.Now, don't that sound entertaining...NOT!  But apparently it was for me.  The bad thing was my brother would end up with it about half the time, and he would start the spinning and eventually hold it against my hair when he done it...causing one heck of a tangle!  This is the same brother that would every now and then grab a handful of cockle burs and rub in my hair!Another thing we would do with buttons sounds impossible...but I can guarantee you it is not.  We would take a piece of cardboard or the back off a composition book.  Use a nail to poke a hole in three places across one side.  Use a lark's head knot to attach a string about 18 inches long to the middle hole. Then run each end through a button and tie that end to one of the side holes.  Now try to get both buttons on one side...keep in  mind that the holes the string runs through is much smaller than the button.I have meant to mention string before, but don't think I have every actually gotten around to it.  Due to our circumstances, my mom knew how to get full use of everything.  And to this day any time I pull the string that opens a bag of dogfood--I think of my mom.  Any time any bit of string came into the house like that--it was saved and wound on this ball of string.  Then when my mom went to baste the backing to the quilt frame, she used this string.  I don't save string--but I always feel this twinge of guilt because I don't."},

And I had to return an audio book to the library...I just took everything back and got all new.  I am having a hard time finding something that really holds my interest in the reading department.  And I feel almost naked without it.  Reading has always been as necessary for me as rain and sunshine.But guess what?  I won the mini quilt that http://piecefuljane.blogspot.com/is giving away in honor of her 100th post!  A first for me to win something like this.  I have that to look forward to.I am thinking about getting off here and at least scanning some of the retirement papers...just to get a feel for what I am facing.  I have been up since before 7:00--early for me.  Of course I don't normally go to bed till after 1:00 or 2:00 in the morn.  I like to stay up to watch old shows on tv....My nephew called me this afternoon--I had just been home from the grocery store a while.  We had a good visit.  I sure wish my kids could have been around him--I think he and my older daughter would hit it off so well.  It is too bad that when you are young, you are working and involved in kid's things and we didn't seem to get the time to be together.  Now, he can't get out and go other than what he absolutely has to.  He cannot take the chance of falling and really getting hurt.  With the muscular dystrophy, he is basically bound to his house except for trips for check-ups.I guess I best be signing off for now..."},

I have so many things I need to do I should at least set down a list of things I need to accomplish.The thing at the top of the list isn't exactly a resolution, but I do have to start doing the paperwork for my husband's retirement.  And that within the next month or two.  Preferable in the next week or two just to get it off my mind.  There is so much paperwork to go through...not sure that there is too much to fill out, just need to go through and check it all out.Now to the things that I really want to accomplish in the next year or things I want to become a habit.1.  I really need to make it a habit to walk at least three days a week.  Just some sort of exercise routine.  All my life I have loved walking, but the past few years have got so out of shape that I get short of breath so easily.  And if it is climbing hills/a lot of steps, I might as well forget it.2.  There is definitely a need for organization in my life.  If you have read this blog very long, you can probably tell that just by the number of times I have to hunt for things.  One of the things that compounded the problem is when MIL moved to the nursing home several years ago, so much of her stuff came here.  We hung on to a lot of it for years while she still lived.  But she passed on in the fall of 2005 and I still have things to get rid of. 3.  And of course, I would like to get more projects done in my quilting and more pictures taken.Not a very big list, but that is all for now."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2007", "text": "I finally found my favorite cow picture...I took several and this is the best in my opinion.  I don't think I did a good job of capturing them, though you may get a little bit of the feeling I had.  It was like I was a visitor at their house and they were just waiting for me to come on in.  This was taken several years ago, with B & W film.  I will always love black and white film for some things.I have spent hours on-line trying to come up with a plan for a couple baby quilts and nothing has caught my fancy yet...I usually see something and play off it.  I feel like even when I go to sleep that I am subconsciously thinking about it.I have had a couple or three frustrating days, starting Thursday afternoon.  I just thought I could go pick up the B&W pictures I have...I could not find hide nor hair of them.  Friday, I went to the mall to return some things...I had the gift receipts for two places.  Neither one would just give money back since I didn't have the actual receipt...I didn't mind bad at the one because it was a major dept. store.The other was Finish Line and I did mind because they didn't have anything to fit my body!  I am not done with it yet...I did just let my daughter spend the money.  But I plan to get on line and write them and just tell them I won't be spending any more money there--it is usually where we buy our tennis shoes, and also I had spent about $100 on daughter there...so, even though it isn't much.  Also, I am thinking of going in there at some busy, busy time and buying a dozen pair of socks, buying each one separate and tell them why--because they are gifts and I want someone to be able to return them with ease....then taking them back the next day.But it wouldn't be quite fair because it isn't the kids' fault that works there.  So I won't do it.  But it sure crosses my mind.  In all honesty, from now on when I buy gifts, if what I buy at a store is going to two or more people, I will pay for each person's separately because that is the policy in our mall...to get in-store credit...not actual cash.  Which isn't too bad if it is a major dept. store...but still what if there is something somewhere else that you really want?Anyway, that really frustrated me...I had a gift certificate to Joann Fabrics but just came home I was so aggravated.  Then, looked for pictures again.  No luck.Yesterday, DD and I went looking at houses for sale in Terre Haute and I did go to Joann's and got a fabric fix.  I got several fat quarters, plus some slinky type fabric to make a pair of pjs.  I am trying to get up my nerve to go cut them out.Oh, but that is not the end of Saturday...cancelled checks were awaiting me when I got home.  So last night I decided I might as well balance the checkbook and get it done and over with.  When I went to put them away, I decided to dig a little deeper in that drawer which is about the second place I had looked for my B&W pictures--and there they were!Now to get off my bottom and go do something....."},

When cooked the beans definitely had a different taste--kind of a strong taste.  And they were darker colored than normal.We also used to dry apples.  We would peel them and cut them into fairly thin slices and spread them out to start drying...then put them in these white heavy bags...mom called them feed bags but they are NOT the material we call feed sacks.  anyway, after they had started to dry we put them into these sacks and left them in the sun to finish drying.  They had a leathery texture...and are quite a good snack.  I keep thinking I will try some that way here, but never do.Otherwise, I took down and put away the Christmas decorations--whoops!  I just now remembered I left my Santa Claus on the front door.  I will have to get that in a few minutes while it is still on my mind.  It is such a chore to put the Christmas tree away...I do not know know how many trips up and down the basement stairs I had to make.  A minimum of 6, possibly 8 or 9.I also have been looking for a box of pictures I have taken and not got in albums...most of my black and white pictures.

The lumber for the house came from our property, my parents had a couple friends that were carpenters--one laid the block foundation.  And if I am remembering what I was told correctly, they helped get it framed.  But my brothers and all of us helped with all the rest of it.  I was not even in school, but I was given a block with sand paper wrapped around it to sand down where two pieces of dry wall were seamed together. This will always be home to me...my brother owns the place now.  We go down there on an irregular basis.  Hopefully when my husband retires we will have more time to go.Instead of listening to Christmas music like normal people, I made myself a new tape from songs I have downloaded over the past few months...the first four songs specifically mention Tennessee, and two of those mention Knoxville.  I am not from Knoxville, and only been there a few times, but it is the nearest big city to where I grew up.  Guess you can tell I sort of been homesick....and it is something that can't be cured.

I am really in the mood to sew, but seems like when everyone is around I have a hard time going down there and starting. I need to make a decision about a couple baby quilts. My oldest daughter wants to make one for one of her secretaries...and my youngest daughter's best friend is due in April. She is having a boy, and I don't have any fun panels to use that would go good for a boy. I really don't want to get into any more quilts like the Raggedy Ann and Andy one we did a year or two ago. And then a couple years before that, we did one for my oldest daughter's boss's daughter. And we had the mom sneak us a sample of the wallpaper and did a custom one based on the wall paper colors and figure....the more I read the more I have become uncomfortable with doing anything like that because of copyright.

And the one in the post is actually part of our yard--the creek had flooded and was running through it a little bit...It is hard to describe the feeling that washes over me when I see these pictures. It goes to the very core of my being...a million feelings come tumbling in. The happiness we found at this, at the little shack that we lived in is almost too good to be true.My husband and I moved to Tennessee and lived on the property this barn belongs to for a little over a year. We only had a wood burner--a Buck Stove to be exact--to heat with. We cut our own firewood. I learned to use a chainsaw then. We had three channels on our TV: PBS, NBC, and CBS. In that time there we became hooked on Masterpiece Theater, though the main show I remember watching was I, Claudius. I don't remember the show as much as I remember the anticipation of seeing the next episode. We had a huge garden there--I canned enough green beans that year to last us two or three years. Plus I sold enough to more than pay for all the fertilize, plants and seeds that I had to buy. We didn't have to pay for the garden to be plowed--we used my brother's tractor and plow.I raised both half-runner and cornfield beans (they are very similar to pole beans), okra, tomatoes, potatoes, okra, pepper, and onions I know. I cannot remember if I raised anything else or not. Oh, I know I had cabbage...I remember making kraut with it.My husband could shoot from the front yard over to the ridge behind the barn pictured above--I think he could place the target 500 yards. He could shoot his bow and arrows in the front yard. Just an idyllic sort of life for us at that time.We still miss this place--I dream of it fairly often. In my dreams it is always so good to be there. I was only a mile from my mom and half a mile from my best friend..I visited with both almost daily. If not actual visit, then talked on the phone. That seems a lifetime ago.I guess Christmas is a time of remembering...seeing these pictures and some others really have me in mood.

And it turned out good for the first time in ages.  I wanted some to give to a couple friends...but don't know when I am going to get it to the one.  I called her and she was not home..so maybe she went to some of her kids' homes for the holidays.Husband stayed home today with a sinus infection.  He did not sleep hardly any last night and kept the rest of us up most of the night with his coughing.  He doesn't go back to work till the day after Christmas.Christmas is almost here...and I haven't found any hard candy so far.  Hard candy, apples and oranges are such a part of my Christmas memories.  Mommy and daddy always bought a bushel of red delicious apples and a bushel of oranges every Christmas that I can remember.  I was not crazy about the apples, and today I care even less for red delicious.  But I remember loving the oranges, or to be more specific the juice from them.And we usually got at least one new jigsaw puzzle at Christmas...to this day I love jigsaw puzzles.  If not for the kitties I would have one out right now.We always hung up an actual sock Christmas eve and would get up and find hard candy, nuts,  and apples and oranges in them.   And when I was small, I always got a cap buster.  Mom would hide it some where and I would usually hunt and search till I found it...let the noise begin!  And our tradition was to have fire crackers on Christmas eve, and it must have been fairly popular for us to be able to get them every year.  I have never heard of any one else that did this besides my brothers and their friends.  Of course I was always out with them.We always shot off the biggest part of them after dark, then the next day we would hunt the area for ones that had not exploded.  We would do one of two things with them...break one in half, light it if it still had powder, and drop it on a solid surface such as the sidewalk, and stomp on it.  That would cause it to go off as if you had lit it the regular way.The other thing we did was collect all we could find, and unroll them.  If they had powder we collected it...I don't remember how many it would take.  We would drill a hole in a chunk of wood and make some kind of cork, or find something else we could plug closed.  My dad actually had dynamite fuse from when they dug the basement to our house....We would beg a length or two from him, and use it to light our homemade explosive device!  We had a blast seeing what we could actually do with the powder...if it was too big of a piece of wood nothing..I know we used other stuff...but I don't recall what.  And I don't recall the results.  I just remember us running to get behind cover.   We really never had anything  that  was that big or dangerous--wouldn't have wanted it to go off in our hand, of course but it was nothing to worry about.That would scare people to death now.  Also think of how a kid can't have a knife at school...and I understand but it is still a sad situation.  When I was a kid, all boys had pocket knives.  For years when I worked at the orchard, I carried a knife and was just as apt to have it with me at the grocery store or Walmart as to not.  It just went in my pocket.Now I am finally getting used to carrying a purse again...for a long time I felt naked without my wallet in my back pocket.  And every now and then I will pay for something and forget and put it in my hip pocket still...Well, I am slowly but surely getting sleepy so will sign off for the night.....This is a different view of the barn seen in my header...I found it while looking for the picture of beans strung on strings to dry. Could not resist posting it, and between the two I don't know whether I like it in B & W best or just the way I found it...off-color colored film picture. So I just am posting both."},

It is now for sure their favorite place to run and hide and play....so much more than when it was bare.Anyway, I did have one big, heavy garbage bag when I got done...then my younger daughter stopped by on her way home from work and had tacos with us. After she left we went to Terre Haute to see our friend's daughter play basketball...her team won and she made several points...Tomorrow I need to go finish shopping for my husband. I will probably try to find him something he would like for hunting or fishing...just not sure what that is going to be.Blogger problems....I am having problems with my blog...I can see the barn picture behind my header if I use Firefox but not with Internet Explorer.  Another friend says she cannot see it at all.  I suppose it started with the changes Blogger made...the first I noticed any changes was this past weekend when all that showed in the header picture was the tip of the barn roof.  So I went in and resized the image--well, I cropped it.  That loaded fine...Then last night in messing around, I switched to IE for something and noticed no header, switched back to Firefox and everything was fine.  Switched back to IE, and tried reloading the picture while using it, still didn't show there.  but it still shows for me while on Firefox.I am trying to scan through the help topics but so far no luck with this exact problem.Anyone that reads this, please post if you see this picture in my header and tell me what browser you are using..."},

Doesn't it look so cold and lonely? I didn't have the nerve to go far because I was afraid of running into drifts that I couldn't get through. The roads going east and west were fine for the most part, though some of those only had a lane wide enough for one vehicle to pass through. I don't know what would have happened had I met another car.I also went to Lori's_Pins_'n_Needles. I had to buy a couple things there to finish up one Christmas present. She has the most beautiful selection of fabrics that I have come across in one quilt shop. She carries a wide variety. If anyone is ever passing near Paris, Illinois, I highly recommend this shop.I bought my friend a couple half yard pieces of fabric, then I bought two half yard pieces that I am going to make us each a fat quarter from. Then I bought a couple or three things I just wanted. I bought a little pin cushion with a magnet to stick to my Juki...I think I will eventually want one for my Pfaff...then I bought some freezer paper pages till I don't have to cut my own. Also got myself a 6 1/2 Creative Grid ruler...I think I will eventually switch over to those.I have Christmas presents wrapped now, but not bows. They are going to be lucky to survive the cats this year. I have had to get the little Princess out of the tree several times since she has started feeling better. And they tend to like to play under it--even with all the presents under it. They just play on top of them, or knock them out.I have been sewing a little bit, but it is not something I am driven to do. Been making scrap blocks--just sewing bits of scraps together...using a rotary ruler and cutter and cutting a straight edge, adding more strips, till I can cut a 6 1/2 square from the sewn together bits. Not sure what I am going to do with them when I get done. But it is enjoyable to sew even a little bit.I am glad I have a cheap iron--the cats have now knocked mine to the concrete floor twice--and it still works! I told my husband he was going to have to make me something to hold it till they couldn't knock it over. Not quite sure what it is going to be or how it is going to work, but he will come up with something once I start pestering him about it."},

This is one of my favorite pictures--takes me back to childhood almost instantly.There was nothing better than snowy days for me.  I would get my cheap old boots on, get the dogs and take off on a 'grand' adventure...this is just some of the area I might cover in an afternoon.  This was just part of my growing up playground.The barn that is prominent in the pictures was ours...it was built by my brothers under the direction of my dad when they were in high school!  My dad had muscular dystrophy and by the time we got moved to the 'new' house, he was not able to do much.  This barn, as well as our house was all built from wood that was taken from the trees on our land....my parents were nothing if not self sufficient in so many ways.There is a creek that is the boundary between our property and the neighboring property...there were two or three summers that I played in that creek a big part of the day each summer.  Catching crawdads, skipping rocks, etc....I really don't know what we did to have so much fun, but those are some of the best memories of my life.  It was a couple or three years that my nephew, who is a month older than me, spent the summers with us.That barn holds tons of memories...of calves we raised on bottles, of swings we had in it, playing hide and go seek, building tunnels back in the hay, or just me sitting in the loft hunting blackbirds with the old .22 rifle.   I don't hunt anything now, though if I was back in a place where I had a garden and birds or groundhogs were destroying what I had planted, I could still do it.  Might not enjoy it, but I would do it.Enough of memories for the night...snow is really beginning to fall.  I sure hope I can get out tomorrow and take pictures.  I love snow pictures...."},

I am so relieved to have it done...no more worries about kitties having more kitties.Will wait a bit on the boys...I forgot to ask how old boys have to be to be neutered.  My daughter is in hopes of finding an apartment that she can have her boy in at least....so she may have to get him de-clawed as well.  I really do not like the thoughts of that, but realize she really would miss him.  That is a ways down the road though.  She is hoping the divorce will be final the last part of January.I keep forgetting and calling my boy Cougar, or Coo....he just reminds me of him so much.  Sometimes I think I was a complete fool to allow myself to have cats again, knowing how much pain there is later on down the road.  Yet I would not go back to being without them for anything."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2007", "text": "The quilt was washed today and sent on its way to Pennsylvania to a childhood friend that I have not seen since 1974! That is the year we graduated, and I don't think I seen her after we graduated...we were not really close friends then but have been emailing for the past 2 years. She emailed to wish me happy birthday for the first time in 2005 and we email at least 4 or 5 times a week if nothing interferes.She does not know it is coming so am kind of anxious to see what she says. I love surprising someone about more than anything. I did wash and dry it before I sent it...I used a Shout Color Catcher and it did catch color. I meant to write care instructions but didn't because I wanted to get it sent.Her dad was from Tennessee--the community I was from. But she was born in Pennsylvania and didn't move to Tennessee till in 5 or 6th grade if memory serves. It had to be huge change for her! I think we had one of the last old time grade schools....It had 4 big rooms--I am not good at all at extimating sizes but they were big and each room had a coal stove and that was how it was heated. Two grades were in each room--one teacher per two grades. I think all through the first 8 grades there were the same 4 boys in my class. Then there were 5 of us girls that went through all 8 grades together...another girl came for a couple years in 5 and 6th and then moved. Then Deb came and stayed.We were not really close in school, specially in the elementary years--I and my best friend were tomboys. Always wanting to play whatever ball was in season a big part of the time. There were times when it seemed like the kids would all play hide and go seek, or tag. And every now and then the girls jumped rope...Are you beginning to realize we did not have any sort of gym or organized sports? I really don't think we missed anything...we all had a good time. We had two 15 minute recesses--one in the morn and one in the afternoon. I can still remember the times of those recesses--grades 1-4 had them at 10:00-10:15 a.m. and 2:00 pm--2:15 p.m. And grades 5-8 had the next 15 minutes. I am not real clear on lunch--we all had it at the same time--but I cannot remember if it was at noon or not. I tend to think it was.We ate and then got to go outside and play a while...younger grades were not supposed to mix with the older students but my best friend and I got permission to cause we played ball with the older boys...we were told not to come crying if we got hurt. That was a lifetime ago...oh, and we had outhouses--one for the boys and one for the girls. And for the first 4 years we had to take our lunch, and then that only changed because parents complained and they started shipping in hot lunches from one of the other elementary schools!You cannot imagine how scary it was for me to start high school! All those rooms! So many kids that I didn't know. Just so many things that my kids were doing from the time they started school. That is when the girls in our class really started sticking together...other than Deb, I have kept in touch some with the other 4 ever since graduation. And would have her too if she had not moved back to Pennsylvania and me to Indiana...maybe not right at first but I am sure it would have happened sooner than this.This is a picture I 'borrowed' from my brother--this is how the old school looks now. So sad to see it this way...one of my friends has tried to talk people into turning it into a community center but no one seems to care."},

It has rained and drizzled off and on all day long.  We are supposed to get freezing rain towards morning.  I really hope they are wrong about this...Wednesday I take Mama Cat and the Princess to be spayed.  I am sure hoping the weather is accommodating that day.  I am taking them to a vet in the south end of Terre Haute instead of to the vet in our little town.  I called out there about the age they have to be and got two different answers, so I called down there and got what I thought I had been told before, plus what I had read.  And he is the vet we used when we first married--and also when Sarah got her dog from the shelter a few years ago, we got a deal on getting her spayed by going to him.  We also left her with him when my mom died...he got so tickled at how glad she was to see us when we got home that he followed us out to our car/van talking to us and laughing about her.  He really likes animals.When we were first married I had a dachshund that jumped off my lap while I was setting on a step stool.  She got down in her back till she could hardly walk and that on New Year's eve...we called him and his response was so immediate--meet him at his office in 15 minutes.  There was no outrageous charge--just the normal office charge and charge for the medicine...I don't remember if he gave her a shot or not.  But I think his quick response was a big part of her recovery...she never had another bit of back trouble  in the rest of her years...Change of topic--I finally finished the binding on my small quilt while watching the Indianapolis Colts play tonight!  I want to try to get a good picture of it tomorrow but don't know how possible that will be.  I am convinced that the flash on my camera is not even up to par for normal pop-up flashes.  Maybe I should ask for a good flash for Christmas--but I don't use the flash that much."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, December 8, 2007", "text": "Can you guess that I love barns?  This barn is along highway 41, in Parke County.  Maybe it is because I spent so many happy hours in the barn when I was a child.  It was one of my favorite places to play...going to the barn to milk the cow, feed the pigs, and feed the cows in general was never a chore for me.  And even though that has been over 30 years ago, the smell of cow or horse barn is a pleasant smell to me that takes me instantly back to my childhood.We were dirt poor in so many ways.  We raised almost all the food we ate...we raised and butchered four hogs every year, we almost always had a cow or two that we milked, and raised all our vegetables.  And we picked wild blackberries, as well as there was a couple old apple trees that my mom gathered apples from to make jelly with.  To this day my favorite job on earth is to pick blackberries.  Why I don't know...as a kid I always ended up with bunches of chiggers...if you have never had them you haven't missed anything other than misery!My mom filled every jar she had and also had a deep freezer that was always stuffed to the brim with food we raised.  And there would be guys bring truckloads of peaches up from Georgia and drive along the roads and stop and ask if you wanted to buy peaches...my mom always bought a couple bushels and we would freeze and can them.  It is so refreshing to come in from hoeing the garden and to have peaches that are just beginning to thaw--that are still in that crystallized state.  I am getting hungry just thinking about them.We had cornbread almost every day of our life, and my mom made biscuits every morning too...there were a few times when she got bronchitis that she didn't get up and make biscuits but I bet that was not five times a year.  And her biscuits were unlike anybody's I have ever seen.  But oh, so yummy good!  When grand kids were home, I have seen them have her make them a pan of biscuits after breakfast and they would eat every one of them.She didn't measure anything, just mixed them up by feel.  And she didn't roll them out and cut with a cookie cutter, she just pinched off a little bit of the dough, and worked it between her hands, and placed in the pan.  And every one was the same size!  I do not know how to explain what they were like...but I would give anything to have a pan of them  right now!Another thing I never hear of any where up here is shucked beans...or do not even hear them called dried beans.  We always took green beans and snapped the ends off them, and if need be we took the 'strings' off--I wonder if anyone that is reading this knows what I mean?  Anyway, then we would have just use regular string/or crocheting thread and a big needle and would run the beans on the strings and hang them to dry.  And everyone called them shucked beans down there...they had a sort of strong flavor, but I really liked them.  I think I have a picture somewhere of some...I will hunt for it after while and scan it in...Enough reminiscing for now..."},

I cleaned out a bunch of stuff out of my fridge and fixed supper.And, when Roger got home, we got my quilt hanger up that my friend had her husband make me for my birthday in November.  I really like the picture that is above it, and just chose to have it down lower than maybe I would have otherwise.  I also pulled out a few more Christmas decorations.  But still I have not attempted to put lights on the tree.  I had hopes of picking up some extra strands of lights at Walmart but they did not have any at all except outdoor ones that hang like icicles off the edge of the roof.So I came home without any.

But doesn't he look like he lives in  the lap of luxury in all of these pictures?My daughter's new bed/mattress set and chest of drawers arrived last  week.  It was almost impossible to make the bed because the Princess had  to help.  When we were done, it was so cute:  all three of the kittens  and my daughter were stretched out on the bed.  I told her the kittens  thought she bought the bed for them.  See more pictures here:   http://picasaweb.google.com/rose.swallsI spent about 5 hours at the Emergency Room Thursday night with my daughter--she has a torn muscle.  But her leg was swelling and we were afraid to wait because of the possibilities of it being a blood clot.  She can walk with ease and the calves of her legs only cramp occasionally now.  Not even sure that the right one is cramping at all...it was the left one that was swollen and also it cramped the hardest.  It hurt to touch the calf of that leg when we were at the ER.I have been sewing a little...but not finishing anything.  Every time I try to set and do this one binding one of the cats ends up trying to help me and I just put it away.  That quilt has been cat tested and approved already.It was not too cold here today, but this afternoon the wind has started and has been howling.  Coming from the west/northwest.  I can barely open the back storm door.  It is the type of wind that makes Shelby, our dog nervous.  I suppose she will want to be able to be close to me the entire night.

This one is not bad in comparison to some I have seen. Sometimes he will have an arm so out of position that I think he about has to be double jointed.This weekend was fine entertainment from them. Sunday morn, husband got up to go to the potty and came back to bed. Normally I lay there with my eyes closed, but for some reason I had them open and seen him come around the end of the bed--one of the cats was under the bed and grabbed him! I laughed till I cried at his expression and the way he jumped.Then there is the little girl, who is sometimes a little princess and sometimes Puss Puss. She loves Roger--when he comes home from work, the first thing he is supposed to do is pick her up and pet her a few minutes. Then when he puts her down, she helps him take off his work boots, followed by a quick dash to the bedroom for a romp on the bed.She will come get in bed with us, and she peddle pushes/kneads with her paws. And will go in and out from under the cover numerous times. Well, I went to bed just a bit past midnight Sunday night, leaving the kitties all asleep in the living room and dining room. I had not been in bed but a minute when up over the side she hops. Goes straight to husband to peddle push for a few seconds, then is in and out under the cover I don't know how many times.Then she comes and gets on my chest and peddle-pushes for a bit then lays down and I think she is settled down good. I continue petting her all the time thinking we have got it made--we can just lay there and go to sleep, or back to sleep as in the case of Roger. But she only lays there a few minutes and hops up and goes over on his pillow to peddle push with her face right in his face, and purring loud enough to wake the dead. By then I am laughing so hard I am shaking the bed, so get up, grab her and sleep on the couch. He can't stand it cause her whiskers tickle his face sort of like walking through a spider web.Mama cat is so settled in...I think she fully realizes she does not have to worry about anything here. I have not had her hiss at me or heard her hiss at anyone since about the first week. Can about sit down on her and she won't move. So different to when she was at her other home--she would not stick around for anyone except my daughter. She was constantly in the defense mode."},

I have not idea what I am getting anyone...I can always buy for my older daughter.  I seem to be able to choose clothes she likes, and can always find a dozen things she really likes.My younger daughter is a different matter however--she just doesn't seem to want a lot of anything.  Her husband is the same--he loves working on cars for fun...year before last we bought him a whole bunch of tools...and my older daughter also bought him a socket wrench set, then last year we bought him a battery drill set that also had a saw, and a palm sander...plus extra battery pack...so he is basically set for tools.  Oh, we also got him a vise.  He has an engine hoist...so just not much else that he needs.

Last night we were gone to late to have any, and I think we missed a lot of them then. We did not get corned at all this year--don't know if it is cause all the kids we really know are grown or if kids just don't do it to people they don't know.

It did not state how much flour to use to thicken the butter/broth mixture.  Also, she made almost double the recipe and we had to bake longer.  We don't know if it was due to the fact that she made more or what--after the biscuits were brown, we laid aluminum foil over top of them to prevent them from burning.Easy Chicken Pot Pie1 bag Bird's Eye frozen vegetables1 cup Bird's Eye white pearl onions  (we decided we would have liked them better quartered)4 cups cubed cooked chicken3 TBS butter3 cups low fat chicken broth1/2 cup low fat half-n-half creamsalt and pepper to tastepinch nutmeg1 package refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough2 TBS parsley, choppedPreheat oven to 400 degrees.

Then there dropped something on my quilt and I first thought it was a thread and then realized I had not had dark thread anywhere about.  It was the thread take-up spring from the top tension.  It had broke.  So I came up and called the place I got my Juki from and they were so busy I had to wait for them to call me back.  It would take them a week to get the part, then have to ship it to me, so I called another place I have heard mentioned on the Juki forums at Yahoo and will see how this goes.  I ordered two, just in case this ever happens again...but in all my years of sewing this is the first I have ever seen one break.After it broke, I quilted a few more inches and it still seems to do okay, so will try more after I get supper fixed.  I am in the mood to get this thing finished.  My husband came down and saw what I had done and thought it was really nice.  I  think I am losing my fear of the quilting, I just need to learn to slow down and not try to go so fast.I did go for a drive yesterday, but I did not take fishing equipment. I didn't go near the fishing holes I had in mind. I only droveabout 45-50 miles, but it took 2 1/2 hours, and I took almost 50pictures. It was totally enjoyable...the only thing better would have been if it had not been cloudy in the morning and I could have went earlier in better lighting. As it was, I am still fairly pleased with the photos I took.I came home, downloaded them, and played with some of them a little bit--switched some of them to black and white, which I love for some things. And the picture of the leaves in my header is from one of my photos, as was the one previous of the cornfield stubble. If you want to see more of the ones I took yesterday check out: http://picasaweb.google.com/rose.swalls/ParkeCountyIndiana for a better view. They are really nice viewed in the slideshow here. You can have them fill your whole page and it is almost like being there. I hope you enjoy them.Now, I need to go quilt some! I am not getting anything done sitting on here!"},

I feel that my free motion quilting isn't the greatest, but I feel it has improved and I am not real ashamed of it so far.  I will just have to wait and take pictures of it because I do not know how to describe what I am doing.  Nothing fancy, that is for sure.  The only thing I am wondering about is if I am quilting it too close for it to be snuggly.  I am hoping not because I intend for it to be used.I did do the diagonal lines on it Sunday, then yesterday was definitely errand day for me.  Cleaned up dog messes out of the back yard, ran by the bank, stopped at the post office and to Walmart and grocery...then home to unload and put away things.  Followed by mowing the yard.  All before noon.In the afternoon I gave the dog a bath, cleaned up after that mess and gave myself a shower--LOL  Then vacuumed and mopped, fixed supper and washed dishes.  Oh, I think I did a couple loads of clothes yesterday, also.And have not did even half that much today...did do a couple more loads of laundry and fixed supper and washed dishes.  While doing laundry I contemplated the quilt but still didn't know how/what I wanted to do.  Then after supper and dishes I just went down there and started.   I FMQ'ed for about 2 hours....I am going to give this to a friend, but I will tell her it is part of my learning experience.  She will love it anyway I think.I am hoping to go for a drive tomorrow and planning on taking my camera.  But, I had that planned for today and got up to rain so it didn't happen.  I should learn not to plan too much...things have a way of happening to alter the best laid plans.  I am not even sure what direction I want to head...so many places call my name.  I am even thinking about throwing my fishing rod in the back just in case I am tempted to throw my line in the water.  But with all the rain I doubt if anything would be biting.."},

We were supposed to be with the scout kids to sell popcorn but the ones that signed up to sell went on the camping trip instead.  What kid wouldn't?  So after getting set up and staying an hour, my daughter just called it off since no kids were showing up. We loaded everything back up, took it home, and went to the mall and walked through the major department stores.  It is the first time I have been to the mall in months!  (The only kind of shops I like to frequent are fabric/quilt stores.)  The mall has been remodeled and some stores have changed spots, as well as there were a couple new stores.  Neither of us bought a thing...I was on the lookout for that perfect purse, and she was just looking.We had lunch and then drove to other DD's house.  Rachel had not seen their new puppy that found them--part pit bull boy.  The vet thinks about 3 months old.  He does not meet a stranger--loves everyone.  I think it is highly intelligent.  It was a neighbor's and got out and came to them...then it disappeared when they went to work.  So when their day off came, they went to this neighbor to see if they had caught it but they didn't know where it was and didn't really want it. So, it ends up another neighbor had seen it roaming and had caught it thinking it was Sarah and Jeremy's...so they went back to the real owner and ask if they were serious about not wanting it.  So that is how it came into their life. ****I did pin baste a small couch sized quilt Thursday.   It is left over blocks from that  last quilt top I did that has an Irish Chain feel to it.  I have not quite decided how I want to quilt it so haven't started.  I am trying to let the muse hit me before I start.  But I may just have to start cause I really want to get it done fairly soon.The other 'problem' I am having with it is it is mostly off-white tone on tone fabrics.  Yet there is the colored squares that form the chain feel to the quilt...I cannot decide if I just want to go ahead and use the same off-white thread on those or do I want to attempt to use a multicolored one on them.  If I thought I would not have trouble with getting the tension balanced just right, I would definitely go for the multi-colored on top and the off white on the bottom for those colored parts.  But it is very hard to get it balanced just right to not have the pokies coming through one side or the other.So it is decisions delaying me yet again...."},

I wish they were better quality, but I am still glad to have these to show. This is only a small sampling of the quilts she made. All before the rotary cutter! She cut out her template/pattern out of cardboard and would just hold it along with the fabric in her hands and cut out the pieces with scissors. I don't think I ever saw her use a pin or anything to hold the cardboard in place. Any part of the sewing that was done on a machine, was done on a treadle machine."},

She wanted something to identify her and the cubscouts and this is what she came up with.  The background is a navy blue twin sheet, and she chose the yellow fabric for the letters.She did the letters by choosing a font on the computer and enlarging it to the size she wanted, printed each one off, and I used misty fuse to fuse them to the background then did a close zigzag stitch around each one.  I used paper towels for my stabilizer and that worked fine.Yesterday we went to Indianapolis and picked up our Rav 4.  I had been so excited the night before that I did not sleep at all....I did not test drive the vehicle at all.  I just sat in it to see how it felt.  And to see how I felt about looking out the mirrors.  So when we got home we went for a fairly long ride.  I really enjoy driving it...it has tight steering and a tight turning radius.  We got the V6 so it has some power.  We only got front wheel drive...my husband had read on some forums and people had only front wheel drive and lived in Minnesota, Colorado, and Chicago and said they got around fine.  Since we really don't plan on going really rough places with it, it should do us fine."},

She sure loves him--I very seldom see him go find her to lay with, but she all the time searches him out to lay down with. She almost always has to be touching him.I had an appointment with the surgeon that sent me to get the stereotactic biopsy...the appointment was uncalled for in so many ways. I bet it was made just in case there was bad news, we would have been planning my surgery. My best quilting buddy's mom passed away Monday while being operated on for an aneurysm. They had it repaired but she had a heart attack. They said if they had not did the operation, it was to the point of bursting?<<I sure did not expect it, and neither did my friend or her sister. Up until this year this lady had bowled on a bowling league, she had been bitten by the quilting bug just a few years ago and was always working on something. She also worked on geneological stuff...loved her computer. She had had old computers up until recently, and she was not afraid to wipe everything out and reformat the things herself. On to other things....I have the heat kicked on right now. I came home from Terre Haute and was just freezing by the time I got back into my jeans. (I actually put on dress pants to go to the visitation--but they had pockets!) I have supper half made--it should be called Hungarian/Italian beef. My friend was telling me how she made it and I thought it didn't sound too good, but told her the next time she made it to call me and let me taste it. She did and I have been fixing it ever since. This is not an exact recipe--she didn't give me one. So just sort of learn to flavor it to your own liking. I do prefer chuck roasts and I try to get one without too much fat.I cut it into 2-3 inch chunks and put in crockpot. Next pour in 15-16 ounce can tomato sauce--that is the part that made me question whether I would like it. Next I sprinkle on 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, sprinkle in plenty of garlic powder, and sprinkle in italian seasonings. Then I fill the tomato sauce can about two-thirds full of water and pour on top of all. Put the lid on and set the crockpot on low and leave till it is real tender--usually 8 or 9 hours is plenty. We always have a loaf of crusty Italian bread to eat it with and just tear the bread! For me there is just something about tearing it rather than slicing it.Several people have tried this and only one didn't care for it. She is Italian though so I am not sure if she is just used to different flavorings, or I wondered did she not cook long enough or not enough of the garlic, Italian seasonings, etc. When it starts cooking you definitely smell it."},

I have some strips sewn together for that...I am hoping to get to sew more on that tonight.THIS post sure made me think about my mom.  She always wore an apron, but only wore the kind without the bib.  I have no idea why she didn't want them.  Maybe they were hotter.  Till I was about 8 years old, mom cooked on the wood burning cook stove.  I remember sitting by the stove in the winter mornings, but I don't remember much else about it.   I do know she was glad to have the electric stove to do the canning and jellies on once we got one.  But everyone always talked about how much better food tasted cooked on the wood stove.  She also always had to have pockets--even in her dresses she wanted pockets.  But it was almost a sin with her if someone made an apron that did not have pockets.  (Maybe this is where I get my love of pockets.)    One of the things mom used her apron for was to gather things in...if we went to the garden and she decided she wanted a mess of something, she would just gather up the end of her apron in one hand and pick beans or okra and drop into the apron.  An excellent way to do in my opinion.In fact, I carried it on in a sense when I worked at the orchard...if I was out checking varieties of apples, and wanted to take some back to the house for everyone else's opinions, I would gather my t-shirt tail up in my hands and pick into that.  Of course I had to watch that cause it would gradually stretch the neck till it was almost down to my bra!"},

My daughter picked up a rotisserie chicken, frozen veggies, chicken broth, half and half, and canned biscuits.  She made this fabulous chicken pot pie from this.

And I had a wonderful night of sleep. I even managed to sleep on my stomach for just a few minutes, a feat in itself with just having that biopsy. Speaking of it, I must say I wonder does everybody's breast itch after you have this done? I am not sure if it is from the surgery, or from the strips they put on the incision....to begin with it definitely feels like it is from deep within, but I don't know if that is possible.I tried to process my Connecting Thread order; I could not sign in in any shape form or fashion. I first deleted temporary files and the cookies, closed browser window and reopened and tried again. I had to call customer service and finally finished that order.Next, I tried to get my order together for Hancocks of Paducah. I had to call customer service twice there. I did finally get the job accomplished, but not before wasting my whole morning. Here it is after 1:00 p.m. and I have not accomplished anything else.

Now will be waiting to hear. Was a tad bit more tender than the first time around...I didn't get much rest last night. However after my husband left for work, I managed to get a couple hours of really sound sleep. Kind of feel refreshed.But wait a minute...I have not told about the previous night. The night before the biopsy. I had one heck of a night. I still put the kitties in 'their' room at night till we can get some rest. However, I have been getting anxious to have them sleep with us. Tuesday night was the second night I have attempted to leave them out, with me sleeping on the couch. Just to see how they do.I thought it was going great. Chunky Monkey climbed up on my side and was sleeping so peacefully. I was not sure where 'she' was. I think I even dozed off, only to wake up and think it just might work if I went on to bed. WRONG! Soon as I opened the door, the girl appeared out of nowhere and the boy woke up bright-eyed! I am assuming bright-eyed. Could only kind of see their outlines. They flew to the bed and started pouncing around. It was Playtime! My husband was really sound asleep and snoring...I managed to round them up in the dark and take them to their room without him ever knowing a thing. By the time that was done I was wide awake. So I stick in a quilting video, lay down in the floor, and am asleep in short order. (I cannot stay awake if I lay down to watch quilt videos--they are better than any sleeping pill.) I woke in an hour or so I think, got up and went back to bed. I went to sleep, but I swear I don't think I slept any time till husband got up, and what does he do after he goes to the bathroom? He lets the kitties out.They come flying back in there, and the little girl especially considers the bed her own personal, private playground. She was up there in a flash, and pouncing on anything and everything. The boy was up and down and playing some, but not as bad as her. But wait! What is at the head of our bed? A mini-blind. And he sees the cords hanging down. She sees him see them. They both get up there right by my head and start trying to get the mini-blind cords. It was rattle, rattle, rattle. Rattle, rattle, rattle!I got up again and snatched them both, took them back to the living room, and shut the door to our bedroom! So it wasn't like worry was keeping me awake--it was my two lovely kitties. But you know, I am not complaining. I think they have kept me sane the past bit. And I know now that they are going to be quality control for my quilting. The first sign of that is I have a quilt I keep near the couch for when I lay in there or on the floor....it is one that my mom tied. Just strips sewn together. But it is warm and snuggly, and she made it. Well, they both like to claim it.Then this morn after I had my really sound sleep, I came into the dining room where I have a quilt chest. It has clear plexiglass sides so you can stack your quilts in it and see them. Well, I keep the lid open with tops hanging over it. It looks really good like that. So I came in here, and there were both the kitties: they had pulled the tops down and were sleeping on them. I did manage to get get some snapshots of Chunky."},

Her birthday is the 12th, so I really need to get busy. Is it stupid to want to do something with bright flowers at this time of year? That is what I really want to do, but have about decided to quick make a couch quilt out of the blocks left over from that last quilt top I made. The one that kind of his an Irish chain feel to it. I wonder if I could get it done, with getting that biopsy tomorrow???She lives in Pennsylvania so I would really have to buckle down and work on it every minute. I really think she would appreciate it. We were not the best of friends in high school, yet we had went to the same little elementary school so in one sense we had things in common. Had not heard from her since high school, then a couple years ago on my birthday, I got an email from her and we have been emailing each other since.Sometime we want to make it to Tennessee at the same time...when either one of us goes down, three of our other life time friends and whichever of us two is down there, always get together and go out to eat. And talk and talk.*********It is close to midnight here. I couldn't write about mom last week...too many bitter memories surfaced after seeing my sisters. I really prefer not to dwell on the bad, but it did exist. But there was good, too.I remember one summer for some reason we had a little bit of down time when we didn't have anything pressing in the garden or tobacco. Mom pulled out 3 quilt tops and we tied them all. I cannot remember what two of them were but one of them was Hands_All_Around.I still have it. This is just a sample I found on the web...I remember her laughing and saying people would think we were crazy making quilts in the summer; it was hot and we had not air conditioning. So she did have a point. But she also talked about we would not be getting cold in the winter. Sometimes I wonder how she stayed so interested in quilting. There were no quilt shows, no magazines. I remember when it was an absolute thrill to find one of the women's magazines with a quilt featured. Then came Quilter's Newsletter Magazine. I still have all mom's old issues and love to look at them every now and then. I would like to know if it was the first magazine dedicated to quilting.....I have a feeling that it was, but not sure.One time she was able to buy this big box of scraps from a sewing factory for $5. In my mind it was a huge box, and I honestly think it was at least 20-24 inches wide, probably 12-15 inches deep, and it was much longer than it was wide. I think it took both my brothers who were teen-agers to carry it in. (And they were not small teen-agers either.) It was a treasure chest for her. I think she only made quilts and braided rugs from them. To this day that is one of my best memories."},

Anyone can draw a pumpkin, but I traced these instead! I get all tense inside when I actually go to do something. But just sitting down there I can do okay when I am just doodling on paper. Maybe if I do more of it, I will get more free.I made a big pot of chili for supper. I have eaten entirely too much. I love soups--particularly my own! Though I have yet to taste a chili I didn't like. I never measure anything when making chili or vegetable soup or potato soup. I do kind of go by my recipe for broccoli soup...it tastes like no other I have ever tasted. And once I made it, no other has ever satisfied me.

Another beautiful fall day here...it feels like rain is on the way. I went outside for something and was amazed by the feel. I don't mind....it might get me more in the mood to sew.I went down and got my friend's Internet up and running this afternoon....it was really simple. I am sure she could have done it...but she is sort of scared of doing things like that. And if it had been like mine was, I would not have wished that on my worst enemy. For some reason it would not load from the disk and I had to get on the phone and spend hours getting it installed.Other than that, I have not done much other than cooking and doing dishes. I read a little on a book I had thought was going to be very good, but was disappointed. It was just weird. A little sick to my way of thinking. So will probably not even attempt to read it through. I also got my checkbook balanced...it came out right first time around. Kind of scary. I am usually off just a few cents. So it seems to good to be true. Tomorrow is bill paying day--I try to pay all the bills on the first of the month. That helps me keep it straight. That and the fact that I actually have a record book that I keep track of the bills. I make a list of all the normal monthly bills, write the date paid, the check number, and the amount in it. And last year with all the medical bills I even had one where I kept track of what we spent on them. I kept track of the check number, date paid, and who it was paid to. Believe it or not, it came in real handy when I was double billed one time.I really wonder if other people have the medical expenses we have...I have kept track of it pretty close two or three years and on top of paying for insurance and on top of what insurance has paid, we have averaged spending almost $300 per month on medical bills. That is a chunk of change to be going out all the time. Yet not near as much as it would have been had we not had insurance. Plus, I am thankful to have been able to pay that.Oh, well, I am going to try to get off here and get my mind settled and think about going to bed.

I still have to go down there and install the new internet service she is getting....I can only hope it goes smoother than when we switched to it. I am the only person I have heard of who had so many problems.Wednesday it rained...I don't recall what I did. Then yesterday I went to Joann Fabrics and to the library. I get so disgusted at our Joann's....everything is constantly a mess there. It is discouraging to try to shop there. I did pick up a Fairfield batting...they were all on sale. It is 80% cotton and 20% polyester. I have never used this brand so hope I like it. I also picked up a few pieces of fabric. From there I went to the library. By the time I chose my audio books, I was done tired, so I quickly grabbed a few books and came home.Our car is on its last legs--it is a Toyota Camry and has 140,000 miles on it. Had never give us a minutes problem until the last bit. It died one day a couple or three weeks ago as my husband was going to work. A new water pump and timing belt...which we had just replace year or so ago. Yesterday on his way to work, the dashboard lights kept flickering on and off as well as the low battery.He stopped at Hardee's to get a breakfast sandwich and it would not start when he went back out. He got out and fooled under the hood, wiggling wires, etc. Got back in and it started. Made it to work where he left it running, with the windows up, while he got under the hood again. Decided to see if he could make it die by wiggling the wires. No luck. Remember I said he left the car running which means the keys are in the ignition, and had the windows rolled up. When he let the hood slam shut, he heard this CLICK! The doors locked! He was so aggravated--but the locksmith at work was able to come and get the door open. They found a part that was bad--not sure if it is a fuse, but it was something small like that and replaced it. It started right up then, and started fine when he came home. We started to leave last night and it wouldn't make a sound! We also replaced the battery just a little while back, so it is not the battery. We also replaced something else but what it was called escapes me right this minute--I can picture it perfectly. Just cannot think of what it is called.He has been planning for a couple weeks for him and friends to go shooting and sight in their rifles--so he is doing that today. It is close to deer hunting season--maybe bow season is open now. Not sure since he is not allowed to shoot his bow for a while yet. So today I got up and vacuumed, mopped, cleaned the bathroom, and mowed the yard. So that is done for a while. I wonder just how many more times it will have to be mowed. I hate even thinking about all the leaves I will be raking. We are not allowed to burn them any more, which is fine by me. Though sometimes I will burn a few, I prefer to bag them.

My husband came up with the name Chunky Monkey. Little Coo is a juniorized version of Cougar who was my last cat. And think the little girl is still supposed to be Lucy but we call her Allison made over, or Allison reincarnated since her looks and personality are so much like a cat my daughter had by that name. Along with her nicknames of 'the princess' and Puss Puss.They are worth a fortune to me...every day I wonder how I have made it so long without a cat and boy, I would die if anything happened to one of them. The other day I don't know what Lucy had in her mouth...I thought at first she was choked. Then realized she had something caught in her moth but I couldn't tell what. I was trying to hold her and pry her mouth open and it was not working. You can only half imagine--I was ready to grab her and fly to the vet. Was trying to think did I want to try to drive her myself or get my neighbor to drive me while I held her. But I couldn't even hold her here...and every time she would get loose from me, she would run a few feet and then started trying to get 'whatever' out of her mouth. And ever time she got down and ran The Boy would run and pounce on her! He thought it was PLAYTIME! And this happened at least four or five times--over and over. She finally seemed to get it lose and chewed and swallowed. I think she may have gotten a piece of the dog's food lodged in her teeth or jaw someway.Anyway, a bit later when I got to thinking about it and how The Boy thought it was play time--I got so tickled. But oh while it was happening, I wanted to take him and lock him up! And all kinds of thoughts were going through my head like if she dies how am I going to explain it to my husband and daughter...how am I going to live with myself.These two can find more stuff to get into than any cat I have ever had. I don't even want to think about Christmas. Probably won't have an ornament left on the tree. They love our shoes--I have seen cats play with shoe strings, but they will get hold of the shoes, and sometimes my pants, and try to shake them like dogs shake things."},

And the attitude that I can make my own patterns. She had this saying that if you hadn't made a mistake, then you hadn't ever done anything. Only that is not exactly her words...This is the quilt that I lost for several years. This picture is probably the day I found it or the next...it was a dark dreary day...I had my husband hold it off the end of the porch. It is not a great picture....but you can at least see why I was upset. I can actually remember being very small when my mom pieced this quilt. I was probably 5 or 6 years old and can remember sitting in the floor at her feet playing with other scraps.I don't know where she got all the red material...I don't ever remember her just going and buying yardage of fabric except for muslin or else for making our clothes. Her quilts were almost entirely of scraps. They were by no means perfect but I loved them all. We always chose our favorite block when the quilt top was finished. She always had several tops waiting to be quilted....in fact I am not sure how many were/are still there after her death.I tell my brother I would love to have pictures of all the quilts she has made, and know where they all are. She made a bunch in her life...it was truly her passion. A lot were quilted, but she also tied a lot. She gave a lot away as graduation presents...I could not even begin to think of who all received them for that. I think all the grand kids have at least one...and most of us children do."},

I have had these blocks made for over a year--maybe even longer than two years.   As it is, the quilt is about 87 inches square.  I have blocks left and will do something with them...not sure what. As I type I have two kittens playing in my lap, as well as biting on me. I think they are telling me it is time to sit and snuggle. I usually sit with them in my lap for an hour or so and have not taken the time to do that tonight. They are settling down to snooze as I type this.

Riley's poem, When_the_Frost_is_on_the_Punkin keeps going through my mind. At least the first line or two. I wish I did have it memorized but I don't. Another one I should have memorized is September by Helen Hunt Jackson. Until I heard the poem by Riley, this is the one that repeated through my mind over and over--and I did know more of it. It seemed to be written just for me when I worked at the_orchard....my mom always repeated it in the fall so I grew up hearing it. The first year I worked at this orchard was a record breaking year. If they had kept records...the trees literally had to have props under the limbs. I don't know why I didn't take the time to take my camera and take pictures. It would have to be seen to be believed. That year there were lots of Red Delicious apples as big as soft balls and maybe bigger. And the mutsu trees were still young and one apple would actually make a pie, or come very close. Two would have been too many...if I can find it I actually think I have a picture of someone's hand picking one. It was taken sometime other than the first year...after I was not such a new employee. I almost have another quilt top together...I can't wait to get it done. It will be big enough for a queen sized bed. I should have had it done today but I had errands to run this morning and other things got me sidetracked part of the day.My breast finally bruised--it is one ugly mess. It has been mainly purple, with that greenish yellow cast to it. My husband thinks it looks soooo sore. I feel it when I ride--not real bad unless he hits a rough spot. Then I do grab it and cringe! But just normal stuff does not seem to hurt.I did put a lot of pictures of the kitties at my inbox_account...they are in the kitties album."},

They are definitely the light of my life right now!Yesterday the biopsy did not get done...they got me ready, numbed me, made the incision, and when they 'fired' the needle in, it hit a gusher. I bled and bled. This doctor has been doing this procedure for 12 years and it is the first time she has ever had to stop before she got the biopsy done. There was a LOT of blood...when they let go of me so I could turn over on my back, blood shot out at least 2 feet. Gauze pads were being saturated in just seconds. They finally got it stopped but held pressure on it for another 45 minutes to an hour. I was told that if it started bleeding at home and we could not stop it in a few minutes to get to the emergency room because I could bleed to death.However, I am going back October 3 to try again...the procedure isn't bad at all. I really wasn't dreading it much before and now even less. I know this was a rare thing to happen...the doctor kept apologizine and I told her that if it was going to happen to anyone, it would happen to me. And that it was no more her fault than it was mine. It was just one of those things."},

I could definitely use a design wall too! But I still like it--I think it will make a homey looking quilt--one that will call my name to come snuggle under it when I finally quilt it.So that is done, and tomorrow about this time I will be getting ready for my biopsies. Two places in my right breast. I will be so glad to have it done and over with. A lady called me yesterday to pre-register me...she told me it would be next week before I get the results.

He still has to make the plate that fits around it, but that won't take long or be hard. I am so thrilled to have it down there.And I did get all my nine-patches sewn together.

Plus she has a MIL that she cooks for every day, plus she has 4 grown kids and 3 grandchildren so her life gets rather full part of the time.  Hopefully, I will get motivated to get back into something quilty.  My nine-patch is half done.  And this past weekend we got my desk ready.  Maybe I should say my husband got it ready.  We just have to wait to find help to get it down in the basement.  It is sooo heavy.  I really hate for Roger to lift on it, but I am so anxious to have it down there.  I think once I get this nine-patch done that I will try to make myself piece on my Pfaff till I can have it ready to quilt any time.My basement is so full of stuff--this will make 3 full sized office desks with sewing machines sitting in them.  I feel like I have come a long way from having a Kenmore sewing machine that I felt guilty over even giving it away...it was horrible.   My husband got it for me probably for my first birthday after we were married.  I thought for the longest time it was just me that couldn't sew with it.  I worked full time then and only sewed a little every now and then.But after we moved to Tennessee for a while and I didn't work outside the home, it would sew good for a while, then all heck would break loose and it would not sew.  I would do everything imaginable and finally it would start sewing, but I could never figure what I done to remedy the situation.  I would do the usual of cleaning bobbin/bobbin area, rethread, change needle, etc.  Finally my oldest daughter was in elementary school and I tried to hem a simple cotton blouse one night and ended up doing it by hand.  That was the final straw.  I started shopping for a machine and settled on my Pfaff Tiptronic 1171.  I have really loved that machine!  That was around 1992 and I  have only had one little problem with it this past winter, and it wasn't affecting the sewing.  It just made a chirping noise...so took it in to be serviced and he could not find what was causing the noise but kept oiling it till it stopped."},

She was so nice though.The bottom line is while I have an old cyst that has been there a long time, I also have a place with about 30 microcalcifications and the radiologists wants me to have a biopsy done. Right now I am more bothered by whether I should tell people or whether I shouldn't. I don't want people to worry, but would appreciate the prayers. I really do not want one of my sisters to know cause I know how upset she will be.It really affected my husband, but like I told him, it isn't a death sentence just because a biopsy is called for. I just really don't want to worry about it.On to happier subjects, my daughter called tonight and she thinks I will be able to bring my kitten home this weekend. I cannot wait...I have been searching for a name for him. So far Moses is my choice. I would call him Mose for short. He is the kind of tabby my Cougar was....I still miss him. Here is a picture of my Cougar--I think it is the second picture of him I took with my digital Canon Rebel.  This is not too long before I had to have him put down.

That is Monday morning.  Still not into sewing or even photography...I did sew a few lines earlier this week and keep promising myself to get back down there.

I have been trying a new antidepressant--once before I was suffering with this fatigue thing and an antidepressant did the trick.  That was several years ago, and I have not had any real problems till now.  Anyway, this is totally messing with my stomach.  On the positive side, I should lose some weight.  The negative is that besides not ever feeling like eating, I don't even like to think about food--don't want to cook it or even smell it.  I just feel out of sorts all the way around.I accidentally forgot to take it once, and was able to eat a little better the next day.  So yesterday I skipped taking it till I would actually enjoy eating something today.  I have been taking it since the 8th and have not ate a full meal since.  Even with not taking it yesterday, I didn't really eat much today.I went to the doctor partly because I have been so moody plus just extreme exhaustion.   It might be that time of life for me since I am 51 yrs. old.  So, if this don't work, the doctor is going to do farther tests and see if Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) might be an option.  New studies have shown that it is not near as dangerous as once thought...in the original studies done, they avoided having one segment of women in it.It turns out that it is NOT good for women who are past menopause, but shows that in the others, that 40% of those that don't have HRT will develop Alzheimer's by age 80.  There was an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, and also an article about that article in the Los Angeles times--June 21st I think is the date.  HERE is where I first heard about the article...it at least gave me hope that something can be done.  Maybe."},

This is not the entire song and not as good as the version I have, but it is a sample of it.

It is soooo skinny, and was just craving affection. She just purred so softly as I held her.....I have seen the little girl over there just kick her. I feel so bad for both--my husband asked me where I thought the little girl learned those actions...and he is right. They also have a puppy over there and I have seen her hit it across its face for absolutely nothing! And she is only maybe 4 or 5 years old at the most!I will probably make a run to the store tomorrow and pick up some kitty food so if it comes over here again, I will have something to feed it.

A quart of it does not last very long at all at any of our homes. So I am hoping to get to make more.Our car, a 1998 Toyota Camry with 140,000 miles on it has decided to give us some problems. We cannot complain though, as this is only the third thing we have had to deal with it since we got it in 2000. The other was the water pump and as it was time for it, the mechanic just went ahead and changed the timing belt while he had it. They both had lasted much longer than is normal. So, with the problem now, which my husband and son-in-law think is the starter, my husband had to drive the truck to work. Leaving me without wheels till it is fixed.Otherwise, I would be very tempted to go on a hunt for a bushel of tomatoes. There are several Amish families in Parke Country that sells produce. If we get it fixed, I may try to go next week....I have promised to go help my daughter freeze corn again on Saturday. Her stepson wants to come and help, but don't know if his mom will allow him. He would be my daughter's shadow if they had them all the time.

It is actually the first pictures I have taken of it I think. It is approximately 5 ft. square. One side of the hexagon measures 5/8's of an inch finished. The quilt has a couple bad spots--one is a little tear and the other there is a spot where top and batting is missing--I just found that this morning.

Gradually, almost all the original bunch have died. There is not a week goes by that I don't miss the neighbor, Lilly, that was to the north of us when we moved here.She first moved out to a senior living place, and her house came up for sell. Another neighbor bought it, as well as the house to the south of us and is using them for rentals. I cannot think how long Lilly has been gone from here--at least 7 years since she moved (she passed away in 2003 I think), anyway, this is the first time I feel like we might have a good neighbor there.I am so sick of the people that we have been getting for neighbors..we did have a couple that were nice to the south of us for a while.

I think the landlord makes them cut it when it is cut....My mind is wondering right now...thinking over all the people that have come and gone. The new neighbor's first name is Shelby, and that is the name of our dog! At least it makes it easy to remember her name. Our new neighbor enclosed part of her back yard right away with fencing. They were out there as we were leaving this evening and Roger asked her if she had a wolf or what...she said no, a beagle but he is just as bad...likes to dig out and run away.Well, he was out there when we got home and I just want to go give him a big old hug. He just has that friendly beagle look and his tail wags nice and slow when you talk to him! Yes, I think I am going to like this girl! I done like the dog--he doesn't bark and go nuts, though I did hear him bark a time or two. I don't mind legitimate barking...I just cannot take it when a dog barks non-stop for no apparent reason. But this beagle brings back memories of Ray, a neighbor that lived diagonally across from our corner. He raised beagles and sold them. For rabbit hunting. He had this one little beagle that was about 2 or 3 months old and for some reason out of all the dogs that he had, it was the only one that somehow managed to get out of the pen every week or two, and every time it came over here to us. Probably more to get to the girls cause they were young then. He was adorable...Enough reminising for tonight...hopefully I will either get to sew some tomorrow or at least take some pictures."},

In the creek pictured here. We go upstream from this dam a couple miles, park, get in the creek and fish with our ultra light rods and reels with artifical lures/jigs. We spent at least four or five hours in the stream today, and it was just so enjoyable. For the past few years, I could not wade and fish because I got so dizzy seeing the ripples in the water. Then, I got to thinking maybe it was looking through my bifocals that made it affect me so bad. So, today, I put my glasses on top my head--I have to have them to be able to see when I change lures. But otherwise, there they stayed. And I fished to my heart's content. Well, almost. I would not have minded staying a while longer but my husband has to go to work tomorrow, we had not eaten since morning, so we headed home.It was such a wonderful day though. We caught a little bit of everything--bluegill, small mouth and large mouth bass, rock bass, and of course I caught creek chub. I detest those things, and I honestly would rather catch nothing as to have to take one of those of my hook. I think it is cause they make noises when handled. It sort of makes me shiver just to think about. And I swear they are slimier feeling than a normal fish."},

I am trying to get back on track...I do have a lining in the frames and plan to get the batting and top pinned in sometime in the next week. It is a log cabin and going to be quilted very simply. I had planned to machine quilt it, but it is going to be a while before my Juki's desk is ready so just thought I would see how doing the quilting by hand would go.I have also made 73 nine patches--still unsure of how I am going to arrange them. That is something else to decide. I am pretty sure they are either going to be on point, alternated with a plain block, or else put half-square triangles on each side. (Square in a square?)My husband goes back to work light duty Monday...so today we decided to take one good long drive before he has to go back. We went south to Jackson-Washington_State_Forest here in Indiana....we really enjoyed it. And being that it was still a weekday, not many people were there.From there we went to Spring Mill State Park. This is a picture of the mill...it was quite interesting.

And hearing it live gave me a total different view of it...so now I love it, although I tend not to like the old style bluegrass unless it is live.WAGON_WHEEL is one of the songs I heard on there! No, I am not crazy about the video, but I don't watch them...I just turn them on and listen while Ido other things. Anything that mentions Tennessee in it gets my vote...then night before last I heard NORTH_KNOXVILLE by Todd Steed and Sons of Phere...there is a rock copy and an accoustic version. This link provides a link the the latter! Anyway, besides being gone a big part of the time, I have been messing around with music. In my search for some group, I ran across John Denver songs at YOU_TUBE!And that led to Neil Young....you get the drift. I did not even think of looking there for the Foo Fighters--though I get them at Yahoo's Launch. But for years I searched for the accoustic version of TIMES_LIKE_THESE. I bet if I had thought I could have found it on the web somewhere, but instead I just looked at music sites."},

I was too chicken to be tested...I could not have done it without finding out if I had it.  And I really didn't want to know if I tested positive for it.  I might have acted different if we had not had children already.The nephew we went to visit yesterday has a brother and sister and they are both positive for it...so far they are the only ones that show they have it.

She gives at least an inch extra, and a couple inces on one, 1 1/2 inch extra on another. And she has lots to choose from as well. Anyway, I bought the half yard of batik and the 3 fat quarters at The Stitchery and the other five 1/2 yd. cuts at Angie's.

I wished it could have been longer. Sometimes I still long to live in Tennessee, yet I just don't want to live that far away from our children. So here we sit.I have been slowly but surely making a few 9-patches every day. I am still undecided about what I am going to do with them. I will have to play around on Quilt Pro and see what I like. I have always thought I would do just a simple 9-patch quilt sometime, set on point, alternated with a plain square of fabric but maybe start out with one kind of fabric in the center and vary it as I work out.I just wanted to share something--this is my collection of batiks in 2005!  When I get my camera back I will try to spread out the collection I have now...I keep adding a half yard here and a half yard there.  it still isn't a huge collection compared to some but I think I have a good start.

Just cannot come up with where that is going to be.How do people decide what to make next in quilting...every time I finish something I have the most horrible time deciding what I want to start on next. I always think I am just going to go start cutting but the choices are so great that it is hard to do. However, I did start cutting 2 1/2 inch squares tonight...out of some of my not so loved anymore stash. A lot of those are Joann Fabric materials, though some are not. Right now I am cutting a lot of blues and browns...more browns than anything.My DH came up with the idea that I wanted to go to Arthur, IL today...and I never refuse that trip. (Arthur is an Amish community.) I go to two places over there: Miller's Dry Goods and Stitch and Sew. Miller's Dry Goods is out in the country which makes for a pleasant drive. They have all kinds of fabric including polyester from ages ago. They do not have electricity so I tend to get kind of frustrated looking at the material...you just cannot see with the gas lighting. They also have a lot of stuff the dime stores used to carry.Stitch and Sew is my favorite shop over there...it is not huge, but has a pretty good selection. I did come home with some fabrics that could be classified as lights--I have the hardest time picking out lights. My stash is 90% medium to dark. I added yellow to the last two quilt tops I have worked on, no make that three--it is the only thing that kept them from being one big boring mess.

Friday about noon the surgeon's office called and ask if my husband could come in about 1:50 instead of tomorrow. We jumped at the chance to get that over with. He is still on restrictions of no lifting or straining, but he does start therapy next week. After a couple sessions, he can begin to drive again.Then, we celebrated Father's Day both Friday night and yesterday evening....today we have just sat around and relaxed. Friday evening our youngest daughter, Sarah and her husband came. We cooked steaks on the grill, had a salad and baked potato. I fixed two jello/cool whip desserts:1 small box of either strawberry or lime jello in at least 2 quart bowlAdd 2/3 c. boiling water and stir at least 2 minutes till it is well dissolved.Next add 2 c. ice cubes and stir till the jello starts to set. Remove the remainder of the ice cubes.Use 8 to 12 oz of cool whip and blend together real well with wire whip. Pour this into a graham pie crust and refrigerate!This is one simple, quick refreshing dessert.Yesterday we went to our other daughter's house in the evening. I had to run all over to find pork spareribs for this. I ended up having to run to Terre Haute to Kroger's. Came home and my husband put them on to boil. I fixed our late breakfast/early lunch. Then watched the ribs, and made baked beans and made a dip for the vegetables my husband cut up.I boil the ribs until they are tender, then coat them in barbecue sauce and cook on the grill a few minutes. After I got them on the grill, I washed our car while my husband tended the ribs. By the time I got that done, it was time to take a shower head down to our daughter's house...they fixed hamburgers on the grill, and her MIL made a dessert.My daughter and her husband were leaving for an Alaskan cruise today--and she took my camera with her! I feel naked without it...I can use my husband's point and shoot but I cannot get close-ups with it. At least not the quality that I can with my digital SLR.I did start on the binding on my string quilt--still trying to think of a name that says it all. Not having much luck. A friend on the Quilts Your Way forum suggested Little Shop of Horrors and that fits it the best so far. There is not much good that can be said about the quality of this quilt, other than it will soon be finished. And it is colorful. It has pieces from material some of my dresses were made when I wash in school.I am doing the binding totally by machine. I trimmed the quilt, and sewed the binding on the first time from the back. I am turning the other to the front and using one of the fancy stitches on the Viking to sew it down. I am doing the binding in sections and not mitering the corners--I think mitering the corners are easy--this is the first time I have every sewed a binding on in sections. So it is kind of scary to me."},

She didn't find out anything new--she done knew that she had a slightly leaky valve. It can be taken care of with medicine and should not get any worse. We were both very weary when we got home. I did not sew a stitch yesterday.Today has been a different story. I did all the quilting I am going to do on my string quilt. Here are a couple pictures of it, but I suggest you click HERE which will take you to my pictures at Inbox...click on the album titled 'String quilt 1970's-2007.' It will show close-ups of some of the quilting.I tried different things in my quilting since this quilt was a mess to begin with. I am definitely of the better finished than perfect persuasion. I cannot wait to have a quilt top/quilt sandwich that is sewn and basted half-way right. I really like the look of all the quilting. I definitely need all the practice I can get, but I will take more time with a quilt top that I have done right to begin with.I don't know where to begin to tell about this quilt top. I did the string piecing part when I was in high school...I can tell because two or three of the fabrics used are from my freshman year. I used magazine pages folded in half lengthwise and cut off the corners. That was the base I sewed to. I apparently did not do such a good job of getting them all the same size. My mom set them together and I think she gave up on them and just did anyway to get them sewn together. This was planned as an everyday quilt from the very beginning...and it will keep us warm. So all is not in vain.The third picture is a piece of fabric that I just love. And I think I have seen similiar to it maybe in Hancocks of Paducah catalog...I would dearly love to have some yardage of it. It is the only piece in the quilt I think. My BIL's mother died either when I was still in elementary school or right after I started high school and she had several dresses cut out and ready to sew. This was from one of those."},

If it had been anything serious we would have had to call on friends.  My husband is not supposed to lift over 10 lb. since his surgery, and nothing strenuous at all.I watered our little garden this evening--the cucumbers looked like they would die if they did not get a drink.  So I gave everything water.  I will try to take new pictures of it till you will see what I mean when I say little.  There are little tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers.  But I noticed one of the cucumbers is deformed...I am assuming it didn't get pollinated good!  Don't know if that is the reason for cucumbers, but if apples don't get pollinated good, they either don't grow at all, or only one side will grow.Around here there is concern because bee hives are disappearing and they don't know why.  We have heard of the bee mites, but this is something different.I only did a very little quilting today.  If I could get to go down for a couple of hours, I could get a lot done.

And it is almost rarer to see Mama and the three babies together, but I do every now and then. She won't let me actually pet her, but she will reach for my hand and pull it to her. And sometimes stands with her front paws in my hand. The babies seem to know my voice, I suppose from me talking to Mama all the time she was pregnant with them.

He feels fairly good, just took his first medicine for discomfort.  He did not take any at all in the hospital.

When he coughs, he no longer has pain down his arm, and even though he took the medicine tonight, it was not for the same old pain.  This pain has to do with the surgery itself.I have been quilting a little bit every day on my old UFO--I think when it is finished I will name it Pleats and Tucks--it is just awful.  And it isn't the back either.  I don't know if I just did it horrible or what...but it is one holy mess.  I do try a few different designs when quilting but it is mostly meandering.

It is the honest truth--it has been a sandwich since 1978.  And the top itself is older than that.  I did it when I was still in high school.  It is straight-pin basted.  I hand quilted just a tiny portion of it when I first sandwiched it, and have not touched it since.So I got it out, took it down to the basement to my Juki.  I loaded two or three bobbins and threaded the machine with what I think I am going to use to quilt it.  But we had to leave to go to the ball game before I could actually attempt any quilting.

My husband required one. His neck/upper back area has really been causing him grief. Pain had started extending down his arm, to the tips of his fingers. Thursday was a most of the day thing simply because they wanted an x-ray of his eyes before they would do the MRI. We had to go to a completely different address for the x-ray, and had to wait about an hour besides. Then back to Indiana MRI where we had to wait again because we had lost our place in line.Today we went to see a surgeon. A spur has developed around the disc in C6 that is pressing on the nerve. The doctor did not push surgery, just said my husband would have to decide when it was limiting his life, and when he was having too much pain. That time has already arrived. He will have surgery this Thursday.We have been kind of upset and worried the entire weekend after our chiropractor talked to Roger. I do think he managed to get my husband to really listen to what the doctor says about when he can do things...then after meeting this doctor and talking to him we are both relieved and feel that this is the thing to do.He will be off work for at least a couple weeks and possibly then go back to work at something considered light duty. And he should be about back to normal in 6 months. So that is something he feels like he can live with."},

I decided today I would try to get back in the habit of taking her. As a reward to myself I took my camera. And this picture of what around here is called honeysuckle is one of the pictures I took. Can't you just smell it! I was half a block away and the fragrance made me close my eyes and breathe in ever so deeply.I took some other pictures of wild flowers...it is amazing when you look closely at them just how pretty they are. Other than flowers, I often see rabbits down there. Usually there are deer tracks, and I have actually seen one on occasion. Otherwise, about all to be seen are robins with maybe a hawk flying over head.After getting home from there, it was off to Walmart to pick up a few things, by the grocery store, and by the post office for stamps.
