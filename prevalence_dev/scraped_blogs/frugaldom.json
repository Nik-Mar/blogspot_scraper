{"title": "There's a Whole New Generation of Frugal Living Folks", "date": "Wednesday 8 February 2023", "text": "The Frugal BankHello to my frugal friends, family and fellow money savers. It's been a while since we discussed household finances - too long, in fact! It's now come to my attention that I've been living this frugal lifestyule for so long that I've forgotten that an entirely new generation has joined us, many of whom haven't, yet, discovered the joys of frugaldom. But what, exactly, do I mean by 'frugaldom'? Read on and find out for yourselves.What is a Budget?A budget is probably the most important thing you can have, as far as your finances are concerned,. It is your budget that dictates the lifestyle you can comfortably afford to lead. It's as simple as looking at the overall amount of money you have coming into your household and deducting all of the regular payments you have going out - everything from your rent or mortgage to repaying debts, paying household bills, food shopping, holidays and everything in between. If you add up all your out-goings (be brutally honest with yourself about this) and deduct them from your overall income, whatever is left is what you can realistically afford to save or overpay any debts to clear those off first. If your regular out-goings are higher than your regular income, then the bank of you is broken and needs some emergency repairs. It doesn't matter if you have savings in the bank - if you are eating into those just to live from day to day, rather than for emergencies, then you need to stem the flow of cash and balance your books.What to do if your bank is brokenStop spending immediatelyPrioritise - essential household bills and debt repayments need paying firstMake a list because lists are very versatile and help you focusNeeds not wants - you need food and water to survive so think survival! You don't need tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, expensive toiletries, 1,000 TV channels, takeaway mealsm big brand names or the latest gadgets.Reassess your budget in a more meaningful way - keep a spending diary and record every penny spent. Your role has now become that of accountant and manager of your own home, no matter what form your home takes.You need to count in all costs - from the cost of living to the cost of working - have you ever counted up how much your job is costing you? Are you wasting money on travel, coffee breaks, lunches etc?Look at ways of generating some emergency income - extra work, sell stuff you no longer need, decluttering your space can declutter your mind.Analyse your overall debt total to start chipping away at that, paying whatever is commanding the highest interest rate first.Become a frugalista in the kitchen and adopt a zero tolerance for waste. Believe it or not, it is still possible to live on an average of £1 per day for all your meals, based on £365 per person over the year. I'm not saying that it is easy and you may need to find your nearest food bank, community larder and Olio food hero, plus find a friend prepared to share so you can take better advantage of offers - it can be done.Learn to make and love porridge, soups, stir fries, stews, curries and strange concoctions of leftovers.How can I save money?Get creative. Consider what you do as your daily and nightly routines: how much fuel, electricity or gas are you using, how often do you socialise, how far do you travel, what paid hobbies do you enjoy, do you buy takeaway food... the list is endless. Pay attention to how you feel and why you feel that way about giving up anything that is eating into your funds. Think of alternatives: do you like art, writing, blogging, reading, walking, cycling, crafting, gardening... anything that can get you through the toughest of times without costing you money. Keep warm with wool or fleece and a hot water bottle but keep your home aired to prevent condensation and dampness. When you boil water, fill a flask with any extra to use later. Cook from scratch, search this blog for simple soup recipes and challenge yourself to create magic meals from leftovers, free food or home grown fruit and vegetables. There are so many ways to save money so I hope you will spend some time reading past posts while I do my utmost to bring this blog up to date. I can only apologise for drifting but it's been full on chaos trying to keep up with everything since the Covid-Brexit combination saw off our Frugaldom volunteer exchange students and lost us previously agreed foster homes for rescue animals that still remain in our care. Find some like-minded friends who understand your financial situation by joining us online - just look for @Frugaldom on social media or search for '2023 Frugal Living Challenge' in the Moneysavingexpert.com forums. Together, we can fix this. Find your frugal living mojo and life may never be the same again."},
{"title": "Frugaldom in 2023", "date": "Thursday 26 January 2023", "text": "Frugal living brought us to Frugaldom - you can read previous blogs from over the years to follow the routes we took to get here, plus read more about the narrow path of frugality on which we remain today, in order to further improve what has already been achieved.    The land of Frugaldom has an Animal Welfare Establishment licence, enabling us to give sanctuary to various ponies, goats and other animals while we tend to their needs and prepare to move certain ones on into permanent homes.If you could give a good, knowledgeable home to a pony then why not consider joining us as a sponsor or becoming a foster carer.    Our yard area, in front of the barn, became a campervan stopover aire.Being totallyoff-grid,we offer nothing more than overnight parking in exchange for a donation. With the help of 'WC in Fields' we incorporated a waste water disposal facility, for use of which there's a £5.00 charge to help cover the service charges.    Next, we completed the centrally located hut and it has served us well as a place to retreat during inclement weather. We often hide out in there for a cuppa with friends, family and our visiting volunteers who come to help plant trees to create a new woodland. So successful has the hut been that we have now applied for planning permission to build two more smaller huts that will allow the members of our extended Frugaldom family to opportunity to stay on site. Everything is off-grid so it's very much a case of getting right back to basics. We have portable solar for lights, a log burner for heat, a camping style gas stove for cooking indoors and a brazier / BBQ made from a washing maschine drum that gets used regularly outdoors.    That about brings us up to date, other than telling you about the gypsy bowtop wagon. It arrived at Frugaldom after last year's Appleby Horse Fair, pulled by a lovely little horse named Tommy. A second wagon, drawn by the massive horse named Oddball, has stayed at Frugaldom on a couple of occasions in the past but this time, both wagons came in and only one went back out again, with Oddbal and Tommy leaving side by side. I don't know if this wagon will be heading back out on the road any time soon but for now, it's parked up and gets used where it is. Friends have camped out in it a number of times and will be again, during this year's tree planting. If anyone wants to plant some trees or coppice some willows to help expand our Legacy Woodland project, please get in contact.     Finances - we cannot have a full year's round-up without mentioning the moneysaving and frugal living endeavours, can we? Life has continued with my personal 'Living on £4,000 for a year' challenge, as has the '£1 per person per day for all meals'. The budget still works for the necessities but for groceries, it's mostly manageable thanks to sites and apps like Olioex.com and to the continuing efforts at homegrown fruit, vegetabls and herbs, plus the usual love of soup and porridge.    I continue to run the frugal living challenge on moneysavingexpert.com, within their forums section. Check out the 2023 Frugal Living Challenge for yourself and feel free to join us online.   We still have the holiday caravan for rent throughout the season on the basis that you bring everything you need, including bedding and linen, and leave the caravan exactly as you found it.    And now for the fundraising part - we currently have 9 ponies, 2 goats, a small flock of hens and ducks, and two guinea pigs. We have much work to do just to keep this lot so we are unable to take on any more anmals at this time. We have fences needing repaired, the barn roof has sprung a leak, the goats need a proper house and the 'tree shelter' is in need of a major overhaul. The drive needs all the potholes filling in, there's more drainage needed and it's a fulltime job looking after the animals so all help is welcome and any contributions hugely appreciated. I set up a page specifically for friends, family and others sending contributions - it can be found at www.ko-fi.com/Frugaldom - so please take a look and consider becoming Friends of Frugaldom.     Finally, I will be trying to bring this blog back up to date while also transferring a few of the older files onto the Frugaldom.com website, which has a blog feature for the Frugaldom project itself. I'd like to reserve this blog for the actual nitty gritty, penny-pinching, budget-stretching, off-grid and frugal living topics."},
{"title": "FRUGAL ROUND-UP OF 2021", "date": "Tuesday 28 December 2021", "text": "HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022It has been some time since I updated this blog but the past couple of years have simply flown by and merged into some sort of time-warped blur. Between the pandemic, the FrugaLdom project, ponies, poultry and now goats, my time has been spent trying to keep up with the daily chores, keeping a tight hold on the budget and pursuIng all the challenges that I set myself each and every year. I'm ending 2021 on a bit of a high! We pulled out all the stops and finally managed to get our hut built. Planning permission took 7 full months to be granted as the planning department staff members were all working from home, then our designated planning officer went off sick for quite some time. However, we got there in the end! In addition to this, and during all of this, we somehow ended up opening a campervan and motorhome stopover site, otherwise known as an 'Aire'. It's similar to those found in France and elsewhere, but without the services. Our 'Aire' is a bit like a frugal campsites for self-sufficient motorhomes and campervans - all we offer is parking space, nothing more. In exchange for parking we accept small donations that contribute towards the running of Frugaldom project. I love it! We get to meet interesting people who share our love for Frugaldom and the outdoors and some even help out on site during their stay.2021 also brought another Avian Bird Flu pandemic so all our hens and ducks are having to stay undercover at home, away from Frugaldom, until such times as we can build them proper, covered enclosures there that are completely mink, fox, stoat and weasel proof. The duck pond now has fish swimming in it, the old duck enclosure has goats living in it and the yard, has been designated as parking for our visitors. We completed the pony shelters, hay storage and potting shed, and extended the little hay shelter to more than double its orginal size. Now we need to improve the goat housing, build the poultry & duck enclosures and get more trees and hedging planted, while making attempts at improving the food growing side of things. We need like-minded volunteers so if you fit that bill... 2022 is going to be about minimalism and off-grid living, as much as possible. I want to grow more food, use less electricity and, as always, make everything as affordable as possible so that each penny can do the job of a pound. With inflation currently sitting at over 5%, things could get tougher but with some forward thinking, I'm sure we can all make some changes that will see us through the worst of any crises arising. Protecting income is paramount when the global economy is this shaky so investing in longterm 'survival' and self-sustainability seems the obvious choice to me. If I can help anyone else cope with their current situations by offering moral support and a place to escape now and again then I will.We are all in this together and together we will succeed in whatever we set our minds to doing. Whether it is debt-busting, money saving, developing small business ideas or simply learning more about how to be happy leading a frugal lifestyle, everything is possible. Feel free to join us in the forums of the Moneysavingexpert website, taking part in our 2022 Frugal Living Challenge. You can also like / follow the daily updates from Frugaldom on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Any questions, just ask. Don't be shy.Our savings have been seriously depleted but as long as we can clear at least minimum wage while living on £4,000 per year, there is still wriggle room to recoup - even when it's costing an extra few thousand pounds a year to feed all the animals. Who knows, we may even dedicate part of our project to becoming a designated sanctuary and Scottish wildlife reserve next year. Having the hut on site means having the ability to be on site longer, staying there whenever possible. I'm still writing for my living and have just signed another book deal as a ghostwriter so perhaps 2022 will see the realisation of yet another dream - being a writer who writes from a cabin in the country.SEE BEYOND YOUR DREAMS - ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!All the very best to each and every one of you for the new year ahead - even to those who don't 'get' what we are about and who can't see the wood for the trees. Good health and happiness to all - stay safe and dont forget to wash your hands. 😊www.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "2021 Frugal Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday 2 January 2021", "text": "HAPPY NEW YEAR 20212020 is a year that most people, the world over, will be glad to see the back of, mostly because of te Coronavirus pandemic. I won't even attempt to go into details as all the information you need about it can be found on most news pages. All that I will say is please stay safe - follow guidelines and local rules, and most importantly, use your common sense. Health and hygiene are intertwined. Plenty of fresh air is essential, a bit of exercise is ideal and both of these things are totally free... just open up your door and get yourself outdoors. Free, free, free... breath in that freedom.2021 arrived at Frugaldom as a frosty morning bathed in sunshine. Working outdoors without a jacket at this time of year is becoming more common and up until last week, I was still able to do so in short sleeves. What I need to keep reminding myself, however, is that even the winter sun can burn. Our frugal living challenge has begun again and this year has brought more changes. My plan is t chart these changes and, once again, tighten the purse strings to enable further savings for further investment into the Frugaldom project.

{"title": "Frugaldom Walkabout #1", "date": "Monday 19 October 2020", "text": "This is something new for me, as it has taken me quite some time to get around to mastering a mobile phone and camera. This has mainly been down to the fact that we don't have and signal at home so when it turned out that we could pick up a 3G signal from the Frugaldom project, it made things a whole lot easier. I can now post short video clips and share project progress with you all.There is no commentary on the videos as we enjoy the peace, tranquility and freedom to be at one with nature while working outdoors at Frugaldom. It's a place where we welcome members, sponsors and volunteers who love nature and who want to be a part of our project.Frugaldom is not for profit.

{"title": "Looking Back", "date": "Sunday 30 December 2018", "text": "4 of the 5 rescued and rehomed ponies at FrugaldomHello to all who read these frugal blogs! I hope you all had a lovely Christmas season and that you enjoy Hogmanay and the new year festivities.I've just been updating the old forums, the ones that go back to 2010, as Ive found it impossible to retrieve the most recent ones that fell out of our reach when the software and operating platform changed. Not to be completely outdone, I succeeded in retrieving these old ones and have now redirected the domain www.frugalforums.co.uk towards them for our 2019 frugal living and working challenges. (Everyone is welcome to join us, it's free!)Anyway, while unlocking previously archived sections of the forums and updating them as I went along, I stopped at the letter 'B' - it's alphabetical - and began reading about all our ideas and plans for the future. It's where I found this and saw just how far we had come over the past 8 years and showed that my longterm aims hadn't realy changed, apart from the fact that finding several like-minded others has, so far, proven to be impossible. Oct 20, 2010 #7In the wake of today's spending review, a thought struck me when listening to the heated debates about the housing crisis, social housing and council rents. Affordable housing is still absent, in my opinion, for all of those people who don't want or can't get mortgages. If housing associations and others are going to be encouraged to provide more affordable homes, why do we still see so many derelict or crumbling properties? I would love the opportunity to develop a derelict site into a profitable business with the potential to expand on that and bring others into the game plan. All around us are derelict houses - small collapsing cottages  left to rot because owners who have inherited them can't agree how to split any proceeds from sales, or else left to rot in an effort to avoid tax. Removing the roof to avoid the roof tax has long, since, been abolished (as far as I am aware) but we now face the \"problem\" of these properties costing their owners up to 40% in capital gains tax. I just don't get it! Surely, in this economic climate, 60% of any surplus property sale in the pockets of the owners must be worthwhile. It has to beat zero with a crumbling wreck as your personal responsibility.One excellent frugal business proposition would be for workers' co-operatives to raise the capital to purchase these unwanted properties to turn them into viable microholdings for those who are prepared to invest in their own futures. The cost of a brick, afterall, is still the cost of a brick. It shouldn't be too adversely affected by where that brick gets laid. Waste land, scrap land, disused sites, abandoned sites... the list goes on and on, yet the right to participate in any such project is curtailed, once again, by finances and the need for ludicrous amounts of cash. A group of like-minded individuals working for the benefit of all could surely earn a living by dividing the spoils, assuming they were able to amass the funds needed to initiate such a project in the first place?My search continues for that first, elusive piece of land that could start the ball rolling. I don't have 50,000+ in the bank to buy a tiny building plot, nor do I intend borrowing it, but I'd be prepared to invest in a project where nobody squabbled about percentages and hours of work they contributed to the end result. All things being equal, (which they aren't) 1000 man hours equates to almost 6,000 even on minimum wage.Frugaldom, as a complete microholding package, is a viable business proposition. We aren't setting out to become millionaires, we're setting out as frugal entrepreneurs in the hope of realising dreams. For me, money in the banks just won't pay in the long run, not with inflation running at more than twice the BoE base rate.============================End=========================="},

{"title": "10 Small Business Ideas for People Who Love Nature", "date": "Wednesday 14 November 2018", "text": "Almost anyone can be an entrepreneur; the only thing missing for many is a great idea. The best place to find a great business idea is to look into something about which you are passionate, for example, if you’re passionate about nature, there are plenty of business ideas with which you can run!1. Adventure ClubA great idea for those who know the area around them and aren’t afraid of a little excitement is an adventure club!These clubs usually consist of a leader (that’s you!) taking members on outdoor adventures. The element of excitement is really up to you and your adventure-seeking customers. These adventures could be as simple as hiking an easy trail together or as exciting as white water rafting, depending on your expertise. Your profits will be even higher if you are teaching your club members something they don’t know. For example, teaching people how to rock climb might come with a higher charge than group hikes.  2. Outdoor Cleaning ServiceYou probably already know that cleaning service businesses are profitable.While it might take a little more time than cleaning a bathroom, you can also take a cleaning service outdoors. You can keep your services as simple as cleaning up litter in a backyard to as involved as construction clean up or even graffiti removal. Depending on the area in which you serve, one type of cleaning service might be more popular than the other.  3. LandscapingIf you love the outdoors and have a bit of a green thumb, consider starting a landscaping business. A landscaping business helps people transform their yards, gardens, or other sites into something they love and even boost kerb appeal.It’s important to note that a landscaping business typically requires some level of education. After all, you have to know how to analyze a site, plan out a landscaping blueprint, and become familiar with local and national building codes and ordinances. It’s also important to know how to not only make a site attractive, but also how to make it safe and effective. For instance, you will need to consider factors such as stormwater management.  4. Run a Horse StableIf you love horses, you could always make a living working with them. Simply owning horses won’t really earn you a living, but if you have land and farm buildings, then you could offer a boarding service for other people with horses. Alternatively, you could also teach riding, subject to the appropriate qualifications, licensing and insurances. This will give you the opportunity not only to spend time outside with your favorite animals but to share that love with others as well.  5. Small-Scale FarmingIf you want to make a name for yourself at your local farmers' market, you don’t have to turn around acres of crops. Instead, you can turn your garden into a space for growing some veggies and maybe even fruits. You can earn extra by offering products as well as raw crops. For instance, if you know how to make jam, you can sell this for a higher price - again, subject to the necessary certification.6. Dog CareMaybe you still want to take care of animals but large animals are a little too much; maybe they aren’t your preference or maybe you don’t have enough land. However, there are plenty of animals that you can take care of while living a smaller, more frugal lifestyle.To spend time outdoors, you can start a dog-walking business. This is a great option because there are many people who can’t take time in the middle of the day to come home and walk their dogs.  If you want to push this business to a more profitable level, you can board dogs as well. You can be selective in the dog breeds you choose to board to ensure you don’t end up with an untrained dog in your house for a weekend.  7. Start Your Own “Green” ShopIf opening a retail shop or purchasing a franchise is a bit too much, you can easily start small by opening an online store. You can also sell  products that you make to a small following. You can link up with sites like Giving Assistant to help earn you a following and boost sales.Your love of nature comes in with what you make. Maybe you want to make your own, homemade tea blends or make everyday products through a greener process. This is your chance to use your love of nature to create something of which you can be proud.8. Open a Beauty SalonCreating your own beauty salon doesn’t quite sound linked to nature, but it can be, with a little creativity. Think about it this way: When you visit the beauty salon, how many chemicals and ingredients damaging to the environment do you see?As an alternative to this, you can start your own beauty salon that uses safer products. There are plenty of hair products and skin care products that you can make with completely eco-friendly, vegan ingredients.9. Eco-ConsultingDo you already dedicate your life to green living? Is recycling and composting a part of your daily routine? Are you greener than the average person? If so, then you might be the perfect person to start an eco-consulting business!Many people don’t live or operate their offices in the most eco-friendly ways. In many cases, these people simply aren’t sure of where to start and where to go. This is where you step in: Your business would be to help these clients transition to more eco-friendly businesses, operations and lifestyles.  10. Green HousekeepingAs we pointed out earlier, many people are willing to pay for cleaning services—inside and out. However, much like we mentioned with beauty salons, these services usually include an alarming amount of harmful ingredients to nature—and humans!Regardless of the type of “nature” business you choose to start, there are plenty of options available. With a little creativity and hard work, you can turn your love for nature into a healthy living—in more ways than one. You should always check that you have any essential qualifications, permissions and/or insurances necessary for carrying out your chosen business ventures but there is bound to be something you can do that combines your love of nature with income generation."},
{"title": "2018 at Frugaldom", "date": "Tuesday 16 October 2018", "text": "This is your whistle-stop tour of Frugaldom during 2018Apologies for my extremely lengthy absence but we stepped things up a gear and implemented many changes that we hope will benefit all our friends, family and followers of Frugaldom. It has been a very busy year so far.Here at Frugaldom, we have tried our very best to reduce, reuse and recycle as much as possible, keep wihin our strict budget and stretch every penny as far as it can possibly go. So far, we are succeeding, although progress is very slow, what with mixed weather, lack of a workforce and trying to find companies (or even individuals) who will come out to Frugaldom and do the work required.Site of the new 'Legacy Working Woodland' and track around it. In January and February 2018 we organised the next area for planting the working woodland. The area extends to over 3 acres, most of that made up of clearfell and bordered by a stream. We employed the services of local workers who were on site for several days clearing around the edge of the planned woodland and sectioning it all off with stockfencing.Fencing of the new working woodland area was completed in February 2018 We had no sooner completed the main fencing when winter returned with a vengance, blanketing us in snow and, at times, making it impossible to drive to Frugaldom - walked, instead. However, the ponies were happy enough and kept all the paths clear. They are fed a constant supply of hay, along with access to salt and minerals, so weather isn't a factor in their feed bill. They eat like horses and cost the same to feed every day of the year.Snowy FrugaldomThe snow ceased temporarily, allowing us two nights away to celebrate a family wedding. Many thanks go to the brave Emily who took on the unenviable task of caring for the ponies, with further thanks due to her for topping up our water bottles when the pipes were all frozen at the caravans. 😊 Such help was greatly appreciated by all concerned.Prolonged sub-zero temperatures in MarchBy late February, early March, temperatures had plunged further below zero meaning all our water sources, both at the field and at the caravan park, froze solid. At that point, we were collecting water in containers from the river and carting it to and fro, relying on bottled water for cooking and drinking, with the water from the burn being used for ponies, chickens and toilet flushing! With the big freeze came gales, so more windbreak mesh was added around certain areas as a temporary solution to problems caused by driving winds.Anneka had returned from Germany to volunteer for a couple of weeks during her break so she got more than she bargained for with on the spot lessons in extreme frugal, off grid living while we were solely reliant on river water, solar power and cylinder gas. We were also trying to keep warm in a caravan in March.Hay feeding, poop picking and tree plantingThe daily chores at Frugaldom always begin with checking water, topping up hay feeders, feeding the chickens and collecting all the dung from around the tracks. This routine is relentless - it is seven days per week and gets done at least twice a day. It means that no matter who visits, these jobs always have to take priority. Luckily, even the youngest visitors are happy to help out with most things.Ponies out on the marshy moorland Whenever we got dry weather during March, tree planting got into full swing. It even got dry enough to allow the ponies out onto the marshy moor grass, where they foraged for tasty snacks among the bog myrtle and heather.Then the floods came By the third week in March, the snow had all gone, the ice had all melted and the rain arrived big time! The bottom field, which is parially planted with downy birch, alder, hawthorn and willow, went under water yet again. Fortunaely, it runs off almost as quickly as it floods, so the trees within our riparian planting ground continue to thrive and the ponies maintain the 'barn owl track' between the flood land and the rest of the project.March also brought sunshine and MallardsMarch is mainly about tree plantin. We received our next 420 saplings from the Woodland Trust, thanks to them and their sponsors at Ikea, Sainsbury's, Yorkshire Tea and the players of the People's Postcode Lottery. We have received 420 saplings each November and March since we began the Frugaldom project in 2014 and have been planting each phase as either woodland or foraging hedgerow. This tree planting project  (2014 - 2018) was undertaken as part of the World War I Centenary, and will culminate on 11th November, when we will be planting the final batch of trees into our memorial woodland. Here, too, will be displayed the Ecoarts war horse.Our WWI Cenenary Woodland at Frugaldom is planted to commemorate all the people and animals lost to a war fought to defend and protect our freedom. For this, we are truly thankful.Tree planting and new orchardsSo far, Frugaldom has been awarded a total of 3,780 saplings from The Woodland Trust and we hope to continue planting to replenish lost hedgerow that will provide a safe haven for wildlife and free foraging opportunities for future visitors to the project. Alongside the native tree planting, we are also planting orchards that include heritage variety, Galloway Pippin apples.The Cuckoo Corral, so named because the cuckoos visit it in Spring, now has around 70 fruit trees and is gradually being surrounded by a new hedgerow of dogwood, rosa ragusa, hazel, hawthorn and crab apple. Numerous wild flower seeds have been scattered around this orchard and it will soon also become home to our herd of creel ponies. (More on this soon.) As always, we welcome your contributions towards establishing the orchards and offer the opportunity to dedicate a tree to someone special. Details for this can be found in the Frugal Shop.Try frugal living for yourself in 2019During April and May, major renovation works were carried out at the new cottage. This one-bedroom cottage with adjoining garden room / studio and allotment-style garden will be made available to anyone who would like to sample a frugal lifestyle experience - you'll be tending the gardens and making the most of village life while here. The cottage is located within easy walking distance of the main London to Belfast bus route, plus it has adequate secure storage for bicycles, so no need to even bring a car! Reduce, reuse, recycle and keep an eye on your carbom footprint. Sample frugaldom for yourselves in 2019 at a price you can afford. Weekends, mid-week, all week, a fortnight or a month... you decide.Frugal Breaks at Three Lochs Holiday Park April saw the first of our holiday makers arriving so it was fortunate that the weather improved. Our wall of daffodils gave a beautiful display behind the caravans and despite some wet days, we had plenty of good weather that allowed our guests the opportunity to explore Frugaldom and the surrounding area.You can bring your horseApril also saw the arrival of our first ever equine holidaymaker for one of our frugal breaks. This gorgeous Thoroughbred seemed to enjoy every minute of her therapy break, as did her owner.Duck eggs incubating and Phase 2 cottage work completed May proved to be a really busy month with the next phase of work being completed at the cottage, the arrival of our first renter, duck eggs going into the incubator and the usual chores being carried out daily at Frugaldom.  The ground gradually dried up in the sunshine and the plants and trees began to grow.At Frugaldom The bog myrtle (Myrica Gale) lends its name to 'Myrical', the Ecoarts unicorn at Frugaldom. As the buds and cones on the shrubs changed to deep russet, the green buds of willow began to burst into life. Down in the marshy, moor grass field, the ponies have done an excellent job of maintaining the barn owl strip, which is flanked on one side by the marsh and on the other by riparian planting of a small woodland copse of alders, edged by wetland tolerant hedging.Ponies going out onto the clear fell From one extreme to another - by May, the rain had left us completely, leading to water shortages of a different kind. This led us to move the ponies out onto the newly fenced track around what will become the 'Legacy Woodland', where they had access to the stream. It also meant that they cleared the area where the raspberries will be cultivated, which is brilliant. except that part of the project needs more funds raised to cover the costs of further fencing.Dry, hot, sunny weatherWith all the mud drying up, it was time to sow seeds and organise a bit more drainage, in preparation for winter. The main track dried out beautifully but so, too, did the wooden fencing. Now we need to raise the funds to get it all re-painted in 2019 so it doesn't start splitting. We still haven't finished the post and rail fencing but have, instead, been using electric fencing run off batteries topped up by solar panels in places. This one corner isn't electrified, it's just waiting for wooden fencing but needed to be protected from pony hooves after we planted some crab apple trees, herbs and wild flowers.Another muddy gateway drainedWhile the rain's away, we shall play... with mud, pipes, groundcover and gravel. Many thanks to Lyn for all her hard work in ditch digging and sorry you got so muddy. Oops! This is Harvey helping rake out the last of the stone that was used to backfill the drainage ditch after the pipes went into it. We ran out of stone and had to order yet another lorryload! To anyone who supports our project, it really is a case of every penny counts. It costs over £200 for each load of stone and to do all the drainage we need done will take literally hundreds more lorryloads. It's back-breaking work that continues almost all year round so feel free to volunteer... you don't need a gym when you can have all your exercise for free right here at Frugaldom! It's almost like your personal outdoor gym!I'm going to cut it short now and will continue into June 2018 in my next post. In the meantime, you may like to follow @Frugaldom on Twitter, like our Frugaldom Facebook page or even join us in the Frugal Living Challenge group, linked to Facebook. For anyone who would like to actively support the project, you can contact me via the Frugaldom website or social media. Holidays can be booked via Frugal Breaks and to contribute towards the project, see the options we have available in the Frugal Shop.You got it! We love everything frugal and strive to stretch every penny as far as possible, whether it be feeding and caring for rehomed ponies, rescuing chickens, offering frugal holiday accommodation, inviting volunteers or just simply living a good life. We're here to provide you with a really good reason to get up each morning and celebrate frugal life.Thank you to everyone who is helping make Frugaldom a shared reality."},
{"title": "2017 End of Year Round Up", "date": "Thursday 25 January 2018", "text": "Looking Forward to 2018 After a Very Busy 2017A fast forward through the month of December with this photo blog showing some of the things we did during December.The children started decorating a tree at Frugaldomreusing the baubles and tinsel  from last year.We had some old clothes to recycle so we made Mr Scarecrow,giving him an old football for a head, a flower pot for a hatand a broken rake to help prop him upright. He's stuffed with hay.For extra tree decorations, we used toilet paper tubesand salvaged food wrappers - these are our Hovis crackers!Making bells for the Christmas tree fromold tin foil, egg cartons and woolOur start was made from cardboard coveredin gold foil from a tomato puree tubeIt snowed!Frugaldom looked lovely in the snow,especially around the new pondsFrankie loves rolling in the snowOur American visitor returned for her Christmas breakand got her first ever experience of sitting on a bareback,barefoot, bitless pony - Willow in her winter woollies.It was very pretty at the caravans, even ifthis first lot of snow only lasted a day or soMost of the snow fell on the Galloway hills.The decorated tree in the mist at Frugaldom,standing among the tiny native trees plantedas part of our World War 1 Centenary woodlandThe wild-seeded Sitka Spruce at Frugaldomcame in handy - we carefully selected a lovely,small tree and lit it up by the caravans,Pippin the pony walking on ice!The gorse by the roadside between Frugaldom andthe caravan park is beginning to flower in the snow.December flew past and most of our time was spent preparing for Christmas. The budget was kept well under control and the challenge spreadsheets were totalled up for the end of the year, allowing for one final small investment in seeds and an Argos voucher for spending on bonus items that were afforded by exra scrupulous budgeting practices throughout the year. :) Olivia, our American student who was with us for a few weeks during summer, returned to spend Christmas with us at the caravans and then she headed further north.Christmas shopping was done as carefully as ever, affording us a big supermarket shop and the many bargains that were available through MuscleFood. (This is my friend referral link that will also get you some meaty freebies.) And then there were all the Christmas leftovers to freeze for later use. The homemade clootie dumpling was, as always, pidding of the day and allowed our guest to sample some traditional Scottish cooking.We spent Hogmanay at the holiday park, listening to the piper piping in the new year and watching the fireworks display.For those of you with an avid interest in number-crunching, here are end of year results. I began the year with the customary £4,000 and spent the following from each category:Groceries - spent £942.83Toiletries, laundry & cleaning products - £43.27Electricity - £932.83Coal & logs - £40.00Mobile phone - £20.00Telephone & Internet - £574.60TV Licence - £145.50Footwear & clothing - £41.84Gifts - £321.48Travel - £365.00Postage & deliveries - £21.17Insurances - £312.99Pets & livestock - £189.55Misc other - £50.50Total spend on household-related expenses = £4,000.60Left in the 'EEK' (Everything Else Kitty) £50 Argos voucher,Gifted Amazon vouchers, Topcashback balance (accrued from Christmas shopping online), Nectar points and a tub of loose change.Progress at Frugaldom has come on in leaps and bounds with resurfaced tracks, drainage runs cleared out, the yard completed, more fruit trees planted plus 1,000+ more native tree saplings planted around the place. Frugal Breaks launched, offering you the opportunity to come and  visit for a short break (or longer stay, if you choose) and the bulk of the penny-pinching savings were poured into a tiny, one-bedroom cottage, complete with an out-building and a plot of garden land. The cottage is now part of our Frugal Breaks holiday lets enterprise, but more on that in a later blog post, as there's still quite a bit of work to be done.That's it! We're now up to 2018 and the start of a brand new year. Good luck to all and please do consider joining us in our new  private group on Facebook for the 2018 Frugal Living Challenge. Don't forget to let us know if you are interested in the money saving, money making or frugal breaks when joining."},
{"title": "November 2017 Photo Blog from Frugaldom", "date": "Sunday 21 January 2018", "text": "November 2017 Slowly but surely I am catching up with the blogging but I must apologise for what turned out to be a further delay during January 2018.  I refuse to drive anywhere in snow and this time around, the little car simply refused to move in it, so I am currently sitting in the caravan and have been staying here for over a week. In a way, it is good! It is giving me the chance to 'free shop' from my own cupboards, fridge and freezer while I can't go shopping and saving money on fuel, as I walk to and from Frugaldom.The polytunnel plotThe temporary polytunnel has withstood some serious wind and rain since it was put up but it also produced quite a good crop of tomatoes, herbs and spinach. It still is, even if the tomatoes are still green - chutney making is always on the cards. Adjoining the polytunnel plot is the yard, which has been completed for this year - it has now ceased to flood or turn to mud. This is still only a temporary fix but I think it could be longterm temporary. :)Rosehips March and November are tree planting months for us and here at Frugaldom, we are trying to develop our frugal fruit, berry and herb farm to include foraging hedgerow, otherwise known as jam and jelly hedges. We love rosehips! They are fabulous for so many reasons - syrup, mixed hedgerow jelly, vitamin supplement, good for wildlife and horses & ponies seem to love them. So, we are planting as many briars as possible all around the place and these will become part of the foraging hedgerow that will eventually go right around the project. The ponies will be allowed to browse their way around to keep them trimmed along the fencelines and then, once they have grown sufficiently, we will be harvesting the hips.Frugal visitors in assorted vehiclesNovember was also a month for visitors arriving and volunteering their services. Irene and Kenny arrived in the campervan to help clear some more garden space. The weather had been so wet that the ground everywhere was saturated, even at the holiday park, so the best and safest option to avoid getting stuck in mud was to park up in the Frugaldom yard. While there, Dave also arrived with his magic machine to haul out and cut more of the old logs. This is a great exchange, as a) it clears them out of the way for us and b) it provides him with extra firewood. :)Marnie cutting willow withiesDuring this month we met and hosted a lovely French lass who came to us via the Workaway site. It was such a shame that the weather couldn't have been decent enough to get out and do some exploring but I do think she managed to enjoy her stay, nonetheless. For 2 weeks, she helped cut willows, barrow whindust into the yard, feed the hens & ponies and plant many of the saplings that we were awarded by from the Woodland Trust.Kenny with the hensThis is Kenny, who became the chief pony and hen carer during the say a Frugaldom. As you can see, our hens are quite friendly, so they'd have been right inside the campervan if they'd been allowed! We had a lovely time during this visit and it was great being able to stop and sit down with a hot cuppa and just enjoy a chat about this, that and t'other.Assorted apples Apples, apples and more apples... we harvested several bags of apples even although this is just the second year our new orchard has been planted. For much of the month, and certainly most of Marnie's fortnight here, we ate apples in some way, shape or form and I suspect I have converted yet another student to the ways of Frugaldom and the apple crumble with custard pudding diet. I had no idea that it would prove to be the top favourite with almost all the students we have hosted here over the past year! Apples-wise, I think everyone within reach got some and I have enough sewed, frozen and stored to last until the rhubarb harvest takes over in late Spring/early summer. Speaking of frozen fruit - we still have kilos upon kilos of blackcurrants, so I made some more apple and blackcurrant jelly.From the soup gardenThe veg baskets were easily filled during November, as we had so much by way of greens - leeks, spring onions and spinach galore got shared out with whoever needed them and a huge pot of soup was made by Irene for us all to share back at the caravan on bonfire night. What a good night that was!Fireworks displayCampervan parked up safely for the night, Irene and Kenny walked along and met us at the holiday park for dinner at the caravan. We then enjoyed the annual bonfire and fireworks display from the warmth of the caravan, while sharing a bottle of wine.Rainbows at Frugaldom This year's weather has been a little bit crazy, to say the least. I truly believe that the drought we had in April - May time was our Scottish summer because we certainly didn't see any of the soaring temperatures and endless blistering sunshine experienced by those of you in the south of England. Our occasional sunshine is usually watery enough to bring rainbows. It's good that we like rainbows!Sunset at the Frugaldom barnWe do get some wonderful skies out here in Dumfries and Galloway. Sadly, for dark sky park enthusiasts, we have had so much cloud and rain that observing the cosmos and photographing meteor showers has been almost impossible. Even our almost resident astronomer packed up and went home. Here's hoping the remaining winter months bring clearer weather!The horseshoe gardenWith the arrival of the latest tree pack from the Woodland Trust came more holly! Yeah! If anyone can remember, this part of Frugaldom is known as the horseshoe garden and was originally going to be used for roses. However, as we had no roses to plant and the previously planted holly circle is doing so well, Marnie planted a holly hedge around here instead. I think it will look fabulous once it grows, as the open end of the horseshoe faces a south-easterly direction. The children love this little garden as it is where they have their mini crittur pond and a beastie log 'castle' complete with it's horseshoe 'fairy' door. There are also wild flowers planted here.The herb paddock & orchard More hedging got planted along the far side of the herb paddock - a mix of dogwood, hawthorn and hazel. This will be kept trimmed by the ponies and will also, hopefully, help protect the fruit trees from being battered by the wind.Crab apples plantedThere were a few crab apple trees left over... oh, ok then, I saved 4 crab apple trees to plant into this corner. There are 3 in one of the triangles and one in the other, as I don't want them growing too close to the track where the ponies will be passing. Each of these triangle gardens will get planted with herbs and salad stuff. I have calendula seeds for sowing, so they should brighten up this area if they grow.Hedge plantingMarnie made short work of planting the new hedge that will separate the track from the new patch of willow in the marshy corner. Again, this will all be foraging hedgerow for harvesting nuts and berries in future and will also provide some much-needed cover for the wildlife that is being displaced from the neighbouring forests being felled all around us. Frugaldom is going to be very exposed once all the spruce trees are harvested!Escape hatch for flood water More drainage work! It seems never ending, but the ponds were dug during the drought and then filled up so quickly that we had no way of knowing how much water would be contained or how quickly it would flow off down the field ditches. Emergency channels had to be dug into the banking to allow the excess water faster escape, as the pond succeeded in bursing its bank.Filed drain flowing wellThis is the field drain channel that was cleared by the digger earlier in the year. It was scraped out to the stone layer and the ground around it scraped clear but as you can see, six months after and the grass and reeds are already growing up along its edges. Along the north side of it, I have planted willows in the hope of stabilising the ground and providing us with more ecoart materials. This area will also make a brilliant retreat for wildlife and I've already seen grey and pied wagtails along the edges.Snowy Galloway HillsThe main pond has remained clear and attracted the attention of many passing birds and mammals - we could see all the foot prints during the first snow of the year. The snow didn't lie for too long but it was clear to see from all around that the Galloway Hills had their fair share of it.Pristine pondI am so looking forward to getting the pond area planted up properly with willows, reeds, iris and perhaps even some lilies, if we can manage to transplant some from the main pond or from elsewhere.Comparing notes with this time last year, the snow arrived a week or so later this year.Pony pamperingThis was also a good month for the ponies, as they had so many visitors keen to pander to their every need. Being such a muddy, wet month, we decided to organise some muddy wellies weekends as Frugal Breaks, which is our latest addition to the frugal projecs family.Health & Safety Don't forget about recycling and repurposing... anyone remember the old bits and pieces we unearthed when reclaiming the garden at Thrift Cottage? Well, we finally found a place to hang the lifebuoy and floats! They are beside the pond, waiting to be painted. :)Frozen, snowy pond This is turning into an epic photo blog so apologies for that, but it was another very busy month, what with trying to fit everything around the crazy winter weather that had descended. I mean look at this! Frozen pond covered in snow and a glorious blue sky!Precariously perched eggCrazier still, the hens don't know whether to stay in, go out, lay, moult or hibernate. As you can see here, I am not the only person around here who is confused... white hen laid white egg on the top shelf of the nesting boxes!Now another apology for sharing 'cute kid photos' but my grandson is so adorabe when he tries his very best to help out at Frugaldom. He is such a trier!Here he is trying to help us with the whin dust, but at just 2 years old (3 in a few months), he's not quite tall enough or strong enough to cope with a full size barrow. However, he persevered and made it all the way to the barn, albeit leaving a double trail behind him. Next up, he wanted to help fill the barrow with whin dust. Trust me, you don't say no to this kid, he has dogged determination and nothing stops him from trying his best, Slowly, using this huge, heavy shovel, he actually did manage to get some whin dust into the barrow. He lost interest in barrowing stone as soon as Pippin arrived to help, so off he went, pony in hand, round to the tree shelter to feed 'his' Pippin. They are so cute together, even if this gran has her heart in her mouth every time child & pony get together!This is Marie, another of our lovely volunteers, fitting protective spirals / tree protectors and planting hedging. As you would expect, grandson was also keen to get involved in tree planting this year, so daughter had to don her pink wellies again to help. After being allowed to stab a hole in the ground with the giant dibber stick, the tree was planted alongside a cane and then the plastic spiral protector added. It will be great if he can remember planting his first tree when he returns in adulthood to see the woodland that he helped to create! Final job of the day for this young man was to feed 'his' Pippin more hay and tell him what a good boy he had been. The ponies at Frugaldom are now almost old enough to begin some proper work, so 2018 will see them having more training. Hopefully, they will be ready to start lugging all the stuff we need about the project and save us having to carry it bit by bit - can you guess what Pippin will be carrying? (Apart from grandson.) Hopefully our first crop of Galloway Pippin apples! Finally, for this month, an update from the wildlife garden at Thrift Cottage. Mr Ecoarts invested in a new trail camera, as we have been using the others at Frugaldom. The badger family is sill visiting most nights but so too are the deer, especially this particular Roe buck. He has become so accustomed to the camera that he now takes selfies and stands waiting for the badgers' peanuts to be replenished so he can eat them all before said badgers get there! Not very frugal... please send more nuts!That's all for now, other than to say the budget is being stretched but frugal living is still reeping rewards and affording us the freedom to develop Frugaldom. In saying that, we never did complete the renovation at home! But that's yet another story!Keep up to date with the daily goings on via Frugaldom on Facebook or Twitter, or you might even like to join the Frugal Living Challenge so you can save for some Frugal Breaks, visiting us here in our little wilderness. Hopefully, the new website at www.frugalbreaks.co.uk will be up and running by the time you read this and, for MSE moneysavers, there's a great discount code available that gets you 10% off our already affordable caravan holidays. :)"},
{"title": "Ponds, Ponies, Pumpkins and Fun at Frugaldom", "date": "Tuesday 2 January 2018", "text": "October 2017Frugaldom is a magical place for creating memories so that's what we plan to do forever more. We have started plotting and planning for the yard area as it's no longer muddy, it's now nicely sheltered and the hedge along the back of it has started to grow, encouraging the wildlife to venture closer.Now that I have 4 grandchildren, there's usually no shortage of little people to have about the place. I have to admit that the 'terrible twos' don't seem to show half as much outdoors as they do indoors.  At Frugaldom, the biggest problem is when it's time to try and get the 2-year-old to go home! He doesn't seem in the least concerned at visiting on his own while the older ones are at school and the littlest is still too small to do much out here.Yard work is funRight from the outset, I knew what would be put at the top of Santa's list for this particular toddler - he loves barrowing anything anywhere! You can never lose sight of a little kid with a big wheelbarrow, that's for sure. It's like having my own mini research team on site when the children come to visit because they show me all the things that are most important to them and what entertains them most. This gives great insight into potential future developments as we launch our frugal holidays, plan more themed breaks and prepare for various child-friendly events at Frugaldom during 2018.\"I love Pippin\"Pippin the pony is always a hot favourite. His name, as far as grandson is concerned is, 'My Pippin' or 'Wanton Pippin' and the pony seems to tolerate absolutely anything said child does... much to the detriment of my ragged, gran nerves!\"I love muddy wellies\"Our first themed short breaks were introduced and aptly named 'Muddy Wellies Weekends' for one good reason - all kids seem to love muddy wellies and so, too, do some adults! :)\"I love playing in water\"Exploring in nature is fabulous fun and the mini-pond gets checked regularly in the hope that the frogspawn and resulting tadpoles return. Of course, it's even better fun if you get to forage in the garden for your own dinner before going exploring. This is one little boy who loves his soup and knows where it grows... in the soup garden, of course!\"I love cleaning my wellies\"Biosecurity is of the utmost importance and should be taught as soon as possible. It's another of the fun things toddlers seem to love and is also something that didn't take long to sink in... washing one's wellies both on arrival and on departure is important so as not to take germs into the barn or near the plants, poultry or ponies.Back on the frugal bandwagon of bargain hunters - I managed to find a bulk lot of these interconnecting grids that are used for shed bases and parking spaces. We aren't anywhere near ready to use them yet but the prospect of saving over £50 just couldn't be missed, especially when the seller was fairly local and offered to deliver them to us. There are enough here to do the base for a garden room.This was another of the bargain buys of October - a lovely little futon (double bed size) that will be utilised in the on-going improvements while trying to create extra space for extra guests in the various accommodations we are attempting to provide.The ecoarts project will soon be launched fulltime, as 2018 sees the start of the creation of the designated trail at Frugaldom. It's a really exciting time despite also being a time of reminiscing. It's still hard to believe that my dad isn't here to see that we really did manage to succeed in finding and affording a piece of land to try and do everything I always spoke about doing. I'm sure he'd have approved! (Mum planted this oak tree and 'Mr Ecoarts' made the wild wood bird for displaying the dedication plaque.)October was a month of growing - everything continued to grow, with the willows, Rowans, Hawthorn, Buddleia and Blueberries doing exceptionally well but it was all closely followed by the later sprouting Holly. Many more of the same will be planted in the future, now that we know they like it here.Lyn's bridge got a coat of paint and work began on clearing the path at the other side, which will eventually run almost to the river, flanked on either side by native woodland species, such as willow, hazel, alder and birch.We can't forget about the picking and preserving. We weren't able to grow any beetroot at Frgaldom but we did receive some, traded for fresh eggs and apples, so it all got boiled and pickled.The apples just kept on coming, so I think most of our friends and neighbours at the holiday park were eating either stewed apples, apple sauce, apple tart or apple crumble. I have enough frozen apples to last a while longer and the cold-stored ones still need to be stewed but are being used as required.The chickens are doing well, even if number 3 grandchild is still finding it difficult to keep up with them or catch them. On this particular day, the children were using the lean-to / potting shed as an art studio and had been out looking for things to make into pictures. Feathers are fun but the chickens kept following the kids into the shed! This was grandson taking his fnished nature art picture to show his mum, He did have a little bit of help making things stick to the bit board (we recycled a cardboard box) but he collected all nthe bits and pieces by himself - yes, he even picked some of the Oxeye Daisies because he thought they were 'pretty flowers'.This is the lean-to potting shed. It's just leaning up against the side of the barn at the minute but we hope to make it a substantial, permanent structure that will double up as a learning room for the children. It isn't a full height sed but it it high enough for short people (like me) to walk about and the children love it. I want to make a proper panelled wall where it meets the barn and turn it into a chalk board on one side and a pin board on the other. It will then make a great space for displaying all the nature leaflets, posters and childrens's artwork.Goldcrests everywhere this month! It hardly seems any time since they were here las year but here we are, picking them up from the barn where they have arrived, exhausted after their long flights from, I think, Scandinavia.The new ponds finally settled and we got a bit more of the track around the edge laid, thanks to the help of our lovely volunteers. I am now 99.9% sure that this part of the project will see the arrival of its first amphibian visitors in spring, as we already have an assortment of birds and insects visiting. I plan on planting a row of willows around the edge just as soon as I have got them all cut.Willow cuttingsThe forst of the willows got cut but all of these were planted along the side of the newly cleared path beyond Lyn's bridge.More tomatoesWe weren't the only ones with late tomatoes - these were all handed in as surplus to requirement, so they got made into pasta sauce, curry and chutney.99p pumpkins are amazing!As October came to an end, we had visitors arriving for the Hallowe'en paty at the holiday park, so we bought some pumpkins. We had tried growing our own but the wet weather just didn't give them a chance. So here's what I got made with the shop-bought variety.Happy HalloweenPumpkin carving at HalloweenAs the month ended, we started looking towards the final events of the year - Bonfire night, tree planting, winter solstice and Christmas. I also had a couple of volunteers arriving to help during November, so that was an extra bonus and something to look forward to, with the arrival of Marnie, from France.The Wildwood FairyThis is one of the latest sculptures made by Mr Ecoarts - it was made for daughter and son-in-law, who recently moved house, but I couldn't really post it here before Christmas - even although she did see it before then. 😊 Being this size, it was kind of difficult to hide at the caravan or at Frugaldom, where the children explore.'Mr Darcy' The horse sculpture was commissioned to go on display at a very special project in central Scotland. 'Mr Darcy', as we nicknamed him, was modelled on a real horse and the sculpture is now on display at Darcy's Equine Assisted Learning Centre near Strathaven in Lanarkshire.I think that's enough for October but I did say it was a very busy month. Onwards and upwards... to the penultimate month of the year. I'll be back soon with some more updates."},
{"title": "Photo Blog from September 2017 at Frugaldom", "date": "Monday 1 January 2018", "text": "SCOTTISH WEATHER!In a bid to bring the frugal blog up to date, I'll do a few more pictorials, as the photos can tell you more than the words in a much shorter time.From drought conditions earlier in the year we moved straight into wet weather with a few hot, dry days sprinkled among the rainy days! Our new wildlife ponds more than filled - they flooded! Emergency measures were needed, so we dragged and rolled some big logs and began building a 'wall' along the edge of the small feeder pond and then dug links between this pond and the bigger one so flood water would run through the ponds rather than over the edge and down the path.We managed to get a lorry load of old tyres for recycling, so these are gradually being rolled around the place to act as huge planters for future herb and flower gardens, plus a few stacked up around the tracks for stuffing full of hay that the ponies can munch on whenever they want.The Siberian crab apple trees were absolutely dripping in tiny fruit but all of this got left for the wildlife, as we just never got around to harvesting any of it. 2018 should be different as we now have the holiday accommodation and can offer fruit foraging and preserving weekends.Our first ever crop of leeks, onions and courgettes! All of the plants were donated or we traded fresh eggs for them. By December, we had used up or traded out all of the courgettes and I have enough leeks to last until the 2018 crop. The new heritage apple orchard brought forth a bucket of fruit from the 2 year old trees, so these were all picked and processed. Galloway Pippins are fabulous apples for eating, cooking or preserving in jams, jellies or chutneys. We used most of them in crumbles but I held back a few for the chutney, which also had some of our onions and courgettes added to it. Tastes lovely, especially with cheese! Along with the other apples from the garden orchard, they filled a full section of the freezer. I now need to make an apple store and have the perfect object for recycling... an old fridge!Plans began for the 'real' Trading Post, which is currently standing by the pallet fence. All going well, we'll build a designated produce store that will double as a pick-up point and actual trading post for trading our surplus produce in the future. Muddy wellies! We get plenty of those at Frugaldom so we introduced our 'Muddy Wellies Weekends' and advertised these via our new Frugal Breaks page on Facebook. At a special price of £95.00 for up to 4 people for 2 nights, all the weekends throughout September, October and right up to mid-November. Two lots of our visitors have already rebooked for 2018 and the children who came along definitely had fun in the mud! Drainage work at Frugaldom is still on-going. I think this is going to be the biggest job we'll ever need to do, as the whole place sits at the lowest point of the surrounding landscape, with peat bog and marsh all around us. Clearing out all the field drains is a slow and arduous task, so I think we'll need to allocate a budget to hiring in a mini digger again in 2018 to speed up the tedious, muscle-aching work of digging them all by hand.Just to keep us all on our toes, don't forget about the snakes. We have adders at Frugaldom and they love nothing more than to come out and bask on the new stretch of access road that was laid at the start of the year. Sunshine + tarmac = warm basking surface for our slithery friends. Personally, I enjoy seeing them and love that we have them living here but I seem to be in a minority! Several visitors have looked at me in disbelief or shocked horror when I mention them. OK, so their bite is poisonous, but adders are still fascinating creatures and can be almost chameleon-like in their colouration, especially when basking on sphagnum moss! 👀 The adult hens that we were given laid many eggs throughout summer and continued to so so right through to December. The chicks we hatched in June turned out to be 5 cockerels and only 3 hens, but this will still give us a glorious selection of egg colours, as we have a white hen laying blue eggs, a brown hen laying pink eggs, a white hen laying white eggs and a brown hen laying brown eggs. All 3 of the chicks, once they mature, will lay blue eggs. (They are pure bred Araucanas.)I couldn't make it up if I tried - rain, rain, rain, then blazing sunshine bringing temperatures topping 25 Degrees C. The hot, dry weather did not hang around Scotland for long, so we missed out on all that super summer they reported in the south.More and more courgettes and leeks - they seem to like the climate at Frugaldom so I'll definitely be designating space for growing many more of these.I love picking homegrown produce! 2017 was another year of cutting, hacking, path clearing and planting, so we didn't expect to have much by way of fruit and vegetables but the apples and herbs just kept on coming... soup and pudding is most definitely still the meal of the day. When it costs nothing to pick the ingredients, why would we spend on shop bought produce?Tiny apples abslutely everywhere we look - please get in contact if you'd like to come and pick some in 2018, when we'll be offering our foraging and preserving getaways - the foraging will be free!Foraging is so frugal that it simply cannot be ignored. Over the past year we have attempted to encourage as many of the brambles and dog roses to grow as possible. We also invested in many more briars - Rosa Canina and Rosa Ragusa in several colours - for planting around the slowly emerging tracks. Somewhere in the future we will have access paths all around Frugaldom and all edged in edible hedging that can be kept under control by the ponies, provide fantastic habitat for wildlife and provide us with a fabulously frugal foraging trail.After all Anna's hard work digging ditches and dealing with the greenhouse, we reaped the benefits by way of a few cucumbers, more spinach beet than we could ever eat and a whole host of herbs grown from seed. I did try to get her to return but the warmer climes of the Continent stole her from us. The summer students kept up the watering and weeding, so we made the most of everything the little greenhouse produced. We did try 3 of these polytunnels but 2 succumbed to the storms and will need to be rebuilt once we have a more secure base on which to site them.Yes, we even managed to get some tomatoes - enough to add to the apples and courgettes to make our year's supply of chutney!Things I love about growing techniques now known by posh names like permaculture and biodynamic farming - allowing things to grow where they want to grow and planting accordingly to make the whole project more sustainable. We had Evening Primrose growing in the herb paddock that nobody had planted... it just grew from seed that probably blew from behind the barn.The absolute biggest and best thrill of my year at Frugaldom was that I was finally able to go walkabout for a pony's eye view of our project. For those who follow or have followed for some time, we were given 3 young ponies in March 2016. With no proper grazing land, we decided to let the ponies live on the tracks that we're building around the project so, instead of fencing the ponies in, we are fencing them out of the growing areas and feeding them hay instead of grass. Willow's 'medicine hat'These ponies have never had shoes on their feet and probably never will. Since coming to us, they haven't had bits in their mouths and probably never will. In the above photo, the pony had nothing on - no halter, no bridle, no saddle... this little walkabout was based entirely on mutual trust and this particular pony is 'Willow'.  She is our medicine hat, spirit pony and is living up to all the ancient myths and legends that originate from the Native Americans. Back again soon with October's summary of events so watch this space... we're working as fast as possible to bring everything up to date both on here and on social media. To keep right up to date, you can follow the Frugaldom page on Facebook and consider joining in our frugal living challenge group."},
{"title": "August 2017 (part 2)  More New Beginnings", "date": "Thursday 14 December 2017", "text": "For as long as I can remember, these frugal living challenges have always been about breaking the shackles of consumerism and escaping to debt freedom; our quest for self-sustainability has never waivered. Over the years, many have achieved some of their goals, few have achieved all and others still toil in the hope of finding light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel. I'm ever hopeful that Frugaldom can provide a glimmer for whoever cares to look. Wherever you are on your great moneysaving adventure, I salute you all and hope you will continue living a frugal lifestyle.Looking back over the years, I see many unfinished projects of my own but each has its place in the grand scheme of things and each will eventually be completed. I see many names who have been with us for part of our journey and then left to pursue their own interests. Sadly, I see names of those who are no longer with us, departed from this mortal realm, and I can only hope that they found peace and happiness at the end of that journey. For the rest of us, life goes on and so does everything around it. We can't lose focus of our main goals nor can we deviate too much from the original plan - frugal freedom. (Frugaldom)As many of you know, it has now been 3 years since we managed to purchase a patch of land to turn into our frugaldom project. In that time we have worked endlessly at taming the wilderness, recruiting whatever help we could and hosting many work exchange students who have helped us greatly. Ultimately, we want the project to become a place where anyone can come and experience this fabulous lifestyle of rural and frugal living combined with the freedom to relax, engage with like-minded others and make the most of what the countryside has to offer, without breaking the bank!Affordability is our watch word! During previous frugal entrepreneur (frugaleur) challenges, we set up all manner of micro-projects from willow and herb growing to orchard planting, recycling and ecoarts. This year, we managed to register the entire Frugaldom project as a social enterprise and we have also signed up to the Galloway and South Ayrshire Biosphere charter. (Frugaldom lies within this internationally recognised biosphere.) Our quest for sustainability, greener living, zero waste and environmental concerns have been recognised as worthy!But we are still, most definitely, rural and with that comes the problem of day trips for most being out of the quesion. So, we invested in accommodation for our extended frugal family by way of  two mobile homes, sited on a very 'back to nature' style (but with many luxuries included) holiday park only minutes from the Frugaldom project.Frugal Breaks officially launched in August 2017 and is now accepting bookings for next year. By renting out one caravan and hosting our volunteer workforce in the other, we are now able to cater for all budgets, offering exceptional value for money to members of Frugaldom and participants in our frugal living challenges. Regular holidaymakers are welcome and even they get great bargains on the condition that they respect the lifestyle and leave the place as they find it.Frugaldom's virtual cashThe web link goes to the dedicated facebook page where I have added a 'Book Now' button - we;re also on AirBnB. HOWEVER, if you are friends, fans or followers of the Frugaldom blogs, challenges and activities, please get in contact to find out how you can take advantage of our holiday offers at greatly reduced prices. Lack of cash needn't prevent you visiting us as we will happily barter / trade / exchange goods and/or services in our quest to make your visit possible. That's what our Cyberdosh project is all about - it isn't quite a crypto-currency but it's a virtual trading currency that you can find, earn and spend at Frugaldom.But hold on... there's even more news of future developments in 2018...My ultimate goal from many challenges ago was to offer the ultimate frugal living experience and this, dear frugalers, is something that is about to happen very soon.We found the perfect property for visitors wanting to sample 'the good life'! Work began immediately to ensure the place was wind and water tight by winter and, although there is much work to be done, we hope to be able to welcome our first frugal lifestyle experience guests by Easter 2018.Affordability is, as always, at the fore, so prices for booking this 'Thrift Cottage', complete with its adjoining workshop and kitchen garden, will reflect my personal wish to help others make memories at Frugaldom.The one-bedroom cottage has a full bathroom and kitchen plus livingroom with fold out double bed. It is on a main bus route, has a daily coach service running all the way between London and Belfast, it's only a couple of miles off the Southern Upland Way and it's near a main cycling route, so no cars needed to get here. I'll keep you updated on progress, so watch this space. If there are any budding interior designers, landscape gardeners or DIY buffs among you, please get in contact about a Cyberdosh break to help us get this place ready for future frugal guests. 😊I told you August 2017 was a busy month!"},
{"title": "August 2017 and the frugal living challenge continues", "date": "Tuesday 12 December 2017", "text": "Where do I start? It was another tremendously busy month at Frugaldom but it didn't stop there: August was as busy on the home front as it was at the field and at the caravans, with work exchange students, holiday makers and the next investment to join the realms of the Frugaldom project. 😊Work on the main yard seemed relentless but we finally got to the top layer and even during the very wettest days of summer, we had no puddles or floods in this area. At Frugaldom, we had several visits from little people wanting to play with ponies, search for beasties, make things, learn more and explore the willow dens. This frst one is progressing well and has sprouted so much that we need to coppice the new growth.In the Thrift Cottage orchard, there were apples galore to be picked and processed. It would seem that our regular apple crumble with custard habit has now been carried back to several European countries, thanks to it proving to be a hot favourite with all the students. August saw several visitors arrive at Frugaldom and on one particular weekend, we had a jolly get together after moving more hay - I think there were about a dozen off us took part in the most fun-filled archery tournament ever and then had a great chatty night of giggles and laughs. It wasn't all play and no work, we made a serious start on schooling ponies to get tem accustomed to some of the work they will be doing in the future. All 3 ponies have now been ridden and are continuing their training barefoot and bitless. We don't need metal! Willow takes absolutely everything in her stride and is ready to join in or take part in anything at all! Eldest grand daughter has been practicing her grooming, mane pleating and pony leading skills, as well as having her first bareback riding lessons on our medicine hat 'spirit' pony. I'm still intrigued by native American tales of these unusual ponies and hope Willow will live up to expectations as a fabulous companion. Over the past almost 2 years we have been introducing heritage variety apples to Frugaldom. Our longterm aim is to farm these apples for supplying locally and for trading from Frugaldom. The trees are now 2 and 3 years old, so the first of them bore enough fruit to allow us to try several things with them - cooking them into crumbles, chutney and sauce. The Galloway Pippins are lovely apples and are also tasty eating apples. We haven't tried cider making with them.Our orchard project will be expanded year on year, as we clear and prepare more growing space. We'll be focussing mainly on the apples but now have a mixed orchard of pears, plums and cherries as well as the apples. Now that we have the lean-to, I plan on experimenting with grapes and hardy kiwis.  As you'll have noticed, keeping up with blogging has been very difficult but that should hopefully, now, be brought back under control and I'll be able bring us all up to date now I can get online anytime. This is the latest gadget to hit the Frugaldom family - the Huawei sim-operated mini wifi hub on pay as you go data! I LOVE IT! It can provide internet access via wifi for up to 9 connections, so now it's easy to get online from the caravan. Now all I need to do is get online from the barn and we're sorted! Chickens have been laying eggs daily and providing a regular supply for fellow caravan residents at the holiday park. With only 4 lating hens, we have still managed to sell a dozen or so each week and still have enough leftover for home use. Once the next 3 hens start laying, we should be able to sell a few more during 2018, when 4 out of the 7 hens should be laying blue eggs.During quieter, more reflective moments, I have had the great pleasure to be able to clamber onto spirit pony and sit with her as she carries on being a pony. I know that this sort of 'riding' is not recommended, nor is it seen as safe, but we are strongly focussing on a much more holistic approach to horse-keeping here, a method that is based on trust and allowing ponies to live the way nature intended.With plans afoot to open our Galloway pony heritage trail by 2020, our ponies will need to be well used to all sorts of events and activities by then, so August was also a fun month for pony play school. Frankie, Willow and Pippin could be representing the ancestors of some of the greatest horses the world has ever known. Who'd have thought that their common denominator would be the humble Galloways?There was so much going on throughout August that I'm cutting this blog post off here and doing a second August one - announcing the next phase of our frugal project - the long awaited frugal living experience that we first set out to offer several years ago. Follow our progress on Facebook and get updates via Twitter or hang on in there and wait for the next installment of the frugal blog."},
{"title": "Frugal living and working through July 2017", "date": "Monday 4 December 2017", "text": "Frugal Living has plenty of perks!Summer work, rest and play a FrugaldomOur visiting students all had archery lessons Throughout the past year we have hosted numerous students and volunteers at Frugaldom, each here to experience frugal living, life in the country and, in most cases, practice their conversational English, albeit with a certain Scottishness. It has been great seeing the progress made during their stays here, even if the good old Scottish summer weather was as unpredictable and unreliable as ever. We still managed to fit in fun between bouts of work.The cuckoo corral orchard After receiving an unscheduled pruning session by the visiting escapee sheep that were with us for several weeks, the newest fruit trees in the cuckoo corral decided to start growing again. The dog roses also took a severe pruning when the ponies managed to push down one of the fence rails and stretch their necks through far enough to reach them! No rose hips this summer!Caroline (France), Olivia (USA) and Anne (Germany)Our 3 students shared a caravan while here and seemed to gel well, despite the fact that the French lass spoke no German, the German lass no French and the American lass no German or French... we all managed perfecly well with Scottish English. 👌😊We finally managed to hire in a mini digger and driverThe digger and driver were here for just a few days, as the cost was slightly prohibitive at almost £250 per day! However, in that time, the 2 main drainage ditches leading away from the central project got cleared, a big straining post dug back into the ground and the 2 ponds dug - one for ponies accessing the running water and the second, larger one, for planting around to form a new wildlife habitat. At the point the ponds were dug, we had a drought, so the entire area was almost dry and scraped down to the clay base, where old stone, possibly from previous drainage, was found.Strawberries growing in the recycled milk caron 'Mishy Pods' A few new strawberry plants plus many runners from existing ones were potted up into the milk cartons, so plans are now afoot to build new strawberry beds.Nick (Bulgaria) is our regular hoof trimmer The ponies have been having their hooves trimmed every 5 or 6 weeks, when Nick stops for an overnight. Learning about keeping and working ponies barefoot has been a real revelation for many of our students and visitors - it's quite shocking how many people think that the poor animals need to have metal nailed to their feet before they can do anything! Here a Frugaldm, we strongly support the theory that 'you are what you eat, right down to your feet' and that can be said for equine species, too. The Frugaldom ponies will never have shoes on their feet as long as they are with us - nor will they ever have bits (more metal) in their mouths. We have metal-free mud monsters, who live out all year round without rugs, stables, fancy feeds or 'posh' saddlery. Hay and herbs serve them well and everything else is from whatever they browse around the edges of the project - mostly marsh and moor grasses.Blistering sunshine for bringing in the hayHaving ponies that don't get let loose on lush, green, monoculture grass means we need a plentiful supply of meadow hay and that isn't always easy to find. We want freedom from chemicals and a good mix of grasses and herbs, so it serves us well that we have friendly neighbours who believe likewise. But boy! Is it hard work bringing in several hundred small bales of hay against the clock within what little sunshine we get here! In this game you really do have to make hay while the sun shines, but I think the girls enjoyed their tractor driving lessons and their ice lolly breaks.All our students learned to drive the tractor with baler The last bales were stacked in the barn at around 10pm, after another brief stop for chips! It was like carb and fat-fest for energy replenishing!After a long day bringing in hay - about 600 balesAfter our brief call to action for doing the hay it was back to the Frugaldom work. One of our regular volunteers who builds the benches from the surplus fencing wood single-handedly built us a new foot bridge so we could get across the newly cleared drainage ditch! She's a whizz with offcuts, that's for sure!Celebrating near completion of footbridge over the newly cleared drainage ditchWheelbarrows and stone are the most common features at Frugaldom nowadays. Drainage is a top priority but we don't have the necessary funds to bring in contractors so it's all down to hand digging, laying in pipes where necessary and backfilling with an assortment of stone. From all this work comes the benefit of better toned muscles and a deeper appreciation for the morning swim in the pool at the caravan site - that definitely starts your summer days off in fine style.Barrowing stone for the drainage is an endless task at Frugaldom After trying to fit as much work as possible into the dry weather slot, it took only 3 days for the new ponds to fill up completely and from that day to now, we haven't had a solid week of dry weather! It's been wellies every single day.Olivia, Caroline and Anne by the newly dug pond Both ponds almost filled to capacity. They are interlinked so the small one runs into the larger one and then it can overflow into the drainage ditch that carries it off though the field via Anna's ditch.The new ponds at Frugaldom - wildlife and drainage areasThe hens at Frugaldom are well settled into their new 'chicken shack'. We lost a few to a mink attack and then gained a few more, when we had 4 given to us and 8 chicks hatched in the incubator at home. At the moment we have 7 of the hens and a cockerel at Frugaldom and the rest at Thrift Cottage.We have a hen laying pink eggs! The 2017 hatch of chicks were all pure bred Araucanas and 2 of the donated ones are x Araucana, so we do get blue eggs. However, we don't know what types the brown hens are, so when one started laying pink eggs, it was a complete surprise.The ponies began their training to work barefoot, bareback and bitless Thanks to 'Auntie Anita', we now have a lovely bitless bridle for the ponies. Until this was given to us we were simply using rope lead reins and headcollars but this is so much 'posher' looking. This is Willow, our medicine hat 'spirit' pony, modelling it.Leeks and courgettes were plentifulThe small vegetable plot behind the barn produced plenty of leeks and courgettes but this area will now be turned over to garlic and herbs, as there just wasn't really enough sunshine reached this area to make it worthwhile expanding it.While here, the students learned a bit about wild flowers and herbs, so we have been drinking plenty of rhubarb fizz and our first ever batch of pineapple plant cordial!At the caravans, we decided to use the 3-bedroom one for our Frugaldom work exchange students and rent out the 2-bedroom one for visitors looking for an affordable way to take a countryside break. This brought about the official launch of Frugal Breaks on Facebook and our new online booking platform. It's been an exciting year, so far!Our fundraising is being done via www.gofundme.com/Frugaldom where you can get dedication discs for our posts and trees, sponsorships and holiday home accommodation to come and visit us in 2018. We've also had several wildcampers at Frugaldom but without any services on site, you need to cart your own water. I'm now investigating portaloos, composting toilets and filter systems for river water.This about sums up July, other than one surprise that came along the way... a telephone call that resulted in us buying another house, this one only 7 miles from Frugaldom!As always, I love to hear from anyone with any questions or comments and please let me know of any typing errors, as I'm attempting to blog on tablet or Kindle in an effort to use mobile internet at the caravan. all going well, we should soon have mobile internet at Frugaldom, but it's all dependent on availability of signal and Pay As You Go sim cards. Vodafone is looking like the most promising for there but Three is definitely the best for caravan park.Back soon with the August whistlestop tour!"},
{"title": "Another year of frugal living", "date": "Friday 1 December 2017", "text": "Another year of Frugal Living2017 is nearing its end.We're less than 3 weeks from winter solstice, so what has happened over the past year at Frugaldom?So much has happened and so much has been achieved that I now need to split this blog post into at least two whistlestop photo tours just to bring you all up to date. Here goes...I'll quickly run backwards from June 2017, as July to December have been exceptionally busy months for us, with many new developments that will take a little bit more explaining. All along our journey, we have stuck rigidly to the frugal living challenge of running the household on the £4,000 budget (excluding council tax) and every other penny has been invested into the future of Frugaldom. But more about that in the next blog post. For those who follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook, you will probably be aware of most of the developments - for everyone else, here is a brief summary to bring you up to date.The lean-to got built Having cleared out the barn and made several improvements, some of which still need to be completed, we decided it was time to start preparing for our future food growing. We were really fortunate in having Anna - a horticulturist - arrive as a volunteer for a couple of weeks so she was a fantastic help in kickstarting this aspect of the Frugaldom project. The lean-to was built up in moveable sections made by the local timber mill but we hope it will soon become a more permanent feature with insulation, lined walls and a covered floor. It will be used primarily as a potting shed and drying room for the herbs but also as a learning zone for the children when they visit during wet weather. (Did I mention I now have 4 grand children? #4 arrived earlier this year.)Anna working in the polytunnel With Anna being such a dab hand at all things planty, we got the ground cleared and set up a portable polytunnel, which was soon full to bursting with all sorts of herbs and vegetables.This is now known as Anna's Ditch We also made loads of progress with the drainage, a massive job that is going to take a long time to sort out, especially when covering in drainage channels and topping them with stone and dust to make them safe to walk along. This one, now known as Anna's ditch, is being left as an open ditch and has, since, had pipe laid into it and is working hard at carrying away the surface flood water from between the cuckoo corral orchard and the herbery (herb nursery paddock).Recycling pallets into composting areas With no shortage of composting materials or manure, 3 pallet bays got set up for the purposes of storing the compostable waste and pony poop! It is quite a struggle trying to keep on top of this very overgrown area but it is gradually being brought under control one square metre at a time!Setting up the portable polytunnel This is the area that we fenced into a small enclosure and have planted several more fruit trees. We had the ponies completely clear out all the grass and wild herbs (we don't have weeds at Frugaldom) and then we drained the muddy mess before laying down ground reinforcement grid and weed fabric. The polytunnel is 5m x 2m but we hope to replace this with a 6m x 4m cabin in the not so distant future. This will provide us with office and admin space, visitor reception area, a place to sit for a break/cuppa and some secure, dry storage for things like seeds and order processing / packaging goods. It will all be off grid, using solar power for lighting and, hopefully, a logburner for heat and kettle boiling.'The Galloway' survived the stormsThe ecoarts project is one that means a great deal to us and as Frugaldom progresses, more wild wood is cleared and salvaged to turn into more sculptures. We plan on setting up a display of these along the access paths that will lead to various areas within Frugaldom - mainly through the orchards, willow, bog myrtle, foraging areas and down to the maple grove. Along the way, we have planted rowans, crab apples, hazels and hawthorn.We had visitors for spring In spring 2017 we actually had a short drought! For 5 weeks, we saw next to no rain, so the burn flowing around Frugaldom dropped to levels that allowed even the labs to cross it. Each day we arrived at the yard, there would be an assortment of sheep and lambs meandering around, usually with a pony following them. They trimmed plenty of overgrown areas but it got a bit annoying when they sarted on the new fruit trees. Still, I guess pruning is needed!We did a huge amount of clearing during the drought  While the water levels were so low, we donned our waders and went paddling along the burn to cut out all the snagged up branches, bits of fallen trees and debris that had been washed downstream in previous floods. I can't say that we have completely remedied the flooding problems but the flood water definitely recedes far quicker since the clear out - the above bend was previously like a dam!We planted a new orchard in the cuckoo corral The new cuckoo corral orchard, above, was planted with over 60 assorted fruit trees - apples, pears, plums and cherries - with 10 very special Galloway Pippin heritage apple trees along one side. Along tthe front, we now have dog woods and crab apples to grow a foraging hedge and along one side, dog roses that should provide us with rose hips in future. The hares are frequent visitors to this area and during spring the cuckoos did, indeed, return to perch on the fence posts.Ecoarts - The Green Man of Frugaldom This is our green man. He was made from bits of wood and branches collected while clearing access tracks and made by our resident artist, Harvey, as part of the ecoarts project. Following on from this, a second green man was commissioned, so there is another one locally - I'll need to find out if he has been put on display yet! Our green man is tucked away by the side of a little path that will eventually become part of a willow walk. We're coppicing as much willow as possible to plant along the paths.Ecoarts - Myrical our magical unicorn'Myrical' is our ecoarts unicorn and has proven to be the firm favourite with the children. (Did you know that the unicorn is the national animal of Scotland?) The name 'Myrical' is in keeping with the location of our unicorn, as it is in the centre of one of the bog myrtle fields. Bog myrtle is also known as 'Myrica Gale' and forms the basis for yet another of our exciting projects involving herbal concoctions, infused oils and soapmaking.Caravan breaks for frugalersHaving finally got around to organising things between the two caravans, we set about preparing for our first paying visitors, offering an affordable alternative to expensive foreign holidays - frugal breaks in the Scottish countryside. We have a small membership base forming here and have now begun working towards upgrading this caravan for a more modern, double glazed and centrally heated model so we can offer affordable shor breaks all year round. They have proven to be very popular, especially during our themed weekends.You can now come and stay to learn more about FrugaldomThe wildlife about here is interesting and diverse so we have set up a feeding station right outside the caravan for visitors to observe nature through the window! There is always great excitement when the woodpeckers or nuthatches appear and it's always fun to spot the treecreepers, even if I haven't managed to get a good photo of one yet.We now have online booking for Frugal BreaksTo find out more about the frugal breaks options, we have a Facebook page set up at Frugal Breaks and have included a 'book now' button on the page. I haven't had the time to develop the website but will hopefully recruit the services of a willing student next year.We have hosted over a dozen students and work volunteers over the past year and we're hosting a young lass over the Christmas break, so we must be doing something right if they are coming back for second visits. :)Throughout the spring and summer months we were swimming almost every morning, thanks to the local holiday park allowing owners and their visitors the use of the indoor heated swimming pool free of charge. It is a great little pool and definitely gives us a great start, swimming before work begins for the day.Frugal Breaks visitors can use the holiday park poolI'll follow up this post with the next whistlestop tour of months July to December but please feel free to ask any questions or request any photos. I think I take an average of over 25 photos per day so there are plenty to choose from and many more things achieved than I have crammed into this post. Other things you may be interested in are ways to become a part of the project. For this, we have introduced our crowdfunding and rewards page, offering dedication discs, short breaks and even corporate sponsorship of various projects.Back soon, hope you are enjoying the catch-up and will return to read the next installment. :)"},

{"title": "Home Brew in a Week with the BrewBarrel", "date": "Tuesday 12 April 2016", "text": "#Recipes#Technology#Money Saving#How to...Home Brewing Customised Craft BeerThis is a blog about my first ever adventure into the world of home brewing and craft beers. I'm not a beer drinker, as a rule, but this is different - it is customised to practically guarantee that I'd like it. I was not disappointed! Indeed, this would make a fantastic, extra special Father's Day gift for giving on 19th June 2016.BrewBarrel - Voted Silver in The Dad Networks Best Father’s Day Gift Category 2015About a month ago, I was asked if I had ever tried brewing my own beer and my answer was no, firstly because I don't particularly like the stuff and secondly because all that kit takes up space that I can put to better use. Regardless of this, I was invited to try my hand at brewing a small barrel of something specially selected, with flavours based on my personal preferences for the ice and slice taste.Having investigated the website at www.brewbarrel.co.uk to find out more about these customised beer kits, I was already aware that artisan and craft beers are all the rage and that the bottled varieties are correspondingly expensive, especially when living on a frugal budget such as mine. I have to admit that buying a kit of anything for the purposes of an extravagant drink with friends simply wouldn't occur to me - until now! Never let it be said that I'm a party-pooper! The prices for the kits are eye-watering to me for personal use but I wouldn't bat an eyelid at buying one as a gift for someone else. So here goes... let's get brewing and find out if it is worth it.With the BrewBarrel you create your own customised beer recipe in three simple steps:Select your favourite beer styleDefine the intensity of your beer's 'hoppy' aroma to control the bitternessAdd up to three more flavours to make it truly yoursMy BrewBarrel kit soon arrived but I never got around to setting it up for a couple of weeks, hoping to have a little barrel of beer ready for sampling over the holidays. As luck would have it, plans went askew, so I have only just got around to sampling it! Now, however, I am glad that I didn't dish it all out to others (sorry folks) as I LOVE IT! Because of my believing that I didn't like beer, it was suggested that I try brewing an Indian Pale Ale utilising different varieties of hops instead of just one type, which results in a naturally citrusy and herbal sweet beer. Apparently, this beer style is also characteristic of the resurgence in micro brewing and is probably the most popular beer style at the moment. If you are a fan of citrus I can wholeheartedly recommend this.First delay I had was in realising that I needed bottled water, as I haven't a clue what goes into the well water pumped off the hill at the caravan park near Frugaldom, so I opted for supermarket bough's own natural spring water, which cost pennies. I needed just under 4.5 litres to make up the 5 litre barrel, so bought 3 x 2 litre bottles. Yes, frugal folks, I am home brewing at the caravan! That's how handy this neat little kit is, complete with it's 5 litre tin keg (that I can think of several ways of reusing). This is a German beer kit, produced by a fairly new start-up company in Munich, where home brewing wasn't as popular as it is here in UK. Despite this, 80,000 brewing kits were sold in Germany alone, with one reason being the will of many people today to engage in a DIY hobby and practise some degree of self sufficiency. Likewise here in Britain, where requests began arriving for the bespoke kits. Alongside the UK launch, new beer varieties, such as Lager and Ale, were developed.I remember the 80s' when every lad and their dad, son, brother and uncle was home brewing. Big plastic barrel kits could be seen in almost every back room, shed or outhouse! Staying home and socialising with friends and neighbours was the normal thing to do during those financially turbulent times and now, here we are in 2016, 30+ years later, still with our turbulent times but with beer kits that are so far removed from the clumsy efforts of the past that it's now trendy for us ladies to have a go. Sexist? Maybe! Fun? Definitely!Measuring out the boiling water, mixing the syrupy malt, adding the hops and yeast... it really was a dawdle! The most difficult aspect of the kit was probably pushing the pressure valve into the top of the barrel, but even that was relatively easy. I waited the few days recommended and then gingerly turned the barrel - I couldn't resist testing the valve to hear the hiss of the beer inside - proof positive that it was fermenting.Next, I had to alter the shelves in my tiny fridge to fit in the 5 litre keg, but managed this without having to eat too much to make the space. Who would have believed that beer could be made within the space of a week? As luck would have it, my visitors cancelled, so my beer barrel sat in the fridge for a second week until I decided to do the testing myself. Gingerly, I lifted the barrel onto the worktop and slowly released some gas from the valve. Not wanting to waste a drop, I opened the tap at the bottom and allowed a trickle of the frothy liquid to run into a glass. I'd never make a barmaid, that's for sure! As you can see, I had a glass of what looked like cappuccino froth, but it slowly turned into a honey-coloured liquid and I was able to taste it for the very first time.What a revelation! Never in my life have I liked beer until now and, even now, I can't believe this is homemade beer! I have no idea of its strength or potency, all I have is the knowledge that I made it, it was simple to do and I like the end product. It's a real treat to the taste buds and I wish this company every success in their entrepreneurial endeavours. They have a great product and, if anyone is stuck for gift ideas, I would happily give or receive a gift voucher that allows me to concoct my own specialist beer from over 50,000 different flavour combinations. I honestly didn't know where to start but can see how easy it could become to keep on sampling more, based on initial results, so...DON'T FORGET THIS IS ALCOHOL!PS: The kit also includes 3 beer mats - nice touch!PPS: Cheers, frugal folks! Don't forget Father's Day in UK on Sunday 19th June."},
{"title": "Badgers in the Garden", "date": "Friday 1 April 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Gardening#Wildlife#How to...In December, the bottom of the garden flooded, so we finally had to move the chickens to new quarters further up the garden. In February, the old chicken run was converted into a wildlife garden. In March, we finally got around to setting up the trail cam in the hope of filming some of the local wildlife - now we have badgers!With the help of a battery powered Trail Camera (these have dropped greatly in price, with models, such as ours, available from under £75) we are able to leave it running and capture footage through the night, thanks to the infra red. These little cameras are amazing and make wildlife filming something we can all afford to do without even incurring the costs of leaving home!How to attract badgers - leave out some peanuts! The very first night we left out peanuts, our first badger arrived. Prior to this, they had no access to this part of the garden, as it had been fenced off for the hens.As you know, we have several ecoarts sculptures in the garden, so the badger had to go and investigate. I don't think it quite knew what to do but I can't help but wonder if it recognised the sculpture as a badger! At first the badger was curious about the camera, as it shines a little blue light when the sensors are triggered and clicks as it begins filming in infra red. Very quickly, our garden badger seemed completely at ease with the gadget until, at one point, he (or she) lay down and fell asleep watching it! Over the coming week, our badger decided it was safe enough to bring along a friend to share the peanuts that get sat on top of the tree stump and scattered around it on the ground. We got very excited by this and the thought crossed our minds that this could be a pair that may just return with babies in tow at some point in the not too distant future. Within about a week, word had spread of the tasty peanut treats available in Frugaldom's cottage wildlife garden and we were delighted when we reviewed the footage and discovered that a third badger had arrived! This was more than we had dreamed of seeing and had me wondering how many badgers live in a sett - or a holt. I've now nicknamed this corner of our garden 'Badgers Halt'! This was the week they began attempting to dig under the shed, so rocks had to be scattered around it to try and prevent them from tunnelling underneath it. This seemed to work, but then... The next day, after reviewing what the camera had captured during the previous night, we were shocked to see a fourth badger happily munching away on the peanuts. Never had we expected anything like this - we seem to have attracted an entire family of them. The original visitor is there every night, almost every hour from dusk until well into the night and then returns before dawn. They all seem to be most active at dusk, but this may be because the peanuts are all gone by morning. And then last night, to round off the month of March and take us through to April, we were introduced to our 5th badger of the group, so I had to go and do some more reading. According to the information about badgers on the Wildlife Trust web site, there can be up to 14 badgers living in the one sett, so I think we're going to need a whole load more peanuts!These are very entertaining creatures but they are also very boisterous, with a tendency to run at one another, head-butting and body slamming. I will try to upload some of the video clips to our Frugaldom YouTube channel so you can share their antics.www.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "Ponies, Tree Planting, Badgers and Beer Making", "date": "Tuesday 15 March 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Wildlife#Horses Galore#The Frugaldom Project#Household Budgets#Money ChallengesA few days of glorious weather has put some sun on ponies' backs, helped with tree planting, dried out the ground a bit and even seems to have encouraged the wildlife. But beer-making? What's that all about, I hear you ask? ========================  Last week we had a visit from the local Forestry Commission and someone very kindly chain sawed and removed all the fallen trees that had crashed onto the boundary wall at Frugaldom. This now allows us free access to the entire length of wall that runs along the top side of one of the fields.Soon, the top paddock will be split into two strips of land - one recreational paddock and one strip for new woodland. The ponies, once they get here, will be used to help clear the land once we have removed the tree stumps and fallen branches. We also need a new fence built to prevent them from wandering too far down the hill or into the stream. Eddie, Pippin and Willow are having their veterinary checks done this week and, all going well, should be coming to Frugaldom at the weekend. Exciting times! Spring is definitely in the air at Frugaldom - while walking the edge of the first field with the machine driver, who will be moving all the old felled trees and roots, I spotted these crocuses. They were a welcome site in an otherwise desolate piece of landscape here. I can't wait for this part to be cleared for new trees, pasture and wild flowers. Tree planting is a slow process but we now have 1,000 more willows in the ground and finished planting the new holly and hawthorn trees that arrived as part of our wild wood tree pack from the Woodland Trust. Still plenty more to plant, with the hazels, crab apples and downy birch standing in line waiting to go into the next phase of our new woodland at Frugaldom. We set up the trail cam at home, in the part of the garden that was reclaimed from the old chicken run. Within hours, we had our first visitor scurrying around, digging in the turf and munching on peanuts I had scattered on the ground. Badgers seem to love peanuts and we do love knowing that they are around here, safe and well. Now we just need to try encouraging red squirrels and hedgehogs back into the area. We already have deer coming into the garden - they ate all the windfalls in our little orchard during Autumn! I have spotted the hares on several occasions over the past week while out tree planting at Frugaldom but haven't managed to take any more photos, so this is the one I took a fortnight ago of the new baby. Baby hares are called leverets. Unlike baby rabbits (kittens, I think?), they are born fully furred with their eyes open and able to run around without a problem. Mum leaves them hiding for the day and returns periodically to feed them. The hares at Frugaldom are fairly bold and don't seem to mind that we are there when they lope across the yard. This is a big clump of frog spawn that was about to be left high and dry when the water level in the new drainage ditch began to drop, so I moved it along a little until it was floating in a cleared area... it slurped over like something out of a slimy comedy horror movie. I am informed that frog spawn is laid in clumps, whereas toads lay their eggs in strings, so this and several other clumps belong to the resident frogs. (Thanks for keeping me right, DC.) And now for the beer - there's nothing better than a cool swig of something refreshing after a long day working out on the land and with all this frugal living, many of us don't have the time or the budget to socialise in a pub. It's expensive enough getting dressed up and arranging taxis (or designated drivers) plus babysitters (if you need them) and buying a decent glass of something, so Brewbarrel.com offered to send me a home brewing kit of their finest to have a go at making my own. We aren't known for drinking alcohol here, as it simply isn't in the budget, but we do make exceptions for special occasions. I'm not a beer drinker, so I explained this to the Brewbarrel.com man and he very kindly selected a recipe that he thinks may be my personal preference, based entirely on what I normally like. (Almost anything with a citrus twist.) His helpful advice was to recommend India Pale Ale, as \"It utilises different hops instead of just one type, which results in a naturally citrusy and herbal sweet beer... if you are a fan of citrus I can wholeheartedly recommend that one to you.\"There you have it - in about a week's time, I'll have brewed my first ever bespoke, luxury beer. It's a 5 litre barrel in the kit, so I'm not too sure how it compares with the equivalent in bottles of artisan beers from the micro-breweries that are springing up around us but I do know that making it myself does have much more appeal.We still have trees and posts available for sponsoring at Frugaldom, so please consider checking out www.frugalshop.co.uk to find out how. To get more in-depth details of the Frugaldom project, you'll need to register a username in www.frugalforums.co.uk (Registration is free)Until next time,NYK / Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Building a Willow Den at Frugaldom", "date": "Monday 7 March 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Technology#Money Saving#Gardening#Poultry Keeping#Wildlife#Horses Galore#The Frugaldom Project#Alternative Energy#Money Challenges#Small Space Living#How to... Fine and sunny weather over the weekend allowed us all out to the field to play at den-building with the grand children. Work is always more of a game when it's fun and having the under 12's in charge of proceedings makes it interesting, to say the least!============= To put you in the picture, my grand children have inherited my love of ponies, so the prospect of seeing some back at Frugaldom soon is very exciting for them. First thing on Saturday morning, they were up and impatient to get going, with the master plan being to build a den in the heritage garden (our Garden of Gratitude) that was within easy reach of the barn and had a view of the corrals, so they could see the ponies if or when they arrive.The work part needing done at the weekend was more willow pruning, but what better material to make a den than fast-growing willow sticks? These will also be great when we get around to creating our frugal pony paradise paddocks! Beautiful blue sky, sunshine and a really sheltered spot for den building, but you can see the snow lying on the Galloway Hills on the horizon. We are so lucky to have found and afforded to buy this little piece of frugal paradise!The sprawling goat willow in the middle of the heritage garden will make a fantastic den, as the branches are already curved over, creating an inviting hide with spectacular views. Better still, the girls will love watching and listening for the pretty little long-tailed tits that frequent this clump of willow.There's an apple tree by the entrance, but the rest is all willow, which we hope will grow up tall enough to weave into an arched walkway to the entrance of the den.The junior clerk of works surveying the 'roof' before we begin weaving through some branches and planting the walls to keep out the wild animals. Youngest is impatient and wanted to know if the willow would have grown by Easter so she could get a door, in case the fox went in 'her' house! The den quickly took shape once all the twigs and stones were raked out of the way and all the clippings from the other willows were planted around to grow living walls. As well as the surplus to requirement goat willow cuttings, there are 200 fast-growing willow cuttings that will be woven together next year.Putting the finishing touches (for the day) to their den as the sun begins to set - still plenty to do but it will need to wait for another sunny weekend.We also hammered a post into the ground for the family who has sponsored 5 harvest trees - each grand child has their name engraved on a disc to show their support for Frugaldom and to pinpoint their adopted trees.Another job that has been done since my last blog post is the new duck run being built. This should keep the surviving ducks safe from any further fox attacks. The hems are much happier and settled well in their new, secure pen and we've even had a few eggs from them over the past week!This used to be the old hem run at the bottom of the garden. Those of you who tae part in our forums will know that this area is where I have started my 2016 Frugaleur challenge, planting 5 new colours of willow for growing into sculpture and basket weaving materials. This bit garden was originally designated as tiny house location, but having since bought Frugaldom, this will become the cottage wildlife garden and the old hen shed will eventually become a hide. The deer are already coming in from the field beyond, we've had a badger visit and there are woodpeckers coming to the bird feeding station nearby. Mr Ecoarts has managed to source some turf, so that will be laid as soon as possible, then we'll sort out feeding stations and set up the trail camera to see what visits the bottom of the garden when we aren't looking.In other news,I am hoping I have managed to source a supply of pallets, which will be a great help at the Frugaldom project.Acknowledgement arrived from our local planning department saying thy are really busy and it could take at least 6 weeks to respond to our enquiries.The Forestry Commission called today to let me know they had been out and removed the fallen trees that landed on our wall.The digger driver is coming out tomorrow so I can show him what needs moving, digging and clearing.The portable solar lighting kit arrived and it is FAB! Many thanks to Kev at The Solar Shed for providing us with a free upgrade to 20w panel and free postage & packaging.The trees arrived from The Woodland Trust for this weekend's tree-planting event.

{"title": "Orchard planting, corral post tagging and the horse drawn travel blogger", "date": "Monday 29 February 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Gardening#Wildlife#Horses Galore#The Frugaldom ProjectThe new apple orchard has now been planted - 25 Galloway Pippins and 2 of them sponsored already! The latest tags have been fitted to the fence posts around the corral and today, Leap Day 29th February, we caught up with Michael, Angus and Bob as they made their way along the country lanes in the direction of Frugaldom.Michael hitching up Tarateeno, aka Angus. You can read his blog at http://horsedrawntravel.blogspot.co.uk The weekend was sunny and dry, so we set off for Frugaldom to plant the new orchard and tag a few more posts around the corral, while also taking the time to gather more wood for the next Ecoarts sculpture. Now that the latest horse has been completed, I'm eagerly awaiting news of what the next one could be. As luck would have it, the weather soon returned to miserable, wet and windy, so we decided to call a halt to wood collecting and get back to Thrift Cottage. It was a soggy scene that met us when we were homeward bound.Seeing the little horse drawn cavalcade, we stopped for some photos and a chat with Michael. We have seen him in previous years while he's been in nearby Port William, so I have given him directions to Frugaldom and am hoping he may still be there when I return with the next lot of tags for the fence posts. Who knows, maybe the hitching post will be ready in time for his next visit to the area. This being the weekend that the latest sculpture was completed - a 'cat' horse  - we have decided to name it 'Angus', after the little cart horse who crossed our path this morning - the black and white cob pulling the colourful bowtop wagon.)As soon as H completed 'Angus', the sculpture was given a coat of wood preserving treatment, while the sun shone, then we began gathering together what was needed for the caravan and our Frugaldom trip.This was the first weekend of the season, but I didn't get much time to catch up with many others on site, as it was a case of getting the tree planting done as quickly as possible, as the next packs of trees are scheduled to arrive here next week. As per the events pages, we intend starting to plant the next new hedge weekend of 12th & 13th Match.Between us, for the new orchard, we dug the 25 holes needed for eight two-year-old and seventeen one-year-old apple trees, all genuine alloway Pippins, a heritage variety believed to have originated in nearby Wigtown. We lived there for a few years after it became Scotland's national book town. These apple trees had to be bought in specially, so a little bit of an investment was needed to help get this orchard up and running as part of our Galloway heritage project. For this reason, we have offered the trees up for sponsorship at a cost of just £15 each, to help cover initial costs. (See www.frugaldom.com for link to the details.)The latest tag-a-post engravings have been done, so these have each been fitted to their posts around the corral. With Frugaldom aiming for absolute financial self-sustainability, every sponsorship, membership or tagged post helps cover the costs of setting up the project and then, once we have Frugaldom up and running, it will hopefully become a trading post where the main currency will be whatever we all make, do, mend, grow or harvest. I'm hoping to get back over there to fit the next batch of tags later this week. (Tree sponsors also get an engraved tag on the Frugaldom corral fence.)After completing the tagging and planting, I had a walk around Frugaldom to check on the previously planted trees and the recently planted willows, then wandered along the river to the pond area. It will eventually make a fantastic location for a wildlife hide or picnic spot, but we are a long way off that stage just yet.We spotted our first leveret of the year! These tiny hares are born fully furred with their eyes open, so many people can understandably mistake them for deserted baby rabbits. You can see this one looks just like last year's baby, complete with tiny white star on its head.I think this about sums up my weekend and I am trying to make the most of this extra day in the year by catching up with blogging, baking and planning my next trip to Frugaldom. I should probably be planning the next bit of renovation work in the house and kitchen garden, but my excuse is that it's still cold and wet outside, so nobody will want to travel to work here.  (If you do, please get in contact - we still need a joiner, a plumber, a builder, a plasterer and an electrician.)Don't forget you can share more of the Frugaldom project news in the forums, on Facebook and on Twitter."},
{"title": "Frugal Living during Winter", "date": "Saturday 27 February 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Fitness#Paranoid Times#Money Saving#Gardening#Poultry Keeping#Cycling#Foraging#Free Food#Alternative Energy#Household Budgets#Food on a Budget#Money Challenges#Small Space Living#How to...Following a frugal regime during winter is never easy. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks or who agrees or disagrees with our lifestyle choices, it's always around February that we could happily crank up the heating and throw extra logs on the fire... or else pack up and head for warmer, drier climes!================  Wintertime is dragging on without any definite signs that it's either going to arrive here with a vengeance or extend its chilly, wet, occasionally frosty days. Will it snow? Will the temperatures plummet to 10 below freezing just as we expect springtime to arrive? Who knows? All I know is that this time of year brings new challenges - money and otherwise. We eventually got the caravan cleaned, aired and made up ready for the arrival of our first visitors: the season opens this weekend and the water pipes, thankfully, hadn't frozen. It's probably warmer in the caravan than in the house, if I'm honest. Living in a smaller space is always going to be cheaper, as it's easier to heat.CHILLY MORNINGSAt home, the thermometer on the sitting-room wall reads just below 6 Degrees C in the mornings, as there's no central heating here and we still haven't resolved the issue of deciding on the best way forward.The open fire heats hot water on a back boiler, which gets pumped around the house and heats 5 radiators quite adequately - if you have a full time stoker, a limitless supply of perfectly dry kindling, a self-filling coal bunker and a guarantee that the power stays on to keep the electric pump running. Last week the power went out!Just as I had banked up the fire and the water in the boiler was starting to bubble, sudden blackness and silence descended - barring the roar of the fire and the boiling water! Flicking a switch is fine if you have one, but there is no such switch to extinguish a blazing fire in the hearth while the pipes are rattling like they're ready to explode! (Getting slightly paranoid at this possibility)CAN A BOILER BLOW UP OR BURST?Literally blind panic while retrieving torches and candles... A fine mist water spray and a dose of salt extinguished the remains of the fire after I precariously decanted red hot coals to the multi-fuel stove in the room across the hall! I do NOT recommend this at all, but until I find out for sure if a back-boiler really can explode from overheating while the power is out, I have lost trust in this solid fuel system. My faith in uninterrupted electricity supply has never been strong, as I've pretty much always lived in the country. I should know better by now, but these types of home improvements cost thousands of pounds. More number-crunching work required and I really do wish I had been able to afford to replace the entire heating system all at the same time. I think I'd now prefer a bigger multi-fuel stove, but keeping a supply of perfectly dry logs is difficult in such a wet climate.GARDENING, POULTRY KEEPING AND WORMS IN WINTERGardening has fallen by the wayside completely - the ground is saturated, the earth just mud - even the two remaining ducks are getting fed up with it. They should be happy once their new run is completed and their pond thaws. The hens have settled well into their new run, away from the flood risk part of the garden and we're even getting an occasional egg from the young (2 year-old) hen. The little banties are now 7 years old, so I'm not expecting too much from them. Garden hens are not frugal if you're in it for their lifetime, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.The wormery is doing surprisingly well, despite the weather. I think with it being so mild for much of the time, the wrigglers have just kept on eating, so here's hoping we get some decent compost this year. I can probably count on one hand how often our food recycling bin has ever gone out for council collection!KEEP ACTIVE - FEBRUARY'S FRUGAL FITNESS MONTHSomething I must practice as much as I preach, as keeping fit and healthy helps your metabolism and the extra exertion keeps the blood pumping sufficiently to prevent hypothermia setting in... move it, move it, move it... anything, anywhere, just keep something moving. Right now, only my fingers are moving because, once again, I'm sat at the computer. Ho hum... I'm a dismal failure at the physical fitness in February but I have remained vigilant with the frugal finances! Just need to try to reap the benefits of some savings interest from somewhere, even if it is a mere 0.5%EXERCISE IS FREE!You'd think I would get to grips with this fact and make the most of it whenever possible! For this reason, I fully intend marching into March, making it all the way through the month, exercising like a mad March hare (without boxing) then marching right out of there, into April.CYCLINGI haven't even sat on my bike since last Autumn! I think it's safe to say I am no cyclist, just a fair-weather peddler. The only pedlar I'm ever going to be is the one at the gate trying to sell eggs, fruit and veg! Riding a bike in winter weather just is not for me - I'm too paranoid about being run over by a logging lorry, tractor or milk tanker!ANOTHER BIG BANG!After the hot coal sprint, any almighty bang and rumble had me worried. The entire house shook and I ran outside half-expecting to see a collapsed chimney had crashed down from the roof. Thankfully not! We hadn't a clue what had caused it, but the poor cat looked terrified!Not long after that, another almighty explosion rocked the house... but it had resonated from the hill at the back of the house. I seriously thought the farm's wind turbine had exploded, but it was still there, still turning. I went and spoke to the nearest neighbour - she had felt the explosion, too, but she was able to alert us to the war games being played nearby! How come I had missed that piece of news? Yes, we had seen the helicopters buzzing about and we'd even had two huge Hercules planes fly over the previous day, but that's not unusual for this area. A trip along the shore road showed there were more than just planes nearby.WINTER TREE PLANTINGExcitement over - but blasting not over! We now have tree harvesting, road repairs and quarrying all going on around us at Frugaldom. Tree planting is going to be noisier than normal, I expect, but this isn't holding up proceedings - it's mainly the weather that's causing the delays!TREE SPONSORING1,000 willows, 25 heritage apple trees, 420 assorted natives and a small copse of oaks to be planted before the end of March. We would love to have actual help planting but no amount of posting online about it gets our news read by anyone close enough who has the free time to spare. You can lead folks to the Internet but you can't make them read specific information. Having invested in 25 heritage Galloway Pippin apple trees for the new orchard, I am now seeking sponsors for each of them. If you would like to help support the Frugaldom project, all the options are listed on www.Frugaldom.com  and in the www.frugalshop.co.ukPOST TAGGINGAs well as seeking tree sponsors for the orchard, we have several other ways available, both for individuals and businesses. Fencing the project is costing thousands of pounds, so we are tagging the posts with engraved discs displaying the chosen details of those who take part.Our Tag-a-post scheme will continue for as long as it takes to fence the corrals, then we'll keep going - around the barnyard, along the track and around the nature walk. It would be fantastic if each new post got tagged, though I fear this could take longer than I have left, as the Frugaldom project needs many, many new posts.Again, you can find out more about our sponsorship and membership options by using the links on the Frugaldom website or by visiting the Frugal Shop.Many thanks to all who have supported us so far - I hope you will all be able to join us here in May 2017 for our very first Frugalfest get together. Or sooner, if you choose.Back to keeping warm - we're chopping up as many of the old posts as possible and drying them for firewood. Frugaldom is huge compared to a garden, so there is more than enough scrap wood by way of logs and branches for any of our members to share, if you care to go the DIY route and collect them from site. (By prior arrangement only.)PORTABLE SOLAR KITI am now looking seriously at investing in a small, portable solar kit for lighting the barn and for emergency use at home or at the caravan. I'm not sure how money-saving it may be, so it has to be seen as an investment. Renewable energy on a stand alone system has to be worth considering, so the possibility of incorporating a small wind turbine on the Frugaldom barn has not been ruled out, either. There are some great kits developing and these are gradually falling within the affordability of individuals, even those of us on a frugal budget.My incomplete list of current winter warmers and emergency back-up supplies:Extra layers, including thermalsFleece has become part of my daily wardrobeWoolly leg-warmersDouble thickness socksWarm gloves and a hat - your head loses a huge amount of your body heat.Furry slippers (Indoors only!)Flasks for filling with hot water (I have a 5 litre one that gets filled from the kettle on the stove)Cooking facility - BBQ, gas camping stove, log burnerInsulated mugsHot drinks, soup and instant hot meal optionsBottled water (if you rely on electric filters or pumps for well water)Exercise or extra movement - a short, brisk walk outside or even up and down stairs or around the house worksElectric blanketHot water bottle / wheat bagsExtra duvetExtra under-blanket - if your bed has slats, lay cardboard over the top, below the mattress, as added insulationKnitted blankets from scrap wool - keeps you warm even while knittingBurnable organic waste turned into fuel!CandlesRechargeable wind-up torchCoal in the bunkerLogs in the log storeOld newspapers (provided by neighbours)Matches and extra matchesHand and foot warmers - anyone tried these? Shame they're disposable but as emergency back-up when working outdoors in freezing temperatures, they sound good!Alternative energy source - even battery power is better than no power - being able to see during power cuts (or when off grid) is paramount to your own safety, as the last thing you want to do is fall over or walk into something.How are you dealing winter on a budget? Is heating costing more than eating? It certainly does here!"},
{"title": "How to Save to Buy a House", "date": "Thursday 25 February 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Money Saving#Household Budgets#Money Challenges#Small Space Living#How to...Home ownership for first time buyers can be a daunting prospect so this is a little bit about how frugal living can help you save to buy a house, or even save to rent to buy a house! The lifestyle affords the luxury of saving more of your cash for your dream home. When I first began my quest to save for a house it was 'the done thing' – we were led to believe there were 3 options –get a mortgageget a council housefind a live-in jobInitially, I opted for the live-in job. Looking back, it was possibly the best paid job I ever had – all bills, meals and car paid AND £40 a week into the bank. But at 18 you don't think about it until you need to move on and set up your own home.And so the master plan began - only I got impatient and wanted an item that cost more than my savings, so I got a bank loan to pay for it! The loan was only £800 repayable over 12 months but getting it became a defining moment. It taught me, rightly or wrongly, that the easiest way to buy something major is to use someone else's money and pay it back over time, preferably with as little interest added on as possible. It all seemed so easy until interest rates rose to an incredible 15%, that's when things can go pear-shaped. It certainly taught many of us why we should pay more attention to financial and property-related news!Since then, various Government initiatives have evolved and different home ownership possibilities introduced. There are affordable rent options, social housing, shared ownership and even social enterprises that incorporate housing.Gentoo Group is one such social enterprise, based in North East of England, with \"a vision to improve the Art of Living.\"Their work is focused around three key areas to maximise impact: people, planet and property. They allow you to find a property you like, move in and pay rent, as a tenant, but your payments can also contribute towards buying the house – no need for a huge deposit or even a mortgage!Social enterprises help further increase your chances of getting onto the property ladder and I suspect that this route may provide solutions to those who would, otherwise, have little possibility of ever owning their own home.Long gone are the days of my three basic options and total exclusion from the property market if you find yourself with insufficient income to qualify for a mortgage. Now we also have:Help to Buy - Government backed scheme for first time buyers offering tax-free top-ups to mortgage deposit savings.Shared ownership - You can buy shares worth between 50% and 75% of the market value of the property and you pay rent on the remaining share.Rent to buy - 'Genie' properties are let at rates slightly above those of social tenancies, but they are still considerably below current market rents. Of course, due to their popularity they are allocated on a ‘first come, first served’ basis and on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement.Part exchange - A bit like trading in your old car for a bigger or better one, you could start small and then work up to your dream home.  Whichever route you choose, you need savings to cover your costs. Most property transactions involve some form of legal fees, possibly surveys, moving costs, initial décor, floor coverings and furnishings and then all the little things that can be overlooked, especially if you are starting from scratch. Granny's insistence on starting a 'bottom drawer' as early as possible is as relevant now as it has ever been.Take care of the pennies, don't spend the pounds foolishly, take advantage of meaningful bargains and bank your savings safely so they can't be frittered away on 'stuff'. Try to ensure your money is attracting the best possible interest, even when rates seem ridiculously low, and be prepared to move quickly if your dream home presents itself.A LITTLE BIT EXTRATo help me with my own savings plan, I charted a timeline. It began with house hunting, then progressed through house viewing, surveys, moving costs and then on to legal expenses. It wasn't until all of those costs, which were several thousand pounds, could be met that I started saving for the actual house! Each month the balance grew with tax-free ISA interest, I rounded it up to the nearest full pound. Pound-rounding became quite habit-forming, so it wasn't long before I was rounding up to the nearest £5, then the nearest £10, until it eventually got to the hundreds. It all took time. Social enterprise options could definitely provide many with far quicker results and it is something I fully intend to explore further. How about you?Feel free to ask questions, comment, get involved in the frugal forums discussions or share these posts and good luck with your personal savings goals."},
{"title": "How to be a Frugal Living Expert, part 3", "date": "Friday 19 February 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Money Saving#Free Food#Household Budgets#Food on a Budget#Money Challenges#How to...Quit spending on stuff you don't need! I cannot repeat this often enough! It is the number one cause of being skint, no matter how much or how little money you have coming into your household. Frugal living is about HOW you allocate your budget. How poor is poor? I can't answer that question as it's all relevant to personal perception. I can't afford racehorses, yachts or a beach house in Monacco but it doesn't make me poor. Everyone wants a slice of your cake and the bigger your cake, the bigger the slice they want! But isn't it funny how rich people don't seem to cut all that many more slices from their huge, rich cakes? It still starts with the roof over their head, the food and drink on their table, their transport and then the usual stuff, like pets, fashion, hobbies and holidays. They DO NOT dash off and spend a heap more time at the Bingo, bookies or pub, not do they do a trolley dash three times a day around the supermarkets looking for yellow stickers and I doubt very much if they cut out tokens for the £9 holiday from several tabloid newspapers (rather than 1), up their brand of tobacco and graduate from Lambrini to Lambrusco and then perhaps onto a cheap Prosecco! So, it's time to start thinking like a solvent person and quit whining about being poor. Enrich your life by learning how to think positively and see beyond the debt. Think like a wealthy and wise person, while taking care of your pennies.Now to look at what's cheap today that used to be the preserve of the rich!Most people who use the Internet now have access from home, work or via their mobiles - we know this because our libraries are being closed at an alarming rate through lack of use and I cannot remember the last time I saw a pay-per-hour Internet cafe since my own closed down in the 90's. It was the preserve of the rich to drive saloons with car phones and when I eventually introduced mobile phones into my business plan, it cost £149.99 for the cheapest pay-as-you-go hand set, which looked a bit like a brick in comparison to today's sleek little touch screen gadgets. Access to technology has turned the definition of poverty on its head.And yet we have food banks, over 5% unemployment (which does NOT mean we have almost 95% in employment) and people saddled with unsustainable debt that includes mortgages on properties that have sunk into negative equity.But interest rates have never been so low for so long, mortgages never been so affordable and many of the luxuries around us have fallen within the reach of even the most basic earners. I can sail to Ireland for a tenner and call it a day cruise, despite fuel prices being almost ten times what they were at the start of the 80's! What has gone wrong?Internet costs money and we don't actually NEED it. Based on various criteria, it looks to cost around £10 per week, by the time you factor in contracts (if you have any), line rentals for land lines and the various call and Internet (usually broadband) packages.To be honest, £10 per week is very reasonable to someone like me who was introduced to the Internet via charged national call rates. I remember the day they dropped Internet access charges to local rate and then a further drop to a penny a minute (on top of your monthly or annual fee, plus telephone line rental) and we celebrated no end - probably with Lambrusco, as Lambrini hadn't yet been invented. I think it came about to make cheap fizzy wine sound like the classier Martini - only not shaken or stirred!When all-inclusive Internet packages arrived, we swore our undying love to our computers. But we mustn't overlook the fact that, despite these massive drops in price, Internet is still something that many cannot afford. So let's look at what £10 can buy you if you really are broke!What food types are suitable for all diets, including sugar and grain intolerant ones, that are affordable to all budgets and can cover our basic nutritional requirements? My guess is that homemade soup is the most obvious choice, as it can be cooked almost anywhere, even over a campfire, and comprises water based stock, some veggies and, if you're felling flush, a handful of pulses and/or grains.How many of you have been to a butcher, asked for dog bones and then used pony carrots and a handful of broth mix or rice to make a pot of soup?What would you give up first? Your mobile phone, your Internet access or something else - anything else other than your connection to the outside world?Join us in the www.frugalforums.co.uk to discuss it further"},

Support this amazing outdoor project in Dumfries and Galloway, where we are attempting to combine nature and the environment with self-sustainability and the Arts.The entire principle of Frugaldom is to pursue self-sustainability in an environmentally aware manner. After years of what many looked upon as extreme frugal living, we finally managed to save enough to buy some land from where we can base the Frugaldom Project. This is a place we want to share with you all, both online and in reality.Joining us as official 'Friends of Frugaldom' offers a little bit more.Friends of Frugaldom actively support this worthy project. Your contributions help plant more trees, sow seeds and improve the natural habitat, wetlands and grasslands that will, in turn, encourage more wildlife. In exchange for your support, you can follow progress and, if you choose, visit the site to experience it for yourself. You will be helping to drive this project forward and ensure its survival.Whether you choose to use Frugaldom as a source of inspiration for writing, art, crafting or photography or view it simply as a symbol of the potential for self-sustainability, it is about true freedom - the freedom to aspire to be all you can be. You may want to plant a tree in the new woodland, sow some seeds, plant flowers in the Garden of Gratitude or go foraging for berries and fruit, or you may prefer to view from afar, knowing that every penny counts, just as every day counts in helping create Frugaldom. The riverbank needs protecting, the old dry stone walls need repairing, the ditches need clearing and the garden areas need tending. Help support the project in any way you can.CLICK HERE TO JOIN US  The websites, blogs, forums, chat room and, indeed, the entire Frugaldom Project is financed privately but all are free for you to use. We are not a charity, nor do we have financial backing by way of loans, grants or Government payments. We are simply frugal living enthusiasts who were fortunate enough to happen upon this wonderful opportunity to create something great that can live on forever. (We can accept voluntary contributions if you would prefer not to join as an official Friend of Frugaldom.)We firmly believe that we can create a great outdoor project on a frugal budget, but it all takes time, effort and the support of as many friends as we can muster. We are prepared to put all of these ingredients into making this dream a reality. Join us on our journey, as 'Friends of Frugaldom' from as little as £5 per month.Frugaldom outdoor project is about freedom, creativity, heritage, nature and the environment. The land itself was previously clear felled, so this needs to be tended and brought back into use as pasture, preferably with a wild flower meadow and native hedgerow that includes hawthorn, holly, dog rose, elder, hazel and blackthorn (sloe). Our hedging will, in years to come, provide for foraging fruit, nuts and berries, while also encouraging wildlife back into this little corner of south west Scotland.Planting of the new woodlands began in November 2014, the Centenary of World War 1, when we were awarded our first tree pack from The Woodland Trust. We are honoured to have been given the opportunity to take part in creating a living memorial, commemorating the lives of those lost in the fight to defend our freedom. Our World War 1 Centenary Woodland will be entering its 4th phase of planting in March 2016.We have introduced a 'sponsor a tree' option, along with the opportunity to 'tag a post' on the main corral, or paddock, at Frugaldom. Each area will be fenced in locally sourced larch wood, rather than wire, so tagging a post helps cover our costs and provides an unusual way of showing your added support.We will be developing the swathes of bog myrtle, encouraging the sphagnum mosses, cultivating the existing fruit trees and expanding on the willow beds by planting fast-growing varieties that can be harvested as weaving materials for willow sculptures, hurdles, basketry and sustainable biofuel.We aspire to become a zero waste enterprise, very much focussing on the reduce, reuse, recycle ethos, but we need your help to turn this little wilderness into a wonderland. Water is harvested from the barn roof, power is generated from portable solar and nothing is being willfully wasted.The Frugaldom ProjectBased in the heart of Dumfries and Galloway, our heritage project is also something that should interest many who visit us in the future. Stretching back several hundred years, it traces the history of modern day Thoroughbreds to the very roots of their racing origins - the Galloways. These little horses roamed the Galloway hills and lowlands before being dispersed throughout the world to become the progenitors of many of today's finest racehorses.Our plans to celebrate Galloway's rich heritage include an eco arts sculpture park set within a 'Garden of Gratitude'. As part of this project, we are now ready to begin planting a small orchard of Galloway Pippins, a dual purpose apple tree first recorded in 1871 in nearby Wigtown, Scotland's national book town.Friends of Frugaldom can benefit from discounted frugal breaks, as we now have our own holiday accommodation nearby, offering you the chance to escape to the country and experience Frugaldom for yourself.Please feel free to join us in the frugal forums to follow the progress of the project - you may even like to learn a little bit more about frugal living and the many money saving challenges we set ourselves.Websites, blogs, forums, chat room and Frugaldom Project administration by NYK Media."},
{"title": "How to be a Frugal Living Expert 02", "date": "Monday 8 February 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Money Saving#Household Budgets#How to... 2016's frugal living challenge budget here is, once again, £4,000 for the year. This is a comfortable amount and allows for every other available penny to be saved, spent or invested elsewhere. How it is done is no mystery and nobody ever died from saving too much, nor from sharing such knowledge freely, did they? So let's go... When it comes to budgeting, there are easier options than becoming a frugal living expert.You could bury your head in the sand and just spend blindly, while worrying yourself sick about how to afford A, B or C.You could make yourself ill trying to work all the hours you can, just to make ends meet.You could torture yourself working in a sole-destroying job that you hate, just to pay bills and take 4 weeks off a year worrying about going back to work again.You could take the even easier option of living on the wings of a prayer (while skint) while hoping that you win the lottery. It is a possibility if you afford yourself the luxury of buying a ticket, but then anything is possible. So grasp every opportunity that you can if it's absolutely free.I use \"searchlotto\" to get free entries every week and this is my gratuitous referral link, in the hope of getting another free entry when a fellow frugal living expert signs up and does likewise. Some people spend many hours clicking, searching, doing surveys and filling up their blogs with paid advertising... this blog post is a little bit like that. It's what happens when costs need to be met but it seldom works out that way. So, please excuse the banners and links, but they are here for a reason. Do feel free to sign up and start sharing them on your own blogs, as it's basically free advertising for the companies they represent, combined with the opportunity for some freebies for us.Another easy option while trying to get out of debt - and one I am all too familiar with, but let's not go there - is outright gambling. (Yes, I know buying scratch cards and lottery tickets is similar, but some people don't recognise that fact.) Living in hope of the dream 100/1 shot romping home with a tonne of your money on its nose. But let's face it, how many people do you know who earn their money from racetracks who aren't actually in the employment of the track, trainers, owners or bookies? This is just another gratuitous link, but if you want to follow free tips for the fun of it, just to practise your number-crunching skills, then this is an ideal place. Other than that, just follow my horses galore blog, which helps pay to keep Frugaldom and the frugal forums, blogs and chat room operational.National Minimum Wage in UK for an adult over 25 years of age is approximately £13,100 per year. After tax and insurance, it's a net income of about £12,000 per year, or £1,000 per month. This equates to almost £230 per week, which is a huge amount, compared to the £4,000 that I budget for annually.Now we hear that the UK Living Wage is coming into force in April this year - a whopping great £7.20 per hour. That's £270 gross per week for each adult over the age of 25 who works a 37.5 hour week. As a trainee nurse in the 80's, I didn't even earn this in a month and back then, I thought I was on a phenomenal salary as a trainee! So you see, wealth and frugal living are not just about numbers and amounts, they are also about perception and priorities.Please note that I do not earn National Minimum Wage - this is for budgeting examples only.I appreciate that living in rural Scotland is about as far removed from living in the big city as it gets, but it's all relevant. If you're earning £40,000 a year while paying £25,000 a year on rent, plus work associated costs and general household bills, then your disposable income can turn out to be a fraction of your earnings - if there's anything left at all! In saying that, you can still buy a house in parts of the UK for less than £50k, so it's all about location and lifestyle. Personally, I prefer quite a simple life that's affordable and fairly stress free. Put it this way - if my household costs only £4,000 to run for 2 of us and we're happy with our chosen way of life, then the reality of it is that we need only work about 6 paid hours each per week, doing minimum wage work, to cover all our costs. Now you can see that working 75 hours between two, even on the living wage, leaves 63 hours worth of income free to do with as we please.Yes, I am in a very fortunate situation in that I have zero debts and the house is bought and paid for, but that's why all those years of scrimping and saving were implemented. They paid off! It took hard work, a single-mindedness that many found far too extreme and complete and utter dedication to the job I decided to do - live a frugal life in pursuit of financial freedom.Looking at the 'real' cost of living, the following are the absolute essentials, rounded to the nearest £100:Groceries - £700 Cleaning & Toiletries - £100 Heat and light - £1,000 Essential insurance - £200 Council tax - £1,000Food is fairly cheap in the grand scale of things - it's waste that costs the most.The food and drink budget here averages just under £1 per person per day for everything and we don't exactly starve, as my less than perfect body mass will testify!Based on the above, it shows how easily we could 'live' on £3,000 a year. It more than adequately shows me that it's the roof over our heads that costs us most of our working lives, once we get past the false belief that we 'need' anything else in this very materialistic world of ours. Staying warm, dry, fed, watered and healthy are our top priorities - you would think!Many people have rent or mortgages to pay so these costs must always be factored into the equation. Interest rates can divide and conquer even the best budget, as they fluctuate over the years. Right now, they are at an all time low, which is no good whatsoever for savers looking to gain interest on their cash, but for mortgage holders the opportunity to pay off lump sums has never been better. In my time as a house-owner, I have witnessed base rates ranging from the current low of 0.5% to as high as 15%In my opinion, you should always, always, always make hay while the sun shines.Money is an absolute necessity no matter what way we look at it, so there are no illusions or delusions here about wanting to go down the cashless route - it simply cannot work. Self sustainability has to embrace sustaining yourself financially as well as physically, mentally and spiritually, in whichever way you believe is right for you, while also contributing to society, as a whole.Personally, I would love to be able to offer every single one of you regulars who read my frugal blog, participate in the frugal forums and join us in the chat room the opportunity to come and experience Frugaldom for yourselves, at no cost to you, but that remains part of the dream, as only a massive windfall would afford me that luxury. I do still enter a few free competitions now and again.Now to get the non-essential spending prioritised... this is the pet monster of each household that feeds on disposable income. For those of you who have jobs to attend (we are fortunate in that we work from home) then the cost of having those jobs can be eye-watering, so think carefully about how much you are prepared to spend on doing the 'right' job.And finally, for this section of our series about how to become a frugal living expert, time really is money - the less time you spend working at running the household you really want, the more money it's going to cost you to compensate for any short-comings. This is a serious lifestyle choice - it isn't simply a 'get out of debt free' card where personal solvency suddenly ends the game.In part 3, I'll look at priorities within the non-essentials list, as society is trying to dictate that several of these 'wants' have become 'needs' when they, in fact, haven't.NB: I have chosen only advertisers who offer free options - nothing on this page should cost anyone anything, other than myself, of course, who gets charged for commercial web services.#Frugal Living#Business#Cyberdosh#The Frugaldom Project#Money Challenges#Entrepreneurs#Frugal Entrepreneurs The Frugaldom understanding of self-sufficiency is one of self-sustainability. It's about earning your own living and then spending accordingly, living within your means, regardless of how great or how meagre these may be. It's a lifestyle choice. Frugaldom is freedom from debt by way of living and working in frugal ways. This is an old post, first published in 2011 (original can be seen here) that I thought I would share here before doing the follow-up, now 5 years further down the line. Over the past few years we have organised various challenges relevant to money saving, clearing any debts and building a lifestyle that fits in with the whole ethos of sustainability. With a little bit of planning, this lifestyle can embrace greener living or a more environmentally-friendly way of conducting business within the household and workplace. Frugaldom is about taking on the responsibility of providing for yourself and, hopefully, being able to share skills, goods and services in a way that can both benefit others and cover all associated costs. True, cash free self-sufficiency, in my opinion, isn't legally possible within the UK. In order to live and work, we need shelter and that shelter incurs a tax. In order to live we need food and water - we could attempt to rear and grow all of our own food and pump our water from a well, but in order to do so there are welfare issues and legislation to be considered - these things cost money. We still need to earn and, as long as we earn, we need to pay taxes where and when due. Some might trade and barter or move around but, at the end of the day, everyone needs an income and earning that income costs money. True Frugaldom means the ability to provide all things for the household in order to sustain a chosen lifestyle and afford everything that it entails. There should be no need for State hand outs but neither should there be an aversion to seeking financial help where and when genuinely needed.  In this respect, it is time to start building our self-sustainable business in order to help secure our future.  We are our own employers, without working (for ourselves) we can neither pay ourselves nor keep a business running. On the surface, it's always handy to grow whatever fruit and vegetables you can, as everything you can produce from home is one less thing you need to spend money on, allowing you to focus your hard-earned cash elsewhere. Over the past few years we have documented the costs involved in setting up a garden to produce as much as possible, including eggs from the assorted poultry. We can make each micro-project self sustaining or cash-neutral; hens lay eggs, selling the surplus can pay for their keep. Quail lay eggs and are quickly hatched and reared - the sales of surplus birds and eggs can cover the costs.  Cash generated from any source can be used to neutralise each of these individual budgets, each of these projects can be built up to combine into one business. It's what microholding is about - all these small, self-financing pieces of the jigsaw fitting together to form a much bigger picture - that picture is your business of the future. Christmas and all the festivities have now passed and we're halfway through the first month of the new year. For those who are still relying on other people's money, the credit card and bank statements will be arriving, reminding you of the dire state of your finances. But not for all of us. For the debt free, each statement is a reminder that there is an alternative route, one that can and should be followed carefully if Frugaldom is to be achieved. I have estimated that for every £1,000 it costs you to exist each year, you NEED to save £2.75 each and every day that you're not earning. So, if life is costing you £12,000 a year, you need to save £33 for every day that you won't be earning, weekends included. The figures are simple - the less life costs you, the less pressure you are under to earn or save extra. Building a business isn't so different. Everything has to pay for itself, some things need to pay more to cover the inanimate objects that house them, some need to cover the cost of storage and distribution. In the case of gardening, plants need to cover the cost of the patch of land they take up each and every day it takes them to grow - fertiliser, protection from pests, time in planting, tending and harvesting... consider all costs, don't ever assume that because you did it that your time is completely free. Any legislation governing what you do needs to be accounted for, just like the costs involved in owning a car to enable you to go about your daily life. If that car costs you £500 to have it parked in the driveway for 365 days of the year then that's almost £1.37 that needs to be earned every single day without even driving the car. (The figures get much bigger when you factor in the percentage that's needed to cover tax and National Insurance etc.) Only by analysing the true costs of living and working can we begin to understand the basic principles of self-sustainability and self-sufficiency. After 10+ years of lifestyle planning, 2011 is my year of Frugaldom business planning. All of the above was first published over 5 years ago and it's good to look back and see progress. Between then and now, we have bought a small house without the need for a mortgage and have been chipping away at the renovation. Then, in 2014, we managed to buy about 5 hectares of land and a lovely wooden barn - again without the need for credit each project is scheduled over the long term, so the 5 years duration for renovating this house should end this year, but it won't, because we chose to grasp the opportunity to invest in the land project.  With hard work, planning and the usual frugal budget, I hope to complete the house in 2017, which will then give us a further 2 years to complete all our plans for the land - now known as the Frugaldom project - which we hope to have open by 2020. Stick with the plan. It may take several detours and incorporate a few extra stops along the way, but you will get there. As they say, 'seeing is believing' and if you can see it in your imagination , then it is there, just waiting to be made a reality. Feel free to follow Frugaldom on Twitter or join me in the Frugaldom Forums"},

{"title": "How to make bread without bread flour", "date": "Sunday 31 January 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Recipes#Money Saving#Food on a Budget#Money Challenges#How to... Now You Know how to make bread without any bread flour! I got through January spending less than £30 on groceries for the household but ran out of bread and bread flour. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention, so let's get inventive. Running out of bread and bread flour is normally unheard of in this household but it can happen to the best of us, especially when trying to empty cupboards and stick to a grocery challenge budget of £1 per person per day, so I spent less than half my allocated budget just cooking from what is already here.As long as you have ordinary flour, eggs and milk then you can make pancakes.If you have just the flour and milk, you can make flour tortillas.Better still, as long as you have yeast and good old-fashioned, all purpose, plain flour then you can make your own budget bread.BARGAIN ALERTBrown Bread and Roll Mix only £1 for 3.5kg*Here's how to make bread without bread flour1 1/2 cups warm water (approx.)2 tsp dried yeast1 tsp of salt2 tsp oil4 cups plain flourI added a scoop of wheatgerm to mine, so it needed another spoonful of water, then made the loaf in my breadmaker. You do not need a breadmaking machine, this recipe will work equally well by hand in the usual way - knead the dough well for 5 minutes, rest/prove for an hour, knead for another 5 minutes, rest/prove for another hour, then shape and bake as normal, either in a lightly greased loaf tin or on a tray. I was quite sceptical about whether or not this loaf would rise, as I have never learned the actual differences between each of the various flour types other than the obvious differences between grain types like wheat and corn but as you can see, the loaf rose as it normally would had I been using proper bread flour. The load was baked as normal white bread on the 1.5lb setting and this did it perfectly. The loaf turned out the tin without a problem and sounded hollow when tapped on the bottom. It got wrapped in a clean, cotton tea towel until it cooled enough to slice. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the first time I have baked bread with plain flour, as I do tend to dilute bread flour with plain flour to save money when handbaking or if the bread mixes aren't available on offer, but this was the first time I had tried baking a full loaf in the breadmaker without having any strong bread flour in the recipe. Once cooled, the load sliced as any other bread would slice - so we had to sample it with some homemade blackcurrant and bramble jam. It tasted delicious!From now on, I will not be paying extra for strong bread flour - I'll sit back and wait for the bargains to appear and, in the meantime, keep a better stock of cheap, all purpose plain flour, which currently costs 45p per 1.5kg bag from most big supermarkets. I have, however, managed to order 3 x 3.5kg of cheap bread and roll mix from Approved Food to replenish stock and I'll add on an extra couple of bags of plain flour next time I get the chance of it. I'm guessing that I'll can dilute the bread mix in similar fashion as long as I add an extra sprinkle of dried yeast.You can add herbs, spices, garlic, sultanas, seeds, grains, nuts or whatever else takes your fancy - play about with it to find what you like best and don't forget to share your results and photos with fellow followers of frugal living in Frugaldom's forums.* My affiliated link"},
{"title": "Money Challenges in January", "date": "Thursday 28 January 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Money Saving#Household Budgets#Money Challenges It's almost the end of the first month into our 2016 frugal living challenge - how are you doing?  My garden is a shambles with nothing more than the last remnants of the perennial herbs and none of them looking like the photo above - lush, green and colourful. No, instead they are looking sparse, woody, twiggy and in bad need of some care and attention. Elsewhere in the garden, some of the garlic cloves have sprouted and I found a few rogue potatoes when scrounging for some spinach the other day I was out there. Every new year brings us new challenges but it still never ceases to amaze my how others perceive 'our lifestyle' as we pursue our frugal living goals. I don't even think of it as a peculiar life of deprivation or self-imposed poverty. We live in times of austerity that have been brought on by what would appear to be a complete and utter lack of ability for some people to add, subtract, multiply and divide! Simple arithmetic should surely provide just reason for living within one's own means after working so hard to achieve total freedom from debt. What I see, I own - it is mine. It doesn't belong to the bank, it doesn't belong to a credit company, hire purchase, lease or finance company, it is mine to do with exactly as I please - so I do! Shame on anyone who can't 'get' why they have overdrafts, credit card bills, bank loans, long-running contracts, mortgages and insufficient (if any) savings if it's down to their money-spending priorities being at odds with their household incomes. Putting you own wants before the security of home and family is, in my opinion, a very selfish thing to do. Back to the finances - we had a debate in the frugal forums about whether or not there were any benefits to paying BT's annual linesaver this year, as prices had, once again, increased. In my situation, where every penny counts, I found that the 10% savings made by paying in full at the start of the year led me to having an extra £21.54 at the end of the year, along with the added £1.94 that represents the 1% cashback I'll accrue from paying by credit card and clearing the balance before any interest is added. For those of you who have been with Egg card since we began our cash-back savings, we still get up to 1% cash back each year from a fee-free card, we just no longer get paid interest on any credit balances - more's the pity. So how is the annual challenge budget looking? From a starting point of £4,000, I have already spent £500, with £194 of this going to BT and my usual 50p per day into the savings pot. Telephone and Internet account for a huge proportion of the budget but let's not overlook the fact that these are luxuries that most of us prefer to have. It now costs around £10 per week for personal communications equipment of whatever description you use - landline, Internet, mobile phone - and that has to act as part of our social activities, as we are all so busy communicating that some of us have no time left to actually interact with real people outside of work or home. The other big burden on budgets is energy costs - these account for about 25% of my annual budget, or 20% if I include council tax. Has anyone else noticed how similar in amounts council tax and energy use have become, or is that just in my old stone cottage with it's single glazing and no loft to insulate? It's like the price of petrol - it used to always run about parallel with that of cigarettes with much of those costs being tax of one form or another - anyone know if it is still possible to buy a pack of cigarettes for the price of a gallon of petrol? Many thanks to all my regular frugal friends for continuing to pursue a life of frugality and for setting a good example to those around them - living in frugal debt freedom IS the new rich - like it, live it, love it! For those who disagree, you can lump it!  Feel free to join any of our many money challenges free in the www.frugalforums.co.uk New for 2016, we have the THISTLE POT CHALLENGE,  a brand new challenge to save those pennies into pounds and come to our Frugaldom meet-up in May 2017. It's going to be our first ever frugalfest!"},

{"title": "How to Grow Rhubarb", "date": "Saturday 23 January 2016", "text": "#Frugal Living#Gardening#The Frugaldom Project#Free Food#Food on a Budget#NYK Tips#How to...How to grow rhubarb23 Jan 2016As we progress through winter, thoughts turn to preparing the land for whatever food we are going to try and grow and I've decided to learn more about how to grow rhubarb. Over the past few years we haven't been without rhubarb. I've grown it from seed, grown it from 'cuttings' when friends have split crowns and have even bought small crowns when they have been on clearance in garden centres or the local hardware store. Each time I got a decent rhubarb bed going, we seemed to have moved house without taking much with us: it's never been the right time to dig it out the ground.Thankfully, when we moved here a few years ago, I had some seed grown rhubarb in a pot plus we were lucky enough to uncover a patch while reclaiming the garden. After the past four years of trying to improve it, I have now decided to split it up and move whatever I can to a new rhubarb patch in the fruit garden at Frugaldom.Rhubarb is said to prefer slightly acidic soil and doesn't like to be too dry, so planting it near the edge of the peat bog could be a good move - time will tell. Meanwhile, I need to get out there and dig before the ground freezes and get a nice mix of horse manure through the area I plan on using. Based on what I have read so far, the rhubarb crowns need some frost to stimulate the new growth and we've had very little of that in the garden this year so far. Frugaldom, however, sits about 300m higher and has already had some snow and ice, so that sounds like my best option.I'll follow up this blog post as soon as I have dug up the crowns from the garden - it's still like autumn here, so they shouldn't know any difference. Splitting up the old crowns should also help bring on a better crop of rhubarb here, so there should be none of this running out of it during the later months. Ideally, I'd like to grow a year-round supply of both rhubarb and apples. I've ordered 10 heritage Galloway Pippin apple trees to start a new orchard at Frugaldom, so 2016 should be an exciting year for fruit growing, between these and the new strawberry beds we started last year with all the runners from the garden.Great source of information about rhubarb growing - http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/Edited in - while out rummaging in the ground for the first rhubarb crown, I popped the last of my garlic cloves into their raised bed and spotted about half a dozen from previous planting have already sprouted. My rhubarb bed, on the other hand, looks like it's been bulldozed and then used as a giant litter tray! It's a firm reminder of why I like holly and brambles growing about the place! They're about the only things over which the dratted cats won't walk to get at fruit, veg or herb beds!#Frugal Living#My Long Shots#Money ChallengesFrugal Bucket Lists13 Jan 2016With our frugal living challenges starting so long ago, I have slowly, but surely worked my way through many lists, none more important than the pursuit of debt freedom, simple living and, ultimately, the bucket lists!We all set off on our individual quests for various reasons - in most cases, it's for money reasons, or lack of it! However, life is for living, not for worrying all through it about the bread and butter of our existence - money! In modern society, we can't really manage without the horrid stuff, so we set ourselves little goals and think about things that we would like to try to achieve along the way. My personal lists normally follow the format of 'things to do before I'm...' whatever age.This was my list of things to do before I'm 50I did not too badly with that list but then wondered what would happen if I really did manage to see the Aurora Borealis and completed that list before the age of 50, then had no follow-up in place.This was my next list of things to do before I'm 50It has now just dawned on me that once again, the Aurora Borealis has eluded me and that it is time to move on and start compiling my next big 'to do' list, only this time it's going to have to be before I'm 55 and it should have been written over a year ago, as I'm now 51 and have 3 grandchildren!  Where does all the time go? No amount of money can buy that, so it's very much a case of get to it - live life to the full on the frugal budget and have fun in the process! I have come a long, long way since 1999 and, despite everything, my fight to succeed continues. Frugaldom has certainly expanded from the postage stamp garden with it's herbs!Witnessing the spectacle of the Northern lights, once again, will be added to the next list but my thoughts and feelings about things on my ultimate bucket list change as the years pass. Some things just aren't meant to be while others you feel compelled to hang on to forever, in the hope that you recognise the opportunity when it puts in even the briefest glimmer of an appearance. New additions get added to the equations and old possibilities die. So, without further ado, I am going to write my things to do before I'm 55 and will add it here soon."},
{"title": "Life of Pie", "date": "Saturday 9 January 2016", "text": "The world, according to Frugaldom, is a complete package. We have all we need to create all that we want and if we break it, we have the wherewithal to fix it. Nothing is fake, everything is real - just take the time to look into this amazing frugal bubble that is our world. It's like the life of pie!Life of Pie!Humour me, if you will. I'm still the same person living the same frugal life surrounded by the same people, same space and same basic ingredients that make up Frugaldom and the world around me. Yes, some faces and places may have changed, some friends and family have passed along the way and new little humans have been born into our extended family, but nothing much has actually changed. We are still in this same bubble that holds all the secrets and solutions to all the mysteries. It still dumbfounds me that some people just can't see the bigger picture when it comes to looking after our spinning rock as it hurtles around that blazing ball that we call the sun.Planet Earth (Free Blog Photos)Don't get me wrong, I'm no scientist, I'm just someone who likes to think more and spend less when it comes to the topics of money and life. I can't stand money but it's a necessary evil in our society. Whether we see it as paper notes, metal, coins, pebbles or digital points, it is merely a number that can represent pretty much anything else, anywhere else. Our imaginations know no bounds and are restricted only by how much we can experience, not by how much money we have. It's like pie - some of us can bake our own from very little while others are happy to pay whatever it takes for others to do it for them.Our world is a mish-mash of every possible ingredient available to mankind and it is all contained within this giant, multi-layered, bubble oven that's heated by the sun and insulated or protected by the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, atmosphere and any other invisible-force spheres that engulf our ball of spinning rock. They contain everything, dictate our weather, our climate, our tides and the phases of our moon. As far as mankind is concerned, nothing more gets added and nothing gets lost - it is baking mankind in an ever evolving life 'pie'.Life of PieWe have what we have and it is up to us all to keep making pie and sharing it accordingly. Some people will be researching and developing the very basic ingredients, some will be tweaking the recipe, some harvesting and preparing the ingredients and some making the dough. Some will be helping bake this never-ending pie while many more will be contributing to all the various fillings needed to help our spherical bakehouse stay in production and meanwhile, we all need to contribute to maintaining the oven, as a complete break-down would be globally catastrophic. Sadly, there are those who will always want a larger slice of the pie than others and there are also those who aren't prepared to share their slice with anyone else under any circumstances - they'd rather pig out, get fat and dictate the pecking order. But one would do well to remember that when times get tough, those who spit feathers, bully the flock and crow loudest are likely to be next in the pie, even if it's just to bring peace to the neighbours. Feed the world... every single person is contributing to the global pie in their own way - even if it doesn't turn out the way we like it.There is only one way out of this kitchen and it isn't by any earthly door that anyone's ever found. We're in it together and we're in it for life... only you can decide how you choose to contribute. What holds it all together and keeps things going is the balance of nature and our combined, conscious efforts to maintain the equilibrium. I believe this is the very basic principle of life itself and that everything we amount to is what gets returned. Trying to lead a balanced life and helping those who can't should be first and foremost, in my mind. Money won't buy food, water, shelter or even fresh air if this bubble bursts, so why accumulate useless 'stuff' that has no meaning in the meaning of life unless you already have everything you need for a balanced and happy life? By all means, protect your investments, but spare a thought for those who have nothing.We need to find alternatives to save our bubble from bursting!www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk / Frugaldom"},

{"title": "Homemade Marzipan Fruits", "date": "Monday 21 December 2015", "text": "It's the final countdown! Winter solstice has arrived, we're about to see out the shortest day of the year and Christmas is almost here! Today I made snow sprinkled marzipan berries, a clove pomander and a cinnamon & berry horseshoe garland.Anyone remember the great snow of March 2013 when we were snowed in with no power for several days? I do, because we went out and decorated around our lane with snow animals, snowmen and snow-writing. This was our smiling snowcat. I hadn't thought much more about it since then until this arrived through the postbox of Thrift Cottage:One of my neighbours, who does not know that we made the snow creatures, had been and taken photos. Low and behold, my snow cat has gone down in history on the front of a charity Christmas card! This beautifully crocheted snowflake also arrived in the post, a gift from a lovely member of our frugal forums who was kind enough to make several of us these lovely gifts. This was much appreciated and is now hanging on the tree here.I managed to get a hold of a few baby food jars, thanks to my daughter resorting to shop bought meals for youngest grandchild, who has just cut his first tooth in time for Christmas. Daughter usually makes and purees her own bay food but Christmas preparations, three young children and a business to run means time is short, so short cuts are sometimes essential. But the outcome is that frugal gran gets a few tiny jars that are just big enough to hold two servings of instant chocolate and mini marshmallows for a couple of friends and neighbours.I found this really great, metre high Santa Claus for 99p and decided that it would be fun to hang him on a door. I think it's easy to guess which room lies behind this particular door that has Santa hanging around cross-legged.HOW TO MAKE MARZIPAN FRUITSI usually make an assortment of marzipan fruits - oranges, apples, bananas - but this year I decided to make snowy berries. I used one pack of marzipan, a little red food colouring, cloves and a sprinkle of icing sugar.I used a 400g pack that had been reduced to 99p and got 30 individual cherry-sized Christmas berries out of it. I tore it into strips then broke off enough to roll into marble-sizes balls.OK, so two of them accidentally vanished during the rolling of the balls but that's what happens when you push back lunchtime to fit in a few more jobs.Usually, I would use several colours of food dye here to create rosy apples, oranges and bananas but I was really short of time and had run out of quite a few food dyes, so I used red and made cherries, or berries, whichever you prefer to call them. I just rolled the marzipan balls around in a dish with some food colouring then stuck a clove into each to represent the stem. Leave then to dry off on a piece of kitchen paper.Once dried, I sprinkled them with sifted icing sugar to give them a snowy effect. These make lovely little gifts packaged up in fours or else left out for guests at Christmas or new year.My cloves were getting very dry and brittle, so I thought I'd use some more of them up before they began crumbling. Being traditionalists here, we always have a tangerine at the bottom of the Christmas stockings, so it's the one time of year I have these in - except this year it is satsumas, so I used one of them and made a mini pomander.I started it off with a criss-cross pattern but then ended up filling in all the gaps to use up more of the cloves. It smells very Christmasy and festive. Next to add some cinnamon to the festive aroma that is now wafting through the house.I cut some berries from one of the shrubs at Frugaldom last time I was over and have had them hanging up to dry. I have now snipped off a small bunch and added, along with some small cinnamon sticks to an old horse shoe and tied it up using garden wire and recycled string. I just need to cut a little piece of holly and ivy to complete this but it was too dark by the time I'd finished all my tonight's jobs.That's my day done - I am off to have my hot chocolate and marshmallows, grab my knitting and plonk myself in front of tonight's comedy film. Tomorrow the Christmas guests begin arriving and I still have a huge list of things needing ticked off my never-ending list. At least when we are this busy, we have no time to spend!Frugally festive best wishes to you all! Don't forget our 2016 frugal living challenge thread has been opened at www.frugalforums.co.uk and you can now join us as an official 'Friend of Frugaldom' at www.frugalshop.co.uk if you would like to take advantage of our frugal holiday accommodation in the future.The festive season is upon us and it's almost time to make the traditional Scottish clootie dumpling - but has anyone tried the super-fast, easy recipe for microwave dumpling?Traditional Scottish Clootie DumplingEvery year, we have a family tradition of serving clootie dumpling as part of the Christmas day meal. This year will be no different, but dumpling making has already begun, because I need to cook at least three of them. Our recipe has been handed down 5 generations of the family. The first dumpling was made yesterday, by traditional methods. You can find the recipe for our traditional Scottish clootie dumpling on the Frugaldom blog.Yesterday's dumpling was made for another family member, so I still need to make on for this household but these take at least 3 hours each to make, as I have only one large pan and no standard cooker, just the mini cooker with hot plates or the log-burning stove. But what happens when you make a dumpling? That dumplingy aroma wafts throughout the house and ignites the taste buds into a stat of wanton disregard for dieting, meal planning or even patience! So a quick search for speedy dumpling found this microwave clootie dumpling recipe.I melted the sugar, margarine, spices and milk then simmered the sultanas in the mix for a few minutes but was in far too much of a rush to allow it to cool, so it got mixed with the plain flour, bicarbonate of soda and beaten egg. I used only half the amount quoted, as there are only two of us here until Tuesday and, unlike traditional clootie dumpling, I don't think this variety will freeze. The above is what it looked like when I poured it into a microwave-safe bowl, which had been lined with plastic food film. (Not too sure I like the plastic film, I will try without this next time.)I cooked mine in the microwave on high for four and a half minutes and this was enough to bake it through. It turned out of the bowl without any problem and smelled like spicy dumpling.Unlike traditional clootie dumpling, which gets boiled in a cloth for over three hours and then grilled or toasted to dry the sweet, leather-like skin, this variety contains eggs and has no skin, so the texture is more of a spongy soft fruit pudding, not the easiest thing to slice when serving. But it does smell really good and we do like our puddings in the household.In true frugal living fashion, a hot pudding usually gets served with custard, so here is the finished dish. Overall, this version of clootie dumpling cost me approximately 40p to make (double up if making fullsize) and by the time you add on some custard you are looking at around 60p for something that easily provides for 6.Tonight we cheated - instant packet custard made with boiling water and 'dumpling' made in under half an hour via the microwave... cheap and cheerful, frugal and festive, hot and tasty!Let me know if you try this really frugal microwave clootie dumpling recipe. For my personal preference, I would use less spice next time but there will certainly be a next time. I wouldn't call it dumpling, as such, it being more of a spiced fruit pudding, but it certainly makes an excellent substitute for occasions when you simply don't have a spare 3 or 4 hours to hang around the kitchen.Amidst ridiculous arguments raging online about container sizes and weights of certain chocolate brands, here is a really easy way to make your own frugal luxury chocolate truffles.Whisky cream liqueur trufflesMy Frugal Recipe for Handmade Truffles150g of chocolate5 tablespoons of icing sugar3 tablespoons of stewed & strained rosehip 'juice' (or any other liquid flavouring you fancy)A separate 100g of chocolate (only if you are dipping the truffles - I didn't, I just dusted them)1/2 tablespoonful of icing sugar & 1/2 tablespoonful of cocoa powder combined (icing sugar on its own works well with undipped truffles)Being a frugal household, I don't usually have any sort of luxury baking items in stock, so I tend to use supermarket's own brand, which usually comes in white, plain or milk. It now costs around 30p per 100g bar but their milk chocolate contains 28% milk solids, which is about double the \"minimum cocoa solids' recorded on the likes of the commercial big brand chocolate boxes, over which the current argument rages.Melt your chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. I just put the bowl of broken chocolate pieces into the steamer, as it seems to work as well as any other method - but cover the chocolate to prevent water dripping into it.While your chocolate is melting, sift the icing sugar into a separate bowl and then slowly combine that with your chosen flavouring. In this case, I was using the juice from stewed, foraged rose hips. The icing mix changes from a deep mango colour to a shade more like condensed milk once it's mixed with the icing sugar.As soon as your chocolate has melted into a smooth paste, slowly pour the icing sugar mix into the bowl, stirring and blending at the same time. Your mix will lighten a few shades, regardless of whether you have used milk or plain chocolate. You can now set this aside to cool. I cover mine with cling film and put it in the fridge as soon as I can. It doesn't take too long before the truffle mix is set, so it's a good idea to keep your hot water in the pan, ready to melt the next lot of chocolate if you are making several batches or plan on covering the truffles in a second coat of chocolate.I left this lot to set in the fridge, overnight, then shaped them into 'logs' before pressing them down with a fork. If you love chocolate and don't mind a bit of a chocolatey mess, handmade truffles are the very thing for you to try.Handmade rose hip chocolate trufflesThe above recipe is exactly the same for any frugal chocolate truffles. You can use almost any flavour you choose, be it alcoholic or otherwise, and you can powder them with just icing sugar, just cocoa powder or with a combination of the two. If necessary, improvise - sprinkle them with whatever you have available.For added luxury, you can dip the finished truffles in a second batch of chocolate before dusting them with cocoa or icing sugar. The following are made with dark chocolate then dipped in white before dusting with cocoa powder.Handmade white and dark chocolate trufflesIn case you missed any of the previous truffle recipes, just type in 'hand made truffles' to the search box that pops up in the top right hand corner of the main website at www.scottishmultimedia.co.ukI am planning on making some apple and chilli chocolate truffles - flavouring provided from homegrown apples and homegrown chilli peppers - but I will wait until I have dark chocolate for those.If all else fails, a cheap alternative is just to jump on the Quality Street bandwagon and grab some bargains while you can. With prices slashed as low as £6 for 2 tubs, you can always split them up into smaller lots or gift them along with homemade snowman soup.This is not a sponsored post, this is the cheapest I could find these chocolate tubs Feel free to join us in the Frugal Forums, where money saving and good living go hand in hand on even the strictest of budgets."},
{"title": "Homemade Christmas Decorations", "date": "Monday 14 December 2015", "text": "With 10 days remaining until Christmas Eve, we are now decorating indoors after getting the first decorations onto the big festive fir tree at Frugaldom.The 'Crispmas' DecorationsHomemade decorations were always something we were encouraged to make when we were at school - everyone remembers the egg carton and tin foil bells, the paper chains and the lanterns, but can you remember the crisp packet garlands? The above are now back up in my sitting room, having been made last Christmas, but I thought I would do a re-post of the instructions for those of you who aren't registered to access the information on our www.frugalforums.co.ukAs always, responsible adult supervision is recommended for crafting.INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOMEMADE CHRISTMAS GARLANDSWe are seeing fewer and fewer foodstuffs sealed in foil-backed wrappers these days so whenever I see any crisp packets with their silver shiny linings, I save them. A discounted family pack of brand name crisps provided this lot last year - I think I may have bought them from Approved Food!The crisp packets are already opened up at one end, so simply open the other the same way, leave the reinforced 'tear open' strips intact, cut along one side and unfold them for wiping them clean.Next, you need to cut the packets in half, lengthways, so these pieces can all be joined together to form one long garland. Scissors can easily slip when slicing through fine foil-based wrappings so it's best not to allow children to do this unsupervised by a responsible adult.Turn all the pieces of cut packaging shiny side down with the reinforced strip running edge to edge along the top. I used cheap sticky tape to join my crisp packets together and it did the job just fine.Once your packs are all taped safely together, you can begin cutting the fringes. I cut my fringes about half a centimetre wide and take the cut to about a centimetre below the reinforcement strip along the top edge of my garlands to help prevent it tearing when you go to hang it up on the wall.When you turn the garland over for hanging it up you will have a lovely silver Christmas decoration that looks good when hung along the top of the wall or around the edge of the ceiling. This is mine from last year, but it is hanging back in the same location this year.This afternoon also saw the indoor Christmas tree decorated with the help of the cat, who seemed to find it entertaining to scoot about inside every bag or box she could clamber inside! So far, she has been prevented from going into the tree or stealing any baubles, but she isn't learning very quickly, despite this being her sixth Christmas!I guess the was finally tired out after 'helping' organise the Christmas tree decorating - she climbed inside the first available empty carrier bag and promptly went to sleep!This is a shop-bought 'Merry Christmas' garland that has lasted rather well over the years. The ribbons around the mirror are recycled from previous bows and the candleholders (without candles in them) were hand crafted by a friend who made them scrap wood. The tin foil on the fire-guard is simply to radiate extra heat into the room and deflect any smokey back draught that occurs while lighting the fire on windy days!It;s beginning to feel quite festive now most of the decorating is done. I have a few more bits and pieces to go elsewhere but need to finish cleaning, vacuuming and dusting first!"},
{"title": "Prioritising Spending", "date": "Friday 11 December 2015", "text": "Getting the Household Budget to Work in Your FavourWeather comes to us free in every way, shape and form possible. Here in Scotland, we can get everything in the one day - rain, hail, sleet, snow, fog, wind and sunshine. We can't control the weather but we can prioritise our spending to weather any financial storms. Hanging fairy lights along the washing lineAs long time readers will know, we saved and bought a bargain basement fixy-up house that really did need fixing up, so we set about prioritising the spending to start with the absolute basics - fixing the roof over our heads and replacing basics like water and electricity supplies. We've no gas, no mains sewage or drainage system or anything as high-tech as mobile phone signals here, so a land line is essential to maintain contact with the outside world and work from home via the Internet. But we all feel the need to spend on things other than the absolute essentials, so I bought solar fairly lights and have hung the first string of them outside the back door, wrapped around the washing line.  The tree has been looked out and that will be decorated this weekend.We call this guerrilla tree decorating!We planned on completing the renovation over 5 years, which should mean we finish next year, but last year we blew the budget on buying the land that is now another 5-year project to turn it into Frugaldom. So, the priorities change, no matter how well you try to plan things. Frugaldom should be up and running fully by 2020 and the house should have been completed by 2016. Except we lost 18 months on the house project by throwing everything we had saved for home and retirement into the Frugaldom Project. Now it is time to take stock and get back to organising the renovation if we are to have any hope of completing it within the next 12 months.The bathroom and kitchen were both given major repair work - absolute basics like replacing burst pipes so we had running water and rewiring so we had electricity - but we never fitted a new bathroom suite nor did we fit a kitchen. Instead, we made do. I've made do without an actual cooker for some time now, preferring to delay this until such times as I can see a way of fitting in the one I really like. Meanwhile, I make the most of my microwave, slow cooker, steamer, a small twin hot plate and a mini oven that cost £5 secondhand in 2007. The top element of that blew quite some time ago, so... I finally decided on the best course of action, seeing as I have family coming to stay over the Christmas holidays and I'll be cooking a turkey: I bought a brand new worktop mini cooker!A new cooker for the Frugaldom householdAmazon has their winter 4 for 3 in home and garden offer on at the moment, so I treated myself to a brand new mini cooker and a set of pots and pans to go with it - the cooker arrived yesterday afternoon and I'm expecting the pan set today. Item three I chose is a large rug for the now renovated living room that was temporarily carpeted in the cheapest of the cheap cord carpet last year.What about item 4, my 'freebie?, you may wonder? Well, that's already arrived and is waiting to be taken to Frugaldom - 100 metres of weed control fabric through which I will plant the first of the new willow beds in 2016! All of the above, complete with free delivery and excluding the 1% cash back I'll receive from paying by credit card (it gets cleared in full every month) amounted to less than the cost of the cheapest available freestanding cooker I could find. Sometimes more is better and size doesn't matter as long as you know you can fit in the Christmas turkey!Knitting an odd ball woolly blanket - warm, functional and frugalNow for some more knitting - I'm on to the fifth ball of wool and this is certainly going to be a very randomly coloured and textured throw, but who said woolly blankets need to be uniform? They're for keeping us extra warm during cold weather, not wearing out as fashion accessories. Although... I could be tempted if anyone nearby wants to throw a blanket party!Whether you celebrate Christmas, Winter solstice or any other festive occasion, they shouldn't be about how much it drains your money resources, it should be about how much you can afford to share what's readily available while still managing the reserves that will be needed in the future."},
{"title": "Frugal Living for Newcomers", "date": "Sunday 6 December 2015", "text": "By NYK in Frugaldom#Frugal Living #Recipes #Money Saving #Household Budgets #Food on a Budget #Money ChallengesA daily dose of frugal living to help our new members cope with the trials and tribulations of living on an ever tightening budget. Don't spend rainy day money unless it really is essential - stop, take stock and prioritise your spending now.  20 servings of home soup for around £2.00 December is one of the most expensive months of the year if, like many others, you leave Christmas shopping until the last minute and then discover you have overspent on the food budget throughout the year, leaving yourself potentially skint over the festive period. Worse still, you may find an increase in visitors, unexpected presents 'needing' to be bought and family or friends expecting to be fed and entertained during the holidays. My number one tip is MAKE SOUP! Soup can be made from almost anything and costs just a couple of pounds to make sufficient for up to 20 servings. I store mine in recycled margarine cartons, which hold two portions, or in the plastic screw cap jars, which can hold 3 servings. The plastic screw cap tubs cost about 65p each and come filled with instant hot chocolate powder! Bonus! (Never bin anything that has reuse potential.) EASY TO MAKE HAM AND LENTIL SOUP 1 pack cooking bacon (currently around 65p from supermarkets)  500g lentils  4 chopped carrots  2 chopped onionsSimmer the meat in water to make the stock- I do mine in the slow cooker for at least 3 hours and this also contributes to the overall heating of the kitchen - and then strain the meat and fat from the water. Separate the meat from the fat (if you are health conscious) and set it aside while making the soup. You can either add this later or use it in other meals, like ham and pasta bake, carbonara, pie or even eat it on sandwiches. Add in the lentils and chopped vegetables then simmer until ready - add more water as required. Once cooked, season to suit your own taste. You can add in the leftover bacon to turn the soup into a luxury, meaty broth that can be served as a meal on its own, probably followed by pudding, if you are anything like us here in Frugaldom, but when the budget is really stretched, I recommend using the bacon for something like pie-making so you get another meal out of it. SUDDEN LOSS OF INCOME Thankfully, this has not happened to me this month but it happens to people all the time - pay offs, lay offs, redundancies, illness, accidents and even, in tragic cases, sudden death. There are any number of reasons for a sudden change in circumstances and we cannot always be prepared for them. So how can we best cope? First, no amount of panicking, shouting, tears or tantrums will instantly resolve the problem and despite being a very difficult fact to absorb, we have to remain level headed for the sake of our own sanity and those around us. STOP - TAKE STOCK - PRIORITISE Tough choices can mean tough love! I'm focussing on income here, so for the purposes of being prepared, frugal living means maintaining a basic supply of essential foodstuffs, like salt, flour, pulses, dried and tinned goods suitable for emergencies and budgeting to run the household on less than what you normally average. I'm not talking about extreme preparedness, only a basic common sense approach to avoiding empty cupboards when we most need them to be full and paying the bills without bankrupting ourselves, while still setting aside something for the future. THIS 'SOMETHING' DOES NOT NEED TO BE MONEY!  MAKE LISTS I did a quick freezer inventory while the soup was cooking and listed every item this lifesaving ice box contains. In saying that, it is only lifesaving while there is electrical power, so I prefer not to cook any meats before freezing them just in case they defrost and need to be cooked before refreezing. Ready cooked meals are done on a surplus to immediate requirement basis, so a batch of Bolognese sauce or lasagne would be OK, along with the frozen stewed fruit that gets used up over the winter months after the growing season has ended. Soup is always available and gets replenished as soon as the last tub gets used. I have several recipes and posts about homemade soup, feel free to read those, save them or share them. During my inventory, I discovered enough food to last us the remainder of the year, excluding Christmas dinner. I could manage a celebratory dinner on what's here but have family visiting who expect a bit of tradition, so we're preparing the meal between us. List your overheads and prioritise your necessary spending - rent or mortgage, council tax, essential utilities all need to be paid. Review contracts, if you have any, to find out which can be cancelled. As a general rule, frugal living means saying no to all contracts, so things like mobile telephones, satellite television and subscriptions of any description are an absolute no-no! Many don't realise the damage these can do while there's money flowing in, it's only when the contractually agreed payments get missed and start accruing debt at an alarming rate that we suddenly realise the hidden dangers. No more contracts - get rid of them as soon as possible and learn to live without whatever luxury it is they were providing.  CHEAP, HOME-BASED HOBBIES This is my knitting project that I started yesterday. It will eventually become a multi-coloured, multi-textured, warm, woolly blanket made from all the odd balls of wool that others often discard at the ends of their own projects. Both the blue and brown mottled wool are from unravelled home knits made by others. I am not a knitter but these plain (or garter) stitch strips are a dawdle to knit, even for the most inexperienced of us. This and the fact that there are fewer squares to sew together at the end of it make it a much less arduous and almost therapeutic task. Relax and unwind your yarn this winter. ENTERTAINING KIDS My own kids are now grown, one has kids of her own, so my kids are grand kids. Children of all ages demand to be entertained, amused, fed, bathed, clothed and pampered - so do some adults, come to think of it! Money does none of these things - people do! A child can have just as much, if not more, fun playing outside with those responsible for their welfare and, contrary to belief, getting dirty isn't a life-threatening situation. As long as you have the time to spend with children doing simple, cost-free activities, children will be happy. If it's cold indoors because you can't afford heating on all day, wrap them up warm, get them out into the fresh air and then wrap them in home-knitted blankets until the house warms up a bit. Many of us still don't have double glazing, insulation or central heating and nor can many afford to burn electricity in the absence of gas. Coal costs a small fortune and log drying can be next to impossible during the prolonged wet weather we endure here, but making the smallest room in your home acceptably warm shouldn't be impossible, even if it means converting your living room into a bed-sit come dining come games room. It makes family time seem fun all the time. If you're a telly addict, get headphones rather than bark orders to shut up at everyone else in the room who has no interest in what's on at the time.

{"title": "Frugal Living Adventures", "date": "Saturday 5 December 2015", "text": "An update on progress at Frugaldom   #Frugal Living #Money Saving #The Frugaldom Project #Household Budgets #Money Challenges #Frugal Entrepreneurs What is frugal living? This is a question I am still being asked, as it still comes as something new to many. It is NOT self-imposed poverty or about trying to live like Tom and Barbara in 'The Good Life'. It's about balancing your life with your income in a safe and sustainable way. This is where my frugal living adventure has taken me so far...  Our online challenges run from 1st January through to 31st December every year. The first one began in 1999 but it wasn't until 2007 that the decision was made to take the main project fully online. We have the frugal blog, frugal shop, frugal forums, frugal entrepreneurs, our own chat room and now, to celebrate each and every one of these successes, we have our Frugaldom project and we have introduced frugal breaks to enable those on low incomes or with tight budgets the opportunity to get away from it all and have an affordable holiday. That takes care of what I have been up t for the past 16 years but we are now nearing the end of our various 2015 money saving, money making and frugal living challenges and preparing to start all over again. If you would like to join us, please follow the link to the forums and register a free username then spend some time browsing. In the meantime, I am going to bring myself up to date with where I am at with the writing and blogging as that is, after all, why I set out to stretch the pennies in the first place. Writing doesn't often net you much of an income so frugal living allows for life on a tight budget while saving for all the other things you want out of life.  Out of interest, I attempted to bake a 25p loaf to find out if it is still possible to do so. The answer to this is yes - if you use nothing more than 375g of cheap bread flour, a teaspoon of the cheapest dried yeast and a pinch of salt. There's no oils, butters, milk or other additives in these loaves, they are basically flour and water with the raising agent added. Tastes OK to me!  My favourite handmade and homemade item of all time has to be my woolly blanket. I knitted two for this household and then knitted one for my youngest grand daughter, who received it as a Christmas gift last year. The blankets get knitted in strips, using up all the odd balls of wool you can find. Each strip gets knitted to the required length, depending on the intended use for the blanket, then the rows get sewn together to create the finished blanket. While doing last year's, I was able to take a little time an show eldest grand daughter how to knit. She now wants a blanket of her own, so I will eagerly encourage her to knit it herself. I love my knitted blanket! It has more than served its purpose, having been relocated to the caravan. But now I need another one for using at the house!  Everyone who knows me knows that I love filled doughnuts - usually jam, apple or custard. It became a bit of a standing joke a very long time ago, when one particular friend would seldom arrive without making a trip via what was then known as Dunkin' Doughnuts but then supermarkets began selling in earnest - mass produced doughnuts! It's a sad fact that we can now buy these for about 12p but for frugal lifers such as me - it is a very affordable luxury and one that's even better served up as a gift. So... I made it my rule quite some time ago that business meetings had to include doughnuts, preferably supplied by whoever is visiting me to talk business. That's how I discovered chocolate custard doughnuts! I hadn't even heard of them until last month! Thank you Mr L, who took the time to call me and rhyme off the supermarket selection from which to make my choice! Much appreciated! Some people have fallen out with me over the past year owing to my decision to spend my own hard-earned cash in a local supermarket. I'm afraid to say that I don't care - if it costs less to buy the product than it does for me to make it, then it's a luxury best delivered by a local driver whose income depends on these very supermarkets. Without them and their ridiculously cheap basic foodstuffs, we of the frugal living ilk would seldom afford ourselves such indulgences.  November saw the final completion of the yard fencing. We still don't have a full bathroom or a cooker in the kitchen but we do have two paddocks or corrals and the barn yard fully fenced! My grand daughters absolutely love going out to Frugaldom for the day. We can pack a picnic, wrap up warm and they take great pleasure in investigating the latest developments. Now that the barn has been sectioned into several workable indoor stalls, the youngest is convinced that she can fill them all with little ponies! But she is equally excited by the prospect of planting trees, growing food, painting, crafting and organising yard sales at the Trading Post, which is what we call our bartering barn and its newly enclosed space.  The first snow of the year arrived but it didn't lie at Frugaldom. We have had wind, rain, hail, sleet and snow plus about four different storms that bring flood alerts to the area but only the hills have the snow lying - so far. If the trees are anything to go by, I would hazard a guess at a mild winter but we have already had several good frosts and freezing temperatures.  I don't often share family photos, almost never if truth be told, but this has to be one of my favourites. The girls had lifted the ice off the top of one of the water butts at the barn and were using it as a round window - holding it together to see if it would mend after it broke in two. It didn't mend but it did stay frozen for the next two days after this photo was taken.  Being on a caravan holiday park for part of the time means getting to know all the neighbours and those neighbours now know that leftovers needn't be binned - we can use anything and everything to save it from being wasted. This was the remains of an out of date bag of wholemeal flour that got made into a loaf for feeding to the birds. Having the oven on in the caravan means not needing the gas fire lit, so baking is an ideal way of killing two birds with one stone during cold weather - pardon the cruel pun! The girls like watching for the more unusual birds that they don't see in the garden at home, so they are easily tempted to sneak out to the bird table with leftovers whenever they are staying the weekend.  This is one of the Jays that has started frequenting the bird table since putting out the homemade bread. They are normally really shy birds that can be heard more often than seen, so it's great seeing them land so close. The woodpecker hasn't taken too kindly to having such noisy visitors, but there's always food enough for them all at the feeding station.  And now, to bring your right up to date with how things are going here, I have the fire lit, the solar fairly lights have been charging in the window in preparation for decorating the big Christmas tree at Frugaldom and the house is feeling quite toasty, despite the howling winds and sooty flecks wafting around the living room after a huge back draught sent a cloud of smoke down the chimney when someone opened the back door while I was kindling the fire.  With winter on its way and all the trees from the new trees planted, I can now rummage through my wool stash and get to work on the next multi-coloured, knitted blanket. I looked out my big size 7.5 needles, cast on 40 stitches and have already begun knitting the rows that will create the first strip of blanket. They call it 'stocking stitch' but to me it s nothing more than plain knitting with zero complications. Sat in my chair by the fireside with the cat sprawled asleep by the hearth is actually rather festive, so I will probably start thinking about retrieving the tree from the cupboard at the top of the stairs and get that decorated next weekend. Hopefully, I'll also hear back from John the apple man, letting me know when the Galloway Pippin apple trees will be delivered for planting. For 2016, I plan to progress as usual with my various projects and challenges but have decided that the time has come to cut back on the hours spent working at earning a 'decent' living and more time spent working at making the most of what life has to offer - the wealth of friends, family, health and happiness. I'm also planning on getting back to regular blogging. Posted by NYK Media as part of the Frugal Blog"},
{"title": "More Tree Planting at Frugaldom", "date": "Saturday 21 November 2015", "text": "#Frugal Living #Eco Arts #Gardening #The Frugaldom Project In between the rain, the hail, the sleet and the snow, we finally got some blue sky and sunshine at Frugaldom, so it was all hands on deck to get more of our 'World War 1 Centenary Woodland' trees planted.  We set off for Frugaldom this morning armed with wellies, gloves, hats and scarves after waking up to a frozen wonderland. Ice was thick after yesterday's rain, hail, sleet and snow but the sun soon thawed the frosted grass while salt melted the ice on the caravan decking. The visitors arrived around 10.30am, so the junior members were wrapped up like it was the middle of winter. Easier to peel off a layer when it warms up than it is to warm up while not wearing enough layers!  We've had more than a few worrying nights with gales howling over the past few weeks so it was great getting back out to site and finding 'The Galloway' still standing, safe and well, keeping his eye on the distant snow-topped Galloway Hills. Now that everything is dying back we should be able to get a little nit more of the garden around him done. Several of our members have sent off for their free Corn Poppy seeds from The Woodland Trust, so I think some of these will be sown around the horse. His bloodline, after all, ran through many of the horses shipped overseas during the War.  A fine sprinkling of snow covering the hilltops on the horizon made for quite a few photo stops during today's planting, but it's such a great view and one that I hope will never change.  Littlest tree planter seemed to spend much of her time attempting to make new paths through the grass in an effort to find short-cuts between planting areas and the wheelbarrow that held the trees, canes and tree guards… Read full post here"},

Frugaldom was accepting onto this scheme last year, receiving our first tree pack for planting in November 2014. The planting is part of a nationwide project to plant millions of native trees throughout Britain and, thanks to generous funding from lead partners Sainsbury’s, IKEA FAMILY, players of People’s Postcode Lottery and Yorkshire Tea, the Woodland Trust is awarding the free tree packs to all those taking part in the planting.

How to make crab apple and rosehip jelly is a handy skill to have, especially as the recipe can be adapted into foraged or hedgerow jelly.  Mr Ecoarts has been hard at work getting 'The Galloway' reassembled and set into its permanent position at Frugaldom. Now, it takes pride of place, rearing from it's recycled tractor tyre plinth in the middle of the garden area, where we hope to incorporate some seating in the future, as part of our Garden of Gratitude project.  The Galloway is an almost forgotten breed of horse that once roamed the Galloway and Lowther hills. These little horses and ponies became world famous for their surefootedness, speed and endurance and through selective breeding to imported Arabian and Turkish warm-blooded horses, were eventually bred into extinction. However, their bloodline lives on - in almost every racehorse that wins on any race track almost anywhere in the world thanks to the great 'Eclipse'. Likewise with trotters, pacers and polo ponies, by way of the great Hambletonian. In fact, trace back any great horse pedigree and the chances are that you'll find a Lowther or Galloway name somewhere at the root of it, as these fabulous horses were bred to many of the royal mares that visited Britain during the 17th Century. Keeping with the Galloway theme, we are hoping to plant a small orchard of Galloway Pippin apple trees in the near future - finding a local supplier is proving to be quite a task, so please do get in contact if you know of anyone. In the meantime, we are harvesting a selection of crab apples, including the tiny but bountiful Siberian crabapples - they are smaller than many of the rose hips  HOW TO MAKE ROSE HIP AND APPLE JELLY I picked a couple of kilos of assorted crab apples and rose hips, which were all topped, tailed and thrown into a big pot with about a litre of water and left to simmer until all the fruit and berries were soft. You can do similar with most foraged fruit and berries for making hedgerow jellies and jams. Having stewed down the fruit, I strained it through a sieve lined with a piece of muslin - I didn't leave it dripping overnight, I just squeezed through the juices and ended up with 700ml of liquid, which I returned to the pan and added 500g of ordinary granulated sugar, stirred until it all dissolved and then brought it to a rolling boil, keeping it boiling vigorously for 10 minutes. I prepared 2 jam jars by scalding them in boiling water and tipped the jelly into the hot jars. This was enough for one large and one small jar of jelly from this amount and it set to a lovely consistency, ideal for serving as an accompaniment or even for spreading on toast.  The above has now been added to the stores of blackcurrant and other assorted fruit jams and jellies that have been made whenever fruit or berries are plentiful and sugar is relatively inexpensive. At 39p per kilo at the moment, I would call it downright cheap - a frugaler's dream and time to stock up in plentiful supplies wherever and whenever possible. As all good frugalers know - there is no sell by or best before date on sugar - if it's stored cool and dry, it can last a lifetime. Hope this helps someone and if anyone is within easy reach of Frugaldom, get in contact - we have plenty of crab apples and berries growing about the place.

{"title": "How to Make Hot Spicy Apple Sauce", "date": "Monday 12 October 2015", "text": "Latest frugal blog post from NYK Media in Frugaldom    #Frugal Living #Recipes #Foraging #Free Food #Food on a Budget How to Make Hot Spicy Apple Sauce Autumn sunshine, showers, wind and windfalls! Yes, frugal friends, it's that time of year again in our corner of Scotland - the time of apples, brambles, berries, chilli peppers and tomatoes! We don't have a heated greenhouse or polytunnel and winters can be long with summers short, but it shouldn't stop us eating seasonal produce.  The trees at both Frugaldom and Thrift Cottage are laden with apples, so these are being picked and shared with whoever wants them. At the moment, I'm processing about a bucket of apples each week, mostly stewing the fruit for freezing to use over the coming months as puddings and accompaniments. Apple crumble spiced with cinnamon is a hot favourite here and costs less to make than apple sponge. Indeed, crumble is just like crumbly sponge mix without the eggs, so it's ideal at this time of year when the hens and ducks slow down or stop  laying!  Having already stewed down the garden plums with raspberries and apples to turn into jam, I saved some of the juice to turn into jelly, so that was another few jars into the store cupboard. The addition of some lemon and the pectin from the apples ensures a good set.  HOW TO MAKE HOT, SPICY APPLE SAUCE After stewing apples, there's no point in wasting what's left over, so into the pot go all the peels, cores, lemon skins (I was given lemons by a neighbour to make her some lemon curd), two chopped chilli peppers and some cinnamon, just to spice things up a bit. Some people call this jam-making from leftovers 'compost jam' or jelly, if dripping it through the strainer, but this time I am making a sauce that can be used as a spread or a meal accompaniment. There's less waste in making sauce and what does get leftover can be composted. Having boiled down all the cores and peels, I press the softened 'pulp' through a sieve to create what looks like a runny apple sauce, then I stirred in approximately 500g sugar per 500ml of fruit pulp. A rapid, brief rolling boil (about 5 minutes) thickens it up without turning the mix into jam and then it can be decanted into warm, sterilised jars. I got 3 jars from my peels and cores this time and the sauce has a lovely hot kick to it that will be ideal either on hot toast or served alongside pork. Next time, I'll add some cloves to the mix before boiling it - you can easily experiment to discover which flavours you prefer. It's also fair to say that while cooking is going on, I don't need to turn on any heaters as the kitchen heat is sufficient. Better still is if I make the sauce over the logburner while it's stoked with foraged wood from Frugaldom - we have plenty of that lying about and are forever offering others the chance to collect some. This being Scotland, we aren't known for our prolonged hot weather and summer sunshine, so without an artificially heated greenhouse or polytunnel, the chances of growing a huge, perfect crop of anything that needs heat are somewhat limited. As usual, my tomatoes in the makeshift plastic greenhouse have grown in proliferation but are having to be picked green and ripened on the windowsills. The chilli pepper plants have survived their stint  outside on the caravan decking but these will be brought in very soon to try and over-winter them for another year. Not being a great fan of chutneys - they aren't frugal in the least when you can buy pickle for next to nothing - I prefer to use my tomatoes and chillies for making sauces, either chilli, Bolognese or curry. I find these much more versatile than having jars of chutney that few around me ever eat. That's been my past week here in Frugaldom - jam, jelly and crumble making. Today I have another batch of apples, more chilli peppers, tomatoes and a tub of blackberries to process so I'm thinking it's going to be chilli for dinner followed by an apple and blackberry crumble. It's probably just as well that the weather has taken another turn for the better to allow me out to work off all these extra calories! If anyone would like to join us in Frugaldom to sample this lifestyle, please get in contact. There are still plenty of blackberries, crab apples and rosehips ripe for picking so you could make it a fun foraging trip and take advantage of our Frugal Breaks, specially while the heated swimming pool is still open on the site nearby.

I found this lovely blog post while researching a bit more for ideas to use all the crab apples we have growing at the Frugaldom Project. If anyone would like to join us in our frugal corner of Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland for some crab apple picking, please get in contact as soon as possible. Crab Apples For Eating    Naturally, I was curious about this.  There is such an abundance of these neglected tiny fruits.  I can't say that I blame people, what a pain in the keester to pick a bushel of marble-sized produce.  However, we pick cherries, and wild plums, and raspberries... really we don't want to bother with the lowly crab apple. Still, they're generally ripe after the raspberries and before their larger and more noble relatives, the real apples.  There are a few inquisitive and determined souls out there like me that just may be enterprising enough to attempt a crab apple recipe.  I did this with rose hips last year and now it's a favorite!I haven't tried any of these yet, but I'm excited to begin a new food journey.

Crab Apple Liqueur From Recipe Secrets4 quarts crabapples, washed, cored and quartered 4 cups sugar 3 cups vodka Fill 1 (4-quart) mason jar with tight-fitting lid with prepared crabapples. Add the 4 cups of sugar and three cups of vodka. Store the jar on its side, turning once every day for 16 days to help the sugar to dissolve. After 16 days, filter out the fruit bits and bottle.  Cedar Waxwing on the Crab Apple, Sandra Cointreau Crab Apple Hot Pepper JellyFrom Recipe Secrets2 lbs crabapples 1 1/2 cups water red wine vinegar 3 3/4 cups granulated sugar 1 cup sweet green bell peppers 1/3 cup hot peppers (mix and match hot peppers for color and preferred degree of heat) In a Dutch oven, combine crabapples with water. Cover and bring slowly to simmer. Cook until crabapples are very soft. Pour into a colander lined with a square of dampened cheesecloth and placed over a deep bowl. Weight down with a saucer and heavy can. Let stand until dripping stops. Discard pulp. Pour collected juice into a liquid measure. Add enough vinegar to make 3 cups. Combine in a saucepan with sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add peppers, then boil briskly for 8 to 10 minutes or until set. Stir for 7 minutes to prevent floating peppers. Pour jelly into hot, sterilized 8-ounce canning jars. Seal with two-piece canning lids. Let cool, then refrigerate. For long-term unrefrigerated storage, process in boiling water bath for 5 minutes immediately after sealing jars. NOTE: To test for set, remove pan from heat. Dip a cold metal spoon into the liquid and hold well above the steam. Turn spoon sideways and let liquid run off. When it forms two drops that run together and drip from edge of spoon, jelling point has been reached.  Goldfinch in a Crab Apple Tree, Janet Zeh Crabapple SchnappsFrom Danish Schnapps recipesUse freshly picked and fully ripe crabapples. They are fully ripe when the pits have become dark brown.You can use almost any species - so start with your favourite one, then try some other species.However, Siberian Crabapple (Malus baccata)and also Chinese Apple (Malas prunifolia) are two species that are highly recommended.Direction:  Wash 10-20 crabapples and cut them in halves. Leave the skin on. Put them in a clean glass jar with tight-fitting lid. Cover with clear, unflavoured vodka - 40% alcohol content (80 proof). Let steep for 8-10 weeks or more - in a dark place at room temperature, 18-20°C (64-68°F). Shake lightly and taste it from time to time. Strain and filter your infusion into a clean glass bottle or jar with tight-fitting lid. Store (age) for a couple of months in a dark place at room temperature before serving. Note: If for some reason you are not satisfied with your infusion, there are ways to adjust both taste and flavours: Too strong-flavoured: If your infusion is too strong-flavoured and overwhelming you can just dilute it with the same kind of spirit you used as base. Allow to settle for a couple of days or more before serving. Taste it to find out. Too weak-flavoured: If your infusion is too weak-flavoured you can enhance the flavours by adding a little, little bit of sugar.  True Danish flavoured schnapps should not contain more than 10-15 grams sugar per liter. But of course, you can add as much as you want to suit your own taste.You can add the sugar directly, but because sugar is more soluble in water than in alcohol, it's usually better to make a simple sugar syrup......and add it to your infusion little by little. Allow to settle for a couple of days. Taste it again, it might need some more. Never use artificial sweeteners - NEVER! You will ruin the taste.Remember to keep your schnapps bottle tightly closed and in a dark place before and between servings.

More Than Today: Crab Apples For Eating I am sharing this lovely blog post for the benefit of everyone on the Frugal Forums who have found themselves in the fortunate position of having access to these tiny crab apples. If you live within easy reach of Frugaldom then please consider joining us on one of our crab apple picking days this month. If you live further afield, why not book a short break and join us for some holiday foraging? (See www.frugalbreaks.co.uk and ask about our frugalers’ discounts.)"},
{"title": "The Process of Frugalisation - part 1", "date": "Wednesday 7 October 2015", "text": "By NYK Media for Frugaldom  Frugalisation is the process of becoming truly frugal on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. It is about learning a new art form, possibly even a new way of life, and taking that forward so you can become a habitual frugal living aficionado.   This is no frills, text only reading for the seriously wannabe frugal living expert. It is is a fairly lengthy process, so requires several posts and an in-depth look at how the process of frugalisation can impact on so many lives. For some, it doesn't always paint a pretty picture so they give up too soon. Life isn't a bed of roses nor does money grown on trees - or does it? For the benefit of doubt, being frugal does not necessarily mean you are poor, deprived, underprivileged or subjecting yourself to some form of self-imposed poverty, it simply means that you have chosen not to be wasteful. For many, frugality usually occurs for long enough to help get them back on track, correcting failing finances, but for some it is a life-altering experience from which there is no return. We love it here in Frugaldom - it provides us with the freedom to be frugal and to enjoy work and home life exactly as we choose! Some people have austerity thrust upon them by circumstances beyond their control (illness, sudden loss of income etc.) and some find that a bit of thriftiness helps them to make ends meet in the household budget. For others, the act of frugal living provides an escape from a seemingly endless downward spiral into unsustainable debt.  Most people who cut back a bit on spending, bin less or look for bargains will class themselves as being frugal, with some seeing it as a temporary measure until the financial problems have been resolved, but that isn't really what I would call true frugality. The process of frugalisation is a lengthy one and it eventually becomes an entire lifestyle from which few true frugalers leave - regardless of how wealthy they may become over time. Should you find yourself in the unenviable position of being skint, having been struck down by poverty, homelessness, debilitating illness or even just spending more than you are earning, then urgent action is needed and that's where the first major choices need to be made: are you prepared to make personal sacrifices and have you got what it takes to make changes in the lives of those around you for whom you are responsible? We all need to start somewhere and I well remember coming through the process of frugalisation myself. I'm glad I did it and have no intentions of returning to where I once was. In the beginning, we all think we know what's best for us and how we spend our own money. We inadvertently fail to see the bigger picture where our actions and reactions impart on our fellow human beings - friends, family and hose around us. Our spending habits during our active lifetime are what make our futures secure or otherwise. Yes, luck can play its part - some win fortunes or land lucky deals but only the wise and the frugal hold onto their wealth and accumulate further financial security. As we all know, a fool and his money are soon parted. A prime example of when (or why) to start the frugalisation process is as you first realise that bills are mounting and income is stretched to the limit just covering all the out-goings. By the end of the month there may be no money left and then something like Christmas comes along, or a birth, death or marriage that can bring about unexpected costs. Into overdraft, catch up next month! Only problem is that the next month of catch-up never comes and the chore of earning sufficient income to maintain current standards begins to take its toll - anxiety, stress and more worry. As is so often the case, the result can be a further increase in spending in a bid to feel better and more in control, or else the inevitable drop in income when it all goes pear-shaped and we can't bring ourselves to face another day of the same grind. This is normal for many. Battle on, perhaps develop other interests in a vain attempt to avert attention from a personal crisis, but it seldom resolves the problem of going broke or becoming ill in the process. Frugal living - I need to make it sound like fun without the need for money. I wish I could, but during the initial stages of the process, it can become very difficult, upsetting and annoying. Everyone else seems to think they know better and suggests a million different ways of saving money. Yes, we get it, buying cheap brands costs less and growing your own fruit, vegetables and herbs saves buying them but get a grip, people, we all can't just traipse out into a fertile garden, scatter some seeds and suddenly grow our own food without incurring costs. It takes time and preparation - buying compost, pots and gardening implements is NOT frugal while you are fighting debts. Nor is getting a couple of hens for 'free eggs' or rushing out to buy all the kitchen accoutrements essential for making your own pies, jams, pickles and preserves. This is a step-by-step, penny-by-penny process that takes time, patience and basic arithmetic. A budget isn't what you think you may need it is exactly what you have to work with in the first place and every spend has to work into that figure.  Learning the difference between needs and wants is paramount to success - NO LUXURIES ALLOWED - these are a waste of money while it's in short supply. Once you are fully solvent you can reappraise your budget and your priorities list. We all need to eat and drink but we don't need fast food, takeaways, prime beef, exotic fruit and vegetables, alcohol or tobacco products. We don't need crisps, chocolate, sweets, cakes or biscuits. We don't need sugar-frosted breakfast cereals when porridge oats are 75p per kilo and our clothes don't need designer labels. We all like to give gifts but we don't need to spend money on them - you can spend time and effort, see how much others appreciate that! If they don't, then it's their problem, not yours. We can do this, it's easy... for as long as we stay away from the shops and cut ourselves off from civilisation! But that surely cannot be good, can it? No more nights out, no more entertaining, no more fripperies?  Save the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves. Waste not, want not.  A stitch in time saves nine. There are any number of thrifty and money saving anecdotes and all are true, but there is always a 'but'. Somewhere down the line, as you subject yourself to the trauma of constantly saying no to yourself and anyone who even suggests unnecessary spending, you will find yourself in the position of having to justify your non-spending. It happens often - even your closest friends and family can make the allegations of your being mean and tight-fisted. They don't understand your predicament, they may not want to understand it and some are offended by it - on the whole, they are mystified as to how you can say no and spend so little appear happy with your lifestyle. Some may even be jealous of your contented outlook, ability to control your own spending, pay off debts and increase your own financial security! Whatever way you discover this, be warned - you will find yourself doubting your own ways and means at some stage and you will ask yourself why you can’t just make this one exception to the rule and treat yourself to a, b or c. Stay strong, this is where you have the backup of fellow frugalers in the likes of the Frugal Forums or chat room – help or support is never far away in the land of Frugaldom.  This fabulously frugal new lifestyle, especially when your income is self-generated through hard work and commitment, isn't for everyone. There will be times when you will look at the way you are living through the eyes of others and waiver on the brink of temptation to abort your mission and go on a spending spree. 'Why not?' you will ask yourself - you worked for it and everyone else seems to manage to have fun, so why shouldn't you? Why shouldn't you treat yourself to something 'nice' or why shouldn't you go and do whatever others have tempted you into doing? Do not be swayed! Do not be led into temptation to break your non-spending rule before it has even become an established pattern in your newly chosen lifestyle. Yes, you do have the choice - it is yours to make, but the process of frugalisation has been broken at the point that you break that promise to yourself to stand firm against previous financial transgressions and put right mistakes from the past - even if you haven't accepted responsibility or apportioned blame elsewhere. Accepting that mistakes were made in the first place is definitely a sure fire sign that the frugalisation process is well underway. After such a trauma - come on, it's a bit of a shock actually looking at the bigger picture and realising what a fool you may have been with your money - the choice to proceed to habitualisation is yours and yours alone, otherwise you're just playing at being frugal until you get back on your feet and back onto the familiar old path of spending as you earn. In part 2, we'll look at how frugal you think you already are - then show you how non-frugal that really is. In the meantime, please feel free to join us in the Frugal Forums where we enjoy one another's online company during our mundane, day-to-day routines of not over-spending or wasting time, effort and money.

I can highly recommend the fabulously affordable and extremely comfortable accommodation as a rural getaway for anyone interested in the great outdoors, art, photography, writing and/or wildlife. Try one of Frugaldom's Frugal Breaks and sample the place for yourself.  Art in the making - the Frugaldom horse is really taking shape. As part of our Ecoarts project, this represents the 'Last of the Galloways' our native ponies that once grazed the hills and moors of Galloway and the surrounding areas before being spread throughout the British isles and bred out of existence.    Ecoarts at Frugaldom Reverse angle showing the sculpture still in the early stages. This sculpture is a life size portrayal of a native Galloway pony and will stand proud at Frugaldom one day soon.   Fruit, glorious fruit!  First of the plums and apples from the garden are simmering with some raspberries for the first of this year's mixed fruit jelly. What preserves are you planning this autumn?     This assortment of fruit was simmered in a little water until soft then the resulting juices strained through a sieve and made up to half a litre. I added 500g of sugar and boiled it for approximately 10 minutes until it reached setting point, then decanted it into a large, sterilised jar. Nothing else is added as the apples provide all the natural pectin needed. Some people add a slither of butter to help clarify the resulting jelly but this is not necessary. Please get in contact if you have any questions regarding Frugaldom, our frugal living and money challenges or our ecoarts project. This is an experimental blog post to test out the compatibility of Facebook with the option to blog from there via Windows Live while also offering us the chance to spread the frugal news further afield by way of sharing on social media. Hopefully, readers will be able to see the photos and link back to our Facebook page, bringing a little bit more interactivity during the early stages of developing the Frugaldom Project.

{"title": "Scotland's Secret South: Galloway Pippin Apples", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2015", "text": "Adapted and reproduced from a blog by Phillip Bruce Scotland's Secret South There is a corner of Scotland that is ignored by the crowds rushing up to Edinburgh, Loch Lomond and the Highlands. Those of us who live in Galloway hope they continue to do so, but there's a warm welcome for the discerning traveller. Galloway is in the Southwest of Scotland and can be found by turning left at Gretna and following the A75 to Stranraer. (Frugaldom is next to Three Lochs Holiday Park, Kirkcowan, where we can now offer Frugal Breaks.) Galloway's Gorgeous Apples  In 1267 a Dominican Friary was founded in Wigtown by the enormously wealthy Devorgilla, wife of John Balliol, after whom the Oxford college is named. The monastery was situated near to where the current Church of Scotland church stands, see picture. The monastery was closed during the Reformation and it is thought that some of the stones from its buildings were used in nearby buildings. The friars used to fish in Wigtown Bay and were known for their skills in the orchards where a delicious pippin apple was cultivated. There are few records of the monastery but the pilgrimage route to the ancient holy place of Whithorn passed close by and it is said that pilgrims were grateful to be given apples by the friars. Could some of the ancient rootstock be still hiding away somewhere around the former abbey's location? In the middle of the 19th century, apple enthusiasts recorded the discovery of the Galloway Pippin, which is probably the tree that was cultivated at Wigtown. This is said to be an attractive apple and several people in Wigtown have trees flourishing in their gardens.  A good book to read is “Apples in Scotland,” by John Butterworth, Langford Press, ISBN 1-904078-00-1 There is a picture of The Galloway Pippin on page 33 with the caption: “Ancient long-keeping cooker from Wigtown, known locally as 'Croft an Righ' (garden of the King). He writes on page 56: “Galloway Pippin' is a late cooker, eaten by some, which has been associated with the area around Wigtown in Galloway 'since time immemorial.' The local name 'Croft-an-Righ, is the same as the same name given by the Romans to the locality, and means 'garden of the king.' There is still a property in Wigtown with this name, with a tree of the same name! Not surprisingly, there are a number of good reports from this area. My inclined cordon has been excellent, and my young standard made a very promising start to cropping. I attribute the latter's development of canker to the fact that its branches were broken the ground trampled by cattle.” =================== At Frugaldom, we have a fruit-growing project that is set to incorporate a small orchard of Galloway Pippins. If you would like to help support this project, you can do so by sponsoring a tree.

{"title": "UK and Global Transporting Facts", "date": "Thursday 23 July 2015", "text": "By Julia Latham  When you examine the facts relating to transport from both the UK and globally, the results are staggering! Can you believe that hundreds of millions of miles are travelled by cars around the world and tens of millions by trucks? That is a significant amount of mileage and it makes you realise why it’s important to be as fuel efficient as possible. It becomes even more crucial when you realise that 13% of global carbon dioxide comes from transport. Of that carbon dioxide, 57% is created by cars and 23% by trucks, with the rest divided amongst other vehicles. We always hear about lowering our carbon footprint but it’s only when you see the figures in real terms that you realise how each of as individuals can make a difference. Fuel Efficiency We can all take simple steps to make our cars and trucks, especially if we drive for a living, more fuel efficient. Carrying out regular maintenance on our vehicles, reducing drag and changing how we drive, for example by accelerating and braking less harshly, can all make a difference. Millions of litres of fuel are consumed by cars and trucks to keep them on the roads. Think how much further those vehicles would have been able to travel if every litre was used as efficiently as possible? Aeroplanes are also fuel thirsty, but best to leave it to the aviation authorities to decide whether that fuel could be more used more efficiently. Bringing Us What We Need Much of the fuel that has been expended by aeroplanes, trucks and ships has been used to bring us all the items we take for granted. The amount of freight tonnage, which comes through our docks and airports every year, is astronomical and that freight is then loaded on to trucks and carried along our roads. No wonder many have gone back to buying more locally in order to help preserve these precious fuel resources. However, the flip side of this coin is that exports, imports and logistics contribute a great deal to the economy. Jobs are created, profit is made by businesses and this, of course, has a positive impact on GDP. Maybe the lesson is just to make every mile, whether by air, road or sea, as efficient as possible and with new technologies it makes this efficiency ever more possible. Keeping It on the Road Spare a thought, too, for those truckers who have to keep everything moving along smoothly. There are over 5.7 million truck drivers around the world and with an average salary of a driver in the UK at around twenty-four and a half thousand pounds a year they have to travel many miles for that money. Trucking jobs are a vital part of the logistics train but they also often take drivers far away from their families for extended periods and it can be a tiring job when you spend many hours on the road. Driving a truck is also a highly skilled job. The average length of a truck is 53 feet and weighs 44,000 kg. Could you imagine manoeuvring that along windy country lanes, through busy town centres and under low bridges, let alone having to reverse it around a tight corner? It’s certainly a job that deserves our admiration and appreciation for keeping everything circulating around the world. This has just been a brief glance at the incredible transport logistics of which many are usually unaware. Even more amazing is that these figures rise dramatically every day. Why not work out how much fuel you estimate you consume in a year and then let’s all work together to lower our carbon footprints as a global community?

{"title": "Frugaldom in June", "date": "Wednesday 10 June 2015", "text": "Glorious sunshine has burst through at Frugaldom, so it's back to work on the land project - in between dog walking, lemon curd making and spending some cash free, prime fitness time making the most of the swimming pool here on site.  Around the Frugaldom micro-ranch, the gardening has already ground to a halt. Having the bird feeding station and a nest box fitted has generated some excellent photo opportunities, especially with the woodpeckers visiting many times each day.  At ground level, however, our little furry friends are having a ball. Not all of them are staying at ground level, either. First it was the rabbits digging up the rosemary and the birds pecking the strawberry plants, then it was the field mice running up the dry stone wall to help themselves to the bird food and now I have an owl visiting every night, obviously thinking the mice are for supper snacks!  Today I took the neighbour's two little dogs with me to Frugaldom, so the conversation was a bit one-sided during the walk there and back. They were very well behaved and sat watching as I dug and prepared the first of the beds in the garden of gratitude - this explains the furry tail-end that got into the photograph!  This is the current view from the garden of gratitude when looking towards the Forest but this vista will change as time progresses. The wood will be harvested and new trees planted and to the forefront, we still have to lay out the rest of the garden. Future plans for this include seating and possibly a picnic bench, as it will all form part of the eventual walk.  As you can see, the Frugaldom Project is beginning to come alive now that the flowers are coming into bloom, trees leafing up and grasses growing. Just out of shot in the above photo will be the first of the ecoart displays, where the barn owl swoops to land on a nearby tree stump. The sculpture is well underway and definitely taking shape, so we are hoping it will be completed and in place later this month.  There is so much to do out at the project that it's difficult to know where to start next. I am always on the look-out for willing helpers and accommodation can be arranged for willing volunteers. There are camping facilities nearby, as well as various other options, so don't be shy, give frugal living a try.

{"title": "How to decorate your small living space to look bigger", "date": "Monday 8 June 2015", "text": "If you are living in a small house or cottage, apartment, lodge, or caravan, there is plenty you can do to make your living space look and feel bigger. Ambitious plans include removing or altering the position of a wall or screen, adding larger windows, glass or panel doors instead of solid doors, or building a separate level or platform for a bedroom or office. Major changes such as these will need professional advice and planning, but some simple decorating and home furnishing tips can also help, without any major expense or upheaval. Decorate in neutral colours and think about creating clean straight lines in plain designs. Heavy, dark or floral wallpaper will make a room feel smaller. Wooden flooring creates a feeling of space and is more practical to clean than light coloured carpet. Then, add a few carefully selected items in a strong, bright or bold colour to accent the neutral decor, such as cushions, a throw, or a vase. This will add taste and personality to the room without overdoing it. Try to keep surfaces clear, with only the minimum amount of ornaments. Hang a couple of your favourite pictures or photos if you want to, but be ruthless or the result will be cluttered and will make the room look smaller. Choose furniture for your home that doubles up as storage; for example, an ottoman or laundry basket that can be used as seating, a stool for a nightstand, a sofa bed, futon or loft bed that can be used during the day, a nightstand with drawers or a unit that can be used as a mini-desk or bureau.  If space beside the bed is tight, hang a shelf instead, and use ceiling lights, wall lights, or sconces instead of table lamps. Store clothes and shoes out of sight in floor-to-ceiling wardrobes or cupboards so as not to waste space. Use any space underneath beds for storage; storage baskets or cubes for smaller or less-used items are ideal to keep everything tidy and organised. Hang a floor to ceiling mirror. Open up windows by removing heavy curtains and install wooden shutters to maximise the light coming into the room. In the living area, choose an extending or drop leaf table, a nest of tables and chairs or stools that can be stacked or stored away in a cupboard. If possible, choose bespoke furniture that uses every bit of available space effectively; opt for built-in book shelves that fit into an alcove or small space.  Hang a mirror opposite a window to reflect the light, and look for clever artwork that creates an illusion of space – for example a tunnel effect or a forest scene. A wall-mounted television and a laptop or tablet instead of a PC will help to free up space and reduce clutter. In the kitchen, reflective, light or white surfaces and cupboard fronts, as well as under cupboard lighting, will help the area to feel larger. Give some thought as to how you can maximise the space that you have. By decorating in light colours, removing clutter, and making good use of every bit of room that you have, you can maximise your living area extremely effectively.

Insulation, double glazing, smart appliances and simply knowing when to put on a jumper can all help. But how is it that some people manage to pay nothing at all? Is it really possible, in an ordinary home, to generate directly and sustainably all of the energy you need? You might be surprised. A new generation of homes Finding homes with this kind of potential is getting easier than ever as construction and development companies have cottoned on to the fact that there’s a big market for eco-friendly properties – and some, of course, share that wish to do the right thing as far as the environment is concerned. M1 Group, for instance, now routinely put eco-friendly systems in their new build properties, giving them added market appeal at the same time as standing by the principles of sustainability that have always influenced their way of doing business.  Solar power Many people assume that there’s no point in fitting solar panels if they live in northern climes, but with the new generation of solar materials now available, that’s no longer the case. Even when the days are short and there’s a lot of cloud, a single solar panel is often sufficient to create all the hot water an average family needs. This new technology is also a lot cheaper than the old technology because economies of scale have come into operation as more and more people have concluded that solar energy is the right choice for them.  Wind power You will need planning permission to install a wind turbine, but you can now buy good rooftop models for just a few hundred pounds, and if they’re well positioned – so as to get plenty of wind – they can generate impressive amounts of electricity. They’re ideal for remote locations where there are no neighbours to annoy and few other buildings blocking the flow of the wind. In places such as this, versions with masts can also be a practical option and are often more productive.  Water power For people fortunate enough to live near a waterway, small-scale hydroelectricity generation can also be an option. People have been using waterwheels for thousands of years, but modern hydropower systems are highly efficient and can produce electricity for all your household needs. You will need to get a professional assessment to find out if it’s a practical solution for you. Energy generation systems such as these can provide all the power that’s needed for some homes. They can also be used in combination. In some cases, the results are so impressive that householders can not only provide for their own needs but also sell electricity back to the grid. This means they make a bit of money, and a larger proportion of the overall energy used in the country comes from renewables, helping to reduce everybody’s carbon footprint. It’s a win-win situation. ============= Following on from our discussion in the NYK chat room regarding frugal entrepreneurs and long term investments, making the right choices at anytime can reap real rewards, in both money and self-sustainability terms. Frugaldom has vast potential for development of more eco-friendly projects than you can shake a stick at - and let's face it, we have plenty of those lying around the place. So what would you choose for your ideal self-sustainable, eco-friendly home? I know Frugaldom isn't home, but with today's technology, almost anywhere in the world has the potential to become self-sustainable on or off the grid, even Scotland could balance the energy books with the right mix of solar, wind and hydro, although we do seem to get more wind and rain than sun most years.

{"title": "Moneysaving Mayhem", "date": "Wednesday 20 May 2015", "text": "May has been a busy money-saving month of mayhem, so far, but we have managed to complete the barn painting and have another corral, or small paddock, fenced, planted the last of this year's trees, sown seeds and I set up a makeshift wild bird feeding station outside the caravan, where the resident woodpecker is now visiting several times each day. That's my frugal entertainment. Life on site in a mobile home is great!  I'm going to begin this latest post with a quote from John Irving that definitely reflects the mood of the day. The photo is one I took of the nearby loch when it was perfectly calm and reflective. I think some of my long-standing friends and family are wondering if I have taken up permanent residence in the mobile home, now known as my micro-ranch. Yes, it's a far cry from a sandstone cottage, but it most definitely has everything I need and greatly increases the time I can spend working on the Frugaldom Project whenever the weather permits. The field is a mere half mile from here. What isn't there to like? I have luxuries here that aren't available at the house, such as Sky TV, an indoor heated swimming pool, golf, fishing, site shop, various free to attend social activities and all are included within the annual site rental fees that equate to about £40 per week, including WiFi, water and TV. (Swimming, fishing and golf are included in that price.)  The site is not a year-round residential site, but I can spend 11 months of the year here, leaving February as the month for catching up elsewhere, visiting friends and family or getting jobs done elsewhere. With the spare room and living room bed settee here, I can have friends and family to stay anytime, providing a frugal holiday option for many and also less travelling for those coming to help out at Frugaldom. The site has facilities for campervans, tourers and tents as well as renting out chalets, but I think the majority of the caravans may be privately owned holiday homes. To be absolutely honest, I haven't a clue why we didn't look at this option instead of renting an assortment of houses over a 10-year period while saving to buy! It could have saved thousands of pounds! I think I've spent more money moving house over the past 15 years than it costs to buy a decent ex-rental or secondhand mobile home on this site! I'm not being paid to say this, but if I could find frugalers to buy the two plots and 'vans next to me, we could have a great little frugal community going here - I could even provide allotment-style gardens at Frugaldom for food growing.  Right now, I have a hand wash drying outdoors, pegged to the airer, and a tray of raspberry muffins baking in the oven, alongside quiche. It's taking time to accustom myself to a full size gas oven after using the microwave and mini oven for so long, but I've managed not to burn anything beyond use. There's also the fact that the cooker doubles as heating in the open plan layout of the caravan. I'm a few items short in the kitchen department, but am managing fine without having to buy anything else. My total spends have amounted to £4 for a plastic wash basin and a cheap frying pan. My latest frugal visitor was able to provide me with … Continued here"},

{"title": "Scottish Multimedia | How to Heat a Caravan", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2015", "text": "It's been just over two weeks since moving into the Frugaldom home-from-home 'ranch' and true to fashion, the good ole Scottish weather has thrown everything at us, from heat wave to snow storms; it has been an interesting learning curve trying to maintain a good balanced temperature in a caravan, that's for sure.  The caravan is a static sited on the holiday park next to Frugaldom. As it will be home for most of the year, getting to grips with heating it (and cooling it) will take time. Again, this is something we have saved for, so site fees are paid in advance and it's up to us to budget the running costs for gas and electricity. We've also chosen to invest in having wooden decking built and they managed to almost complete this while the weather was in a transitional stage between heat wave and yesterday afternoon's snowy blizzard! The morning started out at -3C and white with frost, followed by glorious sunshine and then things went rapidly downhill after that.  Today, the weather has been awful, ranging from bitterly cold to driving rain, sleet and hailstones bouncing. Staying indoors seemed like a good idea, so I cranked up the gas fire for a while and wrapped up in about 5 layers of clothing. The caravan has one small panel heater with towel rail in the shower room, eco-warm air skirting heaters (350w) in the bedrooms and a gas fire in the main living area, so I have added an extra layer over the mattress plus an electric blanket and my hand-knitted blanket over the top of the duvet on the bed.I also have fleece pyjamas, bed socks and a fleecy sleeved blanket. It isn't a glamorous site to behold but it allows me to switch off the bedroom heater through the night and switch it back on when I waken. The 450w thermostatic oil-filled radiator is left on in the main living area on a low setting and the bathroom panel heater is on overnight. Curtains need to be shut before dark to help retain some heat and then they get opened first thing, as the sun rises and hits the windows. So far, so good. I plan on getting a curtain hung up to separate the living area and kitchen, just to cut down on the open plan expanse at nights. I have been reading the electricity meter as I would normally do at the house, so I can easily keep tabs on how much is being used and set aside the necessary funds for the bi-annual bill. I haven't been here long enough to estimate weekly averages. Cooking is with a standard size cooker running off gas cylinders, so I have no idea how long these will last. They also run the living room fire and heat the water on demand via boiler - same goes for the shower. I have my slow cooker and my breadmaker and both have been in full use.  Today I made a loaf of bread, baked a tray of oat and sultana cookies while cooking dinner in the oven and used up some bacon that son legt when he was visiting for the weekend. (The bacon bits got added to carrot and lentil soup.)  I haven't spent anything on kitting out the caravan, so I am cooking with my camping equipment for now. I'll get one of those supermarket £3 frying pans next week, along with a £1 plastic basin for the sink. Other than that, I think I can manage with what I have. Not much outside work got done today, but I did go a walk out to the field just to check on the latest plantings - a rosemary hedge, two strawberry beds and a small copse of oak trees.  View of the Frugaldom barn with the snow-peaked Galloway Hills in the background. As you can see, we still haven't managed to get the back of the barn painted but we have two sides done now.  I got caught in one light flurry of hail that moved over quickly in the direction of the hills but despite how grey everything is, you can see hints of green… read more HERE"},
{"title": "Frugal Living and the Frugaldom Project", "date": "Friday 24 April 2015", "text": "Can you believe that I've been here for a fortnight, already? I'm well settled into the new home from home and finding it an extremely rewarding way to live, following work by the weather - outside when dry, inside when wet - it's the best of both worlds, even when the mundane stuff like accounts, website admin and other work needs to be done. I am having the weekend off to make time for family visits, as the newest member of the family arrived on the 15th. My little ranch hand has already had his first visit to Frugaldom at the grand old age of one week! (Got to start them young so they learn to appreciate the land.) I also need to catch up with housework and paperwork. So far, at Frugaldom, I have managed to build 3 small fruit/veg beds - one for blackcurrants, the other two have strawberries planted in them for now. These are being made by loosely following instructions on a permaculture site, so they are truly recycled using old cardboard boxes, rotting wood, moss, composted woodchips and some soil/compost mix. It will all be slightly acidic as this was forestry at one point, hence the peaty soil, so I'm only planting things that can tolerate low pH conditions. I’ve got about 25 small strawberry plants so far and the same again still waiting to be planted. All of these were runners I potted on from last year’s plants, so free to me.I have sown many seeds, including all the GrowWildUK Scottish wildflowers, Woodland Trust poppies and some very old Californian Poppy seeds that a fellow frugaler sent to see if they were still viable, It will be interesting to watch for them germinating over the next year or two!H was here today helping out and managed to get another part of the barn painted - we still don't have big ladders to do the higher parts but I've spotted someone nearby who has a set, so will ask them nicely if we can borrow them. I'll need to rely on someone else to climb the ladders as my old knees/hips/back won't permit. The swallows are back swooping about and inspecting last year's nest, so I suspect they will soon be back in residence, around the corner from the bats. There are loads of frogs, toads, lizards, hairy caterpillars, butterflies, bees and voles about the place, but I've yet to catch sight of anything bigger. The cuckoos are very vocal in the nearby forest and there was a woodpecker down in the trees by the caravan this afternoon. I was also hearing of a close encounter with a barn owl and then we also have the red kite, white tailed sea eagle and plenty of buzzards in this area. After a short delay, the tractor is being brought back on site tomorrow ready for the fencer to make a start on Sunday, so I'll probably end up back out at HQ on Sunday afternoon for a few hours - no rest for the wicked! It is great to think that corral #2 could be completed by early next week. I have already planted the rowans, silver birch and willow between the two and have surrounded the adjoining areas with grey willow, wild cherry and crab apple trees.  With any luck, I may also see the arrival of someone to build my caravan decking very soon!The Frugaldom home-from-home and Thrift Cottage combined weekly food bills currently average £6.33 per person and are based strictly on zero food waste, batch cooking, baking and plenty of eggs laid by our own hens and ducks. Since arriving on site, I have spent the grand total of £2.40 and am still pursuing my goal to bring the joint-household grocery bills down to £5 per person per week – you can see how that and other challenges are coming along in www.Frugalforums.co.uk The fine weather has now come to an end but the rain was badly needed. Having planted no fewer than 300 trees over the past week or so, the wild cherry and field maples in the dry areas were getting to the stage of really needing a good soaking and I didn’t relish the thought of going round the project with 180 buckets of water! I should soon be able to make a start on the mini-kitchen garden outside the caravan but will spend a couple of hours this weekend in the greenhouse at home, sorting out stuff there that needs to come here.Don’t forget, if you’re in the neighbourhood, join us free as a member of the Frugaldom forums and find out how you can become a part of our woodland and market garden project.NYK in Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Living, Frugal Working", "date": "Thursday 16 April 2015", "text": "After an abysmal start to the day the sun eventually broke through the clouds by around noon and then it shone the rest of the day. In fact, it was jackets off, sleeves up and sun cream needed by mid-afternoon and then a slow walk home, taking photos along the way.  This is a quick photo blog of how yesterday went. I had a meeting on site at lunchtime, so I was pleased the rain had stopped by then. Corral 2 has been properly measured and all the remaining blackcurrant cuttings have been planted among the edible hedging. I think I planted 110, possibly more, blackcurrant cuttings among the sloes, elders, raspberries and blackberries.  It's quite difficult to see all the new trees and fruit bushes but you can just make out the plastic spirals - the edible hedge has now been planted around two sides of the barn. Left of this photo is the Buddleia, which will need cutting right back at the end of this year.  Does this count as biomass, I wonder? Since having the corral properly fenced, the logs have all had to be moved again so we really do need to look at getting them cut up and used in other ways - likewise with the pile of branches and twigs behind them. We've been using that as kindling for the camp stove but it could take a while to use it up at that rate.  The temporary path leading to what will be the willow walk is still in place and now needs to be kept under control until such times as it can be properly developed. Judging by the tracks, the deer seem to like it.  I dragged a few bits of log from the pile and have started marking out a flower bed in the wild garden. There is so much to do and I know exactly what I want at the end of it all but it has to fit with the lie of the land as it was when we bought it, so this fits nicely into the plan.  The area behind corral 1 is where the first of the vegetable beds will be going. It's quite well drained but will take a lot of work to get the beds built and filled, then they all need protected from the wildlife. We don't want the deer or the rabbits grazing on anything.

Last night the caravan got a good clean outside, compliments of the site, so I think that's what impressed the rabbit most - he'd simply come for a closer look as the shiny metallic box cage containing a human being.      After sitting looking at me for a bit, it decided that the hole under the decking of neighbour's caravan was much more interesting and eventually disappeared through the hatch and out of sight. That explains why the little black cat likes going under there - it's meeting up with the rabbits. I wonder if there are any bunnies underneath this caravan? Maybe one night during the better weather I'll set up the trail cam and see if anything triggers it. Worth thinking about before I set to work on my new kitchen garden!

{"title": "Frugal Living from Scratch 2", "date": "Tuesday 14 April 2015", "text": "Part 2 of 2: Getting right back to basics - Each step forward can be seen as another step back towards the starting line. Each tiny achievement marks the successful completion of part of your lifelong challenge, your quest for freedom. Along the way you will meet many sceptics, cynics and even a few cheats and liars whose only ploys are to get your money. As long as you have your 'get out of jail free' card then you know you'll be back in the game soon.  So here I am, sat in my latest home, looking out the window at a pretty grey and wet day with 'pretty' being the most important word in that sentence. The curtains are quite awful, but that's an easily remedied problem once I get around to making some new ones. Perhaps I'll add a pelmet or even some nets, who knows? I haven't decided yet. For now, the curtains serve the purpose of shutting out some of the cold at night.  Most of my days will now be spent between here and Frugaldom, planting and sowing, clearing and cleaning, plotting and planning and wading through all the meetings that these projects seem to involve. The site where we have the caravan is quite busy with fishermen, so I'm managing to hog the satellite wifi connection very easily from my makeshift office corner. It has great views and has all the facilities I could possibly need.  Buying a bigger caravan and siting in on a holiday park may seem like a major luxury to some - indeed, it has already been commented upon! However, this suits our needs and was within a strict budget. Now my new neighbours will know who and where I am, as this lot's sitting outside the caravan waiting to be built into the new decking. I can't wait to see it completed and then I'll be ready for welcoming visitors. I'm using this week as a trial run to work out what is needed, having come here on Friday with only the barest essentials. There's hot water and a heated towel rail, hand washing items of clothing isn't a problem. (Neighbours, if you happen to be reading this, come and introduce yourselves. Just make sure you get the right caravan, as I see several had decking delivered this week.)  This is frugal living! The little fridge is rather bare but I've cooked up some pasta salad, made some fruit jelly and strawberrry whip for desserts and will waste nothing - anything else is from a packet and most of it is vegetarian until I get the groceries brought over from the house. Meals are interesting! I had a box of individual milk portions at the office caravan that came free with an Approved Food order some time ago, so I decanted all of their contents into a jug and used it to bake some rice pudding with sultanas. Had some for lunch today and can have the rest as breakfast, snacks or pudding tomorrow.  Each of the tiny milk cartons has been washed and will be used to plant a single pea, so I can have some home produce. No point wasting good cartons when they can be put to good use. This is frugal living - waste not, want not. We'll grow what we can wherever we can and hope to have enough produce to swap and share. It's just a little chilly out to expect miracles at the moment.  This is my frugal life! The view of our barn dwarfed by the snowy Galloway Hills on the horizon is an awesome reminder of how small we all are in the grand scale of life. Only we can choose how we live and if we choose to live in a simple way then so be it. We don't own the land even when we buy it, the land ultimately owns us and will dictate what grows where, no matter what. Frugaldom is very much about watching the lie of the land and working out what might do best where and when in the future. Some people choose to spend their money on a big house, expensive jewellery, a luxury car, designer labels or visiting foreign and exotic places - we choose this.  Tree planting on a chilly but sunny day, overlooked by hills and snow, with the sheer joy of this being no more than a short walk from home - for some it is a nightmare they would never want to have but for others, it's their lives' work, investing in a better future.  Just to make sure we truly appreciated these days of walking, fetching, carrying, digging and tree planting, we were honoured by the presence of this beautiful bird in flight as it soared above us on our walk between field and caravan - the Red Kite has reached Frugaldom. Believe it or not, in the beginning it is quite difficult to stop spending money when you're on a roll - no matter what you buy, it becomes a habit, just like smoking, drinking, gambling, even clothes, shoes, handbags or hobby stuff. We each justify our spending but any manner of excuses but we are wise to remember that the ends justify the means - and I'd rather end up with the freedom to soar wherever frugal life takes me. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that, but taking your first flight of fancy into your own future of freedom is like starting from scratch over and over again. You just need to quit spending on stuff that weighs you down, then spread your wings and work like crazy to reach each goal. Join us in Frugaldom, give up spending on what you don't need and shape yourself a new and affordable lifestyle while you invest in your future. Frugal Living from Scratch 2  Part 1 of 2: Getting right back to basics - this blog is about frugal living in a way that affords you a simple life of freedom from debts and the luxury to choose how and when you earn and spend your own money. You aren't completely free until every penny is your own. A complete, photo free 'rantathon' to get the penny rolling. Let's get one thing straight - you don't own your own home if you have a mortgage, just as you don't own your own car if it was 'bought' on finance. It simply means you have borrowed these goods and made a personal pledge to pay over the odds for them while you use them and continue to pay over the odds for them even if you don't. It is a contractual obligation which is meant to keep you making payments that, in turn, bind you to earning whatever amount of money is needed to service the debts and live your life - whatever that may be. Likewise with everything you have in your possession - it isn't your own until you have zero debt and are no longer making payments of any description. It always baffles me how some folks can't see a mortgage as debt. The battle cry I hear most often is that I (me, myself, I) cannot be frugal if I can afford to make major purchases for cash. Well, folks, it is by being frugal that we can afford such things in life and they are not so major when you look at the whole picture. I would go as far as declare myself a frugal living expert, having trained in the art for decades, learning by experience and honing my skills. Over and over again, I have show what does and does not work for me. Getting a 9 to 5 dead-end job and living in fear of interest rate or rent increases just doesn't cut it for me and I fail to understand why anyone in their right mind would want to torture themselves enduring that for fifty years of their life only to retire with nothing. Kudos to those of you who enjoy or endure that lifestyle, it's just not for me. I'm neither lucky nor privileged, I simply made a choice in my own life and stuck with it. Absolute essentials, in my opinion, are shelter, suitable clothing and good basic nutrition that contributes towards your overall wellbeing. If you can get to a point that you can meet these needs with enough of your income left over to service all your debts, you have succeeded in the first step. The next step is to cut out absolutely everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that you really don't need and start saving to invest in your own future. Some really tough choices need to be made - if you can't afford a car but really need one for work, can you relocate then  walk or cycle? Failing that, can you change jobs to one within walking or cycling distance? I don't really understand sentimentality towards bricks and mortar, it's a stupid concept to me. Yes, by all means love your home, but if it's just a millstone around your neck filled with memories, pack up those memories and take them with you to some place you can afford to relax indefinitely without checking your bank balance every other week. Why worry about what others think of you? Something like that is learned behaviour and is a rather evil trait to instil in any child, in my opinion. It's also one that is really difficult to free yourself from, but it is worth it in the end. Learning one's own worth based on non-monetary values is far more revealing than finances and fripperies. Very little money is needed to live my chosen lifestyle. For me, understanding how anyone ends up in debt when earning what I'd consider a small fortune is intriguing, despite having seen the facts and figures for myself. There really is nobody to blame but the individuals who got there in the first place and more shame them if they choose to ignore it or, worse still, pass on that burden to others. This blog isn't about becoming a superstar, a guru or a celebrity, it's about sharing my own journey to freedom. Knowing where you want to be is the difficult part but once you have established that, everything becomes so much clearer and easier. It's all down to budgeting - knowing exactly what you need every penny to do and making it happen, come what may. Home is where the heart is and the heart shouldn't give a stuff what friends, relatives or neighbours think. It may be a glorified shed, a caravan, a bed-sit, a tumbledown cottage, a boat or even an underground bunker conversion! For some obscure reason, people attribute worth and status to bricks and mortar, but that's not for the frugalers starting from scratch. Financial riches may come later, but in the beginning, you need to liquidate everything and clear your minds, your schedules and your debts so you can begin again, frugal living from scratch. There are always excuses for why this 'can't' be done - but I'm telling you it can, even if it means finding someone with a spare room to rent while you work several crappy jobs and save your way out of the red and into the black. Room renting isn't ideal for families, I can appreciate that, but it isn't impossible if it gives you a base from which to establish your plan. Being free to control the vision of your own destiny is paramount to success but I would always recommend seeing much further beyond that, to the next challenge. Frugal living is a skill that absolutely anyone can afford to master - it cannot be bought, it has to be lived! How long have you gone without buying a non-essential in an effort to pay every extra penny into the debt pot or savings plan? NYK in Frugaldom Frugal Living from Scratch"},
{"title": "Life on the Cheap in a Small Space", "date": "Thursday 9 April 2015", "text": "Cheap and cheerful living in small spaces is what many aspire to, which is quite amazing considering what's available to buy nowadays. But for frugal living, we want fun and affordable homes, like tiny houses, cabins or even caravans, camper vans or tents. Well, tomorrow is a big day for me, as I downsize to frugal summer quarters.  As the above sign clearly says, it's only a small drive to paradise, or in our case a walk or a cycle, so bring your bikes or walking boots as well as your gloves and welly boots if you are planning a trip to help out on the 'range' that is now known as Frugaldom.  This will be basecamp for the foreseeable future! It's a good bit smaller than Thrift Cottage and under 385sq feet, so I am hoping that it will prove to be a comfortable and affordable choice, not withstanding the additional benefits of it being so handy for Frugaldom. It basically means falling out of bed and walking to work in the great outdoors. Hopefully, there will be a deck built before this month ends.  This is the view of what lies between here and there (Frugaldom) with the little patch of grass in front of the wall ear-marked to become a micro kitchen herb garden. I may even enter the site competition for best garden plot in 2015!  This is the view from the door, looking in the direction of one of the three lochs after which the site is named. From tomorrow, this is Frugaldom home-from-home. Don't worry, there's still plenty of space for Frugaldom friends and relatives visiting and I should be able to pick up the site WiFi, so I can keep you all up to date with progress and arrange your visits. Apart from that, you should be able to get me on my mobile. (Retro, I'll text you as soon as I get there to check.)  Finally, here is the main garden and work space - from the opposite side of the river and all around the big garden shed, which is actually a rather large barn. (The corrals, new woodlands, quarry and orchard are all beyond the barn.) As you can see, my outdoor space far, far exceeds my indoor space but this is yet another aspect of the kind of frugality many have when aiming for money saving, lifetime goals. The cost of living in a mobile home can make it a very attractive prospect, even if you choose to pay extra for the luxury of having it on a fully serviced plot with access to on site facilities, but these are all things I'll be blogging about just as soon as I get everything organised. Moving this close to Frugaldom is one more step closer to fulfilling the dream of creating a woodland wilderness, living off the land and communing with nature. These things can easily be entwined with small space living and modern luxuries. Now to make it all affordable and learn the ropes of cooking with gas. It's a great big adventure ready to happen and I have slashed my budget accordingly. All going to plan, I should be able to update tomorrow, when I'll be starting a brand new food store, meal planning, scheduling and getting to grips with the cost of mobile home living. I'm thinking of it as an extended vacation! Join www.frugalforums.co.uk for all the updates and I'll see you in Frugaldom soon. Scottish Multimedia | Life on the Cheap in a Smaller Space"},
{"title": "Cheap Meals from Eggs and Leftovers", "date": "Tuesday 7 April 2015", "text": "Continuing with my challenge to slash the weekly grocery bill to an average £5 per person, I decided to adapt a very simple recipe for potato cakes. It's very similar to making fish cakes, except I didn't have leftover potatoes and fish, I had leftover potatoes and the bacon bits from making a pot of ham and lentil soup. I had considered making a ham quiche, as the ducks are laying eggs every day and these need to be used. Despite giving many to friends & neighbours, we still have more than enough for the household. Adding potatoes to pastry, however, seemed a bit too starchy and stodgy; I do want to fit into a swimsuit at some time during this summer, especially when there's an indoor heated pool within walking distance of the new home-from-home at Frugaldom!  But I digress... With the potatoes, I'd cooked enough to do two meals then ended up making a Bolognese sauce and lasagne with the extra mince. I had also made a big pan of ham and lentil soup in the slow cooker, so had the cooked bacon bits still to use. (Some were added to cheese and ham pasta, but that still left quite a bit, so I'd to freeze the remainder of the bacon until needed.) INGREDIENTS  Boiled potatoes - chopped/mashed  Cooked bacon bits - chopped  Onion - diced  Salt & pepper  Self-raising flour  Eggs I had about a mugful of chopped potatoes and the same in bacon bits, so I added a large serving spoonful of flour and 2 duck eggs, then mixed it all together. (If it looks too sloppy, add more flour, too dry, add a little water or even another egg, if you need to use them up quickly.)  The mix doesn't look all that appetising at this stage but these taste great once cooked as cakes. You could add any type of meat or vegetable leftovers; I have tried tuna and sweetcorn, corned beef and beans, cheese, onion and ham, mixed vegetables (no meat) and mince with carrots and onion. Frugal brunch cakes are a meal in themselves, depending on what's added. Otherwise, they are simply potato cakes.  Once mixed, scoop out a heaped tablespoonful per cake and place in a hot frying pan. I'm using vegetable oil but this is through choice and availability. I'd normally use this or lard for frying savoury foods. The cakes should sizzle as soon as you put them in the hot pan.  Press each of the brunch cakes down to begin forming a flat, burger-like shape, so they cook evenly. Once they cook on the bottom, you can turn them to flatten them more.  These are quite large brunch cakes I'm making because we are big eaters in this household! Once the cakes are flattened out to about 1cm thick, the four of them fill my frying pan.  Turn them again to ensure they are properly cooked all the way through. They don't take too long if you are using pre-cooked leftovers - only the time it takes to cook the eggs and flour. You could even use leftover pancake mix for this, if you make your pancakes unsweetened. I did have some pancake mix leftover yesterday, but I used it as the base for my white sauce when making the lasagne.  Because I just roughly chopped my boiled-in-their-skins potatoes, these were a bit like hash browns without batter. In all honesty, you could do a full English cooked breakfast of potatoes, bacon, eggs, onions, tomato, mushrooms and beans etc. all mixed together and fried as brunch burgers! Frugal food is fun, filling, nutritious and, on some occasions, fattening, especially if you over-indulge and then don't follow a frugal fitness plan. Zero food waste does not mean eat everything in site all at the same time.  We chose to have our brunch cakes on their own, hot with traditional brown sauce, but they will go equally well with other things like extra vegetables and/or salad once the garden is into full summer production. They are also ideal for campfire cooking, so get that cast iron skillet seasoned and ready for use in true Frugaldom style. Failing that, a camping pan on a BBQ may suffice. These are very filling and very tasty, adapted from a very east to follow recipe for basic potato cakes, found on the Back Roads Living website. I got 8 cakes from my mix, so ha;f is now back in the bridge and will be used tomorrow at lunchtime. Join us in the frugal forums to discuss this and other cheap and cheerful ways of slashing your grocery budget and freeing up more of your cash for more fun in the sun this summer!

{"title": "Frugaldom Project April 2015 Part 2", "date": "Saturday 4 April 2015", "text": "Easter weekend and the weather is finer than it's been all week, This morning, the sun shone and work continued at Frugaldom. I was absolutely delighted when the phone rang to say that the fencing of corral #1 had been completed and was eager to pour over the resulting photos, so here goes... the culmination of a lifelong ambition to have a post and rail paddock! Not much to say about this as the pictures speak louder than words, so I hope you enjoy seeing the progress being made at the Frugaldom project, here in southwest Scotland. I have published a separate post here detailing our unusual fund-raising event, whereby individuals or businesses can 'Tag a post at Frugaldom for £10' by as an additional way of pledging support.  To the left of this line of fencing we are in the process of planting a new willow bed and strip of woodland comprising birch, hazel and rowan, which can all tolerate the boggy ground during wet weather. Beyond that is the second corral, which we hope to fence sometime in the not too distant future.  This is looking towards the yard and what will become the start of our planned willow walk, which was being pegged out last month when planting the willow cuttings.  Now we need to finish painting the barn and getting all of these front posts tagged before the next phase of work can begin. It shouldn't be long before the grass starts growing, so I'm going to try to flatten out the tractor ruts next week.  This is looking straight across at the second corral, which will eventually be separated from this one by a new willow bed that will be coppiced for crafting materials. Beyond corral #2 is bog myrtle or sweet gale and to the right, you can just see the tree protectors from all the new crab apples we planted around the little quarry in November.  I don't think I will ever get tired of the view from here, it is just amazing. I've now seen it at dawn, at dusk, in sunshine and with snow on the Galloway Hills. I've also seen it disappear in torrential rain, but this is Scotland, all of the above could have occurred within the same day.   Final view of corral #1 at Frugaldom, looking towards what we call bracken hill and the future willow walk. Once things begin to grow, you may soon see traces of the willow hide I planted late last year. I hope it takes root and begins to grow soon. That about wraps it up for this evening. To find out more about what's happening on a day to day basis, register free to join the forum and look for the dedicated 'Frugaldom Project' section. Aside from this, I am still pursuing my challenge to slash the grocery budget to £5 per person per week and have managed, so far, to get it down to less than £1 per person per day. You can find more about that in the 2015 Challenge section of www.frugalforums.co.uk See you all there! NYK Media in Frugaldom. Frugaldom Project April 2015 Part 2       Take this unique opportunity to add your name to a very special project, known as Frugaldom Frugaldom is in the early stages of development,  with this little piece of Scottish wilderness just having found its way to us in July 2014. Since then, we have received over 1000 young trees and many thousands of seeds from the Woodland Trust, the Grow Wild UK project and our own frugal forum members. Now we are fund raising to replace old posts with new and define individual elements of the project. This is what we call the corral - photo shows it nearing completion on Saturday 4th April 2015 (Easter weekend.) Frugaldom is a privately funded project. It is neither a recognised organisation nor a registered charity. The project is being run by NYK Media with the support and good will of fellow members of the free to join online community of frugal living enthusiasts. WHAT IS 'TAG A POST'? It literally means we are going to tag our fence posts with 30mm, individually engraved, metallic discs. Anyone can pledge their support for this project. For individuals, the tag may be a dedication to a loved one, a commemoration to a cherished pet, a token of your  personal support, a gift, or even just to leave your mark on this little piece of history that's being created in southwest Scotland, for the benefit of all who care to see it. For businesses, it is a tiny bit of affordable marketing, as we will feature all tags on our web site and social media. These tags can be engraved with your company name and telephone number. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? A very affordable fee of only £10 per tag has been set, based on the cost of fence posts, the tags themselves, the engraving, postage (no pun intended) and fixing. As Frugaldom is as much about nature as it is about simple, self-sustainable living and working, we had to analyse the long term costs, durability and safety of the corral fence. For these reasons, we opted for extra strong, 4\" x 4\" posts and heavy duty, 3\" x 2\" rails.  HOW DO I TAKE PART? You can opt to 'buy now' via PayPal or else see our contact page for where to send cheques, made payable to 'NYK Media', who is organising this event. *Tag a Post at Frugaldom* – visit the Frugal Shop to find the buy now option."},
{"title": "Frugaldom Project April 2015", "date": "Friday 3 April 2015", "text": "Part 1 of 2 - Spring is here, the clocks have changed, we're eagerly awaiting the return of the swallows and 2015 work has now begun at Frugaldom. It kicked off with tree planting in March, which will continue until we have another 600 trees in the ground. 420 of these are part of the Woodland Trust's WW1 Centenary Woodland project. Next up is building the first of the corrals...  To begin, I will recap on the long term plans for our outdoor, wilderness project, as it is the culmination of all the savings made over these past years of extreme frugal living. All details are covered in the forums, where members can follow all the updates. The frugal lifestyle will continue as the project progresses. This is so much more than just a simple retirement plan, this is something great that can be embraced, enhanced and enjoyed by future generations for years to come.  The Frugaldom Project encompasses almost 5 hectares (over 12 acres) of land in the Wigtownshire area of Southwest Scotland. The land has a main burn flowing around it, with a smaller stream flowing from that, The flood levels of the Black Burn, a tributary to the Bladnoch River, create our wetlands, which are covered in marsh grasses, sphagnum mosses, willow and sweet gale, otherwise known as bog myrtle. There is an abundance of heather and, in one raised area, plenty of bracken that now needs cutting and gathering.  The Black Burn forms a natural pond at the far end of the Frugaldom project, where water lilies, willow and tall grasses thrive - an ideal location for a hide, just as soon as we get around to clearing the path that leads there. We are simply expanding on what the local wildlife has already created, by way of their regular trek across the field. Frugaldom has a large barn, a sturdy track leading to it and some hard standing for us parking & turning, although we would prefer that our visitors walked, cycled or rode on horseback to the project. (There will be seating, bike parking and horse hitching provided in the future.) It is our first wilderness project embracing frugal work, rest and play. The main project extends to approximately 10 acres and will eventually comprise the following, if all our plans come to fruition:  Foraging and working woodland  Gratitude garden - a specially designated area for dedicated plants, shrubs and trees in memory of those who are no longer with us  Sensory garden - colourful, fragrant and part of a proposed willow walk  Fruit, vegetable, herb and fruit growing (for picking/harvesting)  Willow cultivation & coppicing for biomass, environmental art, our willow walk and weaving materials  Bog Myrtle (sweet Gale) cultivation  Heather cultivation  Sphagnum Moss cultivation  Arts and crafts from natural resources and recycling  Ponds, marshland and bog gardens  Wildlife habitat regeneration and conservation  Wildlife hides for nature studies  Wild flower meadow - we're taking part in WildGrow UK  Environmental art / eco arts project  Microholding - think mini smallholding for food production  Permaculture - allowing the lay of the land to dictate what goes, grows or grazes where  Native woodland regeneration - we're taking part in the Woodland Trust's World War I Centenary woodland project  Frugal fitness - we are on a national cycling route with miles of good cycling, walking or running routes, off road and on, plus working in the great outdoors qualifies as getting fit, doesn't it?  Rest areas, seating, bicycle parking, horse hitching  The Corral project  The Trading Post  The Hitching Post  The Barn - otherwise known as HQ Frugaldom is set in an area of rural Scottish lowland countryside that will be worked as an off grid, frugal project, free for members to visit, help or support. Ideally, the barn could make an excellent visitor centre for passing cyclists, walkers, trekkers, local holiday-makers and fellow frugalers. Likewise, the project is ideal for writers, artists, photographers and crafters looking to relax, recharge and commune with nature. (We are right next to Euro Velo 1 detour cycle route 73 and about 3 or 4 miles off the Southern Upland Way.) The barn, or HQ, is a project in itself, as this will be the main headquarters for the project. We have no amenities on site, but rain water is being harvested from the barn roof, so we can water seedlings during dry seasons etc.  Yesterday, 2015 work began on the first of many of our projects - the corrals. These are small areas of land that sit above the wetlands, ideal for cultivating into pasture or for using as work space for a variety of activities.  There are two main areas that were temporarily fenced using old posts, logs and ropes. The two areas, once properly fenced, will be seperated by a small strip of woodland and a willow bed for future coppicing.  The fence-line has been realigned to increase the overall paddock size and we now have the tractor and fencers on site to move the logs and replace our makeshift fencing with rough sawn posts and rails. This is a major job for us, which meant investing in new posts and rails, hire of machinery and professional help, so we have a plan that may interest some of you. We are inviting people to literally 'sponsor a post' as soon as the corral is completed.  Each of these posts will be available for sponsoring and will feature an engraved medallion displaying the name of each sponsor taking part. You could include a personal name and date, a memorial to a favourite pet, a token memorial to a loved one or even just a tiny promotion for your blog, web site or company name. We have selected 2.5cm metal medallions, which will be engraved to your specifications and we promise to make this opportunity affordable to all. For the tiny sum of just £10, you can have your chosen name and date on the new Frugaldom corral. Part 2 of this post is coming soon, I just need to wait for the pile of wood to turn into a corral post and rail fence. In the meantime, enjoy the Easter weekend wherever you are. www.frugaldom.com Frugaldom Project April 2015"},
{"title": "Money Saving Experts", "date": "Saturday 21 March 2015", "text": "Are you a money saving expert or are you a frugal living expert? There is a world of differences between the two and both can be crushed by debt. Real frugal living frees you from debt before you start saving any money.  This is a quick blog post in my own defence, after my being subjected, once again, to what one may refer to as criticism against my frugal lifestyle. I just want to make one thing clear - make no mistakes, I actually love being frugal! Get it into your head that some of us don't need to be part of the general 9 to 5, or a salaried slave to the system that we call 'normal' society. Some of us actually enjoy our freedom and we will happily go without what others consider to be absolute essentials in order to afford simple living. I have no fear of losing my income or my home, I earn my own pittance and have the skills to create a home from wherever I may be at the time. Again, don't get me wrong, what I do pays very little, as I'm mostly writing and publishing free content, attempting to grow some food from the kitchen garden or assisting those whose budgets (or wisdom)  [prevent them from seeking professionals. I don't mind non-cash payments by way of some pickle, veggies, a bag of apples or a cake. I just need to earn sufficient to pay the essential bills and this is made possible by squeezing them as low as possible and seeing beyond the goal of 'living within my means'. Some people assume that it is a basic human right to be able to afford certain things that I would consider absolute luxuries, but let's get this straight - paying for all these things as cheaply as possible in order to save cash in a tin, jar or bank while having any form of debt or money worries, in my opinion, is just plain dumb! Absolute debt freedom allows you the luxury to continue following a very frugal lifestyle while saving and investing in your own futures. I know there are other ways of doing things but this is mine and it works for me. Frugal living allows those of us on low incomes to speculate a little in the hope that we will accumulate sufficient to afford to continue our stress free lifestyle, right through to retirement and beyond. That is not to say that we will ever reach a point when we can easily live off the interest from our savings but at no point will we get into the unsustainable situation whereby we have more going out than coming in - that is the gist of this story. It's about living within lowly means in a way that demonstrates how it is affordable to all and making the most of every penny to grow it into a pound.  Money saving - it is such an ambiguous phrase. Is it money-saving or is it simply saving money? Are you saving by shaving a percentage off the overall cost of what you buy or are you living well within your means in order to save what's leftover by way of cash and other investments. For the past ten years, I have been living a fairly frugal life, primarily to clear debts like credit cards and a couple of contracts I had locked myself into and then to free myself from the rent trap, as I prefer the security of owning over the pressure of earning hundreds of pounds extra each and every month in order to sustain rent payments. Personally, I feel I could make a home anywhere, as it's about how you feel and not the material 'stuff' that's built up around you. Personally, I don't care if what's around me is built from stone, brick, wood or mud. I don't care if the roof is slate, tile, shingle, tin or felt. Affording to feel comfortable, relaxed and secure within that space is what matters, free from the worry of how to pay for it. So, when someone grumbles to me that their savings are dwindling, their out-goings are far greater than their income, their home isn't worth selling because they won't get back what they paid for it and they are worried about how they will afford to keep the roof over their head in the future, don't expect me to wave a magic wand and say, \"There, there, everything will work out somehow.\" My answer is blunt and to the point - quit spending, quit throwing good money after bad and downsize instead of playing silly games of 'what will friends and neighbours think?' Yes, I did say it as I saw it and do you know what their utterly disgusted response was, fellow frugal lifestyle fans? \"I could never live like you!\" www.frugalforums.co.uk Money Saving Experts"},
{"title": "Frugal Pie Making", "date": "Thursday 12 March 2015", "text": "Life on the 'feed me for a fiver' challenge is interesting, especially when you look closely at fitting in the recommended minimum 5-a-day fruit and vegetables, discounting potatoes, while trying to make affordable, wholesome meals from scratch. That's why we love pies!  The kitchen is one of the easiest places to start money saving, especially if your budget is tight or if you are taking part in our 'feed me for a fiver' challenge in the forums. Your kitchen, regardless of size, shape or design, is also the hub of most frugal homes. In many cases, it is also the gateway to your frugal kingdom - the kitchen garden. Even at this time of year, here in Scotland, we can find some winter greens by way of leeks and kale. It is like finding free food and everything counts when it comes to feeding the household and zero waste. I'm told some places already have wild garlic appearing but I haven't seen any signs of it here yet, just rain, hail, sleet and more high winds. Anyhow, let's get back to pie-making.  Pies are the frugalers' best friends during lean times, especially when made for specific meals. I prefer to use self-raising flour for most things, so this is what gets used for my pastry, along with cheap lard and margarine. Lard is about one third the price of margarine while margarine is about a third less than the cheapest butter, so I tend to do a 2 parts lard to 1 part margarine for pastry making. It makes for a very short and tasty crust on any type of pie and I think it tastes much nicer with that little bit extra lift from self-raising flour. It also helps that SR flour is still only 45p per 1.5kg pack from supermarkets. The pie above was made from a single chicken breast fillet weighing about 100g. I chopped the garden leeks and added 2 portions of frozen mixed vegetables (77p per kilo) to a frying pan and stir fried the finely chopped chicken with the veg for a few minutes before adding instant gravy and pouring it all into the pie dish to be baked in the mini oven for half an hour. Served with kale, shredded cabbage and an onion, again all cooked in the frying pan on the hot plate, this pie is sufficient to feed four adults without a problem.  Blackcurrants! These are so easy to grow once you get the bushes established and they just keep on reproducing! Every year, I cut back the bushes and stick the prunings into pots or buckets until I can plant them into the ground and every year, more blackcurrant bushes grow! These are now being introduced to the Frugaldom Project as part of our edible hedgerow, as they are such prolific fruiting bushes. Most are of the Ben Connan type, so are quite winter hardy and produce large berries. Blackcurrants are packed with vitamin C and have plenty of pectin, so make ideal jams and jellies, but we are now sampling them as fruit portions for breakfast, served with the porridge, and in pies, ice cream, cheesecake and yoghurt. They need to be soaked in sugar overnight to make them less tart and for today's blackcurrant pie, I used vanilla sugar. (My vanilla sugar is homemade, I just keep topping up my sealed jar containing 2 vanilla pods and they keep doing their job.)  This is the pie ready to go into the mini oven - painted with milk, sprinkled with sugar and the pastry trim made into a little decoration for the centre. I baked it for 35 minutes at 200C, but it should be noted that the top element of my mini oven has blown, so only the bottom one is heating it, meaning everything is taking a bit longer.  Freshly baked blackcurrant pie, just out the mini-oven. It really does smell delicious! As usual, I was impatient to cut into the pie - it just looked too tempting, so I cut a slice while still hot and ran some of the juices into the bowl.  This will be served with custard after tonight's dinner. I'm tempted to cook an early dinner just to get at the frugal pudding quicker! As the pie cools, the juice will set a little but we prefer our fruit pies hot and juicy, served with either homemade ice cream or ordinary pouring custard. This pie can be made using any fruit or berries you have available, just sweeten them to your own taste. I've left another serving of the blackcurrants in the fridge for having with tomorrow's porridge. www.frugaldom.com Frugal Pie Making"},
{"title": "Frugaldom Progress Report", "date": "Monday 9 March 2015", "text": "Sunday saw some frugal activity out at the Frugaldom Project. With around 600 trees to plant, including 420 from the Woodland Trust, Sunday gave us the perfect opportunity to get some serious work done.  This is the Frugaldom Project. It is the result of many years of frugal living - saving every available penny in order to make the dream a reality. For those who don't know, we finally managed to buy sufficient land last year and work began in June 2014. This is where we are now 'at' with the plan.    As the diagram above demonstrates, we are concentrating on the main area surrounding HQ (the barn) in an effort to bring the land back under control and plant a new woodland, orchard, willow walk and gardens. Our new woodlands are being planted with native broadleaf trees, all of which have been donated. Many thanks to all involved, including the Woodland Trust and their associated sponsors, for accepting us onto their World War I Centenary Woodland project, and to Wildforms Gardening for Wildlife.  Green lines within the circle represent the areas now planted with new trees - mainly birch, oak, willow, beech and hazel. The bottom green lines represent our World War 1 Centenary Woodland, where we have already planted the perimeter with dog rose, blackthorn and hazel. Yesterday, we added Rowans to this mix and have 60 wild cherry trees to line the main track into the project.  Black blocks of land marked 1 and 2 represent corrals, or paddocks, of rough grassland that were marked out ready for fencing. Each has been planted along two sides, mainly with birch and willow. That tiny patch between the two paddocks equates to a strip of land 50+ metres long by about 3 or 4 metres wide, so we have planted a small willow bed in there to coppice, the end product being used as weaving materials.  Yellow lines show where the smaller, wild garden areas are located, including the Frugaldom 'Garden of Remembrance', which is gradually being stocked with donated flowers, herbs, shrubs and other plants. Beyond this will be turned over to wild flower meadow, more woodland and a seating area that will double up as a picnic area for al fresco dining while out on site.  Red areas denote orchard and foraging areas, where there is now a small, new woodland of crab apples, hazels, elder, sloes, hawthorn, pear, apple and cherry trees. There are quite a few established Siberian Crab Apple trees that already provide a fair harvest of autumn fruits, mostly enjoyed by the local wildlife, but the larger apples were almost exclusively used to make my own jelly, jams and pie fillings over winter.  Along the side of the barn, we have planted an edible hedge, which may eventually stretch the length of the main driveway, to include raspberries, blackberries, black currants and crab apples. We operate a 'help yourself' policy and have a designated 'trading post' where visitors can leave their plant donations or pick up any surplus available from here on the day. Foraging will be actively encouraged whenever we have fruit or berries available.  Along the green lines outside of the circle is where we have begun planting our willow and wildlife walk. This will comprise a meandering path between willow (Salix Viminalis / Osier) that will be grown into an arched avenue, hopefully leading off to wildlife 'hides', observation points and through the bog myrtle plantation to a beautiful big pond area we have at the far end of the project. Yesterday, I managed to get another 100+ cuttings into the ground and have marked out two new rest zones, each big enough to be used as collection points during harvesting of the willow and bog myrtle in future years.    The above photo was taken from one of the rest areas while I was planting the willow and marking out the path to the first observation hide, which will overlook the winter wetlands, along the side of the river. By the riverside, there are already well established willows and this is where we will be planting many more, plus rowans, hawthorn and hazel.    This is the point in the river closest to the first observation point, which is on a raised, dry area nearby, out of reach of any floods that may occur. As yet, we have been unable to determine what may once have been on the site, although there are several indications that whatever it was may have been manmade originally. (There's a bit of metal detecting and mini-excavation organised for here soon, but I'll save that for another post of frugal fun and adventures!)    As you can see, we had an excellent day of winter sunshine for yesterday's frugal fun adventure to the field. I'd filled a flask of soup and packed some snacks, so there was no real rush. In between planting trees and giving the little caravan an airing, I had loads of time to explore, walking around the main part of the project and scaring a Snipe into flight! I also saw my first caterpillar of the year - what looked like a Peacock butterfly.    I had long, since, run out of willow cuttings by the time I reached the overgrown footbridge, so had to peg out as much as I could with garden canes. The path is very overgrown but still distinguishable thanks to the deer having been making full use of it during our absence over winter. Properly developing what will become our willow walk will need to be a major fundraising event if we ever want wooden slats all the way along it - I have been appealing for old pallets but none have been forthcoming, probably owing to the fact that we'd need them dropped off at the site, but it isn't exactly on a main thoroughfare.    It really is hard to believe that we had such glorious weather for planting trees. This is where we are planting Rowans and, as you can see by the photo, there is already a good covering of bog myrtle in what is a fairly boggy part of the land. If truth be told, I'm stood ankle deep in water to take this, after all the rain we have had. Fortunately, it was a bit too cold for any of our resident adders to have put in an appearance but it certainly has not stopped the moles!    From whence do these furry varmints come? They seem to just pop up one day to start creating merry hell with your land, while also exposing all that lovely soil that could end up in the recycled-tractor-tyre herb and strawberry beds. These molehills have appeared within the barnyard area and appear to be heading for the corral!    This is how our corral (otherwise known as paddock number one) is looking at the moment. The old posts have taken a battering through the winter but it shouldn't be too long before the new ones are erected. Last year we set up a 'fence post appeal' so if you sponsored a post, your chosen name will literally appear on a post once the new fence is completed. The links for post sponsorship (and sponsor-a-tree, shop online or donate) are included in the Frugal Shop. I hope you will consider taking part in this rather unusual 'sponsor-a-post' event. It's not something you see everyday but we do like to think we're giving our followers, supporters and members some unique opportunities.  www.frugaldom.com  Frugaldom Progress"},
{"title": "Puff Pastry Pizza", "date": "Wednesday 4 March 2015", "text": "Reducing the food budget to £5.00 per person per week for all meals may seem challenging to some but for others, it's a bit of a game where we try to use up everything so we are wasting nothing. Puff pastry pizza seems like a great idea to me, but does it work? I had half a block of puff pastry defrosted after making a pie at the start of the week - it is National Pie Week this week, did you know that? Anyhow, I had defrosted the pastry, therefore I couldn't refreeze it, so I decided to try making a flaky bake, puff pastry pizza. Rake out the rolling pin and let pastry flattening begin! I rolled it into a circle large enough to fit into my pizza tray.  I have a tube of double concentrate tomato paste with chilli, so I diluted a half cupful and spread that on as the tomato base. Next up, some of the bacon bits retrieved from making this week's pan of soup (bacon & lentil), as these all get removed from the stock before I add the vegetables and pulses.  The cooking bacon costs 80p per 500g pack from supermarkets, it makes a full pan of stock for soup and at least 2 meals for two of us after that, so it's a fabulous bargain to have as back-up in your freezer.  Meanwhile, I diced an onion, chopped a tomato and added a portion each of mixed peppers and sliced mushrooms with seasoning and herbs to quickly fry these for faster cooking.  A bit of added luxury for any frugal budget has to be some mozzarella cheese! At only 46p per pack from supermarkets, a half pack is sufficient for a large pizza. (This is a 30cm/12\" diameter pizza tray.) You can pretty much add any leftovers to a pizza but I have never, until now, tried making one from leftover puff pastry. Wish me luck!  The quickly fried vegetables got poured over the top - onions, mixed peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes - but anything goes when it's pizza, especially if you are adding more cheese.  I used supermarket's own smart price cheddar to top my pizza tonight, so here's hoping the mini oven can cope with baking all this lot into something tasty!  I needn't have worried. The puff pastry pizza worked out a real treat when baked at 200C for about 25 minutes. However, I can't recommend this temperature or time, as my mini oven is now running on just the lower element, so keep an eye on your pizza if baking in a conventional oven. This one will do us for two meals, so guess what's for dinner tomorrow night? I'll probably follow that with more of the raspberries set in jelly, too, as I'm now trying to use up all the garden-grown berries I have stashed in my freezer. Don't get me wrong, if you are one of these people fortunate enough to have access to coupons and live within walking distance of a supermarket, chances are you will be able to buy discounted pizzas cheaper than us rural dwelling frugalites can make them, but we know exactly what's in our pizzas, they are made to our specifications and appreciated for what they are - open top pies that can be adorned with all sorts of leftovers. No easy access to shops is one of the things that townies often overlook when trying to state the obvious about money-saving in the kitchen. From here, our nearest supermarket is 20+ miles away and we don't have a car, but recently, we have been blessed with a trial delivery service by Asda, so their vans have suddenly become a very familiar site on our back roads and farm lanes.

{"title": "Moderation March 2015", "date": "Sunday 1 March 2015", "text": "It isn't all pie in the sky! Beating down the cost of food in an effort to reduce how much money we waste while grocery shopping can be the easiest place to start saving, especially if you are adopting a more frugal lifestyle while focussing on a healthier diet.  Welcome to March, month of mad hares and, hopefully, the final throws of winter for us here in the UK. Hopefully, the temperatures are beginning to drop for our readers in Australia and snows begin thawing for our Canadian frugal friends. We've survived the festive sales, the New Year sales, St Valentines Day and the Frugaldom February Fitness Challenge, now we have Mother's Day and Easter to contend with before springing fully into spring cleaning - or so I am led to believe!Where last month was about losing pounds, namely the surplus gained over the festive fair season, March is about gaining them, marching proudly onwards in an effort to repair the rest of the damage that could have been done, especially by way of finances. We also need to reclaim cupboard space in preparation for the year ahead. And so through to winter we go, once more. It's that circle of life that gets us from one year to the next until we fall off the merry-go-round. Moderation: Moderate - Balanced - Reasonable - I am neither over-indulging nor depriving myself of anything, but I will be saving money while enjoying the finer things in simple life, no matter what. In the Kitchen  Making savings in the kitchen is the easiest place to start and it needn't result in deprivation, unless you have chosen to deprive yourself of anything specific during the days of Lent. (I do notice quite a few mentions of cakes, biscuits, chocolate, sweets and alcohol when this topic arises. However, as a good non-pursuer of such faiths, I choose to motivate my lifestyle by moderation most of the time, not just for a few weeks of the year. March has been named as our frugal month of moderation in the forums for all those taking part in the various money saving and lifestyle challenges. I have already looked back at my previous budgets, each having been charted in spreadsheets since bringing my frugal living challenge online officially. The following is from a few of my previous grocery budgets:  2011: Annual grocery spends - £1,298.16 2012: Annual grocery spends - £1,227.59 2013: Annual grocery spends - £964.80 2014: Annual grocery spends - £916.06  As you can see, year on year, my overall grocery spends have reduced and yet I have still been able to build up a suitable stock pile of dried, tinned and preserved goods. There were three of us in the house during 2011, so a drop occurred in 2012 when the household reduced to two.For 2015, the new challenge is to hammer down the grocery budget to £640.00, which equates to £520.00 for foodstuffs and £120.00 for toiletries, medications, cleaning and laundry products.  I cannot guarantee that this will be achieved, as it actually works out at just under £5.00 per person per week for all meals, but with food prices continually falling and us now having access to one of the big supermarkets, I think it is entirely possible. It is even possible to include some luxury items, like biscuits, cakes and desserts. In many cases, such things cost less to buy than to make.   In the meantime, if the ingredients are there, then homemade is always preferable.  Flour can be bought for 45p per 1500g, sugar at 49p per kilo. This morning, I made some luxury choc chip cookies for this afternoon's visitor using the tried and tested 1, 2, 3 recipe: CHOC CHIP COOKIES  100g sugar (5p)  200g melted margarine (32p)  300g self raising flour (9p) The above is my basic starting point, to which I added an egg (10p) and extra flour, (3p). You can add about 100g of anything at all, be it grains, seeds, chopped nuts, chocolate, dried fruit... I chopped up a 100g bar of cheap supermarket (30p) chocolate for these. The mix does more resemble crumble but it kneads together like dough. I make the biscuits individually by squeezing then rolling a handful of the mix into a walnut-sized ball and then flattening it, rather than having to knead/roll/cut.  There should be enough in this to get 24 cookies but I opted for making larger ones today, so will probably get only 18. To make them extra luxurious, I added an egg and a little extra flour to bind it all together, baked 12 on a greased tray and have wrapped the remainder of the cookie dough in polythene to refrigerate for later use. The tray was baked for 10 minutes in the middle of the oven at 180C, then the biscuits transferred to a wire rack to cool.  Total cost for luxury handmade choc chip cookies - 89p - this is assuming you have paid full price for everything, but my margarine cost less than half that quoted and my egg came from one of the garden hens, so my luxury cookies actually cost only 63p. You can, of course, reduce this cost by making plain cookies, as opposed to using the chocolate. As I use a mini oven for baking, the electricity costs are minimal and contribute to the overall heat in my otherwise cool kitchen.

{"title": "Frugaldom Woodland News", "date": "Thursday 26 February 2015", "text": "Hope everyone is doing OK, sticking to the plan and making the most of whatever they can. February in the Frugaldom household is very much a use-it-up month and the 28-day kickstart to summer fitness, so being awarded another 420 trees by the Woodland Trust as part of the WWI commemorative woodlands scheme will help further the fitness regime! Anyone up for some tree planting? What's next? Well, as many of you know, this entire challenge began as a way to steer completely clear of debt, save to buy a fixy-up and then live the frugal good life mortgage & rent free. In 2011, we managed to buy our fixy-up house, which still isn't fully 'fixy-upped', but never mind, we'll get there one day. In the meantime...  Last year, the savings bought us a bit of land, now known as the Frugaldom Project (www.frugaldom.com for anyone who wasn't aware of how long this challenge has been going) and we have started planting up our community woodland. The Frugaldom Project is about creativity, sustainability and lifestyle, so why not join us online and become part of the project? Sample frugal freedom for yourself: budgeting, foraging, food growing, tree planting, crafting, photography, writing, outdoor fitness, nature studies, environmental art or even just to appreciate the simple things in life, like frugal living, working from home and having affordable fun. Current projects include taking part in the Woodland Trust's WWI Centenary Woodland project, plus the creation of our garden of gratitude, sensory gardens, haiku corner, trading post, hitching post and our very own interpretation of, or even solution to, writers' block. All aspects of the Frugaldom project will be recorded online and can be found in the dedicated section of the frugal forums.  As part of The Woodland Trust World War I centenary woodland project, Frugaldom is taking part in this once-in-a-generation tribute, by creating a growing legacy for centuries to come.  We planted 420 mixed hazel, blackthorn (sloe), crab apple, dog rose and elder on 8th & 9th November 2014 to produce the first stage of our new harvest woodland and edible hedging, which should provide a great future foraging area for all concerned.  We have been awarded a further 420 trees by the Woodland Trust, sponsored by Ikea, with those trees being expected during the first week of March. For anyone interested, planting is scheduled (weather permitting) between 7th and 8th March 2015  Back on the home front with the bargain food budget, now that we have the joys of Asda deliveries, I have been trying to work in a small order once a month - I've cut the food budget to £5 per person per week for all meals. I'm making the most of everything I have in stock and just buying the minimum necessary, but it does seem to be going OK.  My freezer is still full of delicious meaty bargains from Musclefood and I continue to be both amazed and thankful whenever someone becomes a customer via my friend referral link (the banner above) and starts saving their own loyalty points towards filling their freezers.  Many thanks to all and none less so than to the company itself, for giving us frugalers the opportunity to benefit from what would otherwise have remained the secrets of the bodybuilders, rather than us cashbuilders! :) www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk  Frugal living blog about how to do some money saving and cost cutting in an effort to live a good life, free from debt, without having to live in self-imposed poverty. You won't find us running for awards or seeking fame, fortune or even national recognition because we live the life we write - it is as simple as that. Money Saving The Frugal Blog is linked to and supported by the frugal forums, frugal shop, NYK's chat room and the land of Frugaldom, which came about as a direct result of having stuck with my frugal living, moneysaving challenge unfalteringly until the point of attaining debt freedom, and then for the next 7 years thereafter. This is now year 8 of my debt free challenge and almost all of it has been documented online as a frugal blog with forum posts. Frugal Living Challenge This is an adaptation of the original 'Living on £4,000 for a Year' challenge, which has been running online since 2007. Some of the NYK challenges date back to the late 1990's, so I do have a considerable amount of experience in balancing my own books, while living within my own means, always done on a budget that some consider to be impossible. Utter nonsense! It is entirely possible and is an achievement of which I am particularly proud. I can say with confidence that frugal living, free from debt, on a small income is 100% possible. You do, however, need to exercise will power and keep yourself focussed on your plans in order to achieve these otherwise impossible goals. We have seen many changes over the years, so each stage in the development of our frugal living and working plans takes us a step closer to the good life and beyond. Your budget is personal to you, it should fit with your personal financial situation and it should be something you are happy to achieve. If you can achieve a point at which you spend less than you have coming in, then you are halfway there. Getting to the point that you are spending less than you are earning while also absolutely free from debt is the ultimate goal. You just need to believe it is possible and stick to your plan, no matter what. You can join our quest for financial freedom by visiting us in our members only frugal living forums. My frugal living challenge is not about self-deprivation or self-imposed poverty just for the sake of it, it is about providing genuine support for those who are prepared to try making a real difference to their own lives while sorting out their difficult financial situations. Once the debts are gone and you are in full command of your own spending (or not spending, as the case may be), the world is your oyster. Whether you choose to invest, explore, plant a forest, see the world or lead a comfortable life knowing you are financially secure is entirely up to you. Many former and current challengers have achieved debt freedom and now follow frugal lifestyles in order to stay free from debt while pursuing better lives without the entrapment of credit. Others are tackling debts, including mortgages, while following a frugal lifestyle in an attempt to reach their debt-free or mortgage-free day. Whichever stage you are at, feel free to join us and share your journey. 2015 saw the return of the live NYK Chat room, complete with scheduled chats for the purposes of additional support, plus live question time. The new platform has been tested over the past few months and it is hoped that the increased potential for even more real time interactivity can help many more people who want to embark on their own money saving journeys to financial freedom. This challenge is about establishing your true cost of living, sticking to your budget, clearing debts (if you have any) and making savings wherever and however you can to enable you to live the life you really want. Frugal living isn't for everyone, but everyone is welcome to join us. Methods employed by frugalers include batch cooking, stockpiling useful bargains, preserving, foraging, mending, shopping in charity shops, reducing, reusing, recycling, Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS), vegetable and fruit growing, allotments, keeping hens, using cash-back sites and doing whatever it takes to become self sufficient in managing the cost of living without incurring debt. For some it is about clearing debt, for others it's about increasing savings, buying property, becoming stay at home parents or paying off the mortgage early. Some choose the lifestyle on ethical grounds, others seek early retirement or self-sustainability. Above all, this is meant to be a fun and supportive way to manage a minimal budget so you have control of your own money.  It's about NEEDS and not WANTS  Living on a budget = living within our means  Frugal = thrifty, living without waste Fifty Shades of Money Saving  Recognise the differences between needs from wants  Spend within your means  Set a proper budget  Quit expensive habits  Houseshare or get a lodger  Shop via cashback sites  Always price compare  Buy reduced items in stores only if you need them  Stockpile & bulk buy long shelf life groceries that you will use  Batch cook  Make the most of charity shops  Join Freecycle or other similar waste awareness and recycling groups  LETS trading - become active members of trading & exchange groups  Barter  Grow herbs, fruit & vegetables  Preserving - jams, jellies, cordials, pickles, relishes & wine  Bake your own bread using cheap flour  Learn easy bake biscuit, cake and pastry recipes  Make your own greetings cards  Give homemade gifts  Share orders with friends, colleagues and family for better discounts & reduced delivery costs  Landshare, garden share or apply for an allotment if you have no growing space  Make the most of all freebies  Develop your own home-based business  Sell your surplus through the likes of eBid and eBay trading  Do a kitchen cupboard inventory of foodstuffs  Use lists for grocery shopping  Know exactly what is in your freezer  Use up everything in your fridge  Learn how to make soups, stews and casseroles  Make the most of your slow cooker, if you have one  Learn how to knit, crochet and/or sew  Make do and mend rather than buy new  Engage in clothes swaps and accessorise your outfits rather than have to buy new  Learn to make your own laundry cleaner  Make your own household cleaning agents:  invest in soda crystals or sodium bicarbonate,  Get inventive in the kitchen with herbs and spices to use up all leftovers  Use the free gym whenever you like - just open your door and step outside  Use housework as an exercise routine  Dry flowers so they last forever  Collect seeds for sowing  Go foraging for free wild foods  Trim your own hair or ask a friend to do it for you  Turn down the thermostat if you have central heating - wear an extra layer of clothing instead  Early to bed, early to rise - based on daylight, it can save on lighting  Collect fallen sticks, twigs, dry leaves and fir cones for kindling if you have an open fire or stove  Save all suitable containers for freezing or preserving food  Eat a sensible diet: over-eating is one of the costliest mistakes you can make, along with wasting food  Food is NOT bad just because it has passed its 'Best Before' date. Undamaged tins and properly stored dried goods can last for years beyond that  Stay focussed and stay strong - debts have to be paid before saving for rainy days and luxuries By basing your frugal lifestyle around a combination of the above suggestions, you will soon begin to recognise many more ways of saving money but the easiest way to get started is simply to quit spending it until you have assessed your real cost of living. Monitoring and revising a budget is part of any frugal living plan. IMPORTANT Please respect others' lifestyles and beliefs. We are not here to judge, we are here to support.

Frugaldom's 28-day 'fight the flab' challenge, Valentine's Day, Pancake Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Chinese New Year - the year of the sheep, or year of the ram - and several others that have come along more recently, like Harry Potter Day, on February 20th! Frugal living can be fun for everyone, so celebrate in affordable style!  Valentine's Day is the midway point for our Frugal February Fitness Challenge. The sun shone, so it seemed like a good idea to get back in the saddle again... by giving the bike its first short trip of the year. I didn't go far, but stopped for photos along the way, regardless.  As you can see, the sky was blue and the loch was calm. There was a huge flock of migratory geese grazing noisily on the far shore and a number of ducks and other waterfowl on the water.  All along the lochside, through the surrounding woodlands, there were snowdrops flowering. By my front door, I have crocuses, snowdrops and a profusion of miniature irises in full bloom, adding a splash of colour to an otherwise dreary time of year. Pancake Tuesday, or Shrove Tuesday, is tomorrow, 17th February 2015, and we're all set to have a super frugal use-it-up day from dawn until dusk. As February represents the first 28 days of our annual 'get fitter, not fatter' challenge, it is also fitting that this year's grocery challenge has been reduced to £5 per person per week for all meals, so zero tolerance on food waste means everything gets used up as normal, not just on Shrove Tuesdays. (This challenge is being recorded on a daily basis at www.frugalforums.co.uk to include some recipes.) I will continue the pancake blog tomorrow. In the meantime, I have my flour, eggs and milk at the ready, along with the usual lemon and sugar or syrup toppings.  Chinese New Year begins Thursday 17th February and this year is the year of the sheep, or ram. Having seen a lovely example of a willow woven sheep in a garden by the abbey on the island of Iona, I had shown the photos to resident artist. This is the result - his first willow sheep, woven from willow grown in the Thrift Cottage garden! It is very fitting that it was finished this week, just in time for the Chinese year of the sheep beginning on Thursday. Who knows how many may have joined our Frugaldom flock by this time next year. You can see how this sheep was made on our designated eco arts photo blog at www.ecoarts.co.uk  As time marches on, taking February through to March, we have been having fun finding out how far a fiver can stretch, while measuring how many pounds can be lost during this 28-day kickstart to the 'Get Fitter, Not Fatter' challenge. This fabulous little fashion watch, which is available in an assortment of colours, cost just £2.60 including postage and packaging, after using a 10% discount code on our all time favourite fashion site. Better still, you can collect loyalty points as you shop and the company ships globally.To find out more about this and thousands of other bargains that we'll be researching and reviewing, you can visit www.frugalshop.co.uk It is from there that we will be featuring all the offers, discounts, voucher codes, products and services that help to finance the running of the Frugaldom Project, along with the supporting web sites, blogs, forums and chat room. Our next live chat will be scheduled soon, so don't forget to register a username and password via www.frugalforums so you can take part. This week, we will be discussing the 2015 monthly moneysaving challenges plus offering support to those taking part in the fitness challenge. We'll also be mapping out the other monthly challenges that will be set throughout the coming year. Chinese New Year"},

However... For the money savvy shoppers who have followed our frugal living challenges since the beginning, you will have become familiar with such cheap food supplies, having seen the rise and fall of several over the past five or more years. NYK Media and Frugaldom have been supporting Approved Foods since 2009, so it is easy to see how much money has been saved during that time. None of the items are past sell by or unfit for consumption but many have passed their 'best before' dates for quality control. However, it is safe to say that most dried, canned or pickled foods have indefinite shelf lives if kept properly and some things, like honey, can last a lifetime. Read more here…"},

The programme should make for very interesting viewing, but also makes me impatient to hear what millionaires think of the likes of us, who spend our money on past sell by foodstuffs. It also makes me wonder if the result, which would have been known some time ago, during original filming, is what drove up the prices on site, making much of what's available now more expensive than standard supermarkets! Still, it was an innovative business from the start and they deserve all the publicity they can get. I just hope they don't cash in on the already impoverished who may see a pile of cheap crisps as a better bonus than some reduced fruit, bread or vegetables in a regular store. Perhaps I should have completed order last week, rather than see the items in my basket gradually disappear out of stock. I think the phrase, \"A significant investment in a new 60,000sq ft site is the company’s fourth move in just six years,\" pretty much sums up how busy the company, now known as Approved Group, has become since we began shopping there.

Better still, you can add almost anything savoury into them to make them as nutritious or luxurious as you like! At this time of year, British gardens aren't particularly productive but the frugal kitchen cupboards, fridges and freezers are, invariably, filled to the brim with what's been leftover from last year's budget and a festive period that seems to last for weeks. I have often made sliced sausage in the past to use up leftover turkey, bacon, pork or beef with stuffing, but I don't normally go out of my way to make sausages. Today, however, I decided that it was time to use up the last of some soy mince that had been lurking in the cupboard since buying 6 sachets of the stuff for £1! You'll can guess that this was quite some time ago. It was well past 'Best Before' date, but this means nothing much to frugalers, as we all know it's the 'Use By' dates we need to watch. \"Best Before\" dates are usually on very long shelf-life foodstuffs that can literally last for years.

As we continue our quest for financial freedom and a healthy, happy lifestyle with time to enjoy interests outside of the work place, don't forget to spend time doing what you most enjoy. \"Mould your career around your lifestyle and not your lifestyle around your career.\" What a great quote! The final 8 apples collected from last year's windfalls. I had no space in the freezer for any more stewed fruit, so these had been wrapped in newspaper and stored in a cardboard box. As you can see, they had begun to wrinkle, so I rehydrated them a little before cooking them. Frugal rehydration simply means I soaked them in a basin of tap water for a few hours. After a good swim, the apples were fine for peeling and stewing down with some sugar and sultanas. Then it was time for the crumble to get added: oats, flour, sugar and margarine. Yes, we do have a sweet tooth here and it doesn't help with the fight against the flab during winter. (Or summer, for that matter!) Continue reading…   More than halfway through January and we are already looking ahead to see how we can save extra and do more during February. Time flies when you are enjoying yourself, especially when juggling a fresh, new budget. Meanwhile, we still have meals fit for a King, priced for paupers and easy enough that even the kids can make them - what could be better? The new regime for 2015 involves slashing the grocery budget to an average of just £5 per person per week for all meals, so it is taking come creative thinking. The above soup no longer will have just a carrot grated and an onion chopped into it. Instead, it will have a portion of mixed vegetables served with every bowl to make it up to 2 portions of our 5-a-day in one meal.  We do have the advantage of a well stocked kitchen and the additional benefit of home-grown and freely foraged foodstuffs in the freezer, plus a full cupboard of preserves, all made from free fruit, but in order to reduce the overall average, I now need to focus carefully on both the nutritional values and the costs. I guess that's why we Scots love our oats - we can eat them with practically anything! So, after a hearty breakfast of porridge, sometimes with a handful of sultanas or berries to boost the '5-a-day', it's onwards towards soup-making for lunch. At the moment, you can buy cooking bacon for 80p per 500g pack, so I recommend this for making your stock. Along with a 500g pack of split peas or lentils, plus a grated carrot and chopped onion, this combination can cook you up 3.5 litres of soup without a problem and leave enough stock for flavouring the meals you make with the resulting cooked bacon. I made the most of the current Asda offer for half price lentils and now have 10 kilos of them in stock, as they worked out cheaper than their split peas! After slow cooking the 500g of bacon to make stock, this left about 350g of what looked like streaky bacon, so it was all chopped up and separated - lean meat in one tub, streaky bits in another. I salted the water, as the bacon isn't smoked. This is how I intend using the meat:  7 Main Meal Suggestions: Continued…"},

Yesterday, I sorted out the flowers I got at Christmas, which are still going strong. The original small bouquet was bulked out with greenery foraged from the hedgerow around the garden and it all looked rather festive, especially with some red berries and gold-sprayed foliage among it. There were 4 rose buds among freesia, carnations and gypsophila, so the rose buds have now been removed and are hanging heads down in the sitting room, allowing them to dry out for future use.

Breakfast is nearly always porridge, as a 1kg bag, costing 75p, provides sufficient for 20 servings. But I prefer to think of it as 7 days for 2 people will use up 700g porridge oats, leaving 300g each week for baking or other recipes.

It's been a time of battened hatches and mugs of hot chocolate. Over the past month, life in Frugaldom has been a little chaotic, to say the least.  As you can see, the wet weather took its toll on the tin man and the log border of the new path when high tides combined with torrential rain resulted in the burn bursting its banks and flooding the orchard. The water didn't lie long and there was minimal damage, but the weather has done its best to wreak havoc without sending us any snow this winter, so far. The howling gales, however, ripped apart the polytunnel.  Onwards and upwards - we've a challenge to meet. For yet another year I am going to attempt my £4,000 annual budget. I have no mortgage, no car, I house share and we both work from home, meaning minimal work expenses. I have managed to succeed in this challenge since first publishing it in 2007 and it gets easier every year, allowing more and more savings to be invested elsewhere. For 2015, I am looking at the following budget for the entire household… continued"},

But that doesn't mean forgetting about the scrimping and saving, no way! On the contrary, it means even more rigorous overhauls of the new budget so it can incorporate even more into the development plans we have for Frugaldom.Several of you have already taken the opportunity to visit the site and take part in the preliminary stages, so I am really looking forward to welcoming many more of you in the future. Meanwhile, however, life goes on, incomes need to be earned and many more bridges need to be crossed.FundraisingThere will be plenty of this going on during 2015 and that means spreading the word, generating sales of handmade goods and homegrown produce, featuring sponsored links and reviews and making the most of every opportunity presented. We pay to protect the site from pop-ups and random third party advertisers, but we still need to make it pay for itself.Tree PlantingWe have already planted over 500 tiny trees at the Frugaldom project and we hope to take this number to over 1,000 before spring, all based on a cash neutral budget.Frugal Arts, Crafting and Small BusinessIn order to pursue our goals, we will be introducing several new sponsorship opportunities for the purposes of fundraising and income generation to help take the project towards self-sustainability as quickly as possible.Community - Virtual and ActualGroup activities and challenges will be organised throughout 2015 and, as always, all contributions towards costs and overheads are gratefully received.

{"title": "Lentil Soup and Wildlife Spotting", "date": "Monday 24 November 2014", "text": "The weekend adventure of wildlife spotting began with the arrival of the slow cooker, rehomed my way via another member of the family after my precious crock pot fractured irreparably. It will be sadly missed for cooking, but will be repurposed to make a great planter once it has been decorated. Now for the wildlife tale...It began with a smoked ham hough (or hock) that I bought from the supermarket. These are slowly creeping back up in price, but are still worth paying a couple of pounds each for them, as you can get a full pot of stock for soup and enough meat for at least one family-sized pie.Anyhow... I made a full pot of ham and lentil soup, which is enough for about a dozen lunches, then chopped up the meat to make a pie, which will be another 4 meals. All in all, the smoked ham hock will produce lunches for two of us here for a full week, so it's uber-frugal! We don't eat the fat - we feed it to the wild birds after it has been boiled. Or so we thought!Recently, I invested in one of those motion sensor activated trail cameras with infra red night vision. I am still practising with it before deciding where to set it up for future research. This is a series of stills it caught between late last night, when we put the leftovers from soup making out onto the bird table, and this morning. The first 'capture' was a cat - I'm assuming it belongs to neighbours, although none of them seems to know who owns it.At around dawn, a thrush arrived, closely watched over by a female blackbird, a few dunnocks and some sparrows. The thrush, however, was allowed first 'dibs' on the pork fat.The next visitor to the log man bird table was 'Hopalong', the crow we have filmed in the past that has what looks like a deformed or previously broken leg. His (or her) leg seems no better and no worse, nor does it seem to impair flight or the ability to feed.We don't normally see the magpies coming up to this particular bird table, as it's at the top of the garden, next to the greenhouse, the out building and in view of the kitchen window. I cant help but admire these birds, despite the bad name they have developed as thieves and nest-wreckers.And finally, our own cat gets out after a night curled up sleeping on her cushion and goes for a closer look at the camera. No wonder I often find her sitting on the kitchen windowsill, nose to glass, peering out into the garden! There's so much going on out there!As I sit here tapping away at the keyboard, I now have the camera trained on the bird feeder right outside my window. So far, I have seen robins, blue tits, great tits, coal tits, green finches and goldfinches. (The bird in the photo is a goldfinch.) There's a wren keeps bobbing about inside the driftwood horse and the robin loves perching on the antlers of the driftwood stag. How I am ever going to complete the remaining 17,500 words of my 2014 attempt at NaNoWriMo is beyond me when I have such distractions all around me!Welcome to Scotland, welcome to frugal living and welcome to Frugaldom, where I'm writing my way through life, while living on a shoestring budget and attempting to create a self-sustainable wilderness experience for all to share. As we prepare for 2015, let's not forget what is all around us, there to be appreciated and all totally free to enjoy.NYK in Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Join the Spending Revolution", "date": "Sunday 23 November 2014", "text": "Vendetta Against Debt! It's that time of year again, the time when we are planning ahead for 2015, renewing our vigour for the on-going battle against debt, building up our forces to thwart needless spending and fight for the right to protect our own financial security. This is a war against waste - financial and otherwise. Join us in our quest for financial freedom.  Frugaldom is no fairytale fantasy of mythical castles, dragons and miracles. You play your own part in this quest for freedom. This is an adaptation of the original 'Living on £4,000 for a Year' challenge, which has been running online since 2007. Some of the NYK challenges date back to the late 90's, so I do have a considerable amount of experience in balancing my own books, while living within my own means, always done on a budget that some consider to be impossible. Utter nonsense! It is entirely possible and is an achievement of which I am particularly proud. I can say with confidence that living free from debt while on a small income is 100% possible. You do, however, need to exercise will power and keep yourself focussed on your plans in order to achieve these otherwise impossible goals. We have seen many changes over the years, so each stage in the development of our frugal living and working plans takes us a step closer to the good life and beyond. Your budget is personal to you, it should fit with your personal financial situation and it should be something you are happy to achieve. If you can achieve a point at which you spend less than you have coming in, then you are halfway there. Getting to the point that you are spending less than you are earning while also absolutely free from debt is the ultimate goal. You just need to believe it is possible and stick to your plan no matter what. This challenge is not about self-deprivation or self-imposed poverty just for the sake of it, it is about providing genuine support for those who are prepared to take on the challenge of making a real difference to their own lives while sorting out their own difficult financial situations. Once the debts are gone and you are in full command of your own spending (or not spending, as the case may be), the world is your oyster. Whether you choose to invest, explore, plant a forest, see the world or lead a comfortable life knowing you are financially secure is entirely up to you.  Many former and current challengers have achieved debt freedom and now follow frugal lifestyles in order to stay free from debt while pursuing better lives without the entrapment of credit. Others are tackling debts, including mortgages, while following a frugal lifestyle in an attempt to reach their debt-free or mortgage-free day. Whichever stage you are at, feel free to join us for 2015 and share your journey.You can join us free by registering a username at www.frugalforums.co.uk 2015 sees the return of the live NYK Chat room, complete with scheduled chats for the purposes of additional support, plus live question time. The new platform has been trialled over the past couple of months within the members' section of our host site at Scottishmultimedia.co.uk and it is hoped that the increased potential for even more real time interactivity can help many more people who want to embark on their own money journeys to financial freedom. This challenge is about establishing your true cost of living, sticking to your budget, clearing debts (if you have any) and making savings wherever and however you can to enable you to live the life you really want. Frugal living isn't for everyone, but everyone is welcome to join us. Methods employed by frugalers include batch cooking, stockpiling, preserving, foraging, mending, shopping in charity shops, reducing, reusing, recycling, Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS), Vegetable and fruit growing, allotments, keeping hens, using cash-back sites and doing whatever it takes to become self sufficient in managing the cost of living without incurring debt. For some it is about clearing debt, for others it's about increasing savings, buying property, becoming stay at home parents or paying off the mortgage early. Some choose the lifestyle on ethical grounds, others seek early retirement or self-sustainability. Above all, this is meant to be a fun and supportive way to manage a minimal budget so you have control of your own money. It's about NEEDS and not WANTS.Living on a budget = living within our means. Frugal = thrifty, living without waste Ideas to help you achieve and/or maintain debt free living: Recognise the differences between needs from wantsSpend within your meansSet a proper budgetQuit expensive habitsHouseshare or get a lodgerShop via cashback sites and always price compareBuy reduced items in stores only if you need themStockpile & bulk buyBatch cookingMake the most of charity shopsJoin Freecycle or other similar waste awareness and recycling associationsLETS trading - become active members of trading & exchange groupsBarteringGrow your own herbs, fruit & vegetablePreserving & wine-makingBread-making & home bakingCard & gift makingOrder splitting for better discounts & shared postal costsLandsharing, allotments & frugal garden systemsMaking the most of freebiesDevelop your on home-based businesseBid and eBay tradingMonitoring and revising a budget is part of any frugal living plan.

Thank you, Jenni, for sharing your wisdom. 7 Animals That Attenborough Made UpBy Jenni at The Thrifty Magpie's Nest I love animals and I really love Sir David Attenborough’s wildlife documentaries. Who doesn’t?But I need to tell everyone the truth and stop this nonsense going on for any longer. Last night while watching the latest episode of Life Story, I had a moment of realisation: Some of these animals he’s showing us aren’t real. He’s just made them up. They don’t exist.Before getting all “how dare you slag off the eighth wonder of the world which is Sir David Attenborough” on me- just hear me out.Sir David manages to “film animals that have never been filmed before” then broadcasts them on television and we believe they exist, because he told us they do. After producing over 77 series of wildlife films (that I have counted) he has to have some way of keeping the number of viewers up to convince the BBC to send him to all corners of the planet on holiday. He must have run out of animals to film years ago, so now just dreams them up. We will never find out because all these animals just so happen to be in the depths of the impenetrable Amazon, unreachable at the top of the highest mountains in the Himalayas and in the uninhabitable centre of the Sahara Desert. Coincidence? No, it’s a conspiracy.I know this sounds radical, but take a close look at these ‘animals’ that Sir David has, until now, managed to convince millions of people around the world that they are real things.ShoebillThese stupid looking birds apparently stand up to 1.5 metre high and live in marshes and swamps in Africa. This bird couldn’t possibly survive with that ridiculous beak. It would be so top heavy it would fall over. I think Sir David is trying to pull a fast one here.To read this full blog post, please visit The Thrifty Magpies Nest: 7 animals that Attenborough made up (Web URL http://www.thethriftymagpiesnest.co.uk/2014/11/7-animals-that-attenborough-made-up.html)Many thanks to Jenni in Yorkshire for sharing this entertaining blog post.NYK in Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Tales from Frugaldom", "date": "Monday 10 November 2014", "text": "The ever-continuing tales of frugal living in an attempt to give up the day job and pursue the dream of life in the fast lane of Frugaldom. A round-up of some recent events and the bare bones of being prepared.The past few months have been busy here at Thrift Cottage. Slowly, I have managed to tick a couple of more items off my bucket list and 'to do' list, mainly in getting the kitchen into some sort of order and, most importantly, making my Will! Not wanting to dwell on the inevitable, but it is a simple precaution so I am prepared for the one guaranteed event in life. November, of course, is national Will Aid month, so if you feel loath to hand over your cash to a solicitor for the privilege of their writing up your last Will and testament, then select one who is donating the month's proceeds from such transactions to charity.I have tried my best to follow a good eating plan and maintain a healthy lifestyle in an effort to curb weight gain over the winter months and to at least retain an element of fitness, especially for those occasional days that may be deemed suitable for a cycling trip to the field.The costs of my frugal fitness plan haven't really impacted on my overall spending. In fact, it has probably contributed to a reduction in overall grocery spending, as I am simply reducing the amounts of everything I eat... even when forum members choose to send anonymous gifts in a vain attempt to lead me astray. I had to cycle twice as far, twice as quickly to work off this lot, and do without pudding more than once over the last few months after giving in to temptation more than once and with more than just these crisps!I feel that retribution has been sufficiently served by way of the crock pot in my slow cooker having cracked, rendering it useless for frugal soup and stew making. It now needs replacing, so I'm watching for all the offers and hoping I can find a 6.5L replacement via Amazon, so I can part pay using free vouchers accrued through Topcashback.Savings on the grocery spending have been many, especially since the start of the Asda home delivery trial in our rural corner of the country, but it also means that a few extras seem to find their way onto the orders - like 30p chocolate bars, family packs of biscuits and even the occasional cakes. These costs, however, are minimal in comparison to switching on the oven and spending an hour in the kitchen baking, when the time can be spent elsewhere, like at the computer typing up my 50,000 words in my first attempt at NaNoWriMo. Having spent the weekend out on site planting trees and with a visitor staying at the house, I have fallen behind with my word count, so this needs to be remedied as soon as possible. I made my $10 donation, pledging to write 50,000 so now I must complete that pledge.The cost of feeding the electricity meter has increased by around 10% recently, counter-balanced a little by the odd power cuts that have affected us during the worst of the weather. A nice little rebate of £12.00 has helped prepare us for colder weather, as it equates to between 60 and 70kwh of 'free' electricity, in a round about sort of way.Water rates don't affect us here in Scotland, as any water charges are incorporated into our Council Tax, but it did make me wonder how much was wasted when hundreds, possibly thousands of gallons of the stuff were flooding our street a few weeks ago after the water main suddenly burst. We were very lucky in that the torrent reached the front door but was repaired before it came over the threshold.Over at the field, or Frugaldom, as it is now known by all, the month of near persistent rain has considerably raised the levels of the burns that flow around the land. We went along the roadside boundary and also walked across the main grassland, which is mostly marshland, and could clearly see the flood lines, so this should be useful information for future developments involving such things as live art structures and wildlife hides. I didn't venture down to the pond, as there just wasn't enough time to do everything that needed to be done during our weekend trip there.Despite several weeks of rain, the marshland is not as treacherous as I was expecting. It would be an interesting project to clear out some of the old drainage ditches to create a network of mini ponds, interconnected by duck board walkways!I was pleasantly surprised to discover several areas showing potential for cultivating into grassland, with one spot, known as bracken hill or bluebell hill, depending on the time of year, proving to be particularly dry, owing to its elevation above the rest of the surrounding land. Curious! The friend who accompanied me on my walkabout agreed that it could be an interesting research project to try discovering why this little land anomaly exists.On top of bluebell / bracken hill looks like an ideal spot for a wildlife station, the slightly raised area providing an excellent viewpoint for a vast swathe of the project. Exciting times ahead, I feel.Elsewhere around the field, there were several new fungi and moss species spotted. There were quite a few of this little fellow about the place - not sure what type of fungi it is but am hoping one of you reading this can let us know. :)Tree planting as part of the Woodland Trust World War I Centenary Woodland ProjectDespite having sent out over 100 invites, publicising the event online, notifying both of our local newspapers and alerting the nearby holiday park, the turnout for our event failed to entice anyone new on such a wet Saturday. By the Sunday, however, our core group had packed picnic lunches to make the most of the sunshine and spent the day planting trees, chatting and enjoying being outdoors.The early morning sunshine was blurred by low clouds of fog rolling a blanket of dew over everything, including the little spider's web on the Frugaldom trading post. It really was a fine day for planting trees and getting the hedgerow in around the garden of gratitude.The hedging around the area reserved as a gratitude garden has now been planted up with crab apples, elder and sloes with a few hazels and space remaining for other fruits and berries. I have plenty of cuttings from blackcurrants, raspberries, gooseberries and blackberries to go in between these to form a thick, edible hedge that will also, hopefully, entice wild birds and insects, not to mention happy foragers picking fruit and berries for jelly and cordial making in years to come.I'm really pleased with the progress made over the space of just one weekend of planting and extremely grateful to have been given the opportunity for Frugaldom to become part of the World War I Centenary Woodland project. It will bring immense pleasure to many in the future, I am sure, as our gratitude garden develops and the new seating and picnic areas are created.My problem now is working out how best to be there to actually get any of these great plans implemented. A small financial miracle is probably what most would wish for, but where is the challenge in that? I will start number crunching the list of possibilities now that they have been whittled down to just a few with real potential, then concentrate on how to take this plan forward. As my frugal living motto goes,The less I spend, the more I can afford."},
{"title": "Frugal Car Maintenance", "date": "Wednesday 5 November 2014", "text": "For those who have cars: Each car model has a suggested maintenance regime that is laid out in the owner’s manual. You can save yourself thousands of pounds by taking the time to read the manual and to follow the schedules specified. This can directly impact on the longevity of your vehicle, its performance and the costs per mile driven.Picking up on big problems early is what regular preventative maintenance is all about. Prevention is better than cure might be a maxim that your doctor will tell you, but your mechanic should also be saying the same thing when it comes to your car. Of course, some checks need a specialist to do, but you can also remain frugal by undertaking some car maintenance yourself.Check The FluidsMany car fluids can be checked by an owner with little garage experience. Ensuring fluids are topped up is one of the most effective ways to maintain a car’s ability to drive well. It is quite easy to do, although you will need to consult your manual in most cases. Make sure that your car has the right levels of oil, transmission fluid, wiper fluid, power steering fluid, anti-freeze and brake fluid. If you are not sure about how to do this, then online tutorials about how to use a dipstick to check oil, for example, can be a big help and may well save you thousands of pounds in unnecessary inspection bills. If you wait until the relevant dashboard light comes on, it is often too late to sort the issue out cheaply.Tyre MaintenanceKeeping your tyres well-maintained is another important way of saving money in the long run. According to specialists, premium tyre manufacturers use tread wear indicators on their products, which makes it easy to judge when a tyre is reaching the end of its life. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated tread gauge to detect a worn section of tyre. Whatever you do, make sure, make sure to check your tyres and ensure they are road worthy.Tyre inspections or new tyres are no longer things to fret over, as online reserve and fit systems are available throughout Britain...

{"title": "Centenary Woodland Project", "date": "Tuesday 4 November 2014", "text": "420 assorted saplingsThe latest batch of trees have arrived for the weekend's planting event - 420 mixed hazel, blackthorn (sloe), crab apple, dog rose and elder. 2014 marked the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and, as part of The Woodland Trust World War I centenary woodland project, Frugaldom is taking part in this once-in-a-generation tribute for those who lived and served, by creating a growing legacy that will hopefully stand tall for centuries to come. We hope to have the woodland planting well under way for the 11th of November, Remembrance Day. These trees will make up the first stage of our new harvest woodland, which should provide a great future foraging area for all concerned. Adjacent to this woodland, is what we plan on having as our wild flower meadow, which includes poppies. If you find yourself with any spare wild flower seeds, we can happily give them a good home. (Details for posting can be found on the 'Contact' page of  www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk website.)We have issued an open invitation to anyone with an interest in such projects to join us on Saturday  8th November or Sunday 9th November between the hours of 11am and 3.30pm to help plant our tiny trees. We will be meeting on site, where there are no amenities, so please come prepared. There is some parking available at the road end or along the track at the barnyard. If you choose to stay the weekend, adequate camping facilities can be found nearby at Balloch O' Dee campsite or else 3 Lochs Holiday Park, both of which are within about a mile of the Frugaldom site.The Woodland Trust has provided full instructions, tree protectors and canes for securing the saplings. The Trust is working with lead partner Sainsbury's, along with the Army Cadet Force, Combined Cadet Force and Air Cadets, to create these special Centenary Woods. By providing 3,000,000 free trees for planting on locations throughout Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales, it is hopes we will all have access to these living memorials to the Great War.Get in contact via www.frugaldom.com if you would like to come along and take part in our event."},

Frugal living, as a lifestyle, is quite time consuming, what with money challenges, gardens, cooking from scratch, DIY, taking up to 10 times longer to get anywhere when cycling or walking and let's not overlook many hours at the computer, eeking out a living. So what's so different about November?﻿﻿Image design by Elizabeth Doyle﻿First of all, November is NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month - and it has been running since NYK was publishing 'Now You Know', which makes this challenge 15 years old! It is literally a challenge in which anyone interested can attempt to write a novel of 50,000 words within the month of November. I have registered to take part!Next, we are expecting to take delivery of 420 mixed native species trees that the Frugaldom Project has been awarded as part of the Woodland Trust's nationwide World War I Centenary. The saplings are being delivered to Thrift Cottage during the first week in November, along with canes and protection spirals. We will be having a Frugaldom planting event on site to create a brand new harvest woodland to commemorate the outbreak of the Great War of 1914-18.  This is quoted as being, \"a once-in-a-generation tribute for those who lived and served, by creating a growing legacy that will stand tall for centuries to come.\" More than 16 million people, not to mention countless animals, died during the conflicts. Throughout Britain, people will be planting trees out of respect. We hope to have all our trees planted in time for 11th November and then continue developing this project in any way possible.Fast approaching the 13th and 14th of November and the Scottish Business Exhibition, which is another event I hope to be attending. It's for all budding entrepreneurs and frugaleurs, an opportunity to learn from some experts. Tickets can be claimed free, you just need to register through The Scottish Business Exhibition (http://www.thescottishbusinessexhibition.com) or New Start Scotland (http://newstartscotland.com) web sites.That almost takes us up to the 17th November and the start of Global Entrepreneurship Week (www.gew.co/) which is when we start our 2014 moneymaking challenge in the Frugal Forums at www.frugalforums.co.uk This year, once again, we are working with a budget of £10 start-up capital to see how far we can take, or how much further we can develop, our business ideas.I think that's enough to be going on with for now. In the money savings stakes, I have been fortunate enough to bag myself some of that super-duper, ultra cheap sugar that Pound stretcher is currently selling ay an incredible 49p per kilo. This is thanks to someone in the family who is coming to stay for a few days and asked the question, \"Is there anything you need from the shops?\" Not sure they expected me to ask for a load of sugar, mind you, but the same bag costs over £1 in the village store and a visit there involves a 7-mile round walk or cycle!NYK in Frugaldom"},

I haven't used everything bought, so the budget is actually under £50, but I'll work out the exact costs later.Painting the walls - Anything goes and most of us can find some magnolia paint about the house at most times. If not, why not? It is my second default colour, after white, and can be used pretty much anywhere in the house without looking out of place. So, my kitchen is the default white ceiling and magnolia walls, spare paint is one of those 'always kept in stock' items in the same way as flour or sugar.Work space - No fancy fitted kitchen here, just a few base units bought in an Argos sale a couple of years ago plus a salvaged unit and some old work top. In order to make the most of it all, I need to be able to see it and use it without it being covered in clutter. Herein lies the reason for my love of hooks! I've found that the best way of screwing them into the wall is to add a strap of wood, so the weight is spread across the framework behind the plasterboard, so that's what I did. The strips of wood are all from scrap.Kitchen roll dispenser - A pair of hooks saved from an old over door hanger have been turned upside down and used to suspend a smooth branch from a tree, which is now supporting the kitchen roll. Works just fine and it can be easily replaced when the time comes to do so.Window dressings - Who needs curtains or blinds when you are looking out onto your own back garden? This is some hemmed fabric that a friend gave me several years ago; it used to hang along the front of my kitchen units at the last house we were in, hiding the state of the old units there. Now, I have simply looped it over the extending rail in the window and tied it up using ribbons that I had among my crafting supplies. I believe they arrived as a gift during the love bomb dropped on me by Frugal Queen during our participation in a previous money challenge. The jars on the windowsill contain herb cuttings and my celery stalk that is now growing me more celery.Interior design - The most expensive purchase for this makeover was the wallpaper border, as I needed three rolls of it to go all the way around the kitchen and the adjoining (soon to be) cloakroom. The wooden wall hangings are homemade, shaped from off-cuts of board and painted by resident artist. The corner kitchen stand is of unknown age or origin, as it was purchased several years ago from a charity shop.Culinary delights - Like most frugal cooks, I do like my favourite pans, herbs and spices kept to hand, so here is what I did with mine. Yes, it's a piece of wood with even more hooks! Most of the wood used has been reclaimed from an old wooden bed frame we dismantled. It seemed too good to use as fuel in the fire, so I'm glad we kept it. The little spice racks were bought for £1 each several years ago in, you guessed it, a pound shop. The chalk board, just visible on the top left, was homemade around 2008 and has served us well through three addresses, to date.Designer décor - Can anyone remember this? I bought it around 2004 and it has travelled with us during our past 3 house moves. It holds about a gallon of water and we used to keep tiny tropical fish in it. I'm not sure what will go in here next, as tropical fish keeping is a bit of an expense, what with heating, lighting, filtration and the cost of the fish, especially if there's a lengthy power cut, so it may end up with nothing more than some tiny shrimps or a couple of small cold water fish. Whatever, it has now been scrubbed and set up in what I am calling my 'cosy corner café.Cosy corner - When I say cost, I really do mean it. With no heater of any description in the kitchen, I decided to hang the 250w infra red heater from the ceiling. (Costs under 4p per hour to run.) It is one I have had for several years, meant for brooding chicks after they come out the incubator. I haven't needed it for that purpose since moving here because I haven't been breeding many hens. I have to say, the cat greatly appreciates this corner and has claimed the seat directly beneath the heat lamp! No doubt she will be even more delighted to have fish to watch swimming around, once we get some!Food preparation areas - Few people even notice that I don't have an actual cooker. I have a twin hot plate that fits nicely into a shelf on the corner kitchen stand for storage. Along with this, I have a microwave, slow cooker, steamer, toaster, bread-maker and the mini oven rescued from a charity fair back in 2008. I am no cordon bleu chef, so this lot does me just fine. The old work top has the stainless steel worktop saver bought via eBay on top, providing an excellent cutting and food prep surface that is easy to keep hygienically clean.Cloakroom - Adjoining the kitchen is a small hallway, so this has now been painted and decorated to match the kitchen. The freezer has been moved in there and I am currently hanging shelves and coat hooks to make this into a walk through storage cloakroom. It isn't quite finished yet, but it should be soon. I've now found a suitable length of wood to attach to the wall for adding a load more hooks.Here endeth my wet weather interior design exploits - for now!Eco Arts - Meanwhile, out in the studio, resident artist completed the commissioned driftwood heron and it has now been delivered to its delighted new owner, with visiting rights agreed.October Challenge Round-up - This has been a rather spendy month, even although our challenge was to have an austere October, buying only what we really needed and charting every single penny spent. Results for these challenges can all be found in www.frugalforums.co.uk, where you can also follow the November challenges. Hopefully, I may be able to entice a few more of you to start posting there and taking part, as we have some fabulous plans for future projects and, as always, these are all free to join.NYK, Frugal Blog"},

If you don't like it, don't read it, SIMPLE!When your earned income dictates that you fall below the Government’s definition of poverty, it can get really frustrating! Frugaldom, as well as now being a real place, is the act of living a frugal, thrifty or austere lifestyle at nobody's expense except your own. We have no problems with sharing our surplus or helping support one another. How we source our income, spend our income and live our lives is our own business. Sharing the wherewithal to pursue such an existence is paramount to the success of frugaldom and it is a project that means the world to me - it is my world! In the mid-80's, many of us were forced to learn the hard and fast way of budgeting to within a penny of bankruptcy and homelessness. By the 90's, many of us were still licking our wounds and struggling to climb back out of debt and take full control of our finances after some very turbulent times of society unrest, disillusionment and what many perceived as injustice. But we survived. Just like generations before us, through wars, famines and enforced displacement. Do we learn from it? I'm not sure! One thing I am sure of is that everyone has the capacity to learn in their own way and we all do it in different ways. Academics is not the only way! In 1998, NYK, which, in this case, stands for 'Now You Know', established its first official challenge, not simply about money but about sharing a mutual goal, whether it be arts, crafts or writing. Most would agree that securing a guaranteed, long term income as a writer (or artist) was a dream that came true for only the chosen few. But we pooled our talents and we said 'do or be damned'. Our voices counted, no matter how much bullying and intimidation was experienced. Some of us learned the lesson of the past and that lesson was self-responsibility, with the added security of knowing that help would be at hand to support us if we fell below a certain line. Despite the billions of pounds of debt being accrued each year by Government spending, the safety net would remain... or so we thought! We were walking a financial tight rope - we still are - except the safety net is shrinking. Sadly, for some it seems to have vanished completely. But surely the question shouldn't be, \"What are 'they' going to do about it?\" Surely, the question should be, \"How can we help?\" Blog post can be found HERE: They, We, Them and Us."},

{"title": "Live Chat Room", "date": "Friday 18 July 2014", "text": "Summary of the Friday Frugalers' ChatTopic - Monthly ChallengesTonight's scheduled chat was to discuss how to proceed with the various challenges we all face and how to proceed in a way that is both helpful and fun, leading us through the remaining five months of this year and into the start of 2015. Being prepared always helps. Hopefully, fellow frugal forum members can be there to help support newcomers to frugal living and to encourage those who may be going through a particularly difficult time.The following challenges were proposed and agreed:August Austerity ChallengeAusterity relates to a strict policy of simplicity and reduction in budget deficits, so August, despite such things as summer holidays, is about really knuckling down to make every single penny count towards reducing debt or avoiding it. (That means nothing on credit unless it is paid in full prior to any interest or other charges being imposed.) If you really don't think you need to be austere, then help out someone who does.September Simple Savings ChallengeA month of saving every spare penny you have by way of buying cheaper brands, spending less, making or mending instead of buying, buying second-hand instead of new, cooking, baking, foraging, preserving... count up all costs before you start and don't do it if you can buy the item cheaper. Every single penny counts, even the odd one you might find on the pavement.100 Day ChallengeStarts on 22nd September and ends 31st December 2014 - 100 days of extra vigilance in an effort to prepare for winter festivities and make it through to the end of the year with less debt than you had at the start of it. If you have no debt, then review your rainy day savings, take note of the figure on day 1 of the challenge and try to increase it by day 100.Frugal ADVENTuresThis challenge will run from 30th November to 26th December (4 weeks) - be prepared, the festivities occurs every year, so don't be caught out and feel pressurised into spending a small fortune on loved ones... show them that fun, laughter and happy memories are free, or at the very least show them they are frugal.October Only if I (Really) Need it ChallengeEasy to understand - time to get those priorities in order and separate needs from wants. This will be a challenging month of spending only on what you cannot live without.November's Never Give Up ChallengeIt's a long haul getting from one year to the next if you have debts or other worries, so November is about reflecting on what's most important to you, sharing with friends, offering and accepting support and, most of all, never giving up on hopes, dreams or ambitions. We aren't chasing rainbows here, we are painting our own. We'll be discussing what really gets in the way and what is simply perceived as getting in the way, addressing what frugal living is really all about and how great it can be to lead by example, regain any lost positivity and help those less fortunate than ourselves.December - Declare Yourself a Frugal SuccessYes, I said success! There are no failures in Frugaldom, only blips, slip-ups, diversions and delays. If you are still actively participating in this glorious lifestyle and still in pursuit of frugal freedom, then you are a winner and that deserves recognition and celebration. We will celebrate all our successes, even the tiniest ones that may, otherwise, have been overlooked. Thank you all for being a part of Frugaldom and for taking the time to contribute to the forums.

Huge potential for the right buyer as there must easily be 1000 people within the surrounding and out-lying area who would appreciate the opportunity to buy local produce at affordable prices.

Being based in Wishaw gave us easy access to Glasgow, so we opted for open return train tickets at a cost of £40, allowing us to travel from our original destination via Glasgow Central, Queen Street and then on to Oban, which is a lovely little harbour town on the Argyll coast. It was a bit overcast when we left Glasgow but the clouds lifted the further north we travelled… Read more (photo blog includes my home made souvenir.)"},

The Frugaldom garden reflects our on-going attempts at home-based self-sustainability. It is from here that we should derive both income and food. It is an environment within which we can relax and enjoy a simple and frugal lifestyle, surrounded by the fruits of our own labours. The garden is being created as a microholding, or tiny smallholding, while following the basic principles of permaculture. But it has an artistic twist by way of the fact that we host an eco arts project. One project that H has been contemplating for a long time was the making of a driftwood horse that can take pride of place in the garden. He was inspired by the magnificent sculptures of Heather Jansch and began gathering up bits of driftwood over a year ago. The fine Easter weather presented a perfect opportunity to finally put all of the foraged driftwood to good use, recycling it into a ‘living’ sculpture.

Potatoes are quite important in Frugaldom as they bulk out meals, are fairly cheap to plant and the return on investment can be high IF you can grow them successfully. My favourite of all time are the heritage variety known as Salad Blue, which have already been planted, but I also invested in some Shetland Blacks, another heritage variety, plus my Charlottes. These have just gone into the ground today. Read more of this photo blog here"},

The debt free good life was one I aspired to for many years and it took many more to achieve it, but we still are nowhere near self-sufficient. So this got me thinking seriously about 'what if we had absolutely no money?’  Could we rustle up a meal from the Frugaldom garden? Don't panic! We don't eat any of our own livestock, they are kept more like pets! But we still need to feed them and they still need to contribute to the overall 'welfare' of the microholding project.  Octavius and Septimus help manure the fruit beds, dig holes and eat grass. They also love raspberry leaves! But that doesn't feed us!

Unpredictable weather should no longer be a problem now that the poly tunnel is reinstated but the sun shone this afternoon, so we were able to get outdoor jobs done.

My strawberry planters have been moved from house to house for the past seven years, along with the original strawberry plants bought from a supermarket in 2007, while they were reduced to clear. I think I bought two lots of 4 plants for £2.00 and, other than when I catered for a party of 120, I haven't bought any strawberries since. They are simply so easy to grow that I could never be without them now. Today has been the first opportunity I have had to get outside and weed the patio planters, which were filled with everything apart from strawberries. Moss, grass, dead leaves, weeds, seed husks, creepy crawlies and the remnants of last years strawberry plants, which had shot runners everywhere. Strawberry runners are fantastic things!

It's been another hectic day of work at the computer screen and, to be perfectly honest, I haven't cooked any meals, haven't been out the door and haven't done any housework. I threw some mix in the breadmaker first thing this morning and, thankfully, it turned out alright. I had bread and homemade soup for lunch, but it was 9pm by the time I ate my pudding! On the plus side, this means I didn't spend any money today, so that is good.In order to save, I need cash; in order to have cash I need work and when you are single with no car and relying on home-based self-employed, that work needs to pay. We are now approaching the end of the tax year, so I have been doing some extra book-keeping, selling extra web content and have invested in having a brand new web site designed - I wanted something lean, clean and simple from which I can begin propagating and cultivating some of my wacky money saving and money making ideas.We're not out of the woods yet but, at 9.44pm this evening, the new site went live! I now have 60 days 'Warranty' during which time I need to learn everything there is to know about it. Fortunately, I enjoy a challenge, I love writing and I'm not afraid to ask for relevant answers to pertinent questions. :)The new site went live tonight.Now I just need to rebuild all the pages, link up all the blogs and channel some creativity into it.

I've had a few of those days recently, so I'm just going to resort to making it to the end of March without too many calamities and not counting my proverbial chickens before the eggs hatch. Speaking of eggs, we now have two ducks a hen and two bantams laying, so I have begun swaps and trades with neighbours again - a lovely lemon drizzle cake handed in this afternoon! Apologies for the lack of posts over the weekend but I'm squeezing in 14+ hours a day in an attempt to fit in work, household, family crises and the complete overhaul of the web site, along with building us some brand new forums - Now You Know. They aren't quite completed yet, but they are open for use, so grab your username before someone else does and I'll 'see' you in the daily chat thread.Pancakes galore!With all the eggs we are now getting, it has been a case of quickly using these to make speedy meals grabbed in between hours of hectic work. (I'm not even thinking about the 2013/14 tax return yet!) So, it's been eggs for lunch in some way, shape or form. Pancakes made with sultanas and cinnamon, served with sugar and lemon... again!Good grief! What is it?In a huge rush to make a loaf, this is what I got in return! The above is supposed to be a beautiful, freshly baked loaf that would be ready for breakfast after I got up early and decided to try the fastbake setting! I'm guessing that's a no-no for the cheap bread mix I got a few weeks ago. But gear not! This mangled mass got chopped and turned into croutons after we salvaged the middle slices. The crunchier bits got chopped and added into the chickens' breakfast!Doughball!  My next calamity came when I put the day's mince on to warm and forgot to make the dumplings! I did a quick search and saw mention of a speedy microwave version... it didn't work very well! I think I 'rubberised' them! Well! I was so annoyed that I dropped them into the mince and let them soak themselves soggy in extra gravy... then served them up with cabbage and carrots for dinner anyway! There were 6 but I am ashamed to say that the two leftover were simply inedible and went into the fire to burn for a couple of hours!Lunchtime today was toasted pitta breads filled with scrambled eggs and hot dog sausages, 'garnished' with tomato ketchup! But guess what? I over crisped the pittas!Pasta twirls added to mince & carrotsThe leftover mince from the doughball disaster should have been made into a pie but I ran out of time again... phone rang at 7.45pm and that reminded me to look at the time and realise I hadn't made dinner! So tonight's gourmet choice was pasta mixed through the leftover mince and carrots.Seeking solace after all my culinary woes, I did a cupboard rummage and discovered a tiny tin of longlife sterilised double cream, which gave me the incentive to whip up some ice cream from one of the cheap instant mixes. I needed some frugal luxury, so that's what I made... extreme luxury ice cream!Whipped double cream, milk and cocoa The ice cream mix needs half a pint of milk, so I made it up with skimmed UHT and then whisked in a heaped tablespoon of cocoa powder.Microwave-defrosted a bowl of garden raspberries I still have plenty of berries in the freezer, all picked last summer from the garden, so I quickly defrosted a bowlful, sweetened them and then mashed them.Adding sweetened, stewed raspberries to the chocolate mix Adding the mashed raspberries to the chocolate ice cream mix - had to sample the rasps to cheer myself up a bit - that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it!Mixed and ready for freezingAll mixed and ready for the freezer. That was almost 9pm and it's now almost half past midnight, but guess what I am doing, other than finishing off a very rushed blog post? I'm about to tuck into this absolutely amazing ice cream and don't care what anyone things about that! :)Raspberry and chocolate ice creamApologies for any silly mistakes in this post; I am hitting 'post' without previewing or proofreading it... my ice cream is melting!"},

But fear not! Frugalers improvise, don't they?  Bring on the humble cabbage! I shredded some cabbage and cooked it with onions then added that to the frying chicken pieces with spicy mix. Wrapped in warm tortillas and served with cheese and salsa, H didn't even notice that the peppers were missing, nor did he notice he was eating cabbage until I pointed out the replacement ingredient. From one who never ate cabbage as a child - eugh, soggy cabbage! - I have found so many uses for it in my adult life that I simply don't know how I would manage without the humble cabbage now! It's a bit of a lifesaver for this frugal household! It's relatively cheap, it's relatively easy to grow, I think we should invest much more effort into growing it and other close relatives of the Brassica family. In fact, I have grand ideas for the 2014 green garden! Cabbage scrapsCabbage scraps can be cooked and fed to the chickens, added to compost, fed to the worms and even used to grow more cabbage.﻿Stir frying cabbageStir fried as a replacement for peppers in an assortment of dishes including chow mein and fajitas.

They may never be full side but they are edible.The red cabbage rooted and growing Even if you don't eat the leaves, these are fantastic experiments for children to encourage an interest in vegetable growing (and eating). Stuffed cabbage leavesInstead of cannelloni, how about trying rolling some of the mix inside cabbage leaves. A you can see, you can cut the leaves or stuff them whole.Cooking the cannelloni with stuffed cabbage leavesCabbage and cheese? Yes! I stuffed my cabbage raw and baked it with the cannelloni to show the difference. H ate the small one without realising it was cabbage.

They were planted into recycled tin cans and sat in the window to try and get whatever little heat they could from any brief glimmers of sunshine reached them - it hasn't been much! Still, 3 of the 4 tins containing peas now have little plants growing from them.

Along the way, making significant income has never been my priority - I don't know why, I am simply not motivated by money. Getting the best bang for my buck, however, is a definite motivator when it comes to spending... when needs must, you understand.Recently, I was sharply reminded that buying a fixy-up house for cash and then focussing almost all of my attention on how to develop the property in the most cost effective way may not be the best thing to do, especially if I intend actually living here for any length of time. For starters, property development works ONLY if the completed project is sold at a rate that both recoups all original investment and generates sufficient profits to warrant the equivalent of a fulltime income over the period of the project. Hmm...As I said recently, we are now 3 years into what I consider to be a 5-year project but while concentrating on this, I have taken my eye off my own long term financial prospects. Creating a self-sustaining microholding is all well and good but the economic and political climate in which we live dictates that we must deal with hard cash. Put bluntly, no amount of berries picked from the fruit garden nor eggs laid by the poultry will pay ordinary household bills, nor will they pay the costs of maintaining my self-employed status. Cue some speedy research!NYK, Frugaldom on FacebookI haven't focussed much attention of Facebook but am assured that we 'need' to be there because 'there' is where everyone else is, apparently.

Just staying financially afloat has been the main focus, but so far so good. Having never had the security of a well-paid professional career, I can't miss it - hence the reason I think I'd feel cash rich if I ever managed to earn myself the UK's minimum wage! Earn a living, I must! And that's why I now need to spend so much time pulling everything back together again, in an effort to earn the income that I need in order to budget for my frugal lifestyle of the future. I decided to call UK2, my web hosting company, on their 0800 free phone number after logging into my long-suffering control page. I was shocked at how out-dated everything was! But I couldn't believe my luck when I saw the half price sale for upgraded web services, so an investment has been made! I'm calling it an investment because I am hoping that the new and fully interactive site will pay for itself then begin earning me a small income before the house project is completed. Fast approaching 50 and no longer a tech-savvy frugal babe, I've had to employ the services of a professional to pander to my every online need!

(Sneaky peek at Wilbur, my flying pig, trying out a new page layout.)Working on the new interactive versionNow we all know I blog and those who know me personally know I could talk for Scotland if given the opportunity, so communicating with the outside world is always a major concern of mine - I live a rural lifestyle of frugality but I place a very high value on social interaction - I'm sure it's what keeps us sane when things get tough. I've been using Twitter for a long time but only relatively recently decided to link it up with the frugaldom challenges. I love my number-crunching, so I decided to do a quick bit of research into how necessary it is to have a decent Twitter following... and proved my own point! Social media is not the be all and end all of succeeding in building yourself a customer base for your self-employment. See for yourself...Researching aspects of social mediaI won't name the businesses connected to the above figures but, suffice to say, you wouldn't expect many serious start-ups or home-based entrepreneurs to wish themselves into the unenviable position of the final listing - would you? I would!Contrary to everything that the marketing and business gurus are saying, that tiny 260 followers Twitter account belongs to the Startups Award for 'Home-based freelance Business of the Year 2013'! I wonder if Catherine Kennard is a frugal living fan?In conclusion, today's 'Making in March' has been all about making progress towards becoming self-sustainable in both home and working life by making plans for my frugal business empire.The big question is, can I do all of this without incurring any debt and, at the same time, fit in my next crazy mini-adventure with my wacky friends? I am running out of time to chase the aurora borealis this winter, so I think we should infuse a little more excitement into this frugal life before the time comes to spend every minute in the garden. Better still, if the new website plays nicely on my Kindle or iPod then I may not even need to come indoors to check on my work status this summer! How great would that be?Already setting budgets, checking travel costs, accommodation costs and route options while comparing notes with willing frugal friends! :)Graphic above courtesy of http://www.blessedaretheweird.com/ and UK2 is an affiliated link.

", "date": "Monday 17 March 2014", "text": "Making (Excuses) in MarchWrite every day! I tell myself that every day! I do write every day, but not always in the same place. I had meant to blog right here every day as well as writing other things but for some reason, March is marching on at an incredible speed and leaving me straggling behind it, so I must apologise for the gaps in this month's 'Making it in March' challenge. Excuses Too many other things distracting me. (Focus!)Not enough time in the day. (Get up earlier!)Too tired and lacking motivation. (Go to bed earlier!)Real life takes over all my time. (This is real life, make time!)Too many other things to do. (Plan ahead, make a list!)So here I am, after a weekend of making nothing more than the meals we ate and a few business decisions relating to the redesign of my grossly out-dated web site, and I still haven't made anything. But... we now have two separate outdoor rabbit runs for their lordships Septimus and Octavius Frugalus!   This making of stuff outdoors was no thanks to me, of course, as H has been busying himself rounding up scraps of wood and wire to make somewhere safe for the Frugaldom bunnies to enjoy any sunshine we may get.  I did manage to dig out some of our home-grown raspberries from last year, plenty of those still in the freezer. Add to those some homemade blackcurrant jam and a spoonful of honey, cooked it down for a minute in the microwave and then, once cooled, stirred it through the next batch of ice cream - tastes amazing anytime of day or night! Now, I am off to put this little lot together and I promise that I will be back before bedtime tonight to show you the proof that 4 duck egg planters (red one already has a hanger) have macramé hangers.  ﻿﻿﻿  OK, no I'm not - phone rang, lost another hour, now need to make dinner before I can do anything! I sometimes wonder what it's like to be able to just nip out for a takeaway, eat out or have someone else cook you dinner. Still going to try and get the macramé hangers done tonight, though, so do feel free to check back much later for the photographic evidence and thank you, once again, for taking the time to read my inane ramblings.   Edited in: I managed to get one hanger made and am working on the second one now. Did this one two-tone using red and green embroidery thread."},

All I managed to make today was turkey mince and vegetable pie, plus a couple more of the microwave chocolate sponges in mugs! Don't waste any pastry - use it to decorateSHORT CRUST PASTRY160g plain flour25g lard25g margarinepinch of saltcold water to bind the mixI simply crush the lard and margarine into the flour the same way I would make crumble, then add the cold water - I think 2 tablespoons did this lot - then pour it out onto floured surface, shape it, roll it and lay it over a sponge tin that's been covered in greased tin foil. If I don't have any kitchen foil, I just grease the tin.Just out the ovenI suppose decorating the pie counts as making something that's creative. I secure the top to the pie base by coating the rim of overhanging pastry with milk then pressing around the edge with a fork before trimming off the excess using the blunt side of a knife. The trimmings get rolled out again and cut into shapes - leaves this time. Paint the pie with milk, stick on the pastry designs and use the very last of the pastry to make berries to go with your leaves. I draw on the leaves with the sharp edge of my knife, then paint the whole lot again with milk. My pie has been filled with the turkey and mixed vegetables that I cooked then divided up and froze last week.  This size pie does the two of us two meals and costs very little to make. At lunchtime, we had some of the lentil soup followed by my third attempt at microwave mug chocolate sponges. But I still can't get them to bake and stay their original height, they always collapse as soon as I open the microwave door. If anyone else tries these, please let me know and pop a photo onto the food section of www.frugalforums.co.uk so I can see. Have a good weekend, everyone. I will do my best to try and make something a little more creative between now and Monday."},

Another week and it's the Budget then the end of the tax year is almost upon us, when we all need to round up our numbers and get crunching for the annual tax returns! I suspect 2013/14 will prove to be minimal for me, as the past year has been focussed on the renovation project whilst scratching enough income to make self-employment pay.  It is almost 3 years since we bought Thrift Cottage and the pink thrift by the front door is looking like it may start flowering soon. Our fixy-up is meant to be a 5-year project, so we should be approaching 60% of the way to completion. 2 more years to go and then I need to get back to building a self-sustainable business that will provide me with both income and a pension plan, so it's time to make some headway in that direction. Being a frugal Scot and living in Scotland, where we still have both paper £1 notes and paper £100 notes, I feel that the photo above adequately explains what a frugal entrepreneur (frugaleur) is all about - making as much as possible from as little as possible!  I'm Hatching Colourful Plans! Duck egg shells drying before planting cuttings in them What did I make yesterday? Pizzas, spicy stir fry from leftovers and a start on my long-term plan for making everything pay for itself. I did get around to painting my duck egg shells - I now have 4 including the red one - but I still haven't made the macramé hangers for them all. Now I have another 2 duck eggs, as Phoebe is getting right into the swing of spring with her laying schedule. Today, I defrosted some chicken, sliced it in strips, dipped it in egg, coated it in spiced breadcrumbs and made goujons - half got cooked for tonight's dinner and the other half went into the fridge for tomorrow. While washing up, I just happened to look out the window in time to see this little fellow! The foraging VoleIt's a little vole that seems to have taken up residence in the dry stone wall that runs along the side of the patio. Voles are about mouse size but have rounder noses and short tails.  Vole stealing blackberry leaves Mr or Mrs Vole was far too busy to notice me going for my camera. Tiny critter was nibbling off the blackberry leaves and taking them into the wall, obviously for nest building. Scruffy cat spends a great deal of her time just sitting staring at this wall, now we know why! On the windowsill, my red cabbage experiment is looking healthy with several more new leaves growing, particularly around the base. Here's how it is looking at the moment. Red cabbage experimentHas anyone else tried this experiment yet? I would love to know if it really does grow enough to start picking more meals from it. That's about it for today - early night again, as I am enjoying watching the TV series about life on the International Space Station (I'm an ISS spotter) and then there's a very interesting money programme on afterwards about how to be a billionaire. I'll absorb inspiration and see how best to afford whatever they do on my frugal budget then I'll come back and tell you how I became a frugalaire! UK Times for the flyovers by International Space Station For anyone else interested, here is a handy chart of dates and time for looking skywards to watch for the space station flying over us, if the night sky is clear enough. I always wave, not sure why! I'm not that into it that I go out in the middle of the night - I need a really good meteor shower or the chance of catching a glimpse of an aurora for that. Until tomorrow! Let's hope the sunshine returns here soon - seems all the good weather chose to abandon us after one great day and yesterday morning! Still, it was enough to dry the washing on the line and that's what counts for now. :)"},
{"title": "Day 11 of Making it in March - Delicious Syrup Sponge Pudding", "date": "Tuesday 11 March 2014", "text": "Day 11 of 31, the Best Day of the Year so Far!Making the most of the sunshine!This morning dawned frosty and bright, so an early start was in the offing to make the most of the good weather. A good 5-mile walk with my camera built up my appetite, that's for sure! It should also have boosted my Vitamin D levels - frugal health and fitness from the free, outdoor gym. Gorse flowering by the streamThe countryside is coming alive with colour as the grass takes on a fresh flush of green and the plentiful gorse explodes into a myriad of bright yellow flowers! I love gorse (or whins) as it is so utterly versatile! I have promised myself some gorse petal cookies and tea tomorrow, if the sun shines and I can nip out to collect some fresh flowers.Gorse on the hillsideWe are surrounded by gorse bushes - they line the roadside, line nearby fields and cover vast strips of hillside. I love the wood for burning in the stove, it is so flammable it doesn't need much drying to burn. The flowers are edible, so they can be used in salads, tea and for wine-making (or biscuit baking). In the past, this thorny evergreen has been used to fire bread-ovens - it burns exceptionally well - and makes for some unusual garden sculptures, as the wood seldom rots.YellowhammerI made the extra effort to watch for wildlife and birds. We saw many chaffinches, Bluetits, great tits, pied wagtails, dunnocks and buntings, plus the familiar Yellowhammers that flit about the hawthorn. It definitely sounded spring-like out there this morning! The Greylags are still noisily grazing by the loch and the Goldfinches were where we usually see them.Crocuses by the roadsideAlong the way there are many snowdrops, crocuses and daffodils, all growing wild and spreading in their secretive way. I often wonder how the bulbs get to be in some of the places I see them flowering! Out this morning, I found a clump of them torn up by the tractor as it had been along the road hedge-cutting. I stuck what I could back into the ground nearby and brought the remains home to see if I could save them. I've stuck them in a pot out on the patio but don't know if they'll grow, as the actual bulbs have been quite crushed.Buttercup species are poisonousThe first of the buttercups are beginning to flower but, sadly, this isn't anything edible, so no good for foraging.﻿The 'spooky' treeThis is what I call the spooky tree - it leans at a rather precarious angle across the road and, at dusk, looks very imposing as it looms overhead. Against an azure sky, it looks quite spectacular in it's leafless, winter form.Catkins beginning to emergeI remember playing with these when I was a child. We'd go into the woods and collect a handful from the nearest willow and imagine them to be tiny, furry pets, giving them names and building them houses from match boxes! Strange how memories of such simple childhood games can be recalled.RibesWhat a beautiful display the Ribes provides. It grows among the hawthorn here and has a tangle of honeysuckle around it, all growing wild by the roadside. Did you know that Ribes sanguineum was introduced into cultivation by 19th century Scottish botanist David Douglas? We do now.Phoebe laid us another egg today, so her contribution to the household groceries helped finish off the syrup that was crystallising in the last tin in the store cupboard. Microwaved Syrup SpongeMicrowaved syrup sponge is yet another of my favourites because it's so simple and quick to make. If you don't have syrup, use jam. I used equal amounts of sugar, margarine and self-raising flour and beat this all together with the duck egg and a splash of milk, poured the mix over the top of the syrup in a greased, microwaveable bowl, blasted it on full power for 5 minutes and served it hot with milk over the top. Delicious! Just replaced all the calories burned during my 5-mile walk and then some! I now have 3 duck eggs washed and ready to paint and hang in macramé plant pot holders. I WILL make these tomorrow - please remind me! Thank you. Having forgotten to take my 'Food for Free' pocket nook with me today, I don't know if I saw anything else that was worth foraging. I'll remember it tomorrow so I can check while out collecting the gorse flowers, weather permitting. NYK, Frugaldom"},

A one-cup serving has the equivalent of 6g of carbohydrates and two thirds of that is sugar! 'Phoebe' duck has been doing well and producing an egg each day, so I had yesterday's and today's to use, meaning 2 more shells to turn into mini planters. I now have these cut and primed, ready for painting tomorrow, so I'll need to get some more macramé done to keep up with the egg laying. Cheese & onion base for quicheTo use up the remainder of the pastry from pie-making, I rolled it into a tray, added a diced onion and a sprinkle of grated cheese then baked this with the two duck eggs beaten with a little milk, salt and pepper. Quiche for tea tonight and we'll eat the rest tomorrow lunchtime. (Sorry, I forgot to photograph it coming out of the oven.) Onion rerooting - I think?!On the 'veg for free' experiment, the first of those musty peas have begun to sprout in the tin can planters on the window sill and, believe it or not, the ones I threw into the planter at the back door also seem to be germinating! The red cabbage base is amazing, with more and more tiny leaves unfurling all around the base and across the cut surface. The photo above is of the onion base, although I am not convinced this one is at all possible. I mean, how can another onion grow from it? I think someone's kidding me on about this one, but I'll leave if for now. VEGETARIANS & VEGANS, LOOK AWAY NOW!  The above is a competition sponsored by MuscleFood.com and I am hoping that I can gain an entry in order to be in with a chance of winning, so if you haven't already done so, but have been considering it, give them a go for your meat order and have it delivered to your door. Not many can beat £5 per kilo for quality chicken breast fillets. But I have to warn you, their 'exotic meat' section is becoming more and more exotic! Choice of freebies with your first offer I was quite perturbed at seeing horse steaks listed but will admit that I have unwittingly eaten this in the past while on holiday in Europe. Now, however, their free offer for new customers has been expanded to give you a choice of meat free with your first order - tonight I see horse steak is one of them! Not sure what to think of this... but do take a look at what is available to buy for home delivery! It's quite an eye-opener to see:Springbok steak burgersZebra haunch burgersTilapia fillets (I had to search that one to find out it's fish that the southeast of England is apparently going crazy for - recipe included here!)Kangaroo steaksBuffalo stewOstrich steaksHorse meat variety packWhat are your thoughts on the above list of meats and would you eat them? Is it just my upbringing on plain foods? Or perhaps my lack of interest in culinary adventure? Maybe it's simply lack of choice by way of my continued rural lifestyle or it could even be a deeply rooted, Old Testament induced belief on what's 'allowed', as far as the food chain is concerned?  I don't know... I have a fear of the unknown, but perhaps a bigger fear of actually discovering I like something that I otherwise 'shouldn't'. Making my mind up about this could take some time, as I do remember the big meat scandal when authorities discovered container loads of kangaroo meat coming into Britain and ending up in school meals. That was in the late 70's, early 80's, so we do know that this sort of exotic meat has been reaching our shores for the past near 40 years, at least, but ... no! I won't pursue my line of thought because I'll end up sitting until midnight blogging for The Paranoid Times!  NYK, Frugaldom  HUGE FRUGAL SAVINGS!  My entire house will soon be lit by LED light bulbs!  Originally, I completely dismissed this money-saving option owing to the initial costs involved in switching from my existing (free) energy-savers to the even more energy efficient LED light bulbs but, to be honest, I was thoroughly sick of the delay in switching on the energy savers.  There is something distinctly unsettling about switching on something electrical and not getting instant reaction! When it’s something as important as lighting, I find any delay is a potential hazard after dark! Apart from that, I was barely able to read in such appalling light. Then I was given a sample LED light bulb and was instantly converted! Instant light! The 40w version looks, to me, closer to the brightness of an old 60 watt and, best of all, the new LED is using only 4.5w per hour. (For me, that works out about 3p for 4 hours of reading time after dark.)  To put this into bigger savings terms, when I first priced LEDs as a moneysaving option, it was working out at over £200 to convert Frugaldom, hence the delayed changeover! But the prices have gradually come within frugal reach. Now, I could converted my entire house and the garden studio for less than half of the original estimate. Yes, it is an enormous amount of money to spend on light bulbs, but the entire 'bulbery' when every light in the house is switched on will total 156w (I still have double strip light in kitchen), whereas, it was 398w, even allowing for the energy saver light bulbs. That is a huge saving. What's more, I will reduce it by a further 106w (from 2 x 58w to 2 x 5w) once the kitchen is done. An estimated £43 per year compared to £112 for me with potential for a further £20 saving possible on kitchen lighting. That’s enough to convince me! I've been told the bulbs should pay for themselves within 6 months and then from thereon in, I’m making real cash-in-the-bank savings! … Read more here NYK Media, Frugaldom This post supported by Lightbulbs-direct.com by way of my free trial light bulb."},
{"title": "Day 9 of Making it in March - Bread and Butter Pudding", "date": "Sunday 9 March 2014", "text": "Day 9 of 31 - Making Something Different Every Day in MarchIt's Sunday, I had a friend visiting this afternoon, I haven't done any crafting, but we did get a second duck egg and not one, but TWO chicken eggs from our feathered friends in the garden, so that made my day! Friend brought me a carton of milk from the village store while on her way here, so that will take me up to 5 empties for another project that I want to try - making a vertical garden using a pallet, cup hooks, garden canes and recycled milk cartons. 'Mishy' from sunny Suffolk will be running this year's 'vertical growing pods' challenge in the Frugal Forums. My delay in starting this project is that I get so few plastic milk cartons here - I mostly get UHT in the waxed cardboard litre cartons. I'm saving what I can and will ask a neighbour if they'll save me some. Back to today - what did I make? The extra milk and the eggs are a clue - the duck egg shell has been kept to make another tiny planter and the eggs got combined with the milk not to make French toast for breakfast, as I'd envisaged, but bread and butter pudding! Frugal bread and butter pudding Ingredients EggsMilkBreadMargarineSugar (I used my homemade vanilla pod sugar.)SultanasCinnamon Method I used 3 slices of homemade bread with the crusts removed - these get turned into breadcrumbs and go in the freezer. Cut the bread to preferred size and spread with margarine/buttery spread. Sit these in an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with sultanas or raisins, sugar and cinnamon, then repeat for the next layer of your sandwiches. Beat the egg and milk together (as though for scrambling) then pour it over the contents of the dish. Add another sprinkle of dried fruit, sugar and cinnamon then cover the dish in tin foil and pop it into the oven until the egg mix has baked. Mine took about 40 minutes at 180 Deg C in the mini oven. Bread and butter puddingThis is very filling, so the 3 slices of bread is sufficient for 4 servings, at least. We ate ours hot with a little extra milk over the top. You can microwave this dish and it cooks in minutes, but I was already cooking rice to go with some sweet chilli chicken. It did mean that I was able to warm all the plates on top of the mini oven and have a warm kitchen. Making... Important Decisions! Owing to the nature of Frugaldom, it derives very little by way of income. Let's face it, you read this for a reason and it's not because you have a huge income and millions in the bank. My blog caters for a very specific section of society - those living below the breadline. I am a genuine frugaler who genuinely lives on my £4,000 and I earn less than minimum wage: I NEED to be frugal. I NEED to steer clear of debt and attempt to save to protect my own future. But I also NEED to earn my income in the first place. For the majority of my working life I have been self-employed, which means no unemployment or sickness benefits to fall back on and no employer paying my tax and insurance, or even guaranteeing me an income in the first place. However... Online is where my business exists and that is where I need to focus my energy. I have several blogs, forums, websites and social media accounts so I have had to give this a great deal of thought to help determine the right route to take.   If you would like to follow Frugaldom on Twitter for the frugal living, money saving, penny pinching, budget busting, cost cutting blogs that include baking, making, cooking, crafting, gardening and recycling, then you should follow @Frugaldom  If you would like to follow NYK Media, where I write and blogs for my income while pursuing a career as a frugal entrepreneur with an active interest in horse racing (it can be frugal, I tell you!), then please follow the newer account @Frugaleur Just as we have money-saving and money-making challenges on the forums, so too do I have money-saving and money-making Twitter accounts, blogs and websites. Back to normal tomorrow with the workaday things and ever hopeful of some sunshine soon. We ended up with more fog here this afternoon, then the rain returned this evening. I need to get into the garden soon! NYK, Frugaldom"},

(I know it's Phoebe's because 'Custard Cream' lays pale green eggs and 'Oreo' lays blue eggs.) Cue an attempt at making one of those eggshell planters to hang in a home made mini macramé potholder.Scoring the egg shellI used a filleting knife to gently saw through the narrower end of the egg - don't cut right through, we want to save the egg inside for cooking!Empty egg shellOnce sliced through enough to open the end off the egg, tip the contents into a dish or cup and put them in the fridge to use up for cooking. (Think I might make bread and butter pudding tomorrow!)Wash out the shell before priming itAfter giving the shell a good wash, allow it to stand upside down to drip dry and then give it a couple of coats of bonding - I used my PVA glue. This strengthens the shell. Omit this stage if you are planning on sowing seeds in it because once the seeds germinate, you can simply plant the entire egg shell into the ground. Painting the eggshellOnce the bonding had dried, I used food colouring to paint this first shell a rosy red! I'll try different colours, depending on what I find in the baking cupboard.Duck eggshell planter I selected a brown embroidery thread and then knotted up another of the mini macramé hangers. (See earlier post for how to make these.) The colouring wasn't properly dried in time for me to plant up this shell for photographing, but I'll do that tomorrow. I have taken a couple more cuttings from my Money (Jade) Plant, so they should be ready to pot by then. Turkey mince pie And finally, for today, there were a couple of other makes! I made a batch of ice cream for daughter to take home with her and I made some pastry to turn some of the turkey 'Nile' mince into a pie to mark the end of National Pie Week! This one has turkey mince, sage  & onion stuffing and mixed vegetables already added to the filling. As usual, I forgot to photograph it when it came out the oven, so this is what's left of it. There is still sufficient mince to make another pie, so I've frozen that for future use. If I count a pie as 4 portions, my 400g pack of turkey mince stretched to 12 meals, six for each of us here. NYK, Frugaldom"},

It is 15 years ago this week since issue 1 hit the shelves in March 1999.  I'm dedicating this post to all the writers who have taken part in our writing, publishing and crafting projects over the past 15 years!  To each and every one of you, I am truly grateful - you helped create NYK despite all odds. The financial aspects of every project played a pivotal part and we may not have 'made it big' but do you know what? We survived it all and are still here to tell the stories. So many memories, from our frugal wine tasters/reviewers (The Plonkers) to our grocery challengers, recipe contributors, roving reporters and wannabe investigative journalists who got our little monthly rag into all sorts of pickles! Bring back Millie May, Eddie Elwood, the Woman Zone and every other part of it, I say! Jordan, Armand, Rovin' Ronnie, McDade, Rosemary, Derum... OK, getting back to recycling, let's not pulp, bin, burn or bury this book, let's try... Making a Secret Book Making a secret book This is quite self explanatory but I have to hold up my hands and say that it is much easier said than done when it comes to making something like this. As a bibliophile, I had a serious problem finding a hardback book that I could bring myself to mutilate! After several attempts, I failed to put the knife into the bedraggled Greek text copy of Homer's 'Odyssey' and, instead, had to opt for one that was rescued from someone else's bin! Step 1 Cover the book in kitchen film the way you used to cover school books. Include a few of the front pages to allow for any sticky mistakes while gluing. Close the book and paint all around the page edges with a clear-setting glue. I used ordinary PVA glue for this. Sit something heavy on top once you're done and leave to dry. Making a secret book Step 2 Open the book carefully to make sure all the pages remain glued together. The cover and first few pages should be glue free, as they were protected by the kitchen film. Draw a box on the top page. I used a small ruler and drew the ruler's width in from the page edge. Next, using an awl or nail or similar, make a hole in each corner of the box you just drew; these will be your cutting markers. I used a crafting blade for this next bit - carefully begin slicing out the pages within the lines you just drew, cutting from one corner hole to the next. This creates the secret compartment within your book. I lined mine with a piece of glossy paper. Next, paint glue around the inside cut edges to bind these together. Close the book, give the outside page edges another coat of glue, sit a heavy object on the closed book and leave for the glue to set. I'll upload a photo of the finished project tomorrow - my glue hasn't fully set yet.Edited in - photos of the finished 'secret book' using old batteries to show the size of the storage space inside it. Would have used a bar of chocolate or wad of cash if I had any of those things - I like the chocolate idea best! :)﻿﻿The secret book.NOW, LET'S TALK MINCE!Turkey mince, that is! Remember I mentioned the superb offer I managed to bag from MuscleFood*? 400g Norfolk Turkey mince for £1, maximum 5 per customer? Well this is what I have done with the first pack. Making fresh turkey burgers Ingredients: turkey mince, onion, herbs, salt, pepper, bread crumbs, egg, cheap sage & onion stuffing - I mixed all of these together in a baking bowl. If you don't have breadcrumbs, here's how I do mine: Making bread crumbsI'm sure I'll be showing my age here, but  does anyone remember making these as children helping mum in the kitchen? We'd simply rub two pieces of dry bread together until it crumbled. It seemed to take forever! Nowadays, it takes seconds to chop some dry bread and give it a whizz with a stick blender. Store all your extra crumbs in a bag in the freezer. Making turkey burgers After scrubbing up and getting in there, mixing the meat, I removed 4 handfuls and shaped each in the same way you make fishcakes. These got coated in bread crumbs and then fried in a little oil. Served with oven-baked hash browns and mixed vegetables made for a filling meal.  The remainder of the mix has now had the last of the bag of frozen mixed vegetables added to it and has been refrigerated for cooking tomorrow. I'll slow cook it with some gravy and then treat it like 'Nile' mince.NYK, Frugaldom* Friend referral link includes code for 4 free chicken fillets with your first order."},

The day began early, as I didn't want to miss the coalman when he was driving along the lane. The coal bunker was almost empty, so best filling it up in the hope that it does us through to spring. 5 x 50kg bags costs £70 and we get through about 10kg each day the fire is lit. Price wise, there isn't much difference between coal and logs, except the coal, in this house, also heats 5 radiators and the water, not just one room. I made the most of the extra 'morning time' and baked the remaining cookie dough (mango, apricot, fig, pistachio & almond) then baked a lemon drizzle cake, but added in some of the mango pulp to try and use that up, too. POTATOESSeed potatoes 'chitting' in egg cartonsThe above are my 2014 indulgence of the year, so far - heritage seed potatoes! On the left are the Shetland Blacks that arrived a couple of weeks ago and on the right are my Salad Blues, which arrived a couple of days ago. They are sitting in cardboard egg boxes to allow them to 'chit'. ('Chitting' is the gardeners' term for letting them start to sprout.) The Shetland Black is a dark-skinned potato with white flesh that carries a blue/purple ring around it. The Salad Blue, which isn't really a salad potato, is my favourite of all time, both for growing and eating. These stay deep purple throughout cooking, so you can get some very colourful and interesting mash! The potato peelings I keptLast month, during my 'Extremely Frugal February' challenge, we had a fabulous time stretching the pennies as far as they would go. It was a month of finding out just how extreme we could be in our quest for moneysaving and zero waste, so even the potato peelings were being saved. (Link to post) Planting the sprouted potato skinMy potato peelings are normally treated as organic waste and added to the compost, fed to the garden poultry (potato peelings need to be cooked first), added to the wormery or used to bank the fire at night. But I wanted to show you that from one potato can come many, so I picked out the best sprouted piece of peel and it has now been planted into a tub on the patio. With care and luck, this piece of peel that would otherwise have been discarded has the potential to produce over 1kg of potatoes.TIN CAN PLANTERSMaking tin can planters safeI do love my tin cans - I'm collecting them all for a specific summer project but keep dipping into them for other things! Before you make anything from them, make sure all the sharp edges have been flattened.Don't forget to add drainage holes in the bottom of the tinsI managed to fit a dozen tin cans onto an old baking tray. I'm using a piece of non-slip rubber mesh underneath so there's no water-logging.Ready for plantingRemember the damp pea and bean seeds that I washed and soaked to try and save them? I have now filled each of these tins with compost and vermiculite and added a row each of the runner beans, dwarf beans and peas. We'll soon know if they are still 'alive'.  Wrapped wallpaper around them to prevent spillsAfter wrapping some old wallpaper around all the tins, I sat the tray on the windowsill and have topped it with the glass out of the broken picture frame. (You know the one - I used part of it to make the apex roof for the cat's den yesterday.)SPROUTING BEANS INTO BEAN SPROUTSMung BeansFrugal living means making the most of anything we can make or grow for ourselves. Mung beans are great for sprouting and adding into salads and stir fries and let's face it - frugalers love their home grown salads and their 'leftovers' stir fries. But how do we sprout mung beans without a fancy, extravagant sprouter? Homemade frugal sprouterGet a clean jar with a screw cap metal lid, a hammer and an awl. You don't even need the hammer, as most jar lids are now thin enough to pierce with minimal force. Now punch a whole load of holes in the lid - do this on top of thick card or a folded towel to avoid scoring or puncturing floors or worktops. Now give everything a final rinse.Hey presto! A homemade sprouterPlace a couple of handfuls of mung beans in the jar and rinse them several times with water. Take the lid off to add the water, screw it back on again to drain the water back out of the jar. Easy drainerI'm leaving my mung beans to soak for 24 hours before giving them a final rinse. I'll follow up this post with progress as and when I see anything happening in the jar, which is now on a shelf in my kitchen.HOT DOGS IN HOT DOGS99p bread mix and cheap hot dogsNow before anyone starts commenting about the unhealthy aspects of this snack, hold your typing fingers still and let me explain - this was an inexpensive and fun experiment and if we were having it as a proper meal, I would normally serve this with onions, cheese and tomato and/or plenty of salad stuff. Today, however, lunch was just a hot dog with tomato ketchup. Cost = less than 5p per person! Worth a shilling for the novelty factor alone!﻿Knead and prove your doughBit of cheating going on here as I am using the 99p per 3.5kg bread roll mix I got from Approved Food*, so it's a simple case of 'just add water', mix, knead, rest, knead, rest, split into finger roll size, wrap around a cheap hot dog, leave to prove for 20 minutes then bake for about 20 minutes.- PHOTOS DELETED -﻿I did take a full set of progress photos but to be perfectly blunt, I fear some may have found them obscene! So here is the finished article.Use smaller pieces of dough for legs and earsBake the rolls with the hot dogs inside them - I used the cheap tinned hot dogs, I think they were 5 tins for £1 from Approved Food when I bought them!Hot dog rollsI made only two 'hot dogs in hot dogs', one for each of us here in Frugaldom. I got some very curious looks when I presented 'the dog' on a plate at lunchtime today, that's for sure! We'll need to eat the other rolls tomorrow lunchtime to use up the rest of the hotdogs, too!  Now I am retiring to bed with a cup of tea and planning out my next phase of rag rugging!NYK, FrugaldomReferences and acknowledgementshttp://www.goodshomedesign.com/hot-dog-dog/* Friend referral link - thank you for my £1 commission earned this week. :)"},
{"title": "Day 4 of Making It In March - How to Make a Cat Den #MIIM", "date": "Tuesday 4 March 2014", "text": "Day 4 of 31 - It's Pancake Day!March 11th - 14th, conversations with 42 global leaders - free online event!Pancakes all Round!This morning when I got up, the sun was shining through the living room window and onto the newly hung mini plant pot holders - there was a little bit of heat, briefly, until the sun shifted round another degree and out of reach of any of my windows - a definite minus point in the house 'directional facing' stakes!We forewent the usual porridge at breakfast in favour of pancakes, but I cheated and used a cheap 'just add water or milk' packet mix and, of course, added water. I like my pancakes made crepe-style, so the batter covers the entire frying pan. This makes them large enough and thin enough to roll them up and serve hot with fillings, depending on what's available.They shouldn't be too dark, I prefer mine just lightly cooked then flipped. These are so cheap and easy to make that we do tend to have them quite often throughout the year, especially when the ducks are laying. Scoop of flour, pinch of salt, an egg and some milk to the consistency that you most prefer - that's it! They are versatile enough to serve sweet or savoury, with a variety of toppings.For me, it's usually a sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice, as Maple syrup just isn't on the frugal grocery list. Ordinary syrup is nice, as is a handful of strawberries and a dollop of ice cream and/or cream, but that's more of a 'use up the garden strawberries and homemade ice cream' combination. Today, I had mango!Pancakes were my first 'make' of 'Making it in March', but now for a Frugaldom special announcement ...HAPPY BIRTHDAY SILKIE, 5 YEARS OLD TODAY!On this day, five years ago, my first little Silkie chick hatched out in the polystyrene incubator despite the abuse the eggs had taken during their journey to me via Royal Mail. I'd bought half a dozen hatching eggs via eBay and the box arrived looking like someone had kicked it! Despite this, I set the eggs, turned them faithfully every few hours for 18 days and then waited patiently for day 21 to arrive in the hope that something would hatch - without holding out too much hope, I might add!On 4th March, 2009, out popped one solitary Silkie chick, one that we aptly named 'Silkie Chick'. She is still known by that name to this day, a full five years later! This is her hatching from her shell inside the tiny incubator that was set up on my desk at the time. Sadly, none of the other eggs hatched, so this chick ended up being reared in a cardboard box in the porch and preferred to behave more like a dog than a chicken! She was cheeky right from the start! She did eventually settle with the other hens and we did get her Silkie company by way of little Dumbledorf. We eventually hatched another 5 blue cuckoo striped Silkies for additional company and, over the years, Silkie Chick has hatched and reared a few chicks herself, but she is now the only furry-looking bantam we have left after a mink went on the rampage in broad daylight in October 2011. Little Silkie Chick, here, survived the attack only because she was hiding inside the rabbit hutch where she had decided to lay her eggs! Daft old bird!But I digress, again! On to more 'Making it in March'. I made it into the kitchen to unpack my latest 'MuscleFood'* order: 5 kilos of chicken breast fillets, 2 kilos of turkey mince and a kilo of boned chicken thighs. Yes, we BUY our chicken - you didn't really think we ate any of our own home-hatched or home-reared birds, did you? Anyhow, this lot arrived and I managed to fit it all into the freezer after splitting it up - the turkey mince was on offer at £1 per 400g pack with maximum 5 per customer, so I got my 5. The chicken thighs were paid using loyalty points, thanks to online friends who have used my referral links and codes. This order should keep us going for the next couple of months, as I still have plenty of beef mince, bacon and pie filling in the freezer. But not only that, the order included an added free gift... A CAT DEN! Scruffy Cat will love it, I'm sure! :)Remember all the 'rubbish' leftover after unpacking the new living room door? Pieces of polystyrene, 4 plastic corner protectors, 4 strips of thin wooden board, assorted spacers, board edge protectors etc.? I finally found a way to recycle some of this 'rubbish', along with the cardboard box and insulated liner that came with the meat order this afternoon. Naturally, I saved the ice packs into the freezer.﻿Turning a cardboard box into a cat denI started by removing the flaps from the box so I could use these to create a roof with 'attic' space for storing all the cat's toys.Making a door in the insulated box liner Next thing I did was to cut an entrance (and exit) door in the insulated box liner, roughly the size of a small cat flap.Making the apex roof with attic spaceIs anyone else trying this? Take the four cardboard flaps cut from the box and pair them up - one long and one short - lengthwise. Overlap the longest piece over the shortest piece where you will be folding it in half to create the apex roof. I initially used tape before gluing it in place. You should now have two equal lengths of cardboard. Fold these in half to form a right angle. This is where I was lucky to have saved the door packaging, because I was able to use the corner protectors to hold the cardboard at the 90 degree angle by gluing in the plastic, but you could simply fold and glue scrap cardboard. Do the same with the second strip and then these need to be joined together, side by side.Reinforcing the apex roofI used three of the four plastic corner protectors for the roof - one at each end and one in the middle and, rather than glue it all together with more cardboard, I used two of the pieces of board from my 'rubbish' stash. If you glue your board or card about 6cm from the edge of the cardboard, it makes a small ledge that helps to prevent the roof slipping while gluing it to the box.Adding the roof to the boxBefore adding the roof, I covered the main box in fabric - I used some more of the old fleece that I had covered my homemade footstools in a couple of weeks ago. Next, I replaced the insulation liner and glued it into place. I reinforced the front of the box using a third piece of board.Next, I used the little folded pieces of stiff card and glued then along each of the side edges of the box and then glued the roof onto these. I was left with one plastic corner piece from my 'rubbish' stash, so this gave me another idea! I had also kept the pieces from a broken A4 picture frame - the type you see in pound shops. (The glass didn't break, so that got kept, too.) I used the two longer pieces of the frame as edging for the cardboard roof and joined them together using the fourth corner piece as a feature at the peak of the apex.Side view of the cat house in constructionBefore doing any more work on the cat's house, I decided to introduce the frugal puss to her new 'den', just to make sure she actually fitted through the door! As you can see, I haven't added any roof décor or edges to the attic space.Scruffy cat investigating her new 'den'Another rummage in my crafty stash and this time I was able to retrieve someone's unfinished project that was sent to me for recycling into McGonk stuffing. Using my largest crochet hook, I crocheted the last of the ball of wool onto what was already there; it made a near perfect sized cat blanket for lining the bottom of the box.Woolly blanket for the cat's new bedBlanket completed, I fitted it into the box and then waited for the cat to pass judgement. Her first reaction was to go inside and play 'paddy-paw' on her new fluffy blanket, so I think she approves.Let sleeping cats lie.That's as far as I got with Project Cat's Den today, so I'll need to continue with this project tomorrow, when I'll add the attic pieces and get the roof tiled - I'm sure I have enough scrap cardboard in stock to cut and overlay cardboard shingles, rather than just paint the roof. :) I want to start doing that right now but, once again, the day has passed far too quickly. Now it's almost time to find the cat's pyjamas!NYK, Frugaldom* Friend referral link, which has the potential to earn me a few extra loyalty points."},
{"title": "Day 3 of Making it in March - Mini Macrame Plant Pot Holders", "date": "Monday 3 March 2014", "text": "Day 3 of 31 - Get Knotted! It's March, Spring is supposed to be in the air and the first flush of green can be seen along the roadsides, where snowdrops are still flourishing and daffodils are beginning to bud. Keeping in mind that the only sun that gets into our house, at the moment, is a brief glimmer first thing in the morning, there is limited space for growing anything on the windowsills, unless... I hang the pots in the window so they catch every available ray!Having sourced an excellent online guide to help me refresh my memory of knotting string, something we did a great deal of up until the late 90s, when I was still making hay nets from baling twine, I set about making myself a macramé pot hanger. Trouble was, I didn't have any string, so I had to use wool.  This first type of wool, a really chunky type, turned out to be too thick for making a delicate, mini-pot holder, so I ended up using a small tin, instead. This is going to be used to sow half a dozen cherry tomato seeds. Once (if) they germinate, they can be transferred to a tin each until large enough to harden off for repotting in the greenhouse..Remember the plastic lid I saved from the can of cream? My next hanger was of a much more delicate nature - made from embroidery thread. This was relatively quick and easy to make, so I shall be making several of these and they can be suspended from a rail held across the window by the existing cup hooks that get used for holding the thermal blind in place during winter. For the photo, this one had been hung from the door handle but I now have one each side of my window - not sure what the neighbours will think of this! :)Money Plant (Jade Plant) cuttingAs you can see, I have planted a Jade/Money Plant cutting into this carton and, with luck, it will flourish and be strong enough to go to its new home in a few weeks - Anne, this one has your name on it. I have made 2 of the embroidery thread macramé pot hangers so far but am planning on making a kaleidoscope of colours to hang in the windows - with the embroidery threads, I can colour co-ordinate to match or contrast the décor and decorate the pots accordingly.The tutorial on the Tuts+ website, which is what I used, is very simple to follow - all you need are the items shown in my first photograph. Even at that, you could simply use a piece of board and a bulldog clip or clothes pegs to hold the string in place while you work.Have fun making mini macramé pot holders - if my ducks ever start laying again, I shall replace the pots in mine with egg shells for my seedlings.Guess I'd best go make supper now - frugal chicken fajitas, anyone?NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 2 of Making it in March - Frugal Room Fragrance", "date": "Sunday 2 March 2014", "text": "Day 2 of 31 Days of Making in in MarchAll Natural Air Freshener / Room Scent Dismal day of rain and fogMy plan to make the effort to get out and walk more has ground to a temporary halt today, owing to the ferocity of the torrential rain and my fair-weather attitude to exercise. I ventured no further than a neighbour's house to hand in a cheesecake. Today was definitely an indoors type of day! Where should I start? I made my bed and made it downstairs - that should count for something on a day like this, shouldn't it? I lit the fire, chatted with a couple of neighbours who arrived and then it turned into a bit of a swapathon - I love a bit of bartering! I now have onions, bacon and hash browns that I didn't have when I woke this morning, not to mention what I've made since then. Making Mango Cookies Mango, apricot & pistachio with fig and almondAs many of you will know, I love experimenting with biscuit baking and sweet making, so today became a biscuit day. I'm still using up the first tin of mango pulp that I bought (4 tins for £1) and I have about a dozen blocks each of the fruit paste that's meant for serving with cheese - another bulk buy for pennies. I couldn't spare any eggs today; neither the hens nor the ducks are laying, so the mango pulp and fruit paste got added to the cookie dough. I didn't weigh or measure anything - I had the last of a bag of wholemeal self-raising flour to be used up, I melted some cheap margarine along with the two fruit blocks, added a spoonful of sugar and then started mixing in the flour, using the mango pulp where I'd normally use eggs. I split the mix, as I have only enough space for one tray in my mini oven, and the remainder of the cookie dough is in the fridge for another day. Next time, I'll omit the sugar. Making Cheesecake Blackcurrant cheesecakeWhile the biscuits were baking, I made two of the packet cheesecakes (4 packs for £1 from Approved Food*) and left them to set in the fridge while making the blackcurrant topping. It's just a tablespoon of homemade blackcurrant jelly mixed with a couple of handfuls of blackcurrants. I still have about 5kg of garden grown berries in the freezer, so no shortage of these here. One cheesecake went to the neighbours and one we have kept. Making Knitted Blankets The long-awaited pink blanketOwing to the awful weather, I decided to spend this afternoon finishing off the long-awaited, pink, fluffy blanket. This is the third blanket I have knitted over the past year and this one is for youngest grand daughter, as she loves pink and lilac. I really do hope she likes it - it is so warm and fluffy, but a bit of a nightmare sewing the strips together after having knitted them on large needles! I am pleased with the finished result and equally pleased that it's completed. Making Frugal Fragrance Air Fresheners Citrus fruit, cloves and cinnamon stickI first saw this 'recipe' on a site called 'The Yummy Life' when it was shared on Facebook. This is my 'frugalised' version, as I used what was to hand rather than wandering outside to rummage in the rain-battered herb garden. I had 3 limes waiting to be sliced and frozen, so I used half and froze the other half. From my baking cupboard, I found cloves (I use these mainly for marzipan fruit making) and a small cinnamon stick. Recycling another jarFind yourself an empty jar and a piece of something bright - I found this lovely little piece of ribbon among my crafting stash, just long enough to go around the neck of my jar. Warm the jar slightly by swirling some hot water around in it, then place all your ingredients into the jar and cover them with boiling water.   That's it, a simple case of infusing whatever scents you like in a jar of hot water. In the original instructions, which can be found here, the infusion gets simmered and can be used in place of oil in a burner, but I found my combination a strong enough fragrance vaporising from the jar cooling in a safe corner of the room.  I now can't wait to experiment with other scents that look this pretty. Many years ago (about 40!), as a child, my friends and I would do this with rose petals, lavender or mint in jam jars of rain water, shaking them every day and making our own perfume. Today's make reminds me of those days, so let's think of today's scented make as the 'grown up' version. Come summer, of course, I love nothing more than the heady aroma of sweet pea blossoms, which I try to have in all the downstairs rooms. Confession Time I tasted my room fragrance! All the ingredients were food quality from my kitchen and this smelled so good that I had to taste it once it had cooled... and yes, it could easily make a lovely twist for a wee dram of whisky or even as an addition to cheap lemonade. In fact,. with a bit of sweetening - honey, perhaps - it could make a refreshing drink all on it's own! I reckon the liquid would make far better ice cubes than plain water, too. :) That's it, day 2 of March done and dusted and tomorrow there will be something new to write about in the Frugaldom household. Then, it will almost be time to make pancakes! NYK, Frugaldom *Friend referral link"},
{"title": "Day 1 of Making it in March - My Indoor Garden #MIIM", "date": "Saturday 1 March 2014", "text": "Day 1 of 31 - Attempting to Make Something Every Day in March Here we are in March already! The day began bright and then there was a tremendous downpour here, but it soon cleared and the sunshine actually brought a tiny bit of warmth with it. By mid-morning, it was looking positively spring-like, although I'm not easily fooled, after last March! This month's challenge in the frugal forums is called 'Making it in March'. It is all about making things rather than buying them, making decisions not to spend, making our way along the frugal path of life, pretty much making anything we want to try making, really. I have been sharing dozens of ideas and suggestions via my Facebook pages so I can check back to see which to try making this month.My 'makes' for today were fairly simple and all of them free! I made the decision to pull on my boots and go for a walk, in an effort to regain some fitness and start losing the many pounds in weight I have gained over winter. This is always so much easier said than done but having challenged myself to blog every day about these challenges, it might provide me with some extra incentive.The outdoor gym - slow pace, beginner levelToday I went to the free outdoor gym and did 3 miles on the local treadmill. While there, I took some photographs to make an online album of progress. You should be able to see the full album HERE without needing to register or log into Facebook.Lunch was a cup of soup with a slice of bread and then it was time to make something constructive. First, a wander around the garden and into the greenhouse to check progress on some cuttings.﻿﻿Close up of the tiny flower emerging from House Leek in the gardenI am quite amazed that succulents can survive our cold climate but mine are doing rather well. In fact, this one, which is outside in the garden planted in a recycled car wheel with tyre still fitted, is showing signs of flowering! The cuttings from this plant are growing well, as are all the others. This gave me an idea!My homemade, indoor succulent gardenNeighbour had sent me along some leftover salad stuff for feeding to the Frugaldom hens and rabbits, so I recycled the disposable plastic bowl into a mini-succulents garden by filling it with a mix of compost, vermiculite, pebbles and the cuttings I had in the greenhouse. I'm not up on names of plants, so I'd to search online and guess. The rosette shaped one turns deep burgundy, almost black in summer sunlight, it is a Black Tree Aeonium, apparently also known as houseleek tree or Irish rose. Alongside this I have a couple more cuttings from my money plant (also known as Jade Plant), a tiny Aloe Vera, a rooted cutting from Phyllis, my aging Epiphyllum (Easter Cactus) I got via Freecycle about 6 or 7 years ago, some Sedum and cuttings from my House Leek, which is the one that's about to flower outside in the garden.I'm really pleased with how my tiny oasis turned out and really hope that it flourishes. My mini-succulents garden shall be counted as my 'make' for the first day of the 'Making it in March' challenge. Cost = NIL, as I had everything I needed to put this together.While outside 'paying' in the garden, I made up a couple more plastic tubs as mini propagators and have now sown a few salad leaves and some cayenne pepper seeds. It will take them some time to germinate, even indoors is less than 10 degrees C first thing in the morning before the fire gets lit, but it's a start.Off to do an hour's blanket sewing now, hope everyone has had a good day and please feel free to join in this month's moneysaving challenge to 'Make it in March'.NYK, Frugaldom﻿"},

We stayed out until about 1am and saw nothing. I was so disappointed, having convinced myself that we would catch a tiny glimmer. It just didn't reach our corner of Scotland, despite being reported as far south as Essex. I did spot four meteors/shooting stars streaking overhead, though, and the sky was amazing with the millions of stars on display.By way of compensation, my Approved Food* order arrived today, all £15.01 of it! 400 bread rolls' worth of mix for £3.96, so that's less than a penny per roll and enough to see us to the end of the year. Bit disappointed in the quality of the potatoes but I have my seed potatoes at the ready to start chitting (sprouting prior to planting) them soon. With luck, we'll be eating home grown by summer.Now for some really extreme frugaling! When opening the orders, they are always strapped with the nylon braided tapes. I have used these in the past to make streamers to hang in the garden as bird scarers but I thought I would try a bit of weaving. Seems to work, so I won't be throwing any more in the bin - I'm sure there are plenty of other things that can be made from them. I used up the remaining 4 mini-naan breads from the open pack with another tin of tomatoes, herbs, pepper and a single portion of cheese for each of us - I had my usual pickle with mine. Last night's chilli con-coction was too much for two people and H doesn't really like chilli, so I can't serve it 2 nights in a row. I went rummaging again and came up with a plan - but now the leftover chilli and rice has turned into another 6 meals! Look away now if you don't like to see the 'before' version of frugal meals...Mixing the rice and chilli concoction with sage & onion stuffingI mixed a cheap pack of stuffing with last night's leftover chilli and added the rice into this, as well.  I haven't a clue how this is going to turn out but I do have a vague idea of how I expect it to taste.Filling the Cannelloni tubes with the mix I've less than half a box of the cannelloni tubes left but after filling the 11 of them, I still have some of the chilli mix left to use - I spy cabbage! Filling in the gaps to use excess mix I peeled off a large cabbage leaf, split it and wrapped this around the remainder of the chilli concoction mix - haven't made stuffed cabbage in a while! The last scoop of mix got packed into the corner of my dish.Frugal version of cannelloni - FrugalloniI poured the jar of tomato and herb sauce over the filled pasta tubes and used half of the 25p tin of cheese chopped over the top. The other half has been wrapped in tin foil and put in the fridge for later use. This is my largest lasagne baking dish, which usually provides enough for 6. Everything was crossed in the hope this tasted OK.Looks OK to me! Tasted lovely!Baked the dish in the mini oven for about an hour and then gave it a quick blast under the grill to bubble the cheese. It tastes excellent to me, even H was quite impressed with it! We followed our Frugalloni meal with a bowl of 10p strawberry instant whip - not the healthiest option, but there has to be some vitamin and calcium content in milk dessert, hasn't there?This living on £4,000 for the year is still fun! I have been doing this for years and, as all the debts slowly disappeared and savings began to build, I stuck with it to enable me to build up more savings. This year is no different and it's certainly no easier, what with the price of electricity, coal and fresh produce forever increasing in price. Hopefully there will be a point at which the garden has been sufficiently reclaimed and redeveloped to provide all the fruit and vegetables needed by the household but, until then, most foodstuff needs to be bought. Spending during February has been kept to an absolute minimum, although there were still a few pounds spent on non-essentials. My £4,000 is for absolutely everything relating to the household except Council Tax, as I have no control over the price of that - it is compulsory and costs just shy of £1,000 for the year. We don't pay the waste water part, as there's no drainage system where we live, but we do have mains water here, so that chare is included in your Council Tax if you live in Scotland. Extremely frugal February has seen the following spends:Groceries: £36.39Electricity: NIL - I topped the pre-payment meter right up to last us all winterCoal: £70 for 5 bagsOther: £6.32 + £7.52 in vouchers for coffee filters, firelighters and some thermal mugs.Telephone & Internet: £15.79 (line rental paid in advance for 12 months)Deliveries: £10.50House Insurance: £145.78 (buildings & contents for 12 months)Donations: £5.00 to a very brave friend who is doing a charity abseil down the Forth Bridge in May. (See here for details)Total cash spends for February £289.78Monthly average budget is £333.33, so I am about 13% under this month, despite a couple of big spends. I haven't ventured further than neighbours' houses other than our late-night walking expedition in search of the Northern Lights. Tomorrow is day 1 of 'Making it in March'. It's about making absolutely anything except debt - food, gardens, clothes, gifts, recycled goods, savings, money, changes, amends... almost anything goes, you decide!

{"title": "Day 27 of Extremely Frugal February", "date": "Thursday 27 February 2014", "text": "Day 27 of 28 - the Penultimate Day of this Pound-Stretching Challenge!Stretching my money as far as possible February has been all about putting even more effort into wasting even less than normal, trying harder to keep the non-essential spending minimised without compromising quality of life and stretching every pound even further. Some might say that my life doesn't consist of much but I happen to like living within my meagre means, maintaining my debt freedom and helping support others who want to try to live a simpler, self-sustainable life. I'm neither penniless nor poverty-stricken, it's a simple case of 'the less I spend, the more I can afford'. Hopefully I'll continue to sleep soundly in my bed at night without worrying about money problems. After last night's efforts at baking the chocolate cake in a mug, I had a second attempt at lunchtime today, this time using quarter of the mix in each mug. This worked out far better and tasted just as delicious as last night's, although this time it was served with some of the homemade coconut and mango ice cream. It's pure greed, really, because despite breakfast being porridge, lunch was filling homemade soup with a thick slice of homemade bread, followed by the delicious 'cakiness' of the Guinness and chocolate sponge cake. I should have used up the remaining pittas from the open pack, so they'll need to get 'pizzafied' tomorrow lunchtime. The big pan of soup has now been decanted into recycled margarine tubs and moved into the freezer for safe keeping. After having had two lunches for two from it, there's still enough in the freezer for another 16 good-sized servings. That's 20 servings for less than £2.00! Today is National Chili Day (possibly more of a celebration in USA), so I thought we'd celebrate with the addition of some chilli in tonight's frugal dinner. The little character on the left is 'Chilli McGonk'. I made him for a  local start-up company that is now growing from strength to strength, (no pun intended) with their chilli based preserves. (www.gallowaychillies.co.uk) Being a frugaler, I make all my own preserves but it doesn't mean I don't try my best to help support local business. I'd taken a carton of the 'Nile' mince from the freezer to defrost, then had a quick survey of the fridge for any leftovers - it brought about an odd combination!  I still have several tins of the 9p Red Kidney Beans in Chilli Sauce, so guess what all got added to the mince and left to simmer while the rice cooked?﻿﻿Dinner was a somewhat strange chilli concoction, rather than con carne! The 'Nile' mince already had peas, carrots and sweetcorn in it, then there was the addition of a couple of cooked potatoes, along with the last of the steamed red cabbage and the last of the bottle of Guinness. Tasted fine but was very filling - definitely no pudding required. I've been pricing dehumidifiers for H's studio but this is definitely the wrong time of year to be looking for a bargain in that department, what with the general winter weather and the atrocious flooding in England. A temporary compromise has had to be made, so the bargain air conditioner, which also has a dehumidifier, has been retrieved from its space in the shed and is being cleaned up to prepare it for going into the studio. This worked well for drying clothes last year, so let's hope it can help stabilise the temperature and clear the dampness in the studio while helping to create better atmospheric conditions for fine artwork. If it doesn't suit the purpose, this unit will end up being sold. IU traded through our local LETS group for this one so, technically, homemade lemon curd and eggs from the garden feathered friends paid for it.Having raked out all my seeds this week and discovering that the dampness had got into the beans and peas, I was loath to throw them out, despite the crumbling, green fuzzy appearance of some of them... so I washed each and every one of them! A few disintegrated and a few more felt a bit too delicate for washing individually, so I dumped them all into a dish of water last night and left them to soak. By this morning, the absolute worst of them were floating, so I scooped those out for the compost bin, rinsed the others again and will soak them another night. They are looking quite rejuvenated, don't you think? I really hope some of the peas and beans grow. I know fine well that most other 'normal' people would simply have binned these, but we don't really do 'normal' here in Frugaldom. If I hadn't challenged myself to a fantastic frugal February, I have to admit to the fact that I would have binned these! There is a mix of runner beans, dwarf beans and peas. I'll get them started off in March and keep my gingers crossed that some of them grow.I can hardly believe that tomorrow is the last day of the month! One more day of extreme frugaling and it will need to include using up the rest of tonight's chilli and the leftover rice, as I cooked a little too much. The bantams have laid us another egg, the coal has been sufficient to see out the month, we still have some logs remaining and joy oh joys... I checked my Topcashback* account and found £24.57 waiting to be collected. This 'cyberdosh' (money I raise through my online endeavours) will go into my Amazon vouchers account towards gifts and any little extras I need.NYK, Frugaldom* Denotes my friend referral link"},
{"title": "Day 26 of Extremely Frugal February - Chocolate and Guinness Mug Cake!", "date": "Wednesday 26 February 2014", "text": "Day 26 of 28 - Absolute Indulgence!Today began as any other day, except there was a glimmer of sunshine. I stuck a washing on, looked out the window and the rain began again - typical! Went exploring in the kitchen and decided that the time had come to use up the last dregs of the can of  'scootie' cream, so had a quick browse online for an easy recipe. As you can see by the photo, I found one! :)I'd defrosted a carton of carrots overnight, so today's batch of soup is 4 litres of carrot and lentil from ham stock. (I used stock cubes I got slashed to 10p per pack because they were past BBE date.) Once cooked, I mashed the carrots into the soup. This will keep us going for now and most of it will get frozen for later use, defrosting as needed. My breadmaker is still behaving beautifully, but I'm down to just one bag of bread flour and one tub of milk powder. A quick check on Approved Food found 3.5kg bags of white bread and roll mix for 99p and Marvel milk powder at 75p. An equally quick check on the supermarket comparison site showed the milk powder to be a phenomenal saving, I have placed a small order for next week and hope everything is still available by the time they despatch my order. £15 well spent, in my opinion, even if it did mean adding in some more cheesecake mix, potatoes, 4kg sugar and a couple of fajita kits to make it up to the minimum order of £15.Having finished off the last grains from a tub of salt while preparing the bread dough ingredients, I thought there must be something 'waste not, want not' that I could do with the empty container, so here's how you can do similar: Carefully trim the top off the plastic salt container and leave a tab for hanging it on a hook or attaching in to the wall. Find a design or picture you like from an old magazine or similar and cut it wide enough to wrap around the salt tub. Any paper will do, as it's just to disguise the tub. You don't even need to do this if you are happy with a salt tub hanging from your wall. I selected a glossy page from a magazine and it is simply held in place with a piece of sticky tape so it can be easily replaced at any time. This is the tub I made today and hung on the wall above my desk -  I decided to use it for holding my glue sticks and general purpose scissors but I reckon they would also be handy for things like knitting needles or for assorted cooking utensils, if hung in the kitchen. Other things I did today: had my first attempt at making the fabulous microwave Guinness Chocolate Mug Cake as described by Kirbiecravings.com And I have to say that, despite what happened, this cake is EPIC!Ingredients for epic choc cakeMICROWAVE GUINNESS CHOCOLATE MUG CAKE 4 tablespoons plain flour5 tablespoons white granulated sugar1/2 tsp baking powder1 egg (I used 2 small bantam eggs)2 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder3 1/2 tablespoons milk (I used Marvel)splash of vanilla extract - didn't have any, so this was omitted3 1/2 tablespoons oil5 1/2 tablespoons Guinness Just whisk all of the above together into what looks like brown batter. This is like death by chocolate and calories! There is no way I could fit it into one mug, so I greased two and split the mix between them, then zapped one in the microwave on full power for just under 2 minutes - my microwave is 700w. I found that half the mix in one mug was still too much because the sponge rose, hit the top of my microwave and toppled over the edge of the mug! I'd suggest quarter of the mix and use this to make 4 awesome cakes. Lucky for me, I had the remains of the aerosol can of cream in the fridge, so this got used up to accompany tonight's fantastic dessert. I had a tiny piece, just to try it, you understand. Wow! Guinness chocolate cakeI can't even begin to explain how this tastes - it is like no other chocolate cake I have ever tried! It really is like chocolate heaven on a plate. Not recommended if you are dieting, have gall bladder problems, sugar intolerance, diabetes or any other health-related problems. This cake is probably best served after a 10-mile run or a hike up Ben Nevis! But oh boy, would I hike up the Ben again just to get this when I got back down to Fort William! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The ingredients are sufficient for 4 servingsI think this deserves to be served hot with ice cream, as it needs to be eaten quickly after cooking it in the microwave, so guess what else I made this afternoon? Another batch of ice cream! The second half of the chocolate mix has been split between two much and is in the fridge for tomorrow! Yum! NYK, FrugaldomPS: Next - what to do with an empty Guinness bottle and yes, I saved the plastic cap off the cream can because these make excellent little jelly moulds. :)"},
{"title": "Day 25 of Extremely Frugal February - Peppered Pitta Pizza", "date": "Tuesday 25 February 2014", "text": "Day 25 of 28 and only 4 Days Until 'Making in March' Begins!Excitement is mounting as the month of February quickly draws to a close.  The month's challenge was to be even more frugal than usual and I think that was achieved as soon as I gave the beautiful old leather sofa a new home and designed the 'new' living room around that without spending anywhere near the allocated budget. The room has been decorated, carpeted and fully furnished for under £140 with nothing more than a light shade needed to complete it. Miniature iris and crocusesThe flowers are popping up all over the place with a beautiful display in the planters at the door. It gives the feeling that spring is on the way and brightens up an otherwise grey day! The household budget hasn't been overly stretched, despite having the annual home insurance to pay and getting through almost £70 of coal to heat the house. To date, this month, I have spent a total of £269.52 of my household budget. Of that, £21.38 went on groceries.  I am still making the most of everything I have in stock, so meals are going to start getting very interesting soon. Keeping a regular supply of milk is always going to be a problem when we don't have transport or a shop within easy reach but there's always a supply of coffee whitener, as I bought 5kg for £1 from Approved Food*. (They still have Marvel on offer at 75p per tin.)  8 pitta breads for 19p or 10 packs (80) for £1... of course I opted for spending the full £1, so my freezer has quite a few pitta breads in it. There's no stopping us frugal Scottish gals once we get into a spending frenzy! ;) These help make a change from soup at lunchtimes, especially when made into pizzas. Today we had peppered pitta pizza and  we were very greedy in that we ate two each. Pitta bread, tinned tomatoes, seasoning and herbsOne tin of chopped tomatoes is sufficient for 4 pizzas and I don't really mind that the juice is soaking into the pitta bread. Salt and pepper get sprinkled over the top of the tomatoes. Using cheap dried herbsToday I had to use the cheap dried, store-bought herbs as we're a little lacking in fresh herbs at the moment - and it was pouring rain. I think these ones cost me 19p for the tub some time ago. I can't actually remember the last time I was in this particular supermarket, as the nearest one to us is over 20 miles. Just as well they keep once dried.Ready for grillingYou can add almost any leftovers to pizzas but I'm just adding some cheese today because there aren't any other leftovers left to use. These get popped under the grill of the mini-oven until heated through and the cheese is bubbling. I like mine with a scoop of pickle but you can be as experimental as you like - don't be scared to mix and match the flavours, it was tuna fish and banana for the old Yellow Pages advert, wasn't it? Apart from that, it's amazing what you can add to a pizza and suddenly the children like it. 4.5kg tinHomemade pizza has been a favourite of mine for years, previously having used the outside slices of bread as pizza bases or simply making my own, but with pitta breads being cleared at that price, they work out cheaper than making my own. However, this cheap and cheerful lunchtime snack is fast disappearing off our frugal menus on accounts of the cost of tinned tomatoes. Over the past few years, since beginning my £1 per person per day grocery budget challenge, the price of tinned tomatoes has fluctuated, bouncing up and down like a baby elephant on a trampoline! The lowest supermarket price I recall was 9p per tin: the lowest price I can find them now is 33p (Co-op) and the tin is slightly smaller. Sad but true, the homemade 'pizza for pennies' is on its way out and it's looking like we'll need to find an alternative. (If you have access to supermarkets, check the price of  Passatta and get your compost on the go to prepare some growing medium for your own tomatoes.) I was lucky to have got a massive tin of tomato paste from Approved but haven't opened it yet - but I have plans for those huge cans! Tonight's dinner is the exact same as we had last night, so no news there. My seed packets are all sorted out and ready for some serious sowing sessions soon, weather permitting. This evening is scheduled as a knitting night in a final effort to complete the long-awaited fluffy blanket for my grand daughter. Before that, though, I need to plan what can be eaten tomorrow and try to keep ahead of the game. I almost fell for the special offer from MuscleFood* when their email arrived offering me 3.4kg of chicken drumsticks for £6 but worse still, I have saved the email to see if the code is still viable for my next order.  NYK, Frugaldom * Friend referral links"},
{"title": "Day 24 of Extremely Frugal February -  Beef Pie and Leftovers Pudding", "date": "Monday 24 February 2014", "text": "Day 24 of 28, a Bit More Bullying for the Beef.On day 11, I cooked a little piece of roast beef and began counting out the meals it could provide. At 600g in weight, there should be sufficient for 6 meals but, at £1 per 100g for the beef and a budget of £1 per day per person for ALL meals, I need to stretch it further. The original post is here if you missed it and we have had two meals each (4 servings) from the beef, so far.Tonight I made a large pie that will provide two of us with three meals each (6 servings), so that will be 10 meals from the £6 piece of beef. I had saved the gravy juices from the meat after slow cooking it, so that had been frozen for later use, too - I simply defrost it when needed and thicken it with some cheap, instant gravy granules.﻿Homemade roast beef and onion pie just out the ovenPastry is great stuff, isn't it? I use 50g margarine, 50g lard and 200g plain flour with a pinch of salt and some water to bind it. then roll it out in plain flour.Making pastryI always use the cheapest available ingredients, so I am currently baking with tinned, pasteurised margarine bought at 3 tins for £1. I am by no means a good cook, but I'm led to believe that keeping everything chilled is the secret to good pastry; I try my best and am not scared to scrub up and get stuck into mixing by hand.Greasing the plate with the lard wrapperRight, what have we got so far? A plate, some flour, lard and margarine and one small egg from the garden hens, so I am able to glaze the pastry - this always enhances the finished look and makes it appear much less like leftovers wrapped in a pie case.Rolling out the chilled pastryThe 200g of plain flour is sufficient to make a large family pie, big enough to serve 6. I use the same recipe for all my short crust pies, whether they are sweet or savoury. Apologies for this next photo, I forgot to switch on the flash. My beef and onion pie filling wasn't really emitting a golden glow.Glowing like savoury gold - roast beef with onions in gravyI freeze most things in margarine tubs, so the above is the rolled pastry with half a tub of beef plus gravy - I used a dinner plate for baking it. Paint around the edges with beaten egg so you get a food seal between bottom and top of the pie pastry. You can use milk if you have no egg or just seal it with water if all else fails, then press the edges together with a fork. Make a little hole in the centre to let out any excess steam.Use up the pastry trimmings to decorate your pieIt was either Fonzie, Bernice or Mrs Splashy who laid us a tiny egg this week - they are our Pekin bantam hens - so I beat this up and glazed the pie top. Now I have pastry offcuts and the remains of a tiny egg leftover from pie making. Excellent! Enough to make pudding!Making pudding from the leftoversThe leftover pastry was enough to roll out and line two small flan dishes, so I put a scoop of homemade blackcurrant jam into each. The egg... I creamed a little sugar and margarine, added some self-raising flour and beat in the little bit egg with some water and used this frugal sponge-like mix to cover the jam in the pastry cases.﻿Leftovers being turned into fruit sponge in pastryThe little fruit flans with sponge got cooked in the mini oven while we were eating dinner. Ordinarily, these flan dishes make individual servings but one was enough between two of us when served with some instant custard. We do like or food here in Frugaldom and I find that an average of £1 per person per day for all food is quite sufficient, although this does take some practice while building up basic stores of ingredients and dried goods. Fruit sponge flans made from pie-making leftoversHaving savoured the flavour of the pie at dinnertime, I now have two thirds of a meat pie and one small fruit sponge flan for future meals. The steak pie was served with potatoes and mixed vegetables and I'm guessing that we'll be having similar for the next couple of days, as I can't refreeze the pie. But let's face it, in the Frugaldom household, beef for three days on the trot is sheer bliss and then that leaves only Thursday and Friday to see me through to March ... and another new month of challenges! Yeah!NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 23 - Feeling the Frugal Need for Seed -  Sweet Peppers and Garlic", "date": "Sunday 23 February 2014", "text": "Whether you prefer Sewing or Sowing, they're both Frugal.Remember these from earlier this month?They are the seeds from the middle of the sweet peppers that I saved. They have been drying out on paper towel in their plastic tub for the past couple of weeks but seeing as I'm more in a sowing mood than a sewing mood, I decided to get them started and find out if any of them will grow. I can see no reason why they shouldn't, as similar experiments in the past have worked. Grand daughter's apple pips and peach stone from 2007(ish) are still growing, albeit it very, very slowly, out in the garden.Empty plastic food containersPlanters - recycled food containers and trays make great planters and plant pot holders or drip trays! If there are no holes in the base of your planter, sit it on a folded tea towel or similar and pierce drainage holes using a sharp knife, awl, skewer or screw driver. Do not put holes in the tray, this is for catching drips or surplus water.Compost and seedsHalf fill your tub with fine soil or compost and water it before sprinkling your seeds over the top. Don't worry if it looks too many, we aren't going to keep them all if they grow, only the strongest and healthiest. Cover these with a fine layer of compost or, if you have any available, vermiculite.Homemade mini-propagatorClose the lid of your tub or else, as I have done, sit another similar tub over the top to allow growing space, making sure there are air vents - these types of tubs normally have air holes already in them - and hey presto! You now have a tiny windowsill propagator that will help protect your seeds and hopefully encourage them to grow. Don't forget to label your seeds - I am using a little piece of card with seed type written on one side and the date they were sown on the other.All we need to do now is keep an eye on the tub to ensure the contents don't dry out and wait patiently to find out if our seeds will germinate.Good luck! You can try seeds from any you happen to save - sweet pepper, chilli pepper, tomato or even start off peas and beans. I have had very successful pea crops from plants grown from the dried peas taken from my broth mix. :)Today I finally got around to planting the rest of my garlic. Better late than never, I say. This has all been planted from kitchen/cooking garlic bulbs. Here's the first lot that I planted before Christmas. I need some nice dry weather now to get out there and properly weed the bed. The wire mesh is to prevent the cat from using the raised bed as a giant litter tray!My raised garlic bedToday's cloves have been planted in a tub on the patio. These are the last of the kitchen garlic that I started off in a sealed polythene bag in the fridge:Garlic cloves being sprouted in polythene bag in the fridgeThese have been in the fridge for the past couple of months, so I'm hoping they'll be OK being transferred outside this late on in the winter. Like rhubarb seeds, they like a good dose of frost to get them going. With luck, I'll get sufficient from my frugal crop to avoid the need to buy any more after this year. Wouldn't that be great?NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 22 of Extremely Frugal February - Tin Can Herb Garden", "date": "Saturday 22 February 2014", "text": "Day 22 - More Fun with Tin CansPossibly some of you will remember my bargain buy from my last visit to the 'big' charity shop that I made en route home from my adventures with grand daughter in October but for thosw of you who don't, or who haven't read the blog about it, I bought a set of Jamie Oliver tins containing herbs - three tins costing 5p each!The tins each contain a packet of seeds - chives, flowering oregano and purple basil but it wasn't until today, when I looked at them more closely, that I noticed they had the Jamie Oliver name embossed onto the cans - posh frugal herbs, or what? I wonder how much the pack of 3 would have cost someone originally? More importantly, many thanks to whoever saw fit to donate them to the community's charity store. (To make your own, simply wash out an empty tin can and punch a few drainage holes in the bottom of it.)I filled mine with some compost, sowed the seeds and then made my own labels for the tins in case I somehow manage to lose the little lollipop stick signs before the seeds germinate - Scruffy cat has been known to help herself to all sorts of things!Planting the seeds left me with 'rubbish' in the form of 3 ring-pull can lids and they reminded me of something else we used to do in the past - homemade punched metal decorations and wind chimes. Hmm... it had been a while since making anything like that. If you've been with us on the challenges for long enough, you'll know we used to save the metal tomato puree (and similar) tubes for this purpose but most have, since, been changed to plastic of some description.Starting with a really simple pattern, like a basic horse shoe, stamp your design out using something like an awl or a pointed end screwdriver. Ideally, you should have the pattern drawn or stuck on the reverse and stamp it from there, but I'm doing a rush job freehand here, just to try it.My patterns are being stamped out using the end of a 'star' screwdriver - tin lids are quite thin nowadays, so it doesn't take too much pressure to make the indents without the need for hammering. Next, I raked out a piece of ribbon from my crafting stash and threaded it through the ring pulls. You can easily use any other materials for this - string, cord, card or even an old belt, if it is thin enough. Have you guessed what it is yet?I haven't attached any backing to mine yet, but they are becoming the frugal version of horse brasses and I'll probably hang them outdoors. Ring-pull tin can lids can be fashioned into all sorts of designs and used for all sorts of creative ecoarts but they need responsible adults supervising all the stamping and cutting, as the edges can be razor sharp.Another day passes and another day of spending escapes me - nothing bought today. Meals are all from stores by way of the breakfast porridge, the last of the bread toasted with cheese, tomato and pickle for lunch and tonight's meal is bacon, cabbage and potatoes, all cooked in the three-tier steamer. For added good measure, I threw a handful of the spicy chick peas in with the cabbage and added some extra pepper. And lest you think I had forgotten, these are the potato skins I am keeping to plant - that one in the middle should be sprouting from a pot in no time!NYK, Frugaldom"},

It certainly has the ability to grow and flourish by way of multiplying into numerous cuttings and these, in turn, are gifted to others in the hope that they may prosper in their pursuit for frugal living.The 'waste not, want not' ethos governs most things in a frugal lifestyle, just as decluttering means getting rid of all the things you no longer need, not just 'stuff'. Whether you sell it, give it away, delete it or recycle it, it's your choice, so long as it isn't binned unless absolutely necessary. This goes for all things - even plants!This is my Jade plant, otherwise known as my lucky 'money plant'. Daughter found it in the bin while cleaning out the house she was about to move into around 5 or 6 years ago. The plant had obviously been knocked over and chewed by previous owner's dog, as the plastic pot is covered in bite marks around the edge - the soil had completely dried out, but the plant was still alive. This is the kind of gift I love my children bring me!Homemade planterI found an old mixing bowl and sat the rescued plant in it, gave it a drink and sprinkled some aquarium gravel around the bottom of it. It has been with me ever since and even survived being knocked off a shelf last year. The little pieces that got broken off got rescued and stuck in a pot of compost, then promptly abandoned over-winter in the plastic greenhouse.Today, I repotted the first one and brought it indoors - it has a fine set of healthy roots and now has a lovely new pot holder! This little planter took all of about 20 minutes to make.Here's how...Tuna cansTonight's dinner, as you may already have guessed, included tuna - it was tuna pasta to be exact, cheap and cheerful. Empty tin cans have so many uses, from cookie cutters to pastry cutters, storage tins, ash trays, (yes, there are still smokers out there and I have to insist they step outside if they want to smoke while visiting Frugaldom), individual pie dishes and, of course, mini plant pot holders.Materials needed for making a mini-planterThese are the materials I used to make my mini-planter. You don't need a hot glue gun, but I find mine handy for so many things and I did make it part of a money-saving challenge a few years back to cover the cost of this crafting investment.Empty tuna tinTwigsScrap card or stiff paper long enough to wrap around the canPiece of string, rope, ribbon, cord or twineI use the scrap of tin foil to prevent hot glue dripping onto the table, so ignore that. My card is a scrap of wallpaper, which I used to wrap around the tin, then I glued the twigs onto this. Before starting, trim all the twigs to roughly the same lengths and then begin gluing them around the edge of the tin. Next, tie the whole lot together, as this holds everything firmly in place until the glue is set. You could remove the string afterwards, but I chose to leave it in place.Rustic look with natural twigsThe next bit isn't essential, but I thought it gave a better finish than just the base of the tin can. The only problem now is that my freebie microfibre cloth has a hole the size of a tuna tin cut out the corner of it! I thought this would be more absorbent for any drips that might result from careless watering of the plant.Felt or fabric baseAs well as being absorbent, the fabric base will help make this non-slip and prevent the tin from marking any wooden surfaces. That's it - your twiggy tuna can planter is complete and ready for its little pot plant and the plant can be anything you choose, even herbs for using in your kitchen. This one was made very quickly using a handful of twigs from my fireside basket - we keep all the twigs that blow down in the garden - but I will do a few more for my other cuttings and for sowing some early seeds indoors. You can use any size of tin available, so you are limited only by your own imagination.Billy can savings potTin can-dle lightI have to admit to having a bin bag filled with empty tin cans because they are so handy for so many things. These are a couple of the other items I have made in the past but there are still plenty more tin can creations to come later this year. I'll blog them as I do them to save confusion. On the left is my 'blinged up' Billy can' and on the right, the first nail-punched Christmas lantern.NYK, Frugaldom"},

Escaped another day without having cash prized from me by way of bills, bank or beguiling bargains. The food supplies are still plentiful and I was having a think about what others must think in lieu of what some have said! I am not poor and I am not proud - I simply hate waste!Is it really so peculiar for frugalers to make the most of past 'best before' dates? I don't give a stuff what date or time a shop needs to clear its shelves and I don't give a stuff if my packets, tins or jars in my cupboards have dates from many months, or even years, ago, as long as it isn't fresh produce or past 'use by' dates. So, if you are offended by the prospect of eating meals created from such ingredients, look away now. :) Pitta breads with chopped tomatoes and cheeseI know I keep harking back to Approved Food but I promise they aren't paying me to mention them, even if I do make a small bit of store credit when someone new signs up through my friend referral link and places an order. However, I need to mention them yet again after buying ten packs of pitta breads for £1.00 The packs are 6 + 2 free, so when I discovered that the first pack I opened contained 9 individual pittas, I was over the moon! I made H an extra mini frugal pizza! Frugal pitta pizza with pickleI used a full tin of chopped tomatoes (Co-op 33p) and half a small tin of 25p cheese along with a spoonful of pickle. It means that each pizza cost less than 20p.Homemade ice cream from a packet (6 packs for 99p)Did anyone make the most of the coconut milk powder offer? 300ml pack for 50p some time ago, so I got my 2 for £1.00 and this is what I used to make tonight's ice cream experiment. One tablespoonful into 150ml of cold water and then whipped up with the 17p ice cream mix. I added in a heaped tablespoon of desiccated coconut, so this is going to be fairly tropical.850g of mango pulp at 25p per tin Now for the mango! 4 large tins of fruit pulp for £1 and I used about 100g, so a matter of pennies to add an extra tropical zing to my frugal ice cream. This is sweetened, so keep that in mind. Mango ice lollies could be on the go soon.Homemade coconut and mango ice cream And now for the final product - this was it before it went into the freezer after I stirred through the mango pulp. A sneaky taste tells me I'm going to like this!Enjoy experimenting with fruits, nuts and all sorts of other flavours if you manage to get hold of some ice cream mix. I can confirm that coconut and mango tastes delicious. :)"},

It's been a good excuse not to go out anywhere; I even turned down the opportunity of a trip to the nearest Co-op recently!Chicken, onion and peppersBack to chicken this evening for dinner - diced and stir fried with sliced and diced onions and peppers. Remember the rule - always slice, dice or grate to make things go further. If I can get the kitchen organised soon then I'll look at stocking up on the chicken fillets while I can still get a bulk order at £4.85/kilo from Muscle Food*. (The offer of 4 free chicken fillets still stands if you use this link.)5p per sachet sweet chilli sauceDid anyone stock up on the sachets of sweet chilli sauce from Approved Food? At 5p per sachet, I have found them a fabulous addition to many dishes and I'm even thinking of trying adding a sachet to some melted chocolate as a tasty topping for homemade ice cream. I'll let you know how that goes as soon as I can source some cheap chocolate. (Anyone nearby going to a supermarket soon?)Add a pinch of mixed herbs to riceRice can be a little bland, but at 40p per kilo (I bought 10kg), a 50g serving costs only 2p per person and affords you the luxury of adding all sorts of herbs or spices, plus it's a great way of bulking out meals and an enjoyable alternative to potatoes or pasta.Homemade summer fruits ice creamThe last batch of homemade ice cream got polished off tonight, but there's still blackcurrant cheesecake remaining in the fridge to get eaten tomorrow. Do you think it matters that two of our five-a-day involved fruit being served on cake and mixed through ice cream? I really must get back out and do some walking or cycling soon! The free outdoor gym awaits!Living room is progressing well without any further money spends. My next project for that is getting some artwork onto the walls and getting back to making the rag rug. I've already set out the plans for our March money challenge in the www.frugalforums.co.uk so there should be something in there to interest anyone with an interest in making something. I'm overrun with ideas and suggestions and really do need to dig my way through them all and get started doing them instead of just reading about them.Hopefully, by continuing to live within my strict £4,000 per year budget, we'll can afford to get most of the remaining renovation work done during 2014 and get into our ecoarts studio this summer to produce some saleable pieces. Having now reclaimed the living room, this will also allow the multi-purpose room to return to normal and provide much needed space for the crafting projects, as well as space for all the visitors I have invited! :)Finally, I'm happy to say that the regular get-togethers with friends and neighbours have finally resumed. But we don't do knit and natter here, its stitching and bitching all the way, along with bartering and the sharing of libations, home produce and surplus to requirement 'clutter'. It's like a chatathon coupled with a swapathon.Now I am off to try and make an old sheepskin rug look like a spring lamb so I can add it to the ambience of the 'new' living room. It's had a jolly good beating outdoors this afternoon and it will probably take me the rest of the week to make it look worthy of being on display.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 18 of Extremely Frugal February - Cheesecake!", "date": "Tuesday 18 February 2014", "text": "Day 18 of 28, Time for Frugal Cheesecake!You all get the gist of the basic routine here in Frugaldom now, don't you?  It's mainly porridge for breakfast, pot of tea on the stove, homemade soup and bread for lunch and then dinner is usually based loosely around the premise of meat and two veg surrounded by something like pastry, pasta, rice, potatoes or herby dumplings (doughballs)! Tonight, it will be herby dumplings. We enjoy dessert or pudding of some description almost every day and this normally includes a portion of fruit, hopefully home grown, depending on what's in season or in the freezer.  This meal combination takes care of the majority of the winter months and, us being in Scotland, chilly winter months far outweigh the hot summer months. Today, my order from Approved Food* arrived. It costs me less to pay £5.25 delivery than it does to get into town for shopping, so that part of my budget has its own category, or column, within my spreadsheet so I can easily compare the year's delivery charges and transport or travel costs with what it used to cost to keep a car on the road. I am far better off without the car, even if I factor in the cost of hiring a car for a week during holidays! But I digress!  My order arrived and it had to be made up to a minimum of £15, so I added in 4 packs of cheesecake mix (£1) along with some other non-essentials to make it worth my while buying the ice cream mix, tinned mango and the 9kg of pasta! I could hardly believe my luck when I saw it listed at 99p for 3 kilos, as it's closer to that for 500g in our local store! I love pasta, it is almost as versatile as potatoes for bulking out the basics and all those carbohydrates help H make it through another day of log-splitting! :) But tonight isn't about pasta, it's about CHEESECAKE! :) This is the first time I have tried packet cheesecake mix and it was so simple that I was quite amazed! Cheesecake is something that falls outside of the frugal budget of 'homemade' luxuries owing to the lack of access to the rather expensive ingredients, so 25p for a pack just seems awesome to me! Defrosting home-grown blackcurrants for the cheesecakeAs expected, I didn't use 'real' butter, I used the 25p/400g tinned margarine to melt into the biscuit base, so that added a whole 2.5p to the price.Base made, 'creamy' top whipped The mix needed 300ml of milk - I used semi-skimmed - so that added 24p to the overall price. I could have used UHT to knock a couple of pennies off the cost and I'm sure even the cheap powdered milk may have worked, but today I am using 'real' milk, albeit semi-skimmed..Cheesecake taking shape! I don't have any tin foil pie trays left, so I'm using a round sponge tray lined with tin foil.Making the fruit toppingThe pack is for a plain cheesecake - vanilla flavoured - but my all time favourite is blackcurrant, so I defrosted some home grown ones and mixed these with a big spoonful of homemade blackcurrant jelly. I probably should add on the cost of that, as I need to buy sugar for making it, so I'll allow 5p, as a jar of jam or jelly costs very little to make when using free fruit.Homemade blackcurrant cheesecakeThis is how my cheesecake is looking now - it is in the fridge setting and will be sliced after dinner. It SHOULD serve 6, lasting us 3 days, but seriously folks, I reckon we'll demolish it over two days by scoffing a quarter pie each in one sitting! Total cost for making it - 57pEdited in - Here's how it looked served and it WILL serve 6, so will last the Frugaldom household 3 days.Cost per serving - 9.5p  NYK, Frugaldom * My friend referral link"},
{"title": "Day 17 of Extremely Frugal February - Arty Vegetables", "date": "Monday 17 February 2014", "text": "Day 17 - Phone Bills, Furniture Fun and Curious Cabbage.Fabulous purple patterns, designed by nature.There's one thing that none of us here can get away from and that is the fact that Internet access needs to be paid for, unless we are fortunate enough to live practically next door to a library and can keep our online activities to a minimum. We need unlimited access as this household derives much of its income from Internet-based sources, but I seldom use the telephone. Today was monthly bill day - 66p for 2 phone calls, both to the feed merchant! Who knows how many hours the computers are online, so it is just as well we now have unlimited, fixed fee access rather than having to pay by the minute! I pay line rental as a lump sum for 12 months, so the monthly part stays under £20. Monday is meter-reading day for electricity and this week we have leapt up to 80 kWh units just by having a tiny, 400w oil-filled radiator set on low upstairs. The stove is eating logs at a rate of around £2 per day and the fire, when lit, gets through 10kg of coal to heat the radiators and a tank of water, so it's getting back to the whole conundrum of what is most affordable when you need to heat a house that has no wall cavities or lift to insulate. At this time of year it can easily cost £45 per week just to keep from freezing! Can you imagine what it might cost to warm the house to the Government's suggested 18C? I can't even contemplate it!Sorting out the book collectionToday was shelf-moving day, as we started moving the huge book collection into the 'new' living room. It will take some time to move all the books but the shelves are now in place and they don't look too bad, all things considered. I've used the third set of free curtains to cover some and had to move the frugal mini-bar to the other side of the room, but it looks OK to me.Red cabbage experimentDinner was the 'slow mince' after a very late porridge breakfast and an even later lunch of homemade bread, leftover pasta and hot dogs! Cheap and cheerful! The last one of the tiny red cabbages has now been cut and ready to cook tomorrow, but I'm thinking that I'd quite like to pickle it. I wonder if the remaining part will grow me any new cabbage? I'll let you know!NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 16 of Extremely Frugal February - Nile Mince", "date": "Sunday 16 February 2014", "text": "Day 16 of 28 - Mince and Tatties!Everyone I know loves mince and potatoes, but it's probably because it's so cheap and easy to make. Here in Frugaldom, and countless other frugal homes, we make 'Nile' mince - so called because it stretches so far! This week's Nile mince is now in the slow cooker and will be low-slow-cooking overnight. I have used 400g (£3) of lean steak mince, which was browned while I was chopping 2 x 10p large onions. I added about 30p worth of frozen peas and sweetcorn plus half a dozen potatoes and some carrots. At most, these, along with the salt, pepper and herbs would account for another 50p, so the entire crock pot has approximately £4 worth of food in it.This week I am cheating a bit, as I had bought a 2kg tin of carrots while they were on offer, so I split them into four lots, one for the pot and three for the freezer - they'll be ideal for making carrot and lentil soup.Nothing should go to waste, not even the tin. These make fantastic planters, plant pot holders, candle lamps, waste paper bins... recycling them is limited only by your own imagination.This is yet another 'recycling' experiment - even the potato peelings have been kept this time around because I'm going to attempt to grow these into more potatoes! Strange as it may seem, it is possible and I have managed successfully in the past. I have left them draining and will select the biggest pieces tomorrow. These will then be left sitting on a cardboard egg carton before popping them into a tub of compost by the back door. If they fail to grow - nothing lost.Today's spends amounted to £2.07 for a 2 litre carton of semi-skimmed and a carton of UHT skimmed milk, kindly collected for me by a friend who was visiting this afternoon.In the 'new' living room, I have begun moving in the book shelves and today I completed the second foot stool/mini ottoman. I ran out of braid, so the latest one has a single stripe, but I doubt this will matter much as the pair may not even be kept in the same room.And finally for this evening, a lovely addition to the Frugaldom book shelves by way of this set of crafting folders - grand daughter will love reading these when she comes to visit. Yes, I am still decluttering, but it seems everyone else is, too, so I'm paying things forward wherever and whenever I can.Hope everyone had a good weekend!"},
{"title": "Day 15 of Extremely Frugal February - Lemon Drizzle Cake", "date": "Saturday 15 February 2014", "text": "Day 15 of 28 - Luxury Cake Day!Lemons and limes, bantam eggs and a cold kitchen... I know! Turn on the mini oven and bake a luxury lemon drizzle cake because let's face it, nothing can go wrong, can it?Usual frugal living winter rules apply - to afford the luxuries, we have Scottish porridge for breakfast and soup for lunch!Pre-heat your mini oven (or ordinary oven, if you have a cooker) to 180C - this helps to warm up your otherwise freezing cold kitchen while you work in it.INGREDIENTSThe zest of 2 lemons (they're 5 for £1 at the moment)175g sugar175g butter or margarine225g self-raising flour4 small eggsBlitz the above until the mixture looks thick and creamy, pour it into a lined or greased loaf tin and pop it into the oven for about 45 minutes. If, like me, you have a mini oven that doubles as a grill, keep an eye on the cake as it bakes to prevent the top being burned when the element in the grill comes on to maintain the temperature. I normally sit a piece of tin foil over the top as soon as the cake looks as though it has stopped rising, but forgot today, so this one burned slightly.Squeeze the juice from the 2 lemons into a jug and mix in about 100g of sugar - this will be your drizzle frosting. I sit the jug on top of my mini oven to help the sugar dissolve.Check that the cake is baked all the way through by sticking a fine blade knife or skewer into the centre - if it comes out dry & clean, the cake is baked. Remove from oven and prick the top of the cake several times with your knife or skewer to create 'drain holes' for your lemon syrup mix then drizzle the liquid over the top until it has all soaked into the sponge-cake. As you can see, this one got slightly over-browned where it was below the heating element of the oven but that sort of thing doesn't worry me.Allow your cake to cool before removing it from the tin. The sugar lemon mix will act like a glaze as it trickles and soaks into the cake, leaving a lovely frosted effect on the top. Once cold, (OK, read that as once it is cool enough to handle without it falling apart) you can sample a slice with your cuppa. Ideally, I like to cut the cake in half - one party for eating on the day and the rest into the freezer, but seeing as there's the chance of visitors tomorrow, I'm using that as an excuse to keep the whole cake at the ready.What can possibly beat a slice of freshly baked, warm lemon drizzle cake on a cold winter weekend? This is just one of the little luxuries of frugal living when your hens or ducks decide to lay a few unexpected eggs mid-winter. Now I just need a couple more eggs to let me make the next jar of lemon curd and a batch of coconut macaroons.Almost forgot to factor in tonight's dinner!I had planned on having Spaghetti Bolognese, as I'd taken a carton of the Bolognese sauce from freezer to defrost. Trouble is, I always, always, always forget to label the tubs and this one turned out to be a carton of the spicy lentil soup. So, a swift change of plan and this is in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch. Half a pack of wholemeal pasta quills boiled, tin of tomatoes added, poured over some instant cheese sauce and then grated a little cheese over the top before popping it under the grill for 10 minutes, BINGO! Costs less than 75p to make and easily serves 2."},

Ouch! This includes my latest dry food order and delivery... I caved!Having mulled over the prospect of stocking up on ice cream mix and mango pulp to combine the two, browsed the food site several times, filled and emptied my 'shopping basket' several times and listened to 'houseshare' requesting sweets and biscuit , I was eventually won over by the prospect of the cheap pasta! At 99p for a 3kg bag, I would be crazy to miss such a bargain (although houseshare thinks I'm crazy, anyway) and the sweets are half the price of those sold in village shop. Fingers crossed that everything is in stock and arrives safely next week. This is what I ordered:Cheesecake MixIce Cream MixMango Pulp Meat Free Chicken Style Roast MixSpicy Balti Flavour CrispsPitta BreadsDry Roasted PeanutsLiquorice AllsortsWine GumsPastaTotal £15.59It has to be pointed out that NONE of these items are essential except for the pasta, of which I ordered 9kg to last a good few months. I omitted the biscuits on accounts of having spent more on sweets that I would normally spend on flour and sugar for baking biscuit! It also has to be pointed out that I think I may have ordered double the amount of ice cream mix to what I initially thought! When I looked at the graphic attached, it shows as a twin pack, but can that be right? 17p for 2 packs of ice cream mix? If this turns out to be the case then I am going to have plenty of ice cream AND plenty of mango pulp, being as it's on offer at 4 large tins for £1. The peanuts and so I have some in stock when entertaining guests at the Frugaldom mini-bar.Back to the mundane - I really did not feel like cooking today, so I didn't! It was porridge for breakfast, mug of vegetable soup for lunch and umm... fruit crumble and instant custard for tea. What can I say? Nowt in my defence.NYK, Frugaldom.It's Just a Plain, Brown Cardboard Box.In a previous post recently I mentioned what I did with my plain cardboard boxes and it brought several requests for 'how to make fire sticks'. I would never even have thought to include such details, so many thanks to those of you who asked.My cardboard boxes get used for many things - weed suppressant, storage, compost, packaging and I'll admit that some have even had to be binned when I simply couldn't warrant another inch of space being turned over to clutter. But it's winter now and I need to both keep warm and declutter. This needy combination leads me to sourcing fire fodder from anywhere possible and it helps more if it can also provide energy for cooking. As you can see, EVERY box that gets emptied in the Frugaldom household needs to be investigated before the cat will 'allow' me to dispose of it, so this box was no different from any other.STEP 1Tear the folds off your box and lay these aside, then split the box down its seam and begin tearing it into strips across the corrugated design. My strips are usually approximately 15cm in width.STEP 2Take each of your strips and tear them into rectangles measuring approximately 20cm in length STEP 3 One piece at a time, begin rolling them up tightly, following the lines of the corrugated design going horizontally.  STEP 4 Once rolled, give the 'sticks a good twist to hold them firmly in shape. If long enough, a couple of twists might be managed.  STEP 5 You get quicker as you go, so pretty soon you'll have an entire box worth of fire sticks prepared and ready for burning. STEP 6 Store your sticks somewhere dry but not too close to the stove. I just drop mine into the basket of twigs that sits by the logs. The cardboard sticks are great for rekindling a dwindling fire, starting a new one, fast burning to help take any dampness out of the logs and hot enough while burning to quickly bring a kettle of water to the boil.   A WORD OF WARNING Cardboard burns like tinder-dry wood, so it goes up in flames hot and fast! Never fill the stove or fireplace with it if there is any chance of a chimney fire or any major backdraft. I always close the dampers on the stove before using these and seldom, if ever, burn them on the open fire unless it's to supplement the kindling sticks before adding wood or coal. They create quite a bit of ash but can also smoulder for a very long time in the same way a book would - looking like dead embers but actually still alight. I don't use them as regular fuel, just to give an extra 'boost' when needed. IT'S JUST MY WAY I appreciate that burning anything may not sound particularly environmentally friendly but when living in a cold house with no other form of central heating, any safe flammable material is fuel for the fire. It should also be noted that this only applies to the plain brown, unbleached cardboard boxes and not to anything glossy or plasticized, This is not a recommendation for how to make fuel, this is simply my way of making some extra that prevents having to bin the boxes that can't be used elsewhere. I like to think of it as recycling it into useable and affordable energy. With coal costing anything from £14 per bag upwards and a small load of logs costing £40, cardboard kindling may be the only free option left for some. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 13 of Extremely Frugal February - Chick Peas and Cheap Ice Ceam", "date": "Thursday 13 February 2014", "text": "Day 13 of 28 - A Touch of Summer!How can I possibly think of summer when I get up in the morning to a house that's 6 degrees C, I ask myself? You'll soon see.My roast beef-stretching project has gone on temporary hold by way of freezing what was left of the beef and cabbage to enable me to use up the rest of the potatoes, sprouts and turnip. After the usual routine of porridge for breakfast, today's lunch was toasted cheese with pickle. (Cheese needs to be finely grated now to make it stretch further and bring it within the realms of frugaldom affordability.) As per last night's late post, I had soaked a pan of chick peas.Today I boiled up the chick peas and then gave them a blast over the stove in a mixture of sesame oil, salt, pepper, mixed spice and chilli. This gave them an added snack-like appeal, so I set aside a cupful to mix in with tonight's dinner and the rest were left to cool, then bagged and popped into the freezer. These should be OK to use a handful at a time whenever I want or need them to bulk up a stew, casserole, stir dry or soup. I quite like eating them like peanuts!What about dinner?Leftover sprouts, potatoes and turnip all went into a big pan along with the small cup of the spicy chick peas. While the oven was heating, I diced and pan fried a breast of chicken with a clove of garlic, then threw in a handful of the frozen peppers. This all got added to the roasting tin, drizzled with oil and put into the oven until the potatoes were just beginning to roast. The plan had been to serve with a tomato-based sauce and rice, but I needed to use up the last of the boiled potatoes.Now for the good part - a slither of summer amidst the winter storms. The mixed fruit I had defrosted overnight turned out to be a mix of stewed apples, rhubarb, raspberries and blackcurrants, so I set about turning it into something more than just ice cream for my Valentine's Day treat! Here's how it went.A Little Taste of SummerThe ice cream mix is available right now on the Approved Food website at 6 packs for 99p. It uses only 150ml of milk and it works just fine with powdered, if that's all you have. Coincidentally, there's Marvel on offer and mango pulp, so I was sorely tempted to stock up for summer!The ice cream mix whisks up like double cream and roughly doubles in volume. You simply tip it into a lidded contained and then stir in your favourite accompaniment. My chosen accompaniment for this batch of frugal ice cream is a couple of tablespoons of my home-grown summer fruit sweetened with a spoonful of vanilla sugar. This is my ice cream mix all ready to go into the freezer. It's in a large plastic tub but you could use two smaller margarine tubs and make it as two different flavours.Meanwhile, I still had all of this stewed fruit left, so you can guess what I did with it, cant you? When putting the ice cream mix into the freezer, I retrieved my bag of crumble mix...... and made another big fruit crumble that serves 6, so it will last us 3 days. By the time I had made dinner and baked the crumble, the ice cream was frozen, so guess what we had for dessert tonight? :)BILLY CAN to the rescue! I am so, so tempted to go and order a stock of that ice cream mix, as I'm down to my last 3 sachets... if I ordered the mango pulp I could easily save a small fortune and have the luxury of ice cream and sorbet here all summer! I'll pop a £20 note into the tin and sleep on it! (Sleep on the notion to spend, not the tin!) There really isn't anything I NEED at the moment, what with so much to be used to keep stock rotating, and I certainly don't want to end up with anything needing binned! Can I warrant a minimum £15 order? £20 note into the tin... Will I, won't I? Will I, won't I? Will I, won't I? Grocery budget already at £151.71 for the year to date, which is way over average because of the freezer order for new year. On the other hand, almost anyone could spent £15 over the period of the summer buying ice lollies and ice cream, whereas that amount could get me a whole load of ingredients and the opportunity to stock up on pasta at 99p for 3kg... I'll let you know tomorrow, whatever I decide.NYK, Frugaldom."},

Cash spends - NILBreakfast - porridgeLunch - pastaDinner - exact same as last nightPost received - 100 coffee filters bought with Nectar Point vouchers via eBayPal popped in with a bag of hay for the Frugaldom bunnies, it was a bit like an exchange gift from the piggies for their vegetable scraps.I had a rummage in the kitchen cupboards last night and soaked some chick peas over night, but they've now gone n the fridge to be cooked tomorrow and used for I don't know what - a concoction, no doubt. If anyone can think of anything interesting to do with them that doesn't need olive oil, please let me know. I do have some sesame oil, if that's any good but we have nothing to dip and H doesn't like hummus.While drinking a cuppa, I went to have another look at Gill's awesome house in Canada and drooled some more!To cheer myself up I have now taken a carton of summer fruits from the freezer - a mix of blackcurrants and raspberries - and I'm going to make ice cream tomorrow. It will be my valentine treat from me to me. I may get around to making some lemon curd or even get around to making the second foot stool. I have grand daughter's blanket to finish, a massive rug to make, shelves in the living room waiting to be filled with books, a kitchen still in chaos and plenty of other things needing done. What I don't have is any paid work! I seem to have finished everything that needed doing and have no excuses not to fit in all these other things!Have a happy Valentine's Day, regardless of your status! Even if it's you treating yourself to a batch of homemade ice cream, make the most of it and enjoy! :)NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 11 of Extremely Frugal February - Roast Beef", "date": "Tuesday 11 February 2014", "text": "Day 11 of 28 - Bullying the Beef!Leave me to sleep!The de-clutter continues here in Frugaldom with each box being painstakingly emptied, each leaf of paper skim read and then binned or burned in a final effort to get rid of all the rubbish I have accrued over the years. The cat loves it, as she adopts each and every box I empty! Today must have been a cold one because she slept in this box for most of the afternoon. Naturally, it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it was sitting by the log burner!Yesterday, I mentioned the 600g of roast beef that was defrosting, so I want to continue with that, to help prove that good eating isn't impossible when on a tiny budget of £1 per person per day for meals. With the beef joint costing £6 and an average portion size being 100g, this easily takes up all of my budget... or does it?Beef - £6.001kg potatoes - 50p1 medium swede - 40pHalf a large cabbage - 16.5p (3 for 99p from Approved Food*)1 large onion - 10pSprouts - NILNut roast - 16.5p (3 x Granose double packs for 99p clearance)Total - £7.33I diced the onion, sprinkled it over the base of the slow cooker, placed the beef on top of it, rubbed salt into the beef then sprinkled mixed herbs over it. Added a mug of water to the crock pot and left that slow cooking for about 4 hours, adding another mug of water along the way. By the time it was done, the meat was literally coming apart, so I split it all up, leaving it stewing in the juices while I baked the nut roast and steamed all the vegetables. As I already know that porridge costs us 6p per serving, soup and homemade bread costs about 9p per person and we get through around 18p per person in incidentals like sugar, milk, tea and coffee, it means that main meals need to come in at around the 67p mark. The list of ingredients above needs to stretch really, really far. In fact, it would need to be sufficient for 11 meals in order for it to come within the frugal budget! We've already had 2, so I'll do my best with what's left. Eating roast beef isn't really something that can be done very often on such a tight budget unless you can offset the price against free produce from your own garden or barter for goods. But this is how tonight's meal looked with just a ladle of the meat stew backed up with a slice of nut roast for the extra protein. There's also a serving of homemade piccalilli in there, the first of the lot I made in September. (I blogged the recipe for my frugalilli.) Everything tasted delicious, but we probably blew the budget by having a bowl of butterscotch whip afterwards, albeit a 6p pack made with powdered milk.Mini fridgeLiving room work is progressing - the second coat of gloss is dry and I can start moving books onto shelves tomorrow. H managed to find the mini fridge, so it has been cleaned and is now sitting on the frugal bar. This will do as an ice bucket - I can simply pop the cubes into a cut-down milk carton and store the whole lot in the mini fridge when we are entertaining guests. I got this tiny cooler free some years ago courtesy of a well known office supplies company. It has both mains and car-lighter plug attachments and can be used for either keeping things cold or for keeping them warm! I have never used it in all the years I have had it, so I hope it still works.That wraps it up for today - no actual cash spent on anything and I'm now off to check out the new £1 or less section of Approved Foods.*  I see they have the ice cream mix back in stock and we love it!NYK, Frugaldom* My friend referral links."},
{"title": "Day 10 of Extremely Frugal February - Gargoyles and Dragons", "date": "Monday 10 February 2014", "text": "Day 10 of 28 - Green Men or Gargoyles?Corner of our old chess boardNormal start to the day with porridge for breakfast. The sun was shining for a bit this morning so another washing went out on the line and partially dried before the rain returned. Fresh loaf baked in time for soup lunch, except H heated the rest of the roast pepper and onion pasta, so we were left to have soup and pudding for dinner! Not much more to report from the food department today. Pudding was tinned mandarins with custard.I've taken a piece of beef out the freezer to defrost, so I'll attempt a marathon challenge to stretch it as far as possible this week. I bought it as part of a bulk discounted freezer pack so I'll call it £6 for a 600g piece of lean beef. According to recommended portion sizes, this little 'chunk' is supposed to provide us with 6 to 8 portions, depending on where you read the information, so keeping this within the realms of £1 per person per day for ALL meals is going to prove a major challenge!This afternoon I prepared the last of a white cabbage, some sprouts that were handed in by a neighbour and a turnip, all for steaming. I'd just finished prepping everything when a friend arrived to borrow something, so I gave them all the vegetable scraps to take home for their pigs when they were leaving. Zero food waste! (Just remembered I also have 4 peppers in the fridge that need slicing and freezing;  must do that tomorrow!)Having transferred my Nectar points into PayPal vouchers for eBay, I ended up spending an entire £3.84 from my household budget today when ordering 100 paper filters for the coffee machine and a set of three thermal travel mugs. Gardening time is fast approaching so the thermal mugs will come in really handy for a cuppa on the patio without fear of hot drinks going cold too quickly during winter months or cold drinks getting a fly in them during summer months!The first of my seed potatoes arrived by courier tonight - a real treat this year, as I decided to invest in some 'pure breeds' rather than just planting whatever was left over from the kitchen. Shetland Blacks are here but no signs of my Salad Blues, so I hope they haven't gone astray; they were the main reason I ordered!Now for my gargoyles or green men conundrum. I think I already mentioned finding my chess set and that I was hoping H would drag out a table for the 'new' living room. Today, he retrieved the small table from the shed and did a quick fix to reattach it to its base. Since 2003, this little table has only ever been used with a cover over it for either the TV or the Christmas tree. Since moving here in 2011 it has been in the shed. I love the table and was adamant that I would clean it up and make the most of it. (As you may have guessed, it was a freebie that came our way rather than going to landfill.)Gargoyle or green man?A little vinegar and oil got mixed together with a splash of lemon juice and then I set about deep cleaning the table. To be honest, it's the first time I have really paid close attention to the finer details in what looks like a Chinese design. Up until now, I had seen birds, flowers, berries, dragons and four 'green man' type faces, one in each corner of the table. Since cleaning and polishing the table, I have now spotted what looks like butterflies among the foliage and, on a spookier note, the 'funny faces' aren't grinning at me - they look more like gargoyles or demons, each displaying a fearful set of fangs! Having done some preliminary searches online to try and determine the origins of the pattern, I am almost certain these little faces could be Chinese demons, so I am now wondering if there is symbolic significance in the overall design of this checker board table with its entwined dragons, gargoyle-like corner features and the intricate network of flowers, foliage, birds, berries and flying insects all around the edges. Any ideas or suggestions as to the meanings, or if this is, indeed, just an ornate little games table would be greatly appreciated. NYK, FrugaldomPS: Found my £1 bargain drip tray that I bought in 2001! I just need to find the ice bucket or mini-fridge, wine bottle tops and cocktail stirrers then the frugal bar is ready for fully stocking. Needless to say, no free spirits are heading my way!"},
{"title": "Day 9 of Extremely Frugal February - Building a Bar!", "date": "Sunday 9 February 2014", "text": "Day 9 of 28 - Cleaning, Clutter, Cup Cakes and Kitchen ChaosPorridge for breakfast, as usual, then lunch was a bowl of the home made spicy lentil soup. There's enough defrosted to do us tomorrow again - just as well we like it! I'll need to make another loaf in the morning as the last one is finished and I forgot today! I did, however, end up baking some cup cakes.It's been a busy day of non-spending. I had fully intended getting more of the pink fluffy blanket knitted for grand daughter, but time evaporated! I did remember to take a carton of Bolognese sauce out of the freezer for dinner and then, after much procrastination (while sat in front of the computer) I got off my bum and made a new list on the kitchen chalk board.First up was pulling out the kitchen trolley to empty and clean it, which I did. That's when I spotted the cartons of cup cake mix and sponge mix - bargain buys from Approved Food a while back - got distracted and ended up making up a pack of the cup cake mix. Meanwhile, the entire contents of the trolley are all over the kitchen units. But worse still, I had another money-saving 'brainwave' in the middle of cleaning said unit!As you know, I am still very excited about my 'new' sofa and the fact that we now have a 'proper' living room. H has glossed around the window today plus he had made a couple of selves for the little window alcove using surplus flooring, so he painted those this afternoon, too. It makes such a huge difference, even although we need to keep the ancient single glazing for a while longer. Inside looks fresh and it is cosy with all the new insulation and the fire lit. It makes perfect space for entertaining guests. All these thoughts were going through my mind as I washed and dried the kitchen unit and then it occurred to me! I should create my home bar right now!A home bar always struck me as being the ultimate luxury 'must have' in the entertaining stakes. I had seen a few, mostly built-in and involving wall mounted optics, elaborate lighting, curves, polished bar tops and accompanying bar stools. Well, those things aren't strictly necessary, are they? All that's really needed is a flat surface and some storage space! I wheeled my kitchen trolley through to the living room... then remembered that I had stacked the other two big plastic cases full of paperwork in the corner to double as a makeshift lamp table! DISTRACTION ALERT!Finishing emptying the boxes of paperwork was on my list! I had already done one of them and turned it into a footstool, so I set about emptying the next one. A second storage foot stool could be on its way soon but the third box isn't, yet emptied. There's a limit to how quickly you can check through several years' worth of paperwork before separating it for burning, shredding, composting or binning. The stove had been raging all afternoon! Meanwhile, I slotted the kitchen trolley where the boxes had been and then raked out the dusty booze bottles from the cupboard below the stairs. It's probably just as well that alcohol doesn't go off, because most of mine has been accrued from gifts over the past few years, then set aside to open and share once we had a place to entertain friends. Well friends, this is it! I just need a few more glasses, as mine are made up from the free ones you used to get with 'Nutella', several years ago!The trolley does not look out of place at all in the room, as I have covered it with curtains identical to the ones I have hanging in the window. Looking in the living room door (or window, if it's the neighbours walking past) you can't even tell it's a kitchen trolley. You can just see it in the back left hand corner of the photograph, disguised as a lamp table behind my precious frugal sofa.Next up is making the second foot stool, raking in the out-buildings for the coffee tables we salvaged and, of course, sorting out the kitchen chaos. Dinner, as usual, was late and contrary to what I was expecting to make, the contents in the freezer tub turned out to be chunky roast red pepper and onion soup! I boiled up some penne pasta, poured the soup over the top, topped it all with grated cheese and popped it under the grill in the mini oven. After about 15 minutes, it came out looking slightly Mediterranean - I called it dinner!That's it for today - kitchen is still chaotic, log burner has burned a stack more paper and cardboard sticks, I used about 10kg of coal to give the house a blast of warmth throughout and heat a tank of water and the shelves in the living room are all ready for a second coat of paint tomorrow. Oh! And I found my old chess set while emptying boxes, so that's something else that can go into the 'new' living room. I am no further forward with either grand daughter's fluffy blanket or my rag rug!NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 8 of Extremely Frugal February - Burnt Biscuits and Leftovers", "date": "Saturday 8 February 2014", "text": "Cardboard Cooking Skills, Frugal Fried Food and Carbon Flavoured BiscuitsFrugal Fuel for Wilbur, the Pot Belly (Pig) StoveIn my never-ending quest for frugal living and to combat the problem of surplus waste, I have found plain brown cardboard to be excellent for many things - packaging, composting, weed suppressing, feeding to the worms in the Frugaldom wormery or simply for turning into cooker fuel. Once alight, it can boil a kettle of water in no time and caramelise onions within minutes.What a cold and wet day it has been, today! I've barely wandered further than the kitchen, other than to take another peek through the living room door to admire my frugal sofa, homemade crafty footstool and my latest acquisition - a beautiful antique, carved wooden fireside box, which, as it transpires, originated from the north east of Scotland. It came to me after being salvaged by a little family business known as 'DL and Sons' in Lincolnshire, so it has done a bit of traveling in its time. Who knows what stories it could tell! This wonderful old box has now taken pride of place by the Frugaldom fireplace and holds kindling sticks, firelighters, matches and newspapers. It's meant for coal, but I consider it quite an awesome feature piece within our eco-renovation and want it to last. Meanwhile, back on the frugal food train... my biscuit baking mostly gets done in the mini-oven, which works pretty well most times. Except today I got distracted on Facebook, forgetting to rescue said biscuits before they acquired that familiar flavour we all know as carbon. Don't get me wrong, they weren't charred black, but they had gone past the stage of 'well done'. No matter, they won't be wasted! Crunchy they may be but with raisins the price they are, wasting any is not an option. Another cup of tea to wash them down, anyone?I didn't bother to light the coal fire, so dinner got cooked on the stove tonight again. Having taken delivery of my precious wooden treasure last night, I had a lovely big cardboard box to recycle today, so it got made into fire sticks! Burning these along with a few logs provides ultra fast heat, high temperature and, despite some extra ash, plenty of cooking time when there's a full box to use just for that purpose.So, what culinary delight did we feast upon this evening?﻿﻿I don't think this has a proper name but if it does, please let me know. It's another one of those frugal 'bowl food' concoctions that gets thrown together in the cast iron pan. This one tasted kind of southern fried, as I had cooked the diced chicken breast in some fajita-type seasoning and then added in the leftover white and red cabbage plus the rest of last night's swede. It made for a colourful, nutritious meal and tasted lovely into the bargain.That about wraps up today's frugal living. Other than some hot glue sticks I needed to replace, which are immaterial to the cost of running the household, I have, once again, spent no actual cash.The kettle has just come to the boil again for making a pot of tea and we have the last slice of apple and sultana pie to eat, then it will be time to relax and pick up my knitting needles for the final stages of the latest fluffy blanket. I have vowed to complete this before doing any more of my rag rug!NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 7 of Extremely Frugal February - I'm Steaming!", "date": "Friday 7 February 2014", "text": "Day 7 of 28 - No cash spends at all.On the seventh day of February, someone must have said, 'let the sun shine'... and it did, in between rain and hail and then eventually for most of the afternoon. The washing machine went on, the laundry went out on the line and several hours later came back in again, just ever so slightly drier than it was when it came out the machine! I won't keep posting all the price break-downs of our daily meals as I have been cooking and eating the same way for years and most of the prices are already on the blog somewhere. On average, I spend an average of £1 per person per day on groceries and find this to be sufficient by the time I have bartered or exchanged Frugaldom surplus and used up any affiliate or friend referral payments throughout the year. I know that if a chicken costs £5 that I need to get at least 5 or 6 meals and a pot of soup out of it. Cheese can no longer be looked upon as a snack food (it needs to be part of a main meal) and I certainly cannot bake with butter on a regular basis - it's mosty 25p tinned margarine or reduced buttery spread, depending on what's available. Even that is becoming expensive!The biggest difficulty I have in maintaining the £1 per person per day budget is in ensuring we consume sufficient fruit and vegetables in our diet and that's where I need to get very creative. With no immediate access to regular supplies of fresh fruit from shops, we are more reliant on vegetables and home grown fruit, like rhubarb, apples, plumbs and berries, plus dried fruit like sultanas and raisins. I try to add extra dried fruit into any biscuits I bake, we love raisin bread and I prefer to have turnip rather than just potatoes. White cabbage is fairly cheap and a whole cabbage goes a long way, so getting the opportunity of 3 for £1 can't be missed. Just now we are eating cabbage on a regular basis, but I also make the most of frozen vegetables whenever I get the chance to buy some. You can usually get up to a kilo of those for around £1. This year, I have been very extravagant and have ordered several types of seed potatoes, including heritage varieties, and some onion sets. The garlic is still progressing well and I have several packs of seeds sitting waiting to be planted as soon as the worst of the winter is past.Based on the 80g per serving fruit or veg theory of the 5-a-day, we need to consume 400g of fresh fruit, vegetables and pulses per person per day, excluding potatoes, as these don't count. Beans count, so we should keep a good stock for both this purpose and for their protein content, likewise with lentils for curry and soup-making. Otherwise, the more fruit, veg and herbs I can grow, the less I need to buy, but it still amounts to the best part of 300kg of 5-a-day foodstuffs per year just for this Frugaldom household of 2. I think it sounds just as big a challenge to consume that amount of food as it does to grow it.This being an extremely frugal month, I am trying to eat from my store cupboards again, hoping to reduce the amount that needs to be moved before I can progress to the next step of my home décor project - making a mini bar/refreshments unit for entertaining friends! I have allocated myself a special celebratory budget of £20 for this - pure extravagance! :)For dinner tonight I has a turnip, some red and white cabbage and some more 'Nile' mince to use up, so the diced turnip went on one tier of the steamer, cabbage on the next and mince with a couple of handfuls of sweetcorn in a glass bowl in the top tier - this cooking method greatly cuts down on energy use and actually costs less than keeping the stove blazing hot enough to do the same job. Homemade apple and sultana pie (compliments of last night's visitors) for pudding and, as one might expect, served with instant custard.Usual 'waste not, want not' approach to vegetable peelings applies and we now have one additional method of recycling these after a friend's sow had 14 piglets! This little lot will be heading to mummy piggy very soon!Before I forget, I have a porridge update!I decided to read the side of the porridge pack this morning and it states that a portion is only 30g! My pricing is for 50g portions but when I weighed them they are actually only 45g. This is quite worrying, as I was thinking we were only consuming about 10% above the recommended serving when, in actual fact, we are consuming an extra 50%! I will try to cut down, thus further reducing the costs per serving, but there's no way would my Jack Spratt housemate survive on a 30g serving, that is just crazy! On the other hand, if we did stick to the recommendation, it would mean getting 33 bowls of porridge from a 1kg bag of oats costing 75p. Now that's what I call frugal food!NYK, Frugaldom"},

I'm allowing about £2.50 for logs, as I wasn't overly vigilant about keeping the stove roaring today, but it did get used for heating all the hot water we used.My new frugal carpet got delivered late this afternoon and is currently lying in the hall - I'll try not to trip over it again! Needless to say, it arrived just as H and neighbour were about to go and collect the sofa, so we haven't had time to lay it, meaning the sofa has had to go into neighbour's garage until tomorrow. I spent most of last night and today worrying about one thing I had overlooked... measurements! It's a big sofa and we have tiny doors! As it turned out, all the cushion top is removable and it should fit in when we move it tomorrow - I'll let you know how that goes!Next worry was moving the sofa in an open trailer during a howling gale with torrential rain and hail. By sheer luck, the wind dropped and the rain almost stopped for about 45 of the 55 minutes it took them to haul it home! Thankfully, we did manage to find tarpaulins and the neighbour had one for over the top of the trailer. All is well, I am happy and we should have the living room beginning to look like a living room by tomorrow evening, at which point we will be celebrating with some leftover New Year 'cheer'!I'd just like to say a very big thank you to the young gentleman who gave us this beautiful piece of furniture by way of 'pay it forward', to those who have helped make it possible to move it from A to B, to the neighbour whose garage we have borrowed and also to those who, tomorrow, are coming to lay the carpet and help man-handle the sofa into place.I love my new sofa and I still haven't even seen it properly - it was too dark by then!NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 4 of Extremely Frugal February - Homemade Soup & a Teapot Warmer", "date": "Tuesday 4 February 2014", "text": "Just Another Frugal Day in Penny ParadiseApologies for a belated post but the day escaped from my grasp while I went off in search of some more furniture and attempted to catch up with all the frugal news.Spending was at an all-time low after the normal porridge breakfast, a pasta lunch and then just soup and pudding for dinner tonight. At most, I reckon the food total amounted to under £1 including cooking it and I didn't light the fire, just kept the log burner going all day. I'll call it £4 in total so it covers the tea and coffee.Today's Homemade SoupI have made about 3.5 litres of the stuff and I'm calling it spicy ham and lentil with pasta bits. I started off with about 4 litres of stock made from stock cubes I'd bought on offer at only 10p per pack! They were past BBE date but that matters not a jot to me, it's cheap stock at twice the price. Added to that was about 300g of red lentils (30p-ish?) and 2 sachets of something called Spicy Tomato and Basil Orzo. When made up as per directions on the pack, it tastes a bit like mini pasta with a spicy sauce... I didn't make it up as directed, I poured the dried contents of both packs in with the lentils and stock and let it slow cook for a couple of hours. The Orzo cost, I think, 5 packs for £1 from Approved Food at some point and this box was found lurking at the back of my cupboard. (Orzo is tiny pasta shaped like grains of rice.) The soup tastes lovely, it's spicy hot and it's very filling. However, if you are anything like me, you'll have a stock of 10 packs for £1 strawberry whip, so soup and pudding is always an option.We caved and had supper tonight - Herby naan bread lightly toasted with a sprinkle of cheese - which would be sheer, unadulterated luxury if I had paid full price for the Naans and cheese - but, of course, I didn't. It was, however, still a good 50p for the two of us and it wasn't strictly necessary. Now I need to eat double portions of veggies for the next few days to make up for today's wacky meals.Hints and tips for use during power cutsDoes anyone know what this is?Look closely and have a guess, if you haven't already read about it elsewhere on my blog, forums or other web pages.Yes, you are correct! That is a light shining through the holes and it throws some pretty patterns on dark walls during power cuts.Here comes the next clue...This contraption is made from two of the parts that make up my three-tier steamer and I burn tea light candles inside it so I have some place to warm plates or keep the tea pot warm while the kettle is on the stove. I simply invert the top tier to give it a flat surface for the teapot or can leave it the correct way round for sitting plates over to keep them and their contents warm rather than switch on the mini oven. (Last time I included this in a post was when demonstrating how uneconomical it was to attempt to warm a room using candles in the wake of the resurgence of the 'candle heater' post on Facebook.)And now the main reason for my belated post this evening - I have found myself an absolutely fabulous bargain sofa for the living room and have arranged for some help to collect it. (Neighbours are helping tomorrow night.) My only niggling worry is that there's yet another storm howling around us at the moment, bringing more torrential rain and hail, but the sofa will have to be moved over 20 miles in an open top trailer... I suspect we may need to reschedule if this awful weather continues unabated. I have until Saturday to collect my fantastic sofa that I've only seen in photos - it looks stunning to me! The current owner is giving this away and I feel so lucky at finding such a treasure in the free ads that it is ridiculously exciting! :)Right now, I am like a kid awaiting Santa, desperate to see my new piece of furniture! It will provide a place to sit other than the futon bed settee that has served as a couch for the past 11 years and travelled around 5 houses with me. (That deserves a bit of rest and recuperation.) The 'new' sofa also has storage underneath it - oh the joys! Even more storage for my crafting goodies, magazines, books and whatever; I really cannot wait to see this! If it needs a cover throwing over it, I'll use one of my big knitted blankets.Tomorrow also sees the expected delivery of my bargain carpet. If 'Lady Luck' smiles on me, there may be a 'proper' living room beginning to take shape in time for my next blog update."},

Stove got lit and the fire's cleaned out ready for kindling if it gets too cold. It's wet and windy out now and we've had intermittent power cuts. A neighbour popped in with some hot cross buns, so they made a fine, tasty accompaniment when spread with homemade hedgerow jelly and a steaming mug of hot tea.

I have been logging my meter readings for several years but decided to delete previous address and stick with just this one, seeing as this is meant to be my permanent home for the foreseeable future.

This is how my chart is looking right now:Charting power consumption since moving here in June 2011As you can see, electricity consumption has reached some fairly lofty peaks over the past two winters, reaching an astounding 275 kWh. Last winter we had the pot belly stove fitted. The open fire had to be ripped out to replace the backboiler and then we'd to have a new fireplace built, so electricity was our only option. As you can see by my chart, October to April over the past two winters has shown massive increases on summer figures, but look at October onwards for this winter... we're still driving down the power usage and are now at one fifth of our top winter use. Today's reading shows 55 units for the past week, 10 of these for an electric oil-filled radiator running in the outbuilding that will become our 'ecoarts' studio this summer.Breakfast was the usual 12p porridge and I thought it best to mention that we eat Scottish porridge in this household and we have greatly reduced the sugar used to the point that I sometimes don't bother with any at all. We use 2 x 50g scoops of oats (7.5p) with 5 scoops water and a pinch of salt, which is enough for two, then serve this with a splash of milk and, if preferred, a little sprinkle of sugar. By reducing or omitting sugar, this becomes an extremely frugal meal that can be eaten at any time of day. I am pleased to say that the cost of this is cheaper now than last year owing to cooking for less time and allowing it to stand for a minute or two to complete the cooking process on its own.Intermittent power cuts today meant stove top cooking and kettle boiling. When we boil the kettle of water for coffee or tea, whatever is left goes into flasks for later use. It means there's always some spare for rinsing dishes, mixing up a cuppa soup or making instant custard. Tea is made by the pot and kept warm on the stove. I keep my mug warm using a USB mug warmer - a novelty gift I got several years ago. It doesn't keep the contents hot, just slows down the cooling process. We also have USB heated slippers and an assortment of rechargers for torch, radio, Kindles and iPods! Anything to save using electricity. The laptops are run on battery power until such times as the warning signals flash up to save work and recharge or switch to alterative power. Apparently, this also helps prolong the life of the batteries.Lunch was beans (heated on the stove) on toast - almost a luxury now that beans cost 33p per tin! I used the outside slices of the bread and now need to make another loaf. We'll call lunch 39p. I have bargain, bulk bought flour and plenty of yeast that was part of a gift from someone. I love that my visitors bring practical gifts rather then cut flowers! My vase is still filled with winter greenery in the form of holly and conifers, but through summer, it gets filled with garden herbs or wild flowers of the most common varieties.Dinner was a carb fest! Baked potato with lasagne mince and grated cheese, costing 82p for two, plus yet another pudding of 21p rhubarb crumble and custard. (Did I mention that we eat dessert or pudding most days in this house?) Cheese is now becoming a luxury item, so I always grate it fine to make it go further. Slicing, dicing and grating is a great way of making most things go further.Total spend on meals for two for the day = £1.78Just out of interest, I took a look back at 2012's menu list for a fabulously frugal February. You can visit it here, although you may need to register to read the posts, as we get targeted by spam if that's not in place. Quite a few price changes since then, too!No other spends from the household budget today other than £2.50 for the logs. No coal used and no cash spent, so an overall spend of £4.28 plus the unseen costs.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Footstools and Crafty Storage Space", "date": "Monday 3 February 2014", "text": "Upcycling, Recycling and Making Creative Storage FurnitureGet the kettle on, pour a cuppa and get comfy. I'll apologise now for doing two posts today (second one to follow) but this is, after all, extremely frugal February and blogging is free.We are making some progress with the eco-renovations, albeit very slowly. The 'new' living room has now been painted using up what we had available to us: needless to say, it's magnolia walls, white ceiling and white woodwork. I have a few bits and pieces that can be reused, like a curtain rail, curtains, book shelves and a chair rescued before it found its way to the tip, plus I have the £4 mirror I bought from a charity shop last year and a little coffee table that got diverted here rather than being binned. Ideally, I want a warm comfy room with plenty of storage space so I can sit by the fireside with my feet up, relaxing and reading, knitting, crocheting or rug making. A storage foot stool was definitely on the list of wants, even if it wasn't an absolute necessity. I now have a storage footstool and I love it!A few years ago, I invested in several large plastic storage containers. These have been used for dry goods in the kitchen pantry, breakables during house moves and paperwork that now no longer needs to be kept, so I am clearing them out. This afternoon, I managed to empty the first of three. Most of the contents were recycled into fuel for the fire, but I did find a few handy bits and pieces for future use. The cat found a use for almost everything!First box emptied and a rummage through my fabric and crafting stash soon netted me enough to complete the project that I have had in mind for some time.About to tackle the lidHot glue guns are fabulous - I've had mine for several years now and still manage to either burn my fingers or stick stuff to my nails but I wouldn't be without it. So, hot glue gun at the ready, along with an old pillow, part of old fleece blanket and some velour/velvety fabric I inherited from my late aunt, who had obviously been curtain making at some point.The box lid will become the top of my storage foot stoolFirst, I glues the pillow at each corner and attached it to the lid of my plastic storage container. The overall dimensions of the container are approximately 70cm x 40cm x 40cm, so these are by no means small. The padded lid was then covered in the fleece and glued around the inside rim to hold it all in place.The only bit of sewing was for the main coverNext, I measured and cut my brown fabric to fit all the way around the container and then machine stitched it together for quickness. I could easily have hand sewn it but the novelty of having access to my inherited sewing machine hasn't worn off me yet. :)Adding a decorative finishing touchAfter covering the container in the velour, I secured it underneath and inside using glue. Among my stash, I found some braid and stuck that across the top of the lid. I'd have liked it to have gone all the way around the lid, but didn't have enough of it. (Aunt must have made lampshades, as there is a box filled with off cuts of this sort of stuff - it was like a real treasure trove to me when cousin gave me it!)My crafty storage footstoolThe entire project took me less than 3 hours to complete, even allowing time to rummage for fabric, sew the cover and let the glue set before packing all my current crafting projects inside for easy access while sitting with my feet up in front of the fire. There is enough fabric left to make a second one almost identical to this one, barring having to use slightly different braid. Extremely frugal February is already throwing up some fun activities to help protect the finances."},

One picked me up a carton of milk on her way through the village, which accounts for my cash spend of the day, and the other brought me a gift of cheese and UHT milk, plus some gorgeous nail polish I had recently admired. In exchange for such gifts, I helped out with some book keeping, gave away some recycled folders for filing receipts and rehomed some old magazines. I love Sunday trading!Today was Candlemas - not that we celebrate it in any way - so I had been weather watching, expecting the storms of recent to descend on us once again. As one of the sayings goes, If Candle-mas Day is bright and clear, There'll be two winters in the year.However, the day dawned bright and stayed clear - if the old wives' tales and folklore are true, we have winter ready to make a ferocious return. I can already feel the temperature dropping since the rain clouds departed. It was 7 degrees C indoors this morning, it's now 15 degrees C after having the little stove burning all day. I stood firm against using any coal today. Was that extremely, I wonder?DAY 2Spending:Paid friend for the milk she got me from the village store - £1.62 spent. I also asked that she buy it using a £10 note so I could do a simple swap and have change in the house because cash by way of spare change isn't easy to come by when you live in a rural location. I didn't want to dip into the coppers jar, nor would she have wanted 162 pennies! I gave her some gardening magazines to pass on to her dad, who always appreciates a look at these after I'm done with them. I get them given to me from another neighbour whose greenhouses I look after whenever they're on holiday.Heating:Only Wilbur, our little pot-bellied stove, has been lit today, so 'he' has probably consumed around £2.50 worth of logs. I was vigilant and used the stove top for boiling kettles of water and for making pots of tea while visitors were here, then cooked tonight's dinner over it.Eating:Porridge for breakfast, cooked, as usual, in the 700w microwave for 5 minutes and costing 12p for 2 people.Lunch was a sandwich with homemade bread and hedgerow jelly. I'm not too sure how to price this, as all the fruit and berries used in the jelly making are foraged for free locally. I guess with sugar bought at 75p per bag, it might cost around 25p per jar to make, so pennies per serving plus allow about 5p for bread - we'll call it 20p for lunch for 2.Stove top cookingDinner is another chicken fillet (£1) diced and spiced using some free seasoning I got with my last MuscleFood* order. (My friend referral link will automatically give you 4 free chicken fillets with your first order.) Peppers cost me 99p/3 from Approved Food*, so I used half a red and half a green (33p) in tonight's meal, along with the remainder of the mushrooms I got from a neighbour. I do return the favours - I supply the neighbour with hen and duck eggs when the feathered friends are laying plus fresh herbs from the garden and she supplies me with freshly baked cakes, newspapers for recycling and any little bits and pieces she can't cook before it spoils. It's a great set-up and one shared by several of us about here. I also had some leftover boiled potatoes that I had popped into the fridge on Friday night, so these went in with everything else to create what I call 'frugal bowl food' - a mishmash of flavours served in a big bowl.We have drunk much more tea than normal today. It is loose leaf tea that was being cleared at 40p per 500g bag from Approved Food, so I bought 6 bags of the stuff in the hope that it will last the best part of 2014. It's not like dried tea leaves will go off if they're kept sealed, is it? I did the same with coffee beans, but bought 10kg of them. I reckon it costs us about 2p per cup of tea, although H takes sugar in his, so that costs an extra 4p per cup! Average is 3p, so I shall allow 36p including milk for all the tea that has been drunk today!Overall mealtime spends for the day - £2.01 including tea for guests plus another 30p for the packet of custard creams demolished while chatting, so £2.31FREE SEEDS!How extreme was my frugaling today? Well, having used up what I had left of a red and green pepper, I saved the middles from them and, with a bit of luck, these little seeds will grow into some lovely sweet pepper plants this summer. I'll keep you up to date on progress as soon as I get some of them germinated.Today's extremely frugal February day cost a whopping great (edited) £6.64 plus the unseen costs of running your own home. I could have put my foot down and been extreme by not having shop-bought custard creams to save myself 30p but, like I say, I'm not all that extreme. Plus, I do love a bit of bartering while sitting catching up with friends, neighbours or family over a cuppa.Edit: I had to come back and add another 21p to today's budget after H decided we needed pudding for supper - more homemade rhubarb crumble and custard! I should have put my foot down and said no, but as a mere house-sharer, I can't really do that.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Day 1 of Extremely Frugal February - A Daily Diary for a Short Month", "date": "Saturday 1 February 2014", "text": "28 Days of Extreme Frugal LivingDay 1 of 28 and I've spent almost £8.50 of my household budget.Often, I am accused of being 'extreme' in my pursuit of frugal living. I can (and do) live without many things that others see as essentials, but my needs, just as my wants, differ from theirs. Having been reading, once again, about the escalating need for food banks, the arrests of squat-living, skip-diving, Freegans and even more proposed cuts in local government spending, I couldn't help but compare my supposed extremism to how others live their lives. I am nowhere near extreme - I actually consider myself to be no more than moderately frugal, sufficient to maintain my own solvency, despite earning less than half the UK national minimum wage.DAY 1Spending: A friend was visiting after a trip into town, so I afforded myself the luxury of spending £1.00 on two bottles of washing up liquid, as Morrisons supermarket had them on special offer.Heating: Both the multifuel stove and the open fire got lit - one for providing us with a warm room and the other to warm the water and radiators to keep the chill and dampness off the other rooms. This probably cost about £5.00 for a day, judging by the number of logs we get through and the 10kg or so of coal. On the plus side, the washing has all dried on airers over the radiators and we've got plenty of hot water, including what has been getting boiled on the stove top for hot drinks, instant custard and flask-filling. There's certainly enough to fill a couple of hot water bottles and this is something I need to get used to doing during the cold winter months.Eating: Porridge for breakfast, cooked in a 700w microwave for 5 minutes, now costs 12p for 2 people. Electricity is costing us 17p per kWh after factoring in the weekly standing charge. Lunch was homemade bread toasted and served with spaghetti, at a total cost of around 36p for two of us.Dinner was a single chicken breast, which now costs £1, diced and stir fried with a large onion (10p), a pepper and a few mushrooms, all dowsed in some cheap (5p) sauce. The pepper and mushrooms came to me free via a neighbour who handed them in to save binning them. This was all served with noodles, which cost me less than 10p. Not content with that, I also made a large fruit crumble using a tub of garden-grown rhubarb (I stew it then freeze it) and a sachet of sponge mix crumbed with margarine. Counting in all the stewing and baking times plus ingredients, the fruit crumble cost just under 40p and will provide 6 servings (13p for 2). Add on another 8p for some instant custard and there you have it... total cost for dinner for two, including electricity for cooking, amounted to £1.46 so that's only 73p per person for a two course main meal.The above prices all include the cost of cooking, which could be done cheaper using the stove top and provided us with three hot meals each at an overall cost of just £1.94This was the extent of today's spending - £7.94 I'll allow some extra for switching on lights (max 5w LED bulbs), running two laptops and for milk and tea - let's call it £8.50 for everything, except the unseen overheads. Even at this amount, I could split today's spending into needs and wants. The following things were not essential:Washing up liquid £1Coal to warm the entire house £3Noodles with the chicken and vegetable stir fry 10pRhubarb crumble with custard 21pElectricity for stir frying when I could have cooked on the stove top 6pIf I was in dire need of cutting my spending to the bone, I could easily have halved my spends and let's not forget that this is for two adults, not just for me.My 'normal' budget for everything including household insurance, clothing, transport and luxuries like a TV licence, pets, a home phone, internet access, socialising, entertainment, travel and gift-giving is £10.95 per day or £13.70 including Council Tax. We have no rent or mortgage to pay but if we did, that could easily double the living costs.I don't think I am extreme in the least. On the contrary, I can afford everything I need while also saving for whatever I want. As long as I can earn my share of that £13.70 per day and call where I live my home, that should suffice for now.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Help Save our Libraries!", "date": "Friday 31 January 2014", "text": "Councils, Cuts and Foolish Finances!Wigtown County Buildings, which house the librarySign the petition against proposed cuts HERE It is with some dismay that I read of Dumfries and Galloway Council proposing cuts to Wigtown Library opening hours, from 40.5 hours to 17.5 hours per week. To many, this is possibly nothing more than the next cut in an already over-stretched (some may prefer to say badly-spent) budget forced upon the council by circumstances beyond their control. But for those of us who live here in Wigtownshire, the threat of cutting the library opening hours is nothing short of outrageous! Wigtown is a small town - not a village, a town - home to around 1,000 people. It's our nearest town, about 10 miles from Frugaldom. The County Buildings, in which the library is now located, underwent massive refurbishment between 2000 and 2003 shortly after Wigtown was awarded official recognition as Scotland's national book town. I'll repeat myself here; Wigtown is Scotland's national BOOK town - as in the town of BOOKS. Any Government cut backs that could result in restricting public access to books within a national book town is nothing short of scandalous! In fact, if it wasn't such a serious threat, one might be forgiven for considering it as a sick joke! Sign the petition against proposed cuts to Wigtown library HERE﻿ The county buildings and all that they contain are the hub of the Wigtown community, with the library providing free access to books, papers, research facilities, computing and, lest we forget, the Internet. It has a children's area, a fun place for littlies to gather and listen to the fantastic tales told by the likes of Renita Boyle , one of the local authors and storytellers.  A library opens up a whole new world to anyone who may not necessarily have the wherewithal to buy books. It provides online access and contact with the outside world for visiting writers, book collectors and other visitors to the area, especially during festivals and fairs. Let's face it, we can't rely on mobile phones about here and it's not as though everyone has phone lines installed, let alone owns a computer with an Internet connection.  Wigtown library serves as an information access point for tourists and yes, some may see it as taking advantage of the place, but there's no getting away from the fact that the library can provide a bit of warmth, comfort and peace to enjoy a good book while just passing the time of day. Libraries ensure books stay in print and are made available to all who want to turn real pages and they allow us the freedom to choose what, where and when we read. Sign the petition against proposed cuts to Wigtown library HERE A library is about providing an open learning facility for anyone who cares to venture through its doors. It should be accessible throughout the day and week. If these proposed cuts go ahead, will anyone take the time to co-ordinate the newly reduced opening hours with the times of our dwindling public bus services? We have no public transport to or from our tiny corner of this county, but we do have a visit from the library bus every three weeks. Will the library buses be stopped in the near future, I wonder?  We, as frugalers, should embrace and support these precious resources in whatever way we can. Even if you would not be directly affected by a reduction in services, you represent the electorate whose votes put Governments and their people in high places. Our tax money contributes to their salaries, so it is up to us to ensure that these people take responsibility for how they spend our money. As frugalers, spending within our own means is something we do.As frugalers, avoiding unsustainable debts is something we do.As frugalers, making do and mending is part of our daily routine.As frugalers, sharing our knowledge freely is something we do.As frugalers, doing our best to support one another is something we do.As frugalers, access to public services may be paramount to the survival of our lifestyle. To everyone who is following, everyone who is attempting to follow and even to those of you who do no more than read about following a frugal lifestyle, I would ask that you carefully consider needs, as opposed to wants. In my opinion, we need our libraries to remain open and accessible fulltime. For some, they are the only leisure facilities left within the realms of affordability and for others, they provide the only warm and quiet retreat available to them for relaxation, reading and/or study. For writers, illustrators, photographers,  translators and editors, libraries represent a trickle of income derived by way of Public Lending Rights, for those with eyesight problems, they may be the only local source of large print or audio-books... the list goes on!  Why shouldn't we stand together and fight these proposed cuts when they could result in us giving up the luxury of free access to the books and services we need when we need them? Help us to say no to cuts in our library services then feel free to come back and request our help when it's your turn. Sign the petition against proposed cuts to Wigtown library HERE and, if it is within your power, come visit in May during the festival. I'll try to meet you in the library! NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Shaggy Rag Rug Adventures", "date": "Thursday 30 January 2014", "text": "Frugal Rag RugsSeveral years ago, I began making myself a little rag rug using a piece of hessian cut from a peanut sack and some spare fabric from curtains and pillow slips.  I had great plans of completing before moving onto something more adventurous.  I photographed it.  I blogged about it.  I never finished it because I gave it to a neighbour who needed something to cushion a rock beneath her garden pond so it didn't rip the liner. That was in February 2010 and this is now almost February 2014. Making my rug has been on my 'things to do' list for quite some time, so I decided, in October 2013, that this would be the year of the frugal rug and perhaps I could even encourage a few others to join in the fun; I bought 5 metres of brand new hessian/jute from a seller on eBay. (It cost less than £10 including delivery.) 28th January 2014This week, despite having so many other things to do and yet still managing to avoid doing them, I cut a 2 metre length of the hessian and decided it was now or never! I started my rug on Tuesday 28th January 2014. As you can see, I have no fancy tools. I have half a wooden clothes peg sharpened to a point and used as a prodding tool. This is going to be a mammoth task but it is one that I am going to derive much pleasure from over the coming months, or perhaps even years!  To begin with, I folded the jute in half then folded it again so I 29th January 2014could easily mark the centre point. In that centre, I drew my magic circle that will lead me to my final destination - the completion of the rug. I have all sorts of stories and pictures in my head that I won't woven into this piece, but I think starting with a yellow circle is a good way to go - it represents the sun. I love geometric shapes and mosaics, I love patchwork and random colours, I love life unfolding to tell its own story, rather than trying to lay out a basic format from start to finish. My grand daughter may want to help, friends or other family members may want to add a few rags of their own, so each little part will have its own story to tell. 30th January 2014Next, I added four more circles, each with a smaller circle within it, to represent earth surrounded by whatever you want to imagine - sky, water, wind, atmosphere - this will be a rug that will have the ability to make people imagine all sorts of possibilities. Four more circles of mixed greens and reds represent anything you want them to - life and love, perhaps. Yesterday, someone sent me a pretty picture of a unicorn, so I have now drawn rearing unicorns on either side of my centre piece.  30th January 2014The unicorns will take a bit of prodding to get them looking anywhere near how I would like them to look, but I'm in no hurry and am enjoying working on this project. They make me think of folklore and fantasy, conjuring up images of flowers, rainbows and mysticism, so who knows where that could lead. Perhaps I need some trees and birds, too. The first unicorn, 30th January 2014The unicorn is coming along slowly, I don't think it's too bad for a first attempt. I have almost finished the navy material I'm using to edge it, so I'll move to green for the bottom half. I'll add more photographs as the rug progresses but I can tell you now, I have no pre-conceived ideas about how this will eventually look - it really is a crafting adventure into the unknown. It's a work in progress and the final design will be reflect life as it happens, chats with friends and memories recalled during the making of this rug. One day, it might take pride of place in the living room and stay with me to become a family heirloom but, equally, it could simply become a homemade gift for someone else. NYK in Frugaldom"},

{"title": "Frugal Bytes - Historic Shopping Prices", "date": "Monday 20 January 2014", "text": "Clearing Clutter is so Time Consuming!Following on from my previous post about list-making, I managed to tick off a few items from the list:I made laundry liquidI baked biscuitsI did the floor plan for the redesign of my kitchen spaceI picked and pickled some beetrootI began sorting out the next box of old paperworkThe trouble is, I need to read all the paperwork before I turn it into firelighters and this current box contains the receipts from my 2007 moneysaving challenge. Folder one turned out to be the year's grocery shopping receipts! Now I don't know about you, but the changes in food prices over the years are something that greatly interest me, so I had to browse these receipts and find out which products were escalating in price, which were fairly constant and which, if any, had actually reduced. Priority note - I bought cigarettes in 2007 and the cost, then, was £4.27 for 20 of the cheapest available. Not having bought any for some years, can anyone tell me how much 20 Richmond King Size now costs? As you'll see by the receipts, I had the choice of two main stores - our local Co-op or the Somerfield store in town, which has, since, changed to Sainsbury's and had an Aldi store built next door to it. Still, it's a 20 mile round trip to Co-op and a 40+ mile round trip to town, so Co-op needs to suffice for most things. The biggest price increases over the last 7 years, for me, have been in the following products:Chicken (£2.98)Bread (57p)Biscuits (HobNobs 42p)Firelighters (49p)Cheese (£1.67)Butter & margarine (99p for 2)Baked beans (18p)Sugar (76p)Washing up liquid (14p)Total for the above: £8.20Based on current supermarket prices for the same items, the above items would now cost me £16.62 That is MORE THAN DOUBLE the price of 2007! Detergents seem to have escalated in price to beyond belief, while a decent, mature cheddar cheese is slowly creeping out of reach unless it's on offer. You can see now why I now make all my own bread, biscuits, firelighters, laundry liquid and cleaning products! I do allow myself the luxury of washing-up liquid, but at FIVE TIMES the 2007 prices, it isn't used as liberally as it might otherwise have been, that's for sure! NYK, FrugaldomKeeping Track to Save Losing Focus of FrugalityI need to work to lists and keep notes on almost everything - it's the only way I can remember everything and show any semblance of organisational skills. Most would call me scatter-brained, if I'm honest! My websites, message boards, forums and blogs became my money saving, frugal living journals and yet I still wander off track if I don't write things down! This is my homemade kitchen chalk board - I'm going to try and shame myself into working through the items by posting the list here to see how long it actually takes me to complete it. I also use this one for messages, like what's needed from the shop during the next visit but also as a way of considering how to make whatever rather than buy it. Today's lists between here, the pin board and my notes: Making laundry liquid on stovetopNEEDEDWashing up liquidFirelightersBiscuitsLaundry detergentPouffe/footstool/ottoman for sitting room TO DOMake firelightersBake biscuitsMake laundry liquidSort out boxes of old paperworkMake a pouffe/stool/ottomanPaint the living roomPick and pickle beetrootRedesign the kitchen Nothing too complicated that I can see, but time-consuming while fitting it around home-based income generation, general housekeeping, fire-stoking and keeping up with all the reading I need to do just to keep on top of the Frugaldom forums and challenges. I'm going to see how many of these items can be ticked off this list by tonight; I have already deleted the ones that are already done. Does anyone else make regular lists? They're almost as addictive as number-crunching or my spreadsheet in this household. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Bytes - Garlic and Baby Beetroot", "date": "Sunday 19 January 2014", "text": "In the Frugaldom Winter GardenWith all the rain and wind we've had over the past couple of months, I'm amazed that anything is surviving in the garden but, as nature would have it, there's always something to see.   Last year's beetroot seed sowings are still surviving, so I'm going to thin these out and pickle the baby beets. I love beetroot, so I'm hoping that I might just about be able to stretch this lot throughout the year, if they don't mind being pickled in malt vinegar. I have two large tubs' worth of them.   My first lot of garlic cloves were planted a few weeks ago and these have been growing quite quickly, I hope not too quickly! They are from whole garlic meant for cooking - no need to buy specific cultivating varieties when you have your own in the kitchen.    I split mine up - half were planted outdoors into the small raised bed and the other half popped into a sealed polythene bag and kept in the fridge. (Garlic likes the cold to start it off, for some reason.) The above are the ones from the fridge, now about ready to be planted out into containers on the patio. If you cook with garlic, growing your own is great fun and very frugal (assuming you have a garden, trough or bucket in which to grow your own. One single garlic bulb can split into about 8 cloves and each of these cloves can produce a new bulb. I'll update again after I've thinned out the beetroot. Looking forward to having a few leafy greens at mealtimes - don't forget the leaves are edible! I'm sure Septimus and Octavius, the new Frugaldom bunnies, will enjoy their share of this crop, too. Meanwhile, the wormery has been topped up with some peelings, brown cardboard and egg shells so the hundreds of baby worms have sufficient food to turn into lovely worm-juice as liquid fertiliser for this year's crops. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Bytes - Baked Pudding from Leftovers", "date": "Saturday 18 January 2014", "text": "Post-Christmas Cooking Continues...Thieves' Pudding\"What is it?\" I hear you ask! Under normal circumstances, I would call it Eve's Pudding or apple sponge, but we're still cooking in the post-Christmas era, so it's a little bit more than just Eve involved in this one! I think I'll call it Thieves' Pudding, as it's kind of a mixture between Stollen and apple sponge.  What did I have to use up to concoct this sweet delight? Here goes for the recipe: A tub of stewed apples, the last gleaned from the garden trees, even although the fruit looked past its best. It got cored, peeled, chopped, stewed and frozen anyway! The final couple of spoons scraped from the big jar of Christmas cranberry sauce (with whole cranberries). A small jar of mincemeat with some chopped nuts A packet sponge mix 3 bantam eggs that Fonzie, Bernice and Mrs Splashy managed to lay over the past week. All the fruit based 'stuff' got mixed together and put in the bottom of my lasagne dish and then covered in sponge mix. It took quite a long time to bake in the mini oven but it eventually cooked to produce enough pudding to last all week. It tastes delicious! I may not be in any way, shape or form a chef, nor am I any form of domestic goddess, but adventurous in the kitchen, I most certainly am! :)  Never be afraid to mix and match, especially when it comes to puddings! If in doubt, it all tastes great under frugal custard! NYK, Frugaldom"},

It's 'reduce, reuse, recycle' gone crazy...  Since reaching the age of independence some 30 years ago, I have had 15 home addresses. That equates to a house move every two years, on average, and that's what results in carting boxes of unopened junk and paperwork all around the country.  2014 is my frugal foray into de-cluttering in the hope that I have now found a long-term home. I'd love to say 'permanent home', but such things just aren't worth pondering, in my opinion.  So, what did I find that caused such great excitement while rummaging yesterday? Y2K Annual ReportAn annual report from 2000, which includes a list of items I thought I had lost forever.

{"title": "Experimenting with Candle Heat", "date": "Monday 13 January 2014", "text": "My Frugal Adventure Into Candle PowerSo many people have posted (or shared or commented or reposted) about the ability to heat a room for 8p per day using a simple candle heater that it was beginning to annoy me - mainly because the information is so outdated and so few people were reading the full story concerning the tiny dimensions of the original room in the article. I remember trying this heating method many years ago, possibly while attending Girl Guides, so it isn't anything new. Inflation has to count for something and I expect current candle prices and room sizes will negate any possible financial benefits, but I do have a good stock of candles and will happily number-crunch my way to the 2014 prices. My Candle ExperimentsOur bathroom is, I believe, a conversion from an old stable and, as such, has 3 external walls. We haven't fully refurbished it yet, other than having to fix the immediate problems when we first bought the house - roof, window, floor, water pipes and some plasterboard on one wall. There is sheep wool insulation in the roof and the one re-lined wall, but the place gets very cold without heating. I lit an 8-hour taper candle and left it burning overnight with no other heat source. We had a touch of frost overnight, temperatures dropped to around freezing, but the candle was still burning and the bathroom was 3 Degrees C the following morning.A bit of online research showed me the cheapest 8-hour candles I could buy would cost about 10p each, if bought in bulk. (I can't use tea lights through the night because I do like to sleep then, not stay awake to relight candles every couple of hours!)Subsequent searching showed me that these taper candles can produce about 80-100w, whereas a small tea-light is, at most 30w, presumably because of much shorter burning times. I'm not too hot with watts, so I won't go into this part any further and I can't guarantee the facts, only say that's what I read when researching.To calculate how much energy you need to heat a room 'comfortably' (whatever that means), you measure the length x width x height in metres and then multiply it by 0.07 My bathroom requires 637w to heat it. Based on all of the above, 1 + 2 + 3 = 8 taper candles per 8 hours x 3 = 24 candles per day to heat the smallest room in the Frugaldom household. £2.40 per day - not 8p per day, as per the grossly over-shared, long out of date, candle heater articles. I am currently paying approximately 17p per kWh for electricity (after factoring in the standing charge), so heating the bathroom with an electric heater would cost about £2.60 per day  Interesting stuff, but a few words of caution - sufficient ventilation needs to be maintained to ensure there's no risk of poisoning from any potentially hazardous fumes. And if you're trying this in the house do NOT try it anywhere you are likely to spray flammables such as hairspray! Having raked out all my old candles, there was one major flaw in this experiment - lack of candle sticks! Many years ago, households possessed candelabras for holding the multiple candles but none have come my way recently. I'd to use an empty wine bottle and a big jar - it did not work! Yes, the bathroom felt warmer while the candles were lit - it had to, there were 8 naked flames dancing in my shower cubicle! As soon as they got to jar height, one by one they melted until all were extinguished. This morning, I had a cold bathroom and a jar of candle wax sitting inside my shower. The room thermometer was ready 4 Degrees C.  Undeterred, I did the experiment again using tea lights placed inside an old stock pot, for added safety. The bathroom temperature was 4C when I lit them. They are the cheap, bulk-bought ones, so I'd need many more of them to generate the near 700w necessary to heat the room. I burned 8. Even at 2p each or 16p per hour, that's still cheaper than electricity, right?  Did this raise the room temperature to a comfortable level?  No!  By the time all 8 candles had burned out, the thermometer was reading just 6 Degrees C and I could still see my breath. Meanwhile, I wanted to devise some sort of contraption for concentrating the heat to try and radiate more of it outwards, rather than upwards... cue the 3-tier, stove top steamer! I am currently burning only 2 tea light candles inside this and it is already too hot to touch. It's sitting on the stovetop, reminding me of the Christmas tin can lanterns we were making not so long ago, albeit on a much grander scale. And this, frugal readers, brings my right back to the beginning of the experiment -  Can you heat a room for 8p a day?  In a nutshell - NO! Candle power may be sufficient to prevent a tiny space from freezing if you have no other source of heating, but it is neither economically viable nor safe to heat a room with candles for any prolonged period of time. In a well-insulated and draught-proofed house, the condensation, soot and fumes generated just cannot be healthy, so perhaps buy a pet canary and keep it in the same room as the candles if you must use them, just to be on the safe side. Again, not very frugal - perhaps best just buy a carbon monoxide sensor and an extra smoke alarm. What have I learned? A simple candle heater, such as my converted steamer, makes a great experiment for both small space warming and attempting to heat a meal during an emergency power cut. It would most certainly prevent a tiny room from freezing, perhaps even a little greenhouse, but I couldn't recommend it for any modern-day, well-insulated household and it most certainly wouldn't be cost-effective to heat an entire room - there are just too many cheaper alternatives to stockpiling a candle mountain. As an example of the above, I'll use my own sitting room.  The calculations of L x W x H x 0.07 would suggest I need 2565w to heat this room 'comfortably', which equates to 32 quality 8-hour candles - that's £3.20 per 8 hours, or £9.60 for a full day. (Cheap tea lights may burn for only 1-2 hours, so that's over 100 per day needed for my sitting room alone, plus someone there to keep relighting them while ensuring the house doesn't catch fire.) Need I continue? I think I will...  £9.60 x 7 days = £67.20 for a week and this is just to 'comfortably' heat one room in the house. It really doesn't take a number-crunching, moneysaving, frugal living genius to see the flaw in this plan, does it? Candle heating is not about frugal living or money-saving. Apart from anything else, can you imagine the colour of your ceilings from all that sooty residue? I know my figures are not scientifically accurate, but they do reflect real costs associated with modern lifestyles. We need to march boldly on, shoulder to shoulder with progress, and just do our best to be prepared for any hiccups along the way. Now I'm off to light my 6kw multi-fuel stove for a bit of instant heat and a hot cuppa. It costs about £10 per week to run, call it £15 to cover a shovel of slow-burning coal to keep it alight overnight. although it hasn't got cold enough to do that, yet.. I can boil the kettle and cook dinner on it and there's sufficient heat radiated to send some out into the hall and up the stairs to the bedrooms. :)  I'll keep my candles for genuine emergencies, if you don't mind. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Bytes - Using Up Leftovers", "date": "Saturday 11 January 2014", "text": "More Meals from Christmas Leftovers In our pursuit of the perfect frugal lifestyle, we aspire to becoming culinary wizards, capable of cooking up a magical meal from whatever we have available in an effort to keep the food budget under control. As well as this, it encourages us to get creative and even experiment by playing games such as guerrilla cuisine! (Sneaking in extras that wouldn't normally be added, as a way of using them up or getting extra nutrition into the diet.)Yesterday we had ham, potatoes and sprouts because the ham was cooked and needed to be used before today and the sprouts were leftovers.Earlier this week I made a lasagne and employed some guerrilla tactics by grating the last of the Christmas-gifted Stilton through it.Tonight was no different - Christmas leftovers! We seem to have more 'leftovers' meals here than any other type. What's been simmering on the stove top tonight? A carton of defrosted cooked turkey, leftover from Christmas1 tablespoon of thick-cut orange marmalade to empty the jar2 tablespoons of mincemeat, leftover from Christmas mince pie-making3 tablespoons of reduced price sweet chilli sauce.Some frozen mixed vegPeas and sweetcorn Stir fried and then served with egg noodles but equally nice with rice - very filling, very tasty and very frugal, as it means I was able to use up the last of the homemade mincemeat I'd been given and I now have another 2 empty jars for recycling into eco-art glass lanterns. I think I still have another few slices of turkey remaining in the freezer, but that will be fine for a while yet. There's have half a jar of redcurrant jelly in the fridge, so I'll need to concoct something with this - probably something like a fruit pudding that can be served with custard.NYK, FrugaldomReader Questions about Money Saving and Frugal LivingHi NYK, Pennies make poundsThis seems a bit rude to ask, but as the saying goes, if you don't ask, you don't know! So apologies up front. How did you manage to save your emergency savings?Do you keep your 'emergency savings' separate from other savings?Would you recommend a certain amount for emergencies?Any advice on this would be gratefully appreciated!﻿NYK AnswersI love questions and am forever researching 'stuff', so thank you for asking and rest assured that I don't find it rude in the least, it is a huge pleasure to be able to answer. Apologies if I waffle on a bit, I'm rather passionate about frugal living. :)Many years ago, while in debt, I got together a bunch of friends in similar situations and we compared our budgets. At that time, we all had very different household incomes, ranging from under £10,000 to over £30,000! The amazing fact that I learned from what became a regular get-together was that we practically all had the same amount of disposable income after paying everything we owed - mortgages, rent, council tax and all other debts!  It was amazing! The magic number worked out at £4,000, so that's the origin of my target budget. Now, in 2014, the figure is simply the amount I know I can comfortably live off and be happy to do so. It's also the minimum amount that I know I need to earn in order to live debt free! If push came to shove, I have sufficient flexibility within that budget to make alterations and also afford the Council Tax.After living on the £4,000 budget for many years, the debts slowly and painstakingly reduced until, in 2007, I finally became completely debt free. At that point, I had two options for remaining debt-free: Live within my increased means or Continue as though I still had the debts, but pay the equivalent amount into savings. (At that point, I had no savings.)2008 arrived and I had decided to stick to my previous budget and frugal lifestyle while starting to seriously save. (That's when I took the 'Living on £4,000' challenge onto the Moneysavingexpert forums.) With no debts, every penny over £4,000 got banked and all other spends had to be paid from extra income or else things made to pay for themselves.Fast forward to 2011, we scraped up enough to buy this cheap fixy-up for cash, but it completely wiped out every penny of the savings - my son even chipped in all his coin savings! Plus point - we had no savings left but nor had we any rent to pay, just council tax and insurance for our own house. Sticking with the £4,000 household budget, we are now slowly renovating the place while also saving for emergencies. I know I need £4,000 to run my household for a year, I know I realistically need another £1,000 to cover Council Tax and I know that incidentals may be needed along the way, so my goal is to have at least £5,500 in emergency savings and increase that by at least the rate of inflation each year, seeing as bank interest no longer affords us that luxury! THis, again, is what has prompted the latest edition of the Interest Beater' challenge in the forums.Emergency savings are totally separate from 'normal' savings, so no mistakes can be made and I can't be tempted to spend from this pot. Initially, I needed to invoke all my will power to ensure every penny was saved. In saying that, I am using an instant access ISA, 'just in case'.I hope this helps explain the way I view my finances, both in the frugal forums and here on the blog. Feel free to continue asking questions and I do hope you will join me in the latest frugaldom challenge, as we hatch another great Billy Can plan and prepare to do some money magic.NYK, Frugaldom"},

I hope you enjoy them.My budget spreadsheet looks like this:  The Frugaldom budget spreadsheetMy January spending already looks high at £475.60, however, the freezer has been filled, the electricity meter topped right up and I paid 12-months telephone line rental up front, which will save me about £45 overall. I cancelled the 'free' 1571 service some time ago, as we seldom made sufficient calls to qualify. There's a £10 allowance for 'mobile' just in case I go gallivanting further afield, otherwise no need for it as there's no signal here.

The kindling has been well topped up thanks to another big bag of scrap wood from local yard by way of a bartering agreement we've struck between us.23rd March 2013 - last winter's snowWinter preparations are on-going in case the snow gets here. Last year we were completely snowed in and, at one stage, without power for about 4 days. Luckily we had the stove, fuel, plenty of food in stock and sufficient feed for the livestock - I am grateful for the fact that we were able to cook and share what we had with neighbours who didn't expect such a bad winter. This is our local construction company, 3B, digging out the main road down to the village last winter - a reminder of what Mother Nature can throw at us, whenever she so desires.﻿﻿﻿﻿Over a year, my household spending averages almost £11 per day, £76.71 per week or £333.33 per month and has done so for the past 7 years. Despite inflation, I seem to be improving my lifestyle with every year that passes. Strange, but true!﻿FREEZING TIPIf you have a power cut during a freezing winter and have no access to a generator - pack your freezer with bags of snow and ice! There is no point in risking losing good food for the sake of a few days without power. Throughout the year, I have zero available space in my freezer - all gaps get filled with tubs or tins of water. If you have just a fridge and it's colder outside than in your fridge, use a sealed box sunk into the snow or sat in a shaded corner. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "How to Reduce The Household Shopping Budget", "date": "Wednesday 8 January 2014", "text": "Budgets, Food and Grocery ShoppingDuring a financial crisis, one of the few things that we can take immediate control of is our own grocery spending. I've pretty much always been vigilant with this but have, in the past, slipped into the bad habit of having a weekly takeaway. That, of course, was when I lived in a street that was home to a Chinese takeaway, an Asian Tandoori and a local chip shop. Living on such a street could easily have led me on the rocky road to ruin, especially as there was, at that time, a village pub that served meals. During summer, we'd think nothing of popping in for a pub lunch or opting for a basket supper on a Friday night. We were certainly well catered for in the food department, even although they saw the need to take away our bank, post office and community hall.  Nowadays, things have got much worse for some! There is a plethora of supermarkets and even faster, fast food takeaways that allow people to drive through, buy food and never need to get out of their cars! The results are stunning! Here we are in 2014 and we have otherwise 'normal' families collecting food from food banks... How can this be possible when food is in such plentiful supply to the extent that it's being binned on a daily basis?  I do realise that those of you reading this blog have probably already made some changes to your lifestyles with regards to debt-busting, moneysaving or living within your own means, but there are millions more who haven't - they simply do not know where to turn, nor do they have any idea how to find help in understanding or even recognising their own budgets.  In the simplest terms, a budget is made up of the money you know for sure you have coming in to pay for everything you need to pay. If you are paying out more than you have coming in then you need to stop right now and acknowledge there's a problem, then adjust the way you spend.From experience, I have found it is much easier to cut down on unnecessary spending than it is to earn extra money in a hurry. If you don't know how to fight your corner in the money wars, there might never be enough to pay all the villains deceiving you into thinking you need whatever they are selling! Frugaldom is about making things affordable, it is not about being deprived.  If you are struggling to make ends meet, fighting off debt or can't see your way through current financial difficulties, don't despair! It's alright to be overwhelmed by situations now and again and it's even OK to think life sucks! What isn't alright is to blame it on money, or lack of it, when all around there are ways and means of capitalising on a few basic skills, starting with mealtimes. Let's play a game of 'Chicken'.Buy one standard whole chicken - I checked a few places and know that £5 can buy a decent sized chicken here in UK.Unwrap the chicken and let it sit for half an hour before cooking it. (Never sit uncooked meats above or beside cooked meats and don't splash water everywhere if you insist on washing your chicken first - I never bother washing mine.)Cook the chicken - the general cooking rule used to be 20 minutes per pound weight and then another 20 minutes over, which roughly calculates to an hour and a half for a chicken weighing 1.5kg, but mine slow cooks on top of the pot-belly stove if it's lit.Carefully pour off any juices for gravy making.Remove the chicken skin carefully and set this aside in a stock pot.Strip off every gram of cooked meat from the bones.Keep the white meat separate and set aside all the other meat you strip from legs, wings and the underside - there can be enough hiding under there to make a pie!Place whatever is left of your chicken carcase into the stock pot or large pan along with the skin and any other bits removed from the bird (giblets, if these were included).Cover with boiling water then allow it to simmer vigorously for an hour or so, but much longer if you are using a slow cooker. This will produce stock for your soup, while any juices from the freshly cooked bird can be used to make gravy. You cannot over cook stock unless you boil the pan dry!Strain the stock off into a separate pan, jug or bowl and allow it to cool.Next...Use excess pastry for decorationUse the white meat for roast dinner - one decent sized breast should be sufficient for 2 portions when served with all the trimmings, so there should be enough white meat for 4 tasty meals.Use the leg meat to make a curry, stir fry, sweet and sour or even add it to mixed vegetables with gravy and serve it as stew with something like suet dumplings.Use the remaining meat to make pie filling with any leftover veggies or gravy and then freeze it if you don't need to use it right away - it freezes just fine and should be sufficient to serve 4.The above should equate to 12 meals if you are serving with plenty of vegetables etc.IF YOU HAVE MEAT-EATING PETS - I have a cat, a friend has ferrets.Leave the chicken carcase in the first pan and add some more boiling water.Skim off the fat and any excess gelatine from your jug of cooled stock and add this to the stock pan.Boil until the bones are soft enough that they crumble when rubbed between your fingersStrain off the excess water - again, this is stock that can be used for cookingAllow to cool and then blitz the entire contents of this pot with a blender - I use a stick blender.You now have close to 100% chicken paste suitable for making your own pet food. A typical can of top brand cat food can contain less than 5% chicken so bulking this out isn't so difficult when feeding to your pets along with whatever else they like. I have mixed it with boiled eggs, rice, potatoes, pasta, porridge and any combination of safe leftovers for the frugal puss and she loves it! (Onions, garlic, mushrooms and tomatoes are not safe for adding to cat food.) It's like gourmet paté for pets. (I don't add salt when cooking it, just a sprinkle of herbs.)Left - chicken paste for the cat. Tight - chicken stock for soupNext, make your chicken soup. Skim off any surface fat - this can be used for stir frying and I have also used it in place of oil when baking savoury sandwich bread.Soup-making is a simple case of simmering the stock with some rice, any diced vegetables you have that need using up and a sprinkling of herbs or spices. Add extra water as required and season to taste - any seasoning from salt and pepper to spices can be used. You should get enough soup for up to 12 servings, again dependent on portion sizes. See the homemade soup section for some more ideas.This is the basis of our 'Chicken' game and it shouldn't cost any more than £10 to get you started. Half of this should buy you a chicken and the other half should be sufficient for vegetables, rice, suet, flour and seasonings to put all the meals together and provide you with enough to feed a family of four a decent meal every day for the best part of a week if you count soup as a meal. The game really comes into play when you start getting inventive with your ingredients and making sure that absolutely none of the food you buy goes into the bin - not one bit of it.If you don't have pets, pop your gourmet pet food into a jar and give it to someone who can and will use it within a day or two; add a homemade label, I'll bet they'll appreciate it! Or else use a freezer-safe container and keep it until it's needed for feeding wildlife - our garden hedgehogs loved the stuff! Please help spread the word that living on a tight budget needn't be awful. If you know of anyone struggling to the extent that they cannot afford food, send them to their nearest free Internet access point, which could be the library or even just a local Wi-Fi hotspot on a friend's laptop and point them in the direction of the Frugaldom forums at www.frugalforums.co.uk Better still, invite them into your life and share what you can with them while helping them along the path to frugaldom. Don't be fooled! Join us in Frugaldom and play the game of living a big life on a small budget. Frugal living has, for far too long, been passed off as a lifestyle for the poor, but the truth of the matter is, frugal living is the lifestyle that is supporting society in a very simple and honest way. Yes, it is simple living - it's simple in as far as 1 + 1 = 2, but it takes a wise person to make £2 do the work of £5 and be happy with their lot.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "That's Life! Be Grateful for it!", "date": "Monday 6 January 2014", "text": "Life!Late start after a very blustery, chilly and damp night - it was warm in bed, I didn't want to get out into the cold! Nature calls and we must obey!The cat has been fed, I've had my mug of tea, lit the main fire, read the electricity meter, eaten my porridge and can still see my breath while sitting here at the computer, looking at the thermometer on the wall reading 8 Deg C. I could switch on an electric heater but we are doing our best to learn to live without these - persistent power cuts render them useless, anyway. The stove has now been lit and will have this room warm by the time the other fire has heated the water in the back boiler to pump it round the radiators. 'H' has been out to attend to the feathered friends, chopped more sticks and had his first soaking of the day. This is a typical morning in Frugaldom. We should learn to appreciate typical days much more than we do!We're still waiting for the full blast of the next storm to arrive - perhaps it has changed direction overnight? No, that would be too much to expect when this is January in Scotland. Besides, it is absolutely battering down with rain and hail now, so chances are the power will be out by lunchtime. The kettle is back on the stove. We are offered a little shelter on this southwest coast by way of Ireland, so best wishes to all over there when the surge arrives.Meter ReadingThe chart above is of my weekly electricity meter readings for this house. You can see both spikes from the past two winters and this is what I want to avoid completely in 2014 - but it isn't a catastrophe if we fail!Monday has traditionally become meter reading day in frugal households up and down the country and this one is no different. I began the exercise in 2003 to try and control how much was being fed into the prepayment meter in the rented cottage while also buying logs and coal. I am grateful for the fact that I have the knowledge and good sense to prioritise my spending in a way that allows me to pretty much live my own life the way I want to and still afford to save for whatever else life throws at us! 21 Deg C throughout the house isn't necessary here, we can live happily without that!With a prepayment meter, costs are unfairly inflated by the power companies assuming that only people in debt, without bank accounts or who cannot be trusted to pay their bills possess such things. To be fair, they are a great way of inadvertently running up a huge bill during winter, as you can over pay during summer and not need to top up extra through the freezing months, but this doesn't excuse the fact that the rate per kilowatt hour is set at a premium. In my opinion, anyone being paid in advance for anything should be rewarded with a discount at least equating to the bank interest rates! (Link to Scottish Power rates) Energy price increases were due to take effect on 6th December but we had topped up the meter to the maximum £249 by then. I haven't a clue what to do about this, as I won't be topping the meter up again until summer - will we be beating the price hikes? The kilowatt hour rate increased but the daily standing charge decreased on 6th December 2013. Overall figures suggest we are saving slightly but is my meter also clocking up a debt along the way? For some obscure reason, Scottish Power representatives have been unable to confirm or deny this for me. I guess I should just be grateful that we have the sheer luxury of electricity at the touch of a button, regardless of tiny percentage differences in metered prices.Today, I read of yet another possible price change, this time a slight reduction! To be 100% honest, I haven't go the faintest idea how much a single unit of electricity should be costing me, all I know is that my meter is currently charging 12.96p per kWh plus a weekly charge of £2.11 despite the standing charge having fallen to £1.92 and the unit price having risen to 14.42p per kWh on 6th December - time will tell what happens. Does it really matter if we're prepared and can afford to pay it?Since buying into this house in April 2011 we have done everything in our power, pardon the pun, to reduce electricity costs. I simply hate paying over the odds while seeing wind turbines appear all around the country that bear no effect on the cost of heating our old terraced cottage on this tiny street on a tiny budget without gas or oil. Here we have coal and logs. Coal is now £14 per bag for the cheapest available in our area. We should be grateful, as many a life has been lost in the quest to harvest coal from mines!But we still need to think ahead and do what we can for future generations. I'm already a gran to a 9-year-old and a 3-year-old and I'm not even 50 yet! I could be a great, great grand parent if I'm fortunate enough to live that long. I want to be part of the population who did what they could to prolong the existence of our planet in a sustainable and meaningful way.Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) is something I would prefer not to do if it could be at all helped - but for now it can't! One questionably better option that's deemed 'carbon neutral' is log burning but, at the same time, keeping a plentiful supply of dry, well-seasoned timber in sufficient quantities to sustain a household all year round simply isn't feasible unless you want to make a career out of log splitting - which pays you zero income and the trees still need to be bought with cash, felled, hauled, sawn, split, stacked and stored a year in advance. We haven't even got around to building a big enough log store yet, far less fill it with an entire winter's worth of wood! Let's hope we can remedy this problem during 2014 and, meanwhile, be grateful for what we already have.Fingers crossed for no power cut, as I've just switched on the breadmaker. As soon as the water is heated by the fire, I'll get a washing on - I swapped the cold feed hose onto the hot water pipe to reduce the energy needed by the washing machine to heat the water (thank you for the tip @Solarbud) - and then the clothes will need to dry indoors on airers by the radiators.The bulk of the 'Nile' mince (so called because it stretches so far) cooked on the stove for last night's dinner (served with veggies and suet dumplings) is in the fridge waiting to be turned into a huge lasagne, so that's what I need to make this afternoon. This will be done in between putting together a web page for a client, catching up with the frugaldom forums, knitting a bit more of grand daughter's blanket that I still haven't finished, chatting, keeping the stove and the fire going and, all the whiles, thinking of the horror being endured by a family well known to all us 'horsey folks' from Lanarkshire at the sudden and devastating loss of a 4-year-old child. I cannot begin to imagine the horror for any mother witnessing such a tragic event. Thoughts are with all concerned at this extremely sad time.NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Welcome to Frugal Living and my Annual Money Challenges", "date": "Sunday 5 January 2014", "text": "For the Benefit of Newcomers to my Concept of FrugaldomFrugal living may not be for everyone and it does take quite a bit of explaining to some who can neither see the need, nor have ever experienced the need for trying it. But it is a lifestyle choice that's made by many, nonetheless.Having already posted about my annual household budget - the £4,000 - I would now like to go over the cost implications of everything else that needs paying. Like I already said, frugal living gave us the ability to save for and buy a very cheap fixy-up over the space of a very short period of time but I did throw in my lot with A. N. Other to buy a 3-bedroom house with a big garden rather than a small flat with no garden. But no matter which way you look at it, £4,000 just won't last a year if you need to count in rent or mortgage and any outside the household expenses, which is why none of these things are included in my £4,000.00 However, this does include the costs of working from home, some of which are tax deductible at the end of each financial year. For everything else, I have a separate kitty, known as...My Everything Else Kitty - E.E.K.My Everything Else KittyThere's no escaping the fact that life costs cash and we need to be really flexible in order to fit everything into the box that is our lifestyle. As you can see by the antics of the frugal puss, even she is a contortionist when it comes to making sure she gets in on the action - if, at first, you don't think you can fit something into your affordability box,  keep trying from different angles until you've found a way succeeding.Everything else outside of the standard necessities are, for me, paid from my 'EEK'. This is the cash kitty that gets topped up by a tiny drip of interest from savings, gift certificates, points, cash back, winnings, sales of surplus eggs, de-cluttered goods and any cash gifts that happen to come my way at birthdays or Christmas time. Let's face it, keeping hens, ducks, quail, a cat and, now, two giant loppy-lug rabbits isn't through real necessity, its more for the fun than the frugality.It's great having fresh eggs for cooking and baking but we can't possibly eat them all, so I trade many of them for other things and need to raise any extra cash to cover the costs of feeding the feathered and furry friends, keeping them all bedded down at night and keeping them healthy. I also have my wormery, the pet worms that help recycle household waste into liquid fertiliser that cucumbers seem to thrive on, judging by the enormous crop we had last year.But how does my 'EEK' work in real terms?Last year ended with an overall balance of £39.70, so that has been carried over and popped into the 'EEK' savings. On top of that, I have a voucher balance of £30.54 in my Amazon account and have just requested payment of another £8 worth of Amazon vouchers via Topcashback*, which gives me cash back on anything I buy using links from their website. There's also £7 of credit lying in my Approved Food* account, which will more than cover the postage of my next order when I need heavy, long shelf-life goods - they normally do regular offers on bread flour, which is how I can bake a loaf for around 25p. Cashback Credit CardsThe use of credit cards may be seen by some as incurring debt but I have one golden rule - if I can't afford to pay something in full at the time then I don't put it on the credit card. Online shopping and being self-employed means that I have some added protection by using a credit, as opposed to a debit, card, so absolutely everything goes onto it that possibly can - even my 12 months' BT line rental. Why? Because as long as I pay in full within the interest free timeframe, I get an automatic 1% cash back that costs me nothing and gets paid in a lump sum around the end of each financial year.Spending £4,000 on the household budget almost exclusively paying by card means brings almost £40 of free cash into the 'EEK' by April of each year, plus whatever else I have paid for by this method. While renovating, almost all of the building materials have been paid this way and in addition to that the livestock feeding, garden-related purchases and any extras that can be added get paid this way. Last year's free money courtesy of the credit card company amounted to £68.94 and that's not to be sneezed at when you see cheap flights, train fairs, ferry fairs or short breaks advertised for less!All these little bits and pieces add up over the year and, with luck and careful spending, can cover everything else I need to buy. Sales of surplus eggs would normally cover the cost of feed and bedding or else what I exchange for the eggs helps reduce the grocery budget. It is a simple case of not buying anything unless we can realistically afford it and if we can't afford it (or don't see the need to buy it) we can attempt to make it.Being self employed means keeping up with National Insurance payments, so I have just paid out £70.20, which covers 6 months. This is not part of my household running costs, so does not impact on the £4,000. It is a miniscule sum but it is contributing to my old age pension, so I have no qualms about paying it, even on a voluntary basis when profits aren't sufficient to warrant any further deductions. My monthly savings bond is paid from what I no longer spend on cigarettes and anything else is absolutely mine to do with as I please, even if it's just a few pennies left in my (homemade) purse.Use it up, Don't Bin it, Burn it or Bury it.My attempt at zero waste failed dismally owing to the amount of plastic packaging that's used by many companies. Plain brown cardboard is great as it gets rolled up and used in the fire, but plastics are a total pain and need to be binned if it isn't of the type that I can reused - meat packaging, for example!  We have an open fire and a stove, so anything that is safe to burn gets recycled into fuel and used to heat the house, boil the kettle and even cook food. Recently, I was learning a bit more about recycling wood shavings into eco-fuel and I'm now wondering if it would work using the shavings from the rabbit cages and hen houses, but I'm not too sure how easy it would be to dry the blocks once they are made, or how smelly they might be to make while soaking them for a month at a time - time will tell!I have a Paper Brick Maker* and it's great for experimenting by adding in things like dried leaves, twigs and shredded paper but, again, the blocks take a long time to dry. I guess I should really try much harder at making a stock pile of these during summer sunshine to help combat rising costs of winter coal. I shall pledge now to make an attempt on the eco-fuel from shavings using this method.Photos by B.B. Photography﻿This was our local village main street when the storm surge hit at high tide on Friday (photos taken by a pal's brother), so let's hope things don't get any worse over the coming days. Now I need to wind this up and be prepared for the next storm that seems to be heading our way - we are almost at the top of the hill, so no sea surge reaches us, just the likelihood of power outages and the steam in the garden bursting its banks if the storm force winds drive in torrential rain at the same time as high tide. The West coast has been taking a real battering recently and the next potential hit isn't looking any less ferocious, so the flasks, candles, torches and hot water bottles are all at the ready plus a stack of wood piled by the stove and an open invitation extended to anyone who may be adversely affected to head up the hill to Frugaldom.Stay safe, folks, and never forget that no matter how little money you have, your chances of subduing Mother Nature when she is throwing a strop are the exact same as any millionaire - appreciate what you have while you have it and make the most of the important things in life that money cannot buy.NYK, FrugaldomPS: We're playing at 'planks'Several of us take part in whatever free fitness fun we can find, so visit us in the Frugal Forums if you would like to take part. Right now, we're doing the '30 Day Plank Challenge' to prove to ourselves that we do have core muscles and to start toning them up in time for spring.*I can earn a few extra points or pounds when friends join and use sites via my referral links"},
{"title": "2014 Annual Frugal Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday 4 January 2014", "text": "Happy 15th Anniversary to our Published Frugal Challenges.Christmas Day walk It was March 1999 when the first edition of 'Now You Know' came off the press as a monthly newspaper, as opposed to just being online or as part of a page in someone else's publication, so I'm planning on making 2014 extra special in as many ways as I possibly can, to celebrate out 15th anniversary without it costing extra money or incurring any debts. In 1998, one of my first personal money challenges was featured in the Scottish Daily Record and then, not long after that, the FT.com inadvertently sent investors streaming our way when Cyberdosh (another of my online money 'games') got a mention within the pages of their prestigious online publication. So much has happened over the years that I do tend to discount the true origins of Frugaldom and relate back just as far as 2007, when I first took NYK's frugal living challenges into the Moneysavingexpert forums. We're still there, for anyone who prefers the vast anonymity of that version, otherwise join us in the www.frugalforums.co.uk  What's in Store for 2014? My annual frugal living budget has, once again, been set at £4,000 for the year to cover all the essentials like food, toiletries, cleaning products, electricity, coal, logs, TV, telephone, Internet, travel, clothing and footwear, gifts and donations, household pet supplies, home insurance and any other routine expenses that can be controlled by strict budgeting.  After so many years of doing such challenges, we are fortunate to now be living in our own bought-and-paid-for fixy-up, the result of yet another challenge to buy a house without a mortgage. This puts us in the lucky position of not having to worry about rent or mortgage repayments.  Council Tax is something that can no longer be shaved, since the councils saw fit to abolish the annual 'pay it all up front' discounts. No savings to be made there, so they get their £100 (or whatever) each month, instead. Being rural, we do save a little bit by way of not having to pay the sewage charges - we have septic tank - and there are no separate water rates here in Scotland. Over the years, we have learned continually what we can and cannot live without - distinguishing between absolute needs and basic wants has been paramount to the success of our moneysaving, cost-cutting campaigns for a simple lifestyle. Many of the items in my budget are non-essentials and I could live without them if I had to, but being self-employed while working from home does bring with it the need for communication with the outside world and that necessitates a telephone line, Internet and yes, even television, as part of the household income is derived from broadcast media related work. What's nearby? Deer!Many people who skim read my posts fail to grasp the concept of rural living combined with frugal living. Frugal living in a rural location is totally different from living a frugal life elsewhere - we have added expenses, we can't rely on power supplies, we have no public transport, no amenities within easy reach, very little by way of regular employment opportunities, no diverse range of shops, no supermarkets and I choose to live without the added expense of a car, so no popping out for a pint of milk if we run out or a hot food takeaway, if the notion takes us.  We don't get yellow sticker bargains for pennies, we can't pop into the pub, library, museum or local hall for a free heat and we certainly can't traipse around the high street looking for bargains. We need to make do and mend plus make the absolute most of any opportunity that takes us away from home. I would love to 'shop local' for everything, but it is impossible while frugal living without transport in a rural location. We need to turn to our gardens, friends, neighbours and yes, even the Internet. I hope to keep the blog updated regularly to reflect how each and every pound of my £4,000 gets spent over the coming year and to share with you some of the other things that are made possible by this simple lifestyle, one that relies heavily on living within my means. Here's what I have done, so far, that will impact on my 2014 spending and the household budget:Got a meat order for the freezer, making the most of some discount codes and free delivery from MuscleFood* (This link is a friend referral link that offers new customers free chicken fillets with their first order.)Topped up the electricity pre-payment meter by as much as possible to reduce the number of to-ups needed over the coming year. The meter was in the house when we came here and I hope to have it removed as soon as I have reduced the 2014 spends against previous years by at least the cost of removing it.Bought a couple of bags of coalPaid for a full year's BT line rental, which cost £141, rather than pay £15.99 per month - an overall saving of £50.88Got two new bunnies - completely NOT frugal but who can refuse such a fabulous present when it also includes housing, food and bedding for the cuddle-bunnies?Umm... this is a very tricky one, so I will attempt to explain it first. My previous 'expensive habit' was smoking - I published my challenge about quitting and practised exactly what I preached, making a point of saving every penny I'd normally have spent on cigarettes. At today's shocking prices, this now equates to over £700 over a year. That's a huge amount of money for a frugaler so I opted to split it among the following: a tax free savings bond with life assurance, fun money and the garden. My previous 'expensive hobby' was horses. I have not been able to save the equivalent of what I used to spend on them because it is impossible for me now. This year, to celebrate, commiserate or commemorate the above, I bought a small share in a racehorse. If any of you out there have ever been bitten by the horse bug, you'll know it is not something you can simply shake off and forget - it's in your blood for life. This is my indulgence for 2014.Looking forward to watching the progress of 'Winnie' this summer Tried to teach the frugaldom bunnies why they shouldn't try typing, but fail..lkshavsi\\l luHK.EN8xm z,///////Ncj....ed Hmemade decorations now all gone for another year, but hoping the horseshoe brings us more luck, rather than more horses﻿﻿So far, this year's meals have all been from food in stock and, while the log-burner is lit, I am making the most of it by cooking whatever I can on top of it - right now, it has a pot of chicken stock simmering away after I defrosted a chicken, made a slow roast dinner over the stove and am now preparing a nice stir fry: leftovers will go in a casserole with the meat that comes off the bones in the stock pot and then I'll get a pot of soup from the rest of it. The actual carcase can be boiled down further, or possibly even slow-cooked overnight, and then blended to make into cat food.  I should probably add that we did not succeed in completing any of the rooms in the house, although most of the 'big stuff' has been done. We're without an actual cooker in the long-term temporary kitchen, but I do have all the mod cons essential to cooking without one - electric hot plate, mini grill, slow cooker, microwave, steamer, bread maker, toaster, kettles, coffee maker... we are quite civilised here, despite what some seem to think. :) We don't have central heating so, in winter, the house is only warm when the fire is lit. This, in turn, heats a few radiators and the tank of hot water - as long as we have electricity to power the pump that circulates the hot water. Electric blankets, huge woolly blankets and hot water bottles are great during winter. The persistence of power cuts is one of the main reasons I chose to have the stand alone stove, lovingly known as Wilbur, my pot bellied 'pig'. He is probably the hardest worked object in the Frugaldom household, unless we count 'H', who has to chop all the logs Wilbur consumes on a daily, even hourly, basis. Extra note here - 'Wilbur' was an eBay buy and cost about £100 including delivery. The more expensive part of this project was having the old chimney lined before being able to install the multi-fuel stove. 2014 will be my first full year of using this to save on electricity, so the bicycle will be back out of hibernation soon so I can get out there and start collecting more sticks and I am still faithfully filling in my www.imeasure.org.uk stats every Monday. What do we do for frugal fun? Well, so far...Went out walking on Christmas day.Had relative staying between Christmas and New Year, so we visited a local historical site that's within walking distance - weather was lovely.Had several neighbours round for drinks on Hogmanay thenWe all went out first footing one another until the 'wee small hours'.Visited the newest neighbours (en masse) to handsel their house on New Year's dayI really cannot see anything sub-standard in this lifestyle of what some perceive as self-inflicted poverty. Yes, it is certainly living well below the breadline and we probably would spend much more than 10% of our annual income if we'd to even attempt to heat our homes to what the Government states is an acceptable level but so what? We aren't cold, we aren't hungry, we aren't living off the state and we own the roof over our heads.  I promise to do my best to keep you all up to date with how I stretch our pennies into pounds throughout 2014, so feel free to join me on board my debt free wagon as I bump along and fight to stay on there. If you fall off, be sure there'll be a virtual friend ready with outstretched hand to help you back on again. As I always love to say - the less I spend, the more I can afford and, with this simple life costing so little, it leaves huge scope for finding better things to do with my time (and money) than waste it on money worries. |Frugaldom Plans for 2014:Keep on beating the budget by focussing on needs and saving for wants.Grow more fruit and vegetables.Complete the living room, kitchen and bathroom.Create a 'secret garden' complete with 'tiny house'.Watch the progress of 'Winnie' in the hope she makes it onto the racetrackEnjoy having the rabbits, hens, ducks, quail and wormery while seeing them all 'help' cultivate the garden.Meet up with friends for another frugal expedition - it's looking like Schiehallion will be the 'big hill of the year' but I'm sure we can fit in several other trips. It's not like walking costs money, is it?Take eldest grand daughter on another big adventure.Encourage more friends and relatives to visit Frugaldom.Knit, sew, craft, bake, make, mend, reduce, reuse and recycle more.I hope you'll all join me for yet another epic, roller coaster ride into Frugaldom. NYK, Frugaldom."},
{"title": "A Happy and Frugal New Year to One and All for 2014", "date": "Friday 3 January 2014", "text": "Welcome to 2014 and a Brand New Frugal Living Challenge!﻿HAPPY NEW YEAR!The annual summary:Thank you, once again, for the continuing support in my plight to beat the budget year upon year and I wish every one of you success with your own.As you'll possibly already know, 2014 marks 15 years since I first published a frugal living challenge. I had, however, had quite a bit of practice before that while getting out of all sorts of financial sticky wickets; having expensive hobbies never comes cheap, so we need to live with the consequences of unbalancing any budget.It is 28 years since I got married, learned to bake bread, first slow cooked and taught myself how to prepare a chicken in a way that stretched it far enough to feed the household for at least a week. It is also 11 years since I got divorced, but why even bother with the hindsight thing? Just keep on moving forward and correcting whatever mistakes you can in as simple a way as possible - no matter how long it takes! But that won't help the newcomers to Frugaldom, so here goes for another Frugaldom recap - please feel free to refresh my memory if you've been with me since the start and I've forgotten anything important.Back in the 80's I had hens, ducks, lambs and quail, along with cats, dogs, horses, ponies and even a donkey. We'd had the miners' strike, which wasn't easy for anyone attempting to start newly married life in or near a mining village. We also had what could loosely be termed the collapse of Fleet Street, bringing with it a revolution within the newspaper industry. (Looking back, this could possibly have influenced my decision to enter the world of publishing in the late 90's.)By the late 80's, interest rates had, once again, sky-rocketed while, at the same time, domestic rates were replaced with the Community Charge - the Poll Tax to you and me! This combination financially crippled many of us. Times were rather difficult - I think I can safely say that without fear of criticism.Onwards and upwards, we did manage to cling on for dear life, scrambling along the route of self-employment and living on the tiniest of budgets. Blah, blah, blah... they abolished the Poll Tax and introduced the Council Tax, but we eventually lost MIRAS (Mortgage Interest Relief At Source) and there were cracks appearing in the Endowment schemes... need I go any further? Perhaps I will, just to mark such a momentous occasion. We developed from home-based business to commercial premises. By the end of 1990, things weren't looking so bleak after all... barring the fact that our shop was located on the edge of western Europe's largest hot strip steel mill! The next major blow was dealt in 1992!As a word of caution here, and I can speak with the voice of experience, I suggest you never sign contracts of any description without first reading and, more importantly, understanding every word of the small print. 60 months may not sound very long-term but when you lose your income and have signed on the dotted line, you are legally bound to pay - creditors show no mercy.So here I am, 28 years further down the line and still counting pennies in the hope that my experience can help others find their way through their own financial storms. I am still self employed, pretty much still doing the same things I have always done but with a much deeper understanding of how to slash the overheads and beat my own budget. It took me until 2007 to reach debt-free status and, from all of that, I learned the most valuable lesson possible - the real differences between needs and wants.Welcome to 2014 and yet another year of budget-busting, frugal fun! In the eyes of some, this lifestyle is often seen as poverty-stricken - it isn't! We are living well below the breadline - yes!We can't possibly have any quality of life - yes we can!Contrary to the latter very peculiar belief, I have everything I could possibly need: friends, family, home, hobbies, the ability to make do and mend, a reduce, reuse and recycle attitude and, above all else, a huge reservoir of experience in frugality that allows me to live well within my means while affording me the luxury to freely share my knowledge with others, without the need to capitalise upon it. Finally, let's not forget the full recap of 2013 before proceeding into 2014 and answer the question on some lips - did I succeed with last year's challenge? YES! Here is exactly how last year's budget panned out in the end and it should be noted that this is for a household of 2 plus any guests, visitors or holidaying friends or relatives: Groceries, toiletries and cleaning products - £964.80Electricity - £807.18Coal - £219.40Logs - £180Other - £74.91Mobile - no need for oneTelephone/Internet - £377.27TV license - £145.50Footwear and Clothing - £144.56Gifts - £336.76Transport - £98.45 (I no longer have a car, but this includes train and ferry fairs)Postage and Deliveries - £81.05Home Insurance - £164.64Pets, miscellaneous, contingency - £365.78 TOTAL - £3,960.30 As you can see, this left me with £39.70 from my original £4,000, so it has gone into the savings pot for some added frugal fun in 2014! Some of the items listed above are non-essentials, like a home telephone, Internet, television, pets and gifts for others. My contingency funds were sufficient to incorporate several excursions:A fund-raising walk to the summit of Ben Nevis Visiting the Giant's Causeway - included hereWalking across the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge - included hereTaking my grand daughter on her first ever adventure with frugal granYou can see from the above that 2013 was far from dull. Throughout the year we had guests to stay, family visiting and entertained several friends. Several smaller challenges were included within the year, all paid for themselves if they weren't included in my personal budget.  Many thanks go to those companies that chose to sponsor some of our mini-challenges during the past year. Special thanks, also, to all the friends and relatives who continue to support (or even just tolerate) what many see as my eccentric lifestyle and, finally, a deeply heart-felt message to all the friends and family of our dearly departed friend known to most on here as JayJay - gone too soon but never to be forgotten as a core member of our little frugaldom group. Feel free to join us for the 2014 frugal living challenge, as we set off, once again, to live life on a budget. Once again, my personal challenge is to run the household on £4,000 for the entire year, thus allowing me to avoid any debts and still afford some fun along the way. I hope to be able to fully document progress both here and in the forums, but real life takes time to orchestrate in a meaningful way when balancing it with what's most important to you. We all need to prioritise and leave space to enjoy living our chosen lifestyles. NYK Media, Frugaldom﻿"},

{"title": "Bread Baking", "date": "Friday 13 December 2013", "text": "Playing With my New Toy -  a Half Price Breadmaker!Someone tagged me on Facebook recently to ask me about the Morphy Richards Fastbake bread-making machine, which was the first model I ever had. Mine was second-hand when I got it over 5 years ago, but it has served me well. Despite it now being in need of both a new pan and a new mixing blade, I kept it, just in case I spotted some cheap spare parts. In the meantime, I have been using a hand-me-down, twin pan breadmaker that a family member bought from Lidl supermarket. I guess the most important part of this waffling ramble is that when I was tagged, it was also to say that Argos had the breadmaker on half price offer! Well, that was me truly smitten! With a £10 voucher to use and cashback available via one of my favourite sites, I simply could not resist the temptation to have a sparkling, shiny, brand new breadmaker. It was an extravagant action for the Frugaldom household, I can tell you! The new machine arrived, so I quickly wiped it down, seasoned the pan and got the first loaf going using some heavily discounted bread flour I keep in stock.Watching the dough risingFor this basic white, I used the simple 25p loaf recipe but added in some milk powder, sunflower oil and sugar, seeing as it was a very special occasion - the breaking in of the new breadmaker. In all, even if I had paid full supermarket price for the flour, it would still cost less than 50p for the load even allowing for the electricity to bake it.Opening up to retrieve the first loaf from the new breadmakerGreat excitement, as the loaf adequately filled the pan and turned a beautiful golden brown on top.I think this is a better shape than the tall loaves made in the old Fastbake machineThe freshly baked bread tipped out of the pan easily and the paddle/mixing blade remained in the pan, rather than in the loaf - a definite plus!The basic white loaf - slices to perfectionI am very, very pleased with my wonderful new toy. I can see us spending many happy hours working together over the coming year to produce our daily bread.  Should I rehome the old ones, I wonder? Should I deduct the cost of this new one from my food budget, my extras budget, my gift budget or my miscellaneous budget? The total cost, including delivery, after cashback and after deduction of the free voucher came to less than £50. If this machine lasts as long as the old one, it will equate to no more than a few pennies per week. A frugal bargain, if ever there was one to be had. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "How to Make Paper Snowflakes", "date": "Thursday 12 December 2013", "text": "Cutting the Bills This ChristmasAKA Making Paper Snowflakes!Now that we have reached the 12th of December, I really need to try and get the presents wrapped and the frugal Christmas tree set up and decorated. I've been refreshing my memory on how to make paper snowflakes and found this really useful set of instructions but thought I would have a practice run and share a few extra photographs with my lovely readers here on the frugal blog. I'm using old invoices and scrap paper as part of our Frugal Forums 'Decius Frugalus' challenge of waste not, want not. As you can see, the first thing you need to do is find a sharp pair of scissors and an old bill or invoice - make sure it's one that's been paid and no longer needs to be kept on file. Hopefully, my photos will be quite self explanatory.Cutting bills this ChristmasCut your sheet of paper into a square and then fold it corner to corner to form a right-angled triangle. Do this twice, so your square is quartered.Make a square and then fold it in quarters With the right-angle at the bottom, fold the paper into a triangle one third the size of the first one by folding both outside edges inwards, as per my photo.Fold your triangle into thirds It's difficult to put into words how to calculate exact thirds, so I won't even bother trying because I didn't measure anything, I simply folded the paper and guessed the sizes.This is it folded into thirdsOnce it's folded into what looks like a fox-faced 'pokey hat' with the thickest edge on the left, snip off the top to remove the excess paper.﻿Cut off the excessThe scraps can be shredded as paper stuffing or used in whatever other way you use your scrap paper. Mine gets stuffed into McGonks or else used in the fire, meaning it also contributes to the cooking and heating here in Frugaldom. Snip randomly or create your own unique geometric designSnip the very bottom corner off your triangle if you want a hole in the absolute centre of your snowflake. Now begin snipping random or geometric patterns on either size of your triangle, always making sure it remains intact without cutting right across the full width. The following is what unfolded from the above 'bill cutting' exercise.Gently unfold your star creationI'm sure most people will be able to find scrap paper lying about the house. You can use any type, just as long as you can cut it, and get as intricate as you like, without turning it into a paper doily.﻿﻿Carefully unfold your snowflakesGet creative and don't be scared to experiment. In nature, no two snowflakes are ever identical, so you will never run out of design ideas.No end of designs you can makeNow you, too, can go and have fun cutting your bills and invoices this Christmas, then show off your creations on doors and walls. If they're for windows, perhaps best use plain white paper so visitors, passers-by, friends and neighbours can't see how little you've been spending. Adult supervision advised when children are working with scissors."},
{"title": "How to Make a Christmas Candle Lantern from a Tin Can", "date": "Thursday 5 December 2013", "text": "DIY Frugal Festive LanternsA Simple step-by-step guide to making rubbish decorations.Tin can lanternIt's time to deck the halls and get creative with some kitchen rubbish! In this case, it's empty tin cans. The following items are what you will need to create your very own, individually designed, unique candle lantern. Adult supervision needed for any younger members of the family trying this. Essential tools for the jobAs you can see, you need a hammer, a nail, a pair of work gloves to protect your fingers from freezer burns (or being hit too hard with the hammer) and a mat, towel or cloth of some sort to help prevent the tin can from sliding when you strike it. But look closer at the tin can - it isn't actually empty. Cans of water in the freezerThese are four cans I had for recycling this week - two beans, one spaghetti, one cat food. I peeled off the paper labels, washed the tins, filled them with water to about a centimetre below the top of the can and then popped them into the freezer overnight. Making the dot to dot designNext, you can either draw a simple design onto the can or else cut one out (use the reverse side of the labels) and tape it to the can, then following the lines to create your chosen design. Gently tap the hammer through the can and into the ice, which prevents the can from buckling or bending, making holes along the edge of your design. You can be as creative and intricate as you like, drawing patterns, objects or even stencilling, using different sizes of nails for better effect.  The lantern in my photos was done freehand, so it's far from perfect, but still looks effective with a lit candle inside it.  I use small tealight candles, but you need to be careful when lighting them on the bottom of the tins, best using a taper rather than risking burning yourself. Added benefits:  Cheap and easy to makeCreates a cosy little light that throws out designs on your wallsEmits some heat to help cheer you through the cold winter months. Pop over into the crafting thread on the Frugal Forums or visit NYK's brand new Frugaldom page on Facebook page to share photos of your creations. Have fun getting creative with your rubbish and always remember to keep sharp or hot objects out of reach of children.  Place the lanterns on heat-resistant surfaces, out of reach of children and where they cannot be knocked over by boisterous or inquisitive pets. NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "How to Make a Plastic Food Scoop from a Milk Carton", "date": "Sunday 1 December 2013", "text": "Recycling Plastic Milk Cartons into Food ScoopsDecember's mini-challenge in the Frugal Forums is to recycle as much as possible, as creatively as possible, so I'm starting with my milk cartons. At £1.62 for a 2 litre carton, it seems crazy to throw these in the bin.2 litre milk cartons make great food scoopsDraw the shape first, keep the handle to the topCarefully cut along the line to form your scoopKeep the extra pieceI've been making pet food and grain scoops out of milk cartons for longer than I care to remember - working in the pet trade, scooping out bird seed for a living for a few years taught me that trick - but, as someone just pointed out to me, what's normal for one may be a brand new idea for another, so never forget to share. I have to remember this for my 2014 challenge, as I seldom post about the things I see as ordinary, mundane or second-nature to my frugal lifestyle.The unused part of the milk containers, after cutting out your scoops, can be kept for future projects requiring firm plastic or they can be joined together for using as desk tidies, fridge containers or any number of objects - I'll post a few more soon.Reuse the sticky labels for resealing bags The newer, improved, sticky labels off the milk cartons work really well for resealing plastic food bags and cereal packets and if you get really stuck, wrap them around a spare piece of milk carton and use them as sticky tape whenever needed. Ideal for sandwich bags, freezer bags and even wrapping frugal gifts.Handy funnel for filling jars with rice etc.The pouring end of any plastic carton makes a great funnel, but don't pour anything hot through it, as the cartons are now so flimsy that they'll just melt. The other half of this design usually gets used as a plant pot or for rinsing paint brushes. The screw caps get saved.Spare plastic lids can come in really handy for all sorts of exciting projects, plus used as pieces in home made board games. There are so many different uses for plastic milk cartons that I have just created a new section in the Frugal Forums specifically for sharing ideas about recycling plastic milk cartons. See you there soon.NYK, Frugaldom."},

{"title": "Going to War on Waste: Time, Energy, Food, Water, Fuel and Finances", "date": "Saturday 30 November 2013", "text": "2014 Will be my Personal War Against Waste!www.frugalforums.co.ukAs previously mentioned, my journey to this place in time has taken 15 years of challenging myself to beat a financial mess into submission and recover enough to take control of my own finances. Along the way, I have been joined by many others and, hopefully, I have been able to offer sufficient moral support to enable them to move on, leading their own personal journeys, sharing their news as they go. I know many have and continue to do so. Despite everything, however, I still find myself day dreaming about what I would like out of life, wandering off the straight and narrow 'path of need' in search of bigger and better things, or perhaps substitutes for those things in my life that haven't materialised. Life, for me, is about marking progress, passing each milestone marker and ticking it off as a small achievement before moving on to the next. If one route isn't fulfilling all my own, personal needs, then I need to retrace my steps and set off in a new direction, once again hopeful of achieving what I set out to achieve. So, here goes with my war on waste! The Frugaldom eco(nomical) renovation has been in progress since April 2011, when we first bought the house. Work is slow but we are getting there. Where 'there' is, I'm not exactly sure, nor am I sure how I'll know when I reach that destination, or where I'll go from there! But for now, that's where I'm heading. Since having the old back boiler behind the open fire replaced with a Grant's triple pass boiler (second hand/reclaimed), we soon discovered that the hot water being produced was not being used! It was soul-destroying the night I had to run off gallons of hot water just to stop the tank boiling up, but there was simply too much of it to do anything else. We have now invested in another two radiators and, this time, bought them brand new.  Of course, I bought online through a cash back site and used my cash back credit card so there was a little bit of saving involved, but all done with the view of not wasting precious hot water in the future. We've had one fitted in the hall leading to the shower room and the other fitted in the living room, where the fireplace is. It's brilliant! Even now, with two extra radiators, there's sufficient hot water to run a bath - if we had one! Needless to say, I am now on the lookout for a bath! Sheer luxury for wintertime use when the fire is lit. But, of course, with all highs, there can be lows... This is what will be the living room, complete with its newly fitted radiator. Looks a bit wet, doesn't it? That's it drying out after our latest disaster; blah, blah, blah, nobody really gives a toss about why etc... but it's drying out now. I have to say that I am majorly impressed by my workman's ability to keep his cool while all around him is chaotic! He even made mention of Rudyard Kipling and his famous words! I'm not sure how funny he found it when I asked what 'King of the Swingers' had to do with anything!    Shows you how my mind works - it leapt to Jungle Book and the Just So Stories while he was beginning to recite lines from 'If...'!All mopped up now and I was singing my version of 'Steamy Windows', while lighting the fire and trying to remember where I read that music and song calmed crazy minds... I'm sure that's of Biblical origin, so it brought Noah's Ark to mind and that made me think of 'Noah and Nelly' the TV cartoon, which brought me right back around to Rudyard Kipling and his Just So Stories - the one about how the elephant got its trunk.... Crazeee...... me? Never!  Moving swiftly on, now trying to ignore thoughts of Jonathon Swift and Gulliver's Travels, it broughtme to the fact that we almost have the living room competed, as soon as it's dried out, but how do we get in and out of it when there's no door? Yes, OK, I know we just walk through the hole in the wall! Anyhow, that hole in the wall isn't a standard door size (I wasn't in the least surprised at that news!) and it meant having a door made to measure. Umm... I don't think so, not at that price, thank you very much. Cue an online search and some helpful suggestions from the trusty workman. And this is what we came up with; a light-weight shed door that can be cut to fit the existing door frame and made to fill the gap! I was a bit dubious at first and couldn't, for the life of me, work out how I'd open and close a shed door with what I thought was a latch! But look at this! A set of black hinges and a matching black latch, known as a Suffolk latch, and the new door is beginning to look mighty fine to me! In fact, I love it just the way it is, all natural and woody and rustic, but it still has to be undercoated and then painted. Had I been changing the other doors in the house, I might have left this one bare wood and simply varnished it, but the other doors are white. White should look good with the black, as that's what's already on the replacement front door. I'll let you know what I decide, eventually.Back on my war against waste, everything that got delivered was boxed in brown corrugated cardboard, so the past 3 days I have spent tearing it all up into strips and rolling it into fire sticks for 'Wilbur', our pot-belly stove in the sitting room. They have worked brilliantly, boiling kettle after kettle of water and even cooking dinner for the past couple of nights. How great is that?One of my MAJOR grievances is the cost of electricity, especially when it is the main source of energy for cooking, heating and lighting. Over the past few years I have faithfully recorded electricity use on a weekly basis, along with the costs involved in heating by way of coal and logs. I haven't had a house with central heating in it since renting a property in Suffolk while working down there in 2001-2003, so getting this solid fuel system up and running here is absolute luxury, even if it will never have push-button convenience. For the past year, I have worked extra hard at trying to drive down my spending on electricity, coal and logs, despite the prices of coal and electricity increasing. Here are how the current results of that challenge are looking. We had a major blip last winter after the worst snowfalls here in 60 years, cutting us off from the outside world for 4 days. Temperatures were dropping well below zero and we didn't have the heating system repaired at that time - thank goodness we'd had 'Wilbur' fitted, as it meant we had one warm room in the house, the rest relied on electric heaters! We're now about to enter the coldest period of the year; temperatures have already begun dipping below zero and we've had the first flutter of snow. December, I suspect, could be much worse, but the fight against wasting electricity continues.  Firstly, this week I learned the fabulous new (to me) trick of switching the cold water feed for the hot water feed on my little washing machine. This means I can do the laundry while there's hot water in the tank and have no need to burn extra electricity waiting for the machine to heat the water - I can let the fire do it for me and afford a warmer wash for things I'd normally do cold! How simple and ingenious is that?  Secondly, I was very fortunate in that I was awarded £60 of Amazon vouchers by Barclaycard for taking part in a quiz and then listing it here for everyone else to take part. Amazingly, very few of you chose to take part, although it isn't too late yet - you have until midnight tonight and I have 3 x £20 Amazon vouchers to give away tomorrow! (See here) Anyhow, I gave mine over to Christmas shopping and this freed up another few pounds from my savings. Seeing the 'Black Friday' offers for light bulbs prompted me into spending a whopping great £14 of my own money (plus £60 courtesy of Barclaycard and £15 courtesy of Topcashback) to replace every light bulb in the house, barring the fluorescent strip light in kitchen, with maximum 5watt LEDs plus motion sensor battery operated LEDs for the stairs, cupboard and even the wood store. The batteries will be rechargeable, so I'm now saving for a solar battery charger and a set of spare batteries - unless anyone has some they'd like me to review? Even our old rechargeable (via electricity) torch has been made redundant by way of this fabulous little device! It's a wind-up torch complete with phone charger. I have a whole other tale to tell about this after grand daughter and I took it away on out hillwalking and indoor camping holiday last month! Just thought I'd mention it here since it is contributing to my overall energy savings by way of no longer needing the other torch plugged in and at the ready for power cuts! I'll let you know on Monday if electricity use is down this past week, despite there having been some power tools in use, By next Monday, once the new bulbs are all fitted, there really should be a marked difference. That takes care of wasting electricity - we simply won't be doing it, as it's just like burning money. With what gets saved by the above actions, there should be sufficient surplus in next year's electricity budget to more than cover the cost of having the silly prepayment meter replaced and then switching onto a cheaper tariff. Our tariff increase comes into play one week from today, but the electronic key has been topped up sufficiently to last us for what could be months if my calculations are anywhere near correct. Back to my war on waste! What else is worth saving? Well, basically I see binning anything that we've had to pay for as binning money, but so many people remind me that time, itself, is money, so I have decided to severely cut back on wasting my time. For November, I made some recipe card sets and fridge magnets to sell, either as gifts from frugalers for those who could benefit from learning some basic cooking skills, or for newcomers to frugal living, so they could learn to make their own delicious alternatives, plus have a bit of fun. (I included a card about papier mache.) All profits (25%) were for my nominated charity. I'm ashamed to say that I sold only 11 sets over the entire month and earned a pitiful £11 for the charity! I can clearly see I have been wasting my time trying to promote these via social media, as it has proven to be one of the most unsociable, to the point of being anti-social, places I have ever set virtual foot online. For me, it simply doesn't work! After a month of trying (and failing) I discovered that only a handful of people were seeing my posts on the Frugaldom Facebook page and even fewer were seeing my Twitter posts. No more wasting time, no more wasting money, food, water, energy or fuel, no more wasting opportunities to have fun. My war on waste has been declared! NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "1999-2014 Celebrating 15 Years of Frugal Living Challenges", "date": "Wednesday 27 November 2013", "text": "My Moneysaving Experience Has Taught Me Well!Frugaldom's Annual Frugal Living Challenge It's the time of year when we all need to start thinking ahead into the new year, especially if we need to tackle any debts, generate extra income or squirrel away some extra savings for something special. Scottish pounds - still in circulation2014 is a very special year for NYK - it will be the 15th anniversary of our frugal living challenges. (We did have challenges prior to that, but of a slightly different variety.) Every year, I set a Frugal Living Challenge, based on the original concept known as 'The Scottish Pound'. The following is clipped from a 1999 newspaper and shows the beginnings of our first, ever, published grocery challenge. For the benefits of non-Scots, the word 'messages' basically mean groceries.NYK Media's first published grocery challenge from 1999The grocery budget has increased, somewhat, since 1999. Currently, the Frugaldom household grocery budget is set at £1 per person per day for all meals. In saying that, I have maintained the same overall annual budget for many, many years, so my £4,000 per year challenge is still the one I, personally, follow. Nowadays, I'm probably getting far more for my £4,000 because some luxury non-essentials cost much less.Life experience (and a 1997/8 challenge) taught me that almost all things are possible within a budget, as long as we are realistic about wanting to achieve our goals and live well within our means. By following a few basic principles (and almost every trick in the book) I managed to clear my feet by 2007, but continued running the challenges, multiplying and diversifying them along the way. I love trying to beat the banks, squeeze overhead costs and attempt what some consider to be impossible while stretching every single penny of my budget as far as is humanly possible! Year on year, we try to grow more, make more, save more, need less and waste less. The quest for self-sustainability is still as relevant now as it ever has been, in my opinion. A budget is a very personal thing; it should fit with your personal financial situation and it should enable a decent lifestyle to be affordable. No two households are identical, so work out your own cost of living and your own household budget. If you aren't too sure how to do that, you can check out What is a Budget?'Some followers of NYK and Frugaldom have already achieved their debt free status and moved on in their worlds, while some now follow our challenges simply to help them remain free from debt. Others are still pursuing that dream. Whichever stage you are at, feel free to join us for 2014. Share your journey with like-minded others in the Frugal Forums.Now we are approaching December 2013 and preparing to launch the 2014 Frugal Living Challenges, which will be hosted in the Frugal Forums. As usual, some will also be featured elsewhere in various guises. We do like to spice things up a bit now and again, so we incorporate mini challenges lasting anything from a few days to weeks or months. The final monthly-challenge of this year is Decius Frugalus! For the entire month of December, we will be practicing our creative, moneysaving, frugal lifestyles with an attempt at zero-waste on cash, energy, food and fuel in an attempt to leap into the new year full of renewed hopes, dreams and ambitions. They may take our money but - once achieved - they may never take our debt freedom!For some it is initially about asking themselves the question, 'how did I get into debt'? That is generally followed by the all too familiar, 'how do I get out of debt?' and, as soon as that penny has finally dropped, you should feel some of the weight lift off your shoulders. Clearing debt isn't easy, but nor is it impossible. If you want to be part of a mutually supportive and rather exclusive group of like-minded people, introduce yourself in the Frugal Forums. For others, our challenges are about increasing savings, buying property, becoming stay at home mums, starting businesses, seeing the world or paying off the mortgage early. Some choose the lifestyle on ethical grounds but it is not, as has been suggested in the past, self-imposed poverty. It's a fun and supportive way to help you manage your budget, enabling you to control your own cost of living. It's also about separating the NEEDS from the WANTS.In case you should ever run a little short of free reading material, the following links will take you to previous versions of this challenge that have run on the Moneysavingexpert.com website.

{"title": "Loch Ness Monster and Money Madness", "date": "Monday 25 November 2013", "text": "25th November 2013conner395 / Foter.com / CC BYToday I have been looking at anything except work! I was looking at the Monday blues, wondering why so many hate one particular day of the week. I'm constantly seeking financial tranquillity but am always all too aware of the fact that a money-munching monster could leap from the calm waters at any moment!Let's face it, if I had sufficient income from paid work as a writer - a lifelong ambition sparked off by reading a book titled 'The Big Tomato' in the early 70's - I wouldn't be sitting here trying to resolve so many  complicated, long term financial issues. Don't get me wrong, I love crunching numbers and I love all the fantastic results I've witnessed over the years, but helping others for free doesn't pay the bills or keep a roof over my head. Bearing this in mind, I needed to reflect on what my future may hold. We all need to keep our hopes and dreams alive, so this seemed like a particularly poignant day to reflect on such musings! 25th November, 2013 was a typical Monday! Few need reminding that 50 years ago today was the funeral of the assassinated President John F. Kennedy.The weather here in Scotland has been reaching sub-zero temperatures recently and we've had the first snow flurry, but on this day in 1950, several feet of snow fell in many of the  north-eastern States of America and, combined with 100+ mph winds, caused millions of dollars in property damage and killed 160 people. A huge cost for all concerned.In 1973, President Richard Nixon was very harshly criticised, accused of deceiving the American people and not telling them about the real cause and severity of the energy crisis. Another crisis! Energy and finances... will these problems ever be resolved? Looking towards the current energy price hikes here, it's reported that over 35% of Scottish households were in fuel poverty in 1996. In 2002, it was less than half that when they changed the definition of 'fuel poverty'. (I call that political number crunching!) By 2009, the figure was 28% and there's a claim that 98% of all Scottish households now have full central heating. Hmm... to this date, I have never been asked by any official body how much it would cost me to maintain this house at the minimum required temperature throughout the year. I can tell you now, it would probably take closer to half my annual income - certainly well over the 10% of the household income, so our fuel crisis is that we simply can't afford enough of the stuff! That's the reality of a frugal fuel crisis! But I don't feel in crisis about that in the least - it's toasty by the stove and 14C feels positively tropical when its freezing outside. Perhaps I should be stockpiling coal instead of saving cash in the bank! I could have doubled my money over the past 10 years! I'm planning on slashing my electricity expenditure next year for several reasons, one of them being that I'd rather help keep the local coal man and log man in jobs! Without them, I'd be well and truly stuffed!Who remembers Bob Geldof and Band Aid with 'Do they Know it's Christmas?' That was on this day in 1984 - another money-orientated event to help deal with a crisis that resulted in around one million people dying of starvation, unable to buy food or fresh water in sufficient quantities to sustain themselves. Human beings, starving or dehydrating to death! I wonder how many people could be fed from the equivalent of what British households shamefully bin? But worry not - the council will recycle it all soon - into what, I am not 100% sure. Nor am I sure of how ecologically or economically sound these schemes are.On a much lighter note, did you know that on this exact date in 1960, it is reported that Scottish Parliamentarians met in order to protect the alleged existence of the Loch Ness Monster? Supposedly,  a group of young Englishmen were planning on dropping homemade bombs into the loch in order to send the mysterious creature to the surface, hopefully resulting in the capture of the beast for further study. The Chief constable of the County of Inverness, who it's said supported scientific study of this mysterious creature, did not, however, support bombing it in the process. The existence of 'Nessie' will forever be debated, but the fact remains - people love a good mystery. I, for one, am pleased that someone with authority chose to take such action (alleged or otherwise) to keep the hopes and dreams of many alive. Can you imagine what would happen if anyone suggested attempting to bomb Santa and his sleigh out of the sky? How shocking!So, I've wandered from job to job, topic to topic, year to year and room to room today. I'm still not sure which direction I should be heading in 2014 but I have come to one conclusion - nothing is getting any easier! Perhaps we need to find what contents us, rather than trying to buy happiness. For me it seems to be about safeguarding my own future to avoid burdening anyone else - family, for example - with disasters that could so easily be averted.The saying, \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\" springs to mind when I see how many millions of pages of information are available about kicking debts, curbing spending and living within our means - despite them all, how many people (and Governments and countries) still have unsustainable debts, yet continue to spend unashamedly on non-essentials?The saying \"Like lambs to the slaughter\" springs to mind when I see posts on social media sites proclaiming all sorts of miracle cures for all sorts of faults, flaws and crises, then witness those I previously thought of as rational, intelligent individuals, 'buy now', 'subscribe' or 'click here'. Almost every single person I know professes to have less money than they'd like, yet not one has ever taken up the frugaldom challenge to better their ability at budgeting.The saying “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” springs to mind whenever I make soup! ﻿ This afternoon, I made soup from a couple of ham stock cubes, a handful of diced onions and a cupful of lentils. I cooked it on top of the log burner, as the heat was there and best utilised to its fullest potential. That's two days of lunches sorted for pennies.Two little loaves got baked on 45 minute express setting in the breadmaker, so they'll be sliced and some served with the soup. I do like making soup! I guess it's one of the few things I concede to being good at doing - I can conjure up a pot of soup from next to nothing. If all else fails in my grocery challenge, I'll always have soup despite my lack of culinary skills. My bread never rises as proper fluffy, soft stuff, but we eat it, regardless. Soup, on the other hand, that can be played with until you get it near perfect every time.Perhaps I'll try my hand at some more crafting - if only it was as easy as the pictures make it look and if only the receivers of such creative gifts appreciated them for what they are - hours of painstaking work - instead of subjecting me to the regular comment of, \"Oh no, what are we getting this time?\" Perhaps I should shock them all and give them nothing, but where's the fun in that?How many of you have monsters lurking in the dim and dark depths of your lives, just waiting to pounce when you least expect them? Is it just me who worries about the future? Is it a cliché to discuss the price of cheese?Should we really be noting the fact that it costs more for 3 filleted haddock than it does a bag of coal?Why do so many people look at us strangely when we say we bake all our own bread, make all our own jam, marmalade and jellies or that we make our own laundry liquid? Is it really making us seem old-fashioned that we will attempt to home-make anything we can, even if it means recycling something old into something new?I do know that we of the frugal living ilk won't save the planet. I understand that we are like a tiny shoal of krill swimming against a huge tide towards the gaping mouth of a whale, but this is what we do - our best!Which Direction?`James Wheeler / Foter.com / CC BY-NC-SAI feel very lucky to have completed my personal journey to debt freedom, a destination I reached in 2007! But that was just a temporary stop, a way-marker en route to the next fork in the road, where my choice led me to pitching in with A. N. Other and buying a house without a mortgage. Now we are well on the way to completing the renovation that will allow the house to be turned into a home. But that, again, is just the next step of my journey. What happens next?In this respect, we are all sailing in the same boat. We still need to stay ahead of the game and try to protect ourselves from any sudden losses and, at the same time, balance that with actually living a life now that we are content and happy to live. I may not be anyone's wife, frugal or otherwise, but I can, at least, practice frugal housekeeping and home improvements on a budget while, at long last, trying to pick up where I left off before having sunk into the depths of debt and a failed marriage.My 2014 challenge shall, once again, attempt to stretch my £4,000 household budget throughout the entire year while pursuing the goal of turning house into home. My hope is that many more of my friends and family will see fit to afford a frugal holiday. (If you doubt your finances will get you this far, I know someone who loves number-crunching and who can probably help make your trip affordable!) :)I sincerely hope that you will join me in the Frugal Forums for the 2014 challenges that lie ahead of us.

{"title": "Preparing for Sharing the Fun and Frugal Festivities", "date": "Sunday 24 November 2013", "text": "One Month until Christmas!2014 is fast approaching and we can now look forward to the final throws of 2013, all prepared for festive feasting and frugal fun, safe in the knowledge that the Christmas shopping is all done, dinner is planned and paid for, all the fabulous gifts you bought for others have been wrapped, cards written, the Christmas cake baked and not a penny of debt incurred. All that remains is to put up the tree and get the decorations hung!No? Not sound like your household? Phew! Because it certainly doesn't sound like mine and I'd hate to be alone with my wild seasonal thoughts!What stage have you reached in the proceedings? I do know that I've had the best part of 50 years to get accustomed to the fact that Christmas happens every December, followed a week later by the arrival of the new year, but why am I always in such a chaotic state of non-preparedness?What have I been doing with all my time in Frugaldom?I made two dozen Ozzy Blackbeard Knitted Christmas Puddings (that's one of them in the photo at the top) using scraps of wool from my stash. I used a tiny bead as a berry on the first one but then decided it was easier to simply sew a couple of stitches of red wool on top. I had a little bit of green felt, but you could also knit the leaves, if you followed Fibrefable's free pattern. These will be used to gift wrap individual chocolates, meaning that one box can be split among friends and family as cute little gifts or Christmas table favours. Ferrero Rocher, anyone? (Sadly, our local store doesn't have Ferrero Rocher, so I'll need to try and source these from elsewhere.)I used up some oddments of red and white wool to knit little Santa hats, making up the very basic pattern as I went along by knitting a row of plain then a row of purl and decreasing to create the size needed. The small will be used to cover bottle tops on the homemade 'pink champagne' and the larger one is for covering a chocolate orange. (Sadly, our local store doesn't have any Terry's Chocolate Oranges, so I'll need to try and source these from elsewhere.)I tried first knitting and then crocheting little owls for hanging in the tree, as I love what's known as amigurumi and want to make a load of these for the younger members of the family. Next, I'm going to make the mini hedgehog, using the simple to follow, free patterns posted on the Knitted Toy Box blog. The free crochet patterns are on the Romansock blog, which I also love - fluffy bunny, anyone? So many things to knit with such a dwindling supply of DK! (Sadly, our local store doesn't sell yarn, so I need to replenish from elsewhere.)Cinnamon Sticks - I have treated myself invested in a pack so I can make cinnamon candles, scent some winter spiced potpourri and spruce up a homemade Christmas wreath for the door. I opted for the eBay offer of 20 x 8cm for £2 including postage and packaging. At 10p each, that's about the best price I could find and there are also the Nectar Points I collect while shopping there. In fact, I think this was a double points weekend. (Sadly, our local store doesn't sock anything as exotic as cinnamon sticks, so I needed to source these from elsewhere.)Christmas Holly Wreath - I splashed out £2.45 for  5 x 10\" wire wreath hoops, again via eBay,  taking advantage of free delivery and double Nectar points this weekend. We have plenty of foliage in the garden, including holly, plus I have a box of assorted ribbons, bows and shiny baubles in my crafting stash. Add to this some dried cones, the cinnamon sticks, some fine plastic coated garden wire and anything else I can lay my hands on that represents itself with a hint of festive colour or texture, I will have a very frugal, homemade holly wreath for my front door.Christmas shopping! It hasn't been much, so far, but I seem to take a somewhat different view to the current belief by many that Christmas is nothing more than a hyped-up, consumerist-driven spend fest. Yes, I agree that it can be, especially when people go crazy, making rash, OTT decisions about how much money to spend regardless of how little they can really afford. or worse still, when that competitive spirit suffocates the festive spirit. I mean, really! What is that all about? If someone in a family earns £50k a year and another earns £5k, who in their right mind would expect similar value gifts to be exchanged? In fact, who expects reciprocation in the first place, if one tells the other that there will be no gift exchange this year? The gift of giving is a great one, so if any of your nearest and dearest state that they don't want to 'do' Christmas, it needn't stop you - just give their gift away to charity if they insist they want nothing. My shopping, so far, amounts to various smaller pieces of cumulative presents that will be put together by way of homemade hampers - made up in recycled cardboard boxes, not fancy wicker baskets!Planning the meal - I took the opportunity of buying fresh turkey while I had the chance of paying for it with free points. It's now in the freezer. My friend always makes braised red cabbage for us both and, by way of exchange, I give her a bottle of my homemade pink 'champagne'. This year, it's raspberry, blackberry and rhubarb.Bargain bagging with cash back, buy one get one free, free delivery and voucher codes. I splurged in the online Thornton's store! I think the normal price should have been much closer to £100 but with the *Topcashback voucher for free box of chocolates, a half price daily deal, a superb buy one get one free offer, the clearance bargains, the free delivery and the cash back from site and credit card, it came in at approximately £35 and enough luxury chocolates to share among the entire family. Christmas is about affording luxuries that you wouldn't normally even contemplate at any other time of year. Christmas is for frugalers doing what they do best - celebrating their financial achievements and savvy shopping in some most impressive ways.Preparing for the onslaught of a long and possibly harsh winter. I have all my candles to hand, the wind-up torch, the rechargeable clock radio, the stack of logs and the cupboards packed with some emergency supplies. I have practiced cooking most things on the stove top, so a period without electricity similar to last winter's shouldn't affect us too much. New woolly blankets are draped over beds and settee, fleece blinds in the windows, hot water bottle checked for leaks, matches to hand and the electricity meter topped up to the maximum in the hope of delaying the inevitable price hike that comes into play from 6th December. I have not fallen for the ridiculous posts that are circulating with the news that you can heat a room for 8p per day because this 'tale' is simply NOT TRUE! If you doubt my word, light a tealight candle and time how long it burns, then work out how many candles you'd need and at what cost, to last you a full day. The absolute cheapest cost at least 1p per hour to burn and produces sufficient heat to warm a cupboard.Preparing for next year's Frugal Living Challenge, which is run through www.frugalforums.co.uk but still has a subsidiary thread running in the Moneysavingexpert.com forums. 2014 will be year 7 of this challenge being open to the general moneysaving, budget-conscious public, so don't forget to join us soon.Amidst all of this, of course, we are still progressing with the frugal renovation plans and the garden work. Just yesterday, the garden path was completed and I think it is looking great! It stretches all the way from the patio to the stream at the bottom of the garden. In place of weed suppressant, we have recycled builders' tote bags and in place of path edgings, we have logs. The logs worked out at approximately £1 per 3m length from the Forestry Commission. The gravel was our biggest extravagance, as we needed 6 huge bags of the stuff (with another 6 free tote bags, cut and laid beneath said gravel), but we are hoping that it will last a very long time and prove its worth, even if the lower section of path ends up under flood water!Indoors, we almost had a living room but then plans changed again. The new backboiler is so good at heating the water that I've decided to incorporate another two radiators into the system, with one of those in the living room. Folks have asked why I would even need a radiator in my living room when that's where the open fireplace is, but when all that heat is roaring around a triple pass boiler and then up the chimney, I want as much of it circulating around the house as possible. This thing is hearing water at a rate enough to power 10 radiators and still heat a tank of water, so I'm now looking for a bath, rather than waste any hot water! I'll tell you the story of the living room door in a later post!Back on the Christmas trail, check out a few of the links at the bottom for recipes that include snowman soup, handmade chocolates and truffles, clootie dumpling, shortbread, homemade rhubarb champagne and other homemade gifts that we have tried over the years. I hope you can find something that catches your attention and brings a smile to someone's face over the coming weeks.For those of you who like to make your own clootie dumpling and short read, we still have some of the exclusive November Challenge Frugaldom Fun and Food card sets available for sale. (All profits from November sales are for charity.) These include recipes for both of the above plus the instructions for making your very own papier mache, ready to begin the next year of frugal living, cost-cutting, budget stretching and debt busting.On a sadder note, we have now learned that our nearest village post office is gearing down for closure soon. We'll still have postal service available in the village, by way of a counter in the general store, but to add to my woes, one of the two little general stores is closing. This is very sad but reflects how difficult it is for local shops to survive when most who can afford to prefer to jump into their cars and drive 40+ miles to the nearest big name supermarket. As a result, next year's grocery budget has had to be increased to £975 for the Frugaldom household to allow for the extra price increases that have already started to appear in the sole-surviving general store! I did promise to add in local store prices for the items I listed in last week's post about food prices, I will endeavour to do just that over the coming week. I can tell you now that a 2 litre carton of semi-skimmed milk cost me £1.62 this weekend. That's equivalent to 8.1p per 100ml. Checking on the 'mysupermarket' website, I see it costs 4.4p per 100ml in supermarkets, or £1 for 4 pints (2.27 litres). I wonder if less food would be thrown away if everyone had to pay village store prices? Any thoughts on that, anyone?NYK, Frugaldom* My friend referral link"},

{"title": "Another 26 Hints, Tips and Suggestions to Help you Save Money", "date": "Thursday 7 November 2013", "text": "Being Prepared for Frugal LivingBefore we begin, let's get just one thing straight - moneysaving does not mean being mean, nor does frugal living. It's true that it is about living a more simple lifestyle and trying to be more frugal in a self-sustainable way, but this doesn't mean you need to sell all your possessions and move into mobile accommodation or live like a nomad. Despite this 'free of the rat race' sounding escapade, it isn't actually all that practical in our modern society, so we need to face facts and do the best we can with what we've already got. If unsustainable debts are what you've got, then your primary concern should be to get rid of them as quickly and painlessly as possible, even if it means one screaming penny at a time.So, to follow on from my previous post of '20 Hints, Tips and Suggestions to Help you Save Money', I thought I would continue in that vein and post another 20, seeing as there's such an endless supply of things we can all do to help balance our own budgets. Old nest of tables - before and after a frugal makeover.﻿ 1. Recycling and upcycling can be much more fun than binning, burying or burning what's past its best, so I'd suggest taking a much closer look at anything that you think may need replacing soon, whether it's furniture, clothing or major appliances. Can any of it be fixed up in a way that changes it for the better? Can one thing be made into another? Can you create space for storing useful stuff? Even a neat pile of decorated cardboard boxes can look great when stacked in a corner of a room. 2. Vacuum Cleaners - Have you considered using a brush and pan occasionally,  instead of vacuuming? Modern vacuums can have motors well in excess of 2000w and that means it can cost you the best part of 10p every time you do quarter of an hour's vacuuming about the house!  3. Ironing can cost you over 20p for an hour, so why press everything when it doesn't need done? Air dry whenever possible and then fold it neatly to put it away before it gets crushed. Only the absolute essentials should need a quick press to make them presentable and there's always the old 'mattress trick' of lying jeans flat underneath for an overnight. Edited update - having checked the new, top of the range steam irons, I see some are 2800w. Once we factor in the standing charge for our electrical supplies, a steam iron set on high could cost some of us closer to 50p for an hour! 4. Hairdryers can be more powerful than some small electric heaters! Anything involving heat provides evidence that it's a big guzzler of energy, so just towel dry your hair and brush or comb it dry. If you are up to your eyes in debt, a posh hairdo won't make the finances better. 5. Vinegar Hair Rinse - A homemade vinegar rinse can put a shine on your hair and help keep the tangles at bay. Keep a jar made up handy by the sink. 2 cups of white or cider vinegar mixed with a few drops of your favourite essential oil can be stored in a glass jar then simply dilute about a tablespoon of the liquid in a cup of water to use in the final rinse. No need to blow dry, as allowing your hair to dry naturally helps give it more sheen. 6. Egg Hair Conditioner - Beat an egg yolk (not the white) with a tablespoonful of olive oil or baby oil and then mix with a cup of warm water. Use this to condition your hair as and when required. Use the egg white to make the micro-meringues included in the Frugaldom Food and Fun card sets.7. Buying candles probably works out more expensive than investing in a wind-up torch for emergencies, but candles are, nonetheless, very handy to have during power cuts, especially if they are the only source of heat you have for warming your hands! Add them to your gift list in case anyone asks what you'd like. Practical gift are always more appreciated by we of the frugal lifestyles. 8. Grocery shopping - Why buy 2 for 1 if there is even the remotest chance that you could end up throwing the extra in the bin? Why not share shopping with a friend and each of you have one for half price? 9. Walking - Probably the cheapest form of transport but it needn't involve expensive footwear. With a bit of forethought and planning, it is possible to get a full year of travel out of one pair of boots for less than a tenner - just keep them clean, dry and supple after every outing.  10. Dressmaking patterns - Clothing is another big spend for many families, especially where children are concerned, but dressmaking doesn't need to be about fancy fabrics and making dresses!  Can't sew yet? Take the time to unpick an old item of clothing and there you have it - the correct pattern to copy and remake in your own choice of fabric that can be altered to size it up or down accordingly.11. Simple sewing - Start off turning an old pillow slip into a reusable shopping bag, laundry bag, dumpling 'cloot' or even handkerchiefs for practicing your embroidery and you'll soon get into the swing of needlework. Save your oldest pair of jeans for cutting patches to embellish and strengthen subsequent pairs 'designer' fashion. 12. Growing your own - All you need is a sunny windowsill, a doorstep pot or a tiny corner of a garden - yours or anyone else's to get started. If you use herbs in your cooking, look out for bargain packs of fresh, still in the pot, supermarket special offers. These can be cut and will continue to grow and grow... my herb garden is full of such plants. Sprigs of rosemary will root easily in a glass of water and can then be transplanted into a pot on a windowsill for perpetual use, taking more cuttings each year it grows and then potting these up to give as gifts. If you have the space, other food you can try growing are seeds from inside things like pumpkins (although pumpkin seeds can also be roasted for eating on their own), tomatoes and peppers, fruit pips, garlic cloves and even potato peelings. The root end chopped from spring onions can regrow more spring onions, the base of a celery can regrow more celery and the base of a cabbage or lettuce can grow more cabbage or lettuce. Nature is on your side in this game, it just needs fresh water to help it get started. 13. Reusing paper products may not sound like much but, over time, pennies add up into pounds. By stashing away all those envelopes, junk mail, cards and calendars etc. you can then try decoupage, handmade cards, papier mache (have you seen Penny the Penguin, Phil the Pig or our Cash Cow animal banks?), paper pots for seedlings, kindling for a fire, shredded bedding for pets, dry material for adding to compost bins, as a temporary sealant for draughty windows, for pattern making, homemade wrapping paper and, lest we forget, how many uses can one person find for cardboard inner tubes from toilet rolls and kitchen rolls? Homemade Christmas crackers anyone?14. Chopping, slicing, dicing and grating - I'm not suggesting skimping on food to what's less than needed but, as a simple way of controlling portions to healthy levels, it is ideal. So many of us (myself included) tend to over-eat without being aware of that fact. I had no concept of what the Government health organisations recommend as sufficient by way of quantity of food served until I tried weighing things. Try weighing out 30g of breakfast cereal to see how it compares to your normal hapless servings and then you'll see how much further food would go if we restricted the portions to what's now said to be enough.15. Cooking - add as much as possible to the one pan to cook a meal for less. This also ensures all the flavours are retained and shared, bringing a little extra creativity to your meals - never be afraid to mix and match - of course green beans will stir fry with onions and cucumber in your discounted sweet chilli sauce.16. Alternative cooking energy - if you have a stove or log burner, make the absolute most of it. Low heat is slow heat, but it all cooks food.17. Warm plates for warm meals - there's nothing nicer than a hot meal that stays hot even during the coldest weather, so warming the plates can seem extra special. For some, it seems an extravagance but why waste valuable heat if you're cooking up a meal anyway? I can easily fit two large bowls or several smaller bowls over the top of my slow cooker, or on the top of my mini oven. so they get warmed up for free. Just use your common sense when lifting them. 18. Get Together - Organising family nights, date nights or social get togethers with friends and neighbours based around common interests is a great way of bringing extra entertainment into even the most cash-strapped household. It is especially helpful if you can invite others who, in turn, will host the next such event. A budget of £10 can easily provide sufficient snacks and refreshments for a party of a dozen. With some basic cooking or baking skills, you could hold a curry night, a traditional fare night, games night or even a themed party. Don't keep up with the Joneses - invite the Joneses to play along and take part in the challenge of hosting a get together on a £10 budget! Tell them it's 'the in thing' for trendsetters. 19. Charity Shopping - It isn't always about being skint, some folks shop in charity shops to actually help support charity! If you are decluttering, take along a few items to your nearest establishment and have a browse while there. Often, you can find fabulous items at ridiculously low prices, other times you may find crafting materials or cheap garments that can be turned into something else that you need - a duvet cover into curtains, for example. But a word of warning - remember nothing is a bargain if you aren't saving money on something you truly need. 20. Have a power out day once a week - probably best done during warmer months to begin with - switch off everything that doesn't absolutely need to be on and take a look at your lifestyle without electricity. Some people throw the main switch, disconnecting even their fridges and freezers so they know they're prepared for power cuts, but I don't subscribe to interfering intentionally with the running of appliances set to preserve food. What do you do? How do you get around the need for instant power? How do you stay warm if it's cold and the heating is off for 12 hours at a time? This is when you discover exactly why you knitted all those odd balls of wool into big, sloppy blankets.21. Basic essentials in the kitchen - sugar is sugar but you don't need to pay a fortune for butter when margarine will do instead. In fact, there are some recipes that can be followed using vegetable oil or lard when no butter is available. Milk is something else you can save on, as inexpensive whitener can be used in coffee or tea and reconstituted powdered milk can be used in almost all recipes where milk is listed as an ingredient. Then there's UHT - it lasts longer, doesn't need refrigerated and costs less, in most cases, than standard pasteurised milk. 22. Just add dumplings! Yes, I said dumplings! They're a simple mix of flour, suet and water with a bit of extra flavouring if preferred - you can even add some of your home grown herbs. They beef up a stew, can be served with gravy for supper, taste great in mince and can turn a bowl of broth into a very filling meal for any hungry Horace. And better still, they seem to cook anywhere there's heat - on the stove top, cooker top, log burner or slow cooker. 23. Corner cutting cooking - Switch kettles off as soon as they come to the boil, cook using a 3-tier steamer so you use only one ring of the cooker and learn to make the most of a microwave, as it probably uses less than half the energy required to cook in a conventional oven. A slow cooker can be used to cook most things on low power over several hours, but it also contributes to the overall heat of your kitchen, helping save on that. A mini-oven costs less to use than a full size oven... you get my drift. Just as you shouldn't cook more than you can store (or eat), you should also ensure you fill as much space as possible when cooking, or else downsize the cooking space.24. Take a flask - How often do you go places and then find you want a hot cuppa or a snack? Take it with you. Even if you don't need it, you can have it once you get back home. At best, you'll have saved several pounds on the price of a sandwich and a cup of coffee or tea while you were out and about. A picnic or snack pack is a meal for all seasons.25. Know anyone who knits? Knitting can be an expensive hobby but thousands of people do it and many never finish all the balls of wool they buy. Volunteer to take it off their hands and then get your pins out to make yourself a bitsy, piecy blanket that can be the shabby chic envy of all your friends.  They may even ask you to make them one if they buy their own wool and pay you a token sum as gratitude. That's when they'll realise the price of yarn and appreciate the true cost of hand crafted goods!26. The price of bread! It's getting quite ridiculous, so what do you do if you run out, don't have yeast or don't have time to bake a loaf? Bake a big scone or some tortillas! This one is a simple recipe given to me by a friend (thanks, T) when I was in a hurry to make a hot lunch. A big cup of flour, half teaspoon each of salt and baking soda and some milk to mix. This frugal soda scone, or farl, was enough to feed four when sliced through and served with melted cheese. I cook mine in a lightly oiled frying pan over the multi-fuel stove, so no electricity required.Well, this began as a post containing another 20 hints, tips and suggestions for moneysaving but, as you can see, I've now numbered them and discovered I ran over, slightly. Oops!

{"title": "20 Hints, Tips and Suggestions to Help you Save Money", "date": "Tuesday 5 November 2013", "text": "How to Prepare for Frugal Living﻿As we fast approach the end of another year of challenging ourselves to living a productive yet frugal, life, many of us are turning, once again, to preparations for the new year. It may only be early November as I write this but the latest monthly challenge is under way - Novus Frugalus has begun! You can see how to take part here. It is a chance for newcomers to frugal living (frugalers) to give it a go, if you like, sampling the lifestyle before committing to taking part in our year-long challenge to cut costs and live well within our own means. It's much easier said than done, I might add, so I thought I would lay down a few hints and tips to help newcomers - 'novus' literally means 'new' - prepare for 2014. Are you sitting comfortably? You may be in for a rough and bumpy ride if you've never before tried this.Decide exactly why you want to make your lifestyle more frugal - is it a financial necessity for the purposes of clearing debt, a savings exercise so you can afford something special, a major cost-cutting exercise to help safeguard your own financial future or simply because you are so rich that you can afford the extravagance of being eccentric? (Believe me, it will surprise you how many people think this may be the case!) In the beginning, my reasons were for debt-clearing and then gradually graduated onto buying a fixy-up house without a mortgage. Now it is so we can afford to renovate the fixy-up and I'd like to think that within the next couple of years that I'd graduate further towards safeguarding my own financial future. As for eccentricity, well... I continually aspire to that and put in as much practice as possible! If all else fails, I shall simply make myself a big, floppy hat for my own retirement.Take a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil and draw a line down the middle of the paper. On one side write the heading 'NEEDS' and on the other, write 'WANTS'. Now take a close look around you at home and list what you can see in the appropriate columns. Needs are things that the human body simply cannot live without, whereas 'wants' are everything else. This, in itself, can be a real eye-opener once you see how little of the stuff that surrounds us has any impact on actual life. These are luxuries - whether it's a phone, a television, a games console, an electric gadget, cosmetics, fashionable shoes... Imagine a sudden and complete loss of income - it doesn't matter the reason, it just matters that you are prepared to ride out that financial storm because for many, this could mean disaster.List your outstanding debts - everything from the month's credit card bill, overdraft or loan repayment to catalogues, contracts, mortgage, membership fees, subscriptions, insurances and even regular savings plans that may be set up as regular standing orders or direct debits - if the payments are expected, then the companies and organisations concerned are going to attempt to collect them whether or not your income has stopped. If you don't have the financial wherewithal to cover them, banks and creditors are pretty rigid in their rules where fines, fees, penalties and increased interest rates are concerned. For how long could you cover your weekly or monthly outgoings if you suddenly lost your income?Declutter to make space for storing absolute essentials.Take advantage of bargains that can be stockpiled, but always remember that a bargain is only a bargain if you will actually use it.Learn the basics of home cooking - cooking from scratch can save an absolute fortune and let's face it - if you suddenly lose your job, that could provide you with sufficient time to learn a whole load of new stuff.Quit spending on anything that isn't 100% essential to life itself.Assess how much your current job costs you - few ever analyse these interesting figures, so fail to see that spending £6,000 extra each year to go and work in a £20,000 job is the same as spending nothing and walking to a £14,000 job, or even one that involves fewer hours. How much do you spend on work-associated expense once you count in cars (or other transport) child care (where needed), lunches, coffees, cosmetics, extra grooming, suitable clothing and all the other little things that add up over the space of a year? Every mile you drive costs more than the price of the fuel you put into the tank.Bin raking! This may sound like something the proverbial tramp on the street might do but I mean it in a slightly different way; I mean start looking at what is being binned in your household, because everything that goes into it has, most likely, been paid for out of your income. Even the packaging stuff comes in is paid for somewhere along the line and everything you bin is money wasted.Quit buying takeaways - how many meals do you make and how many arrive in the house ready-made by way of supermarkets, takeaways or fast-food drive-through type places? Basing costs on my own £1 per person per day for ALL meals, it is fair to say that the cost of a takeaway meal for one can cost as much as some might spend on groceries to make meals for the full week. Frugal living while debt-busting does not include buying ready-made food.Quit eating out - a single meal out in a hotel or restaurant can equate to a full month's worth of food supplies for one adult. Only the seriously affluent can afford to eat a month's worth of meal at one sitting.Quit non-essential habits like smoking, alcohol or any other drugs, for that matter - even sweets and certain types of fizzy juice can be perceived as addictive and rack up a small fortune of spends! They simply aren't worth it if you are serious about becoming debt free, solvent and financially secure for the long-term.Count up how much toilet paper your household gets through in a full year. This may sound ludicrous, but once you have calculated the true costs of what you're flushing down the drains, you'll understand the importance of being prepared to grab a bulk bargain when you see one.How many loads of laundry do you do over the period of a year and at what cost? I was horrified to see some laundry detergents costing as much as 40p per wash and then some folks still needing to add on another 10p per load in fabric conditioner/softener without including the electrical costs of running a washing machine and, perhaps also a tumble dryer. Yes, this is the top end of the scale, but dyed in the wool frugalers will be washing at low temperatures, using white vinegar as the basis for their fabric softener and a soap/washing soda mix as their detergent. (See how to make homemade laundry detergent.)Start saving good jars and bottles with screw top lids that will be suitable for jam, jelly, pickle and chutney making. Save plastic tubs for soup and other meals that can be frozen.Start looking at what you have from the point of view - could I make that myself? Even clothing can be handmade easily and cheaply once you know how.Get acquainted with your local charity shops, exchange trading groups, freecycling sites and like-minded others in your area. You might be surprised at how many are playing this moneysaving game and you'll also need an outlet for decluttering if you don't have the time or inclination to sell it to raise a few extra pounds.Set aside a corner and a box to keep all those handy crafting essentials together - the world of make do and mend is a rather fascinating one that can lead you in many directions. For many, it opens up a whole new side of life that involves crafting. Handmade can equally mean individually designed and unique. What designer label can offer you that and at what cost, I ask?If you need to spend, try to get cash or loyalty points back on all your purchases. Despite my living in a fairly rural location, I make the most of Topcashback, Approved Food, MuscleFood, Nectar card and a cash-back credit card.There are so many ways to help you cut costs and save cash while going about your normal day-to-day life that no single post could ever cover them all. I'll post another list soon, so watch out for that. meanwhile, my suggestion is that you join us in the Novus Frugalus moneysaving challenge and take full advantage of everything that everyone has to offer by way of what they are doing in their own homes and workplaces, so you can prepare to launch headlong into a frugal lifestyle. It needn't be boring, nor need it be miserable, self-imposed poverty. Yes, it is a tough lifestyle to adapt into while desperately trying to claw your way out of a quagmire of debt, but the rewards are rich, in every sense of the word.If you don't like admitting to cost-cutting DIY, refer to your exploits as hobbies.If you don't like admitting to being skint, refer to it as austerity measures while saving for X, Y or Z - it was a good enough excuse for the Government!If you can't get out of gym membership then make the absolute most of it - shower and wash/blow dry your hair before you leave.If you don't like explaining to the kids why they can't go gallivanting with their friends to cinemas, fast food takeaways or whatever, make it fun for them - let them entertain at home on a budgetIf you can't go a month without a visit to the hairdresser or beautician's, ask yourself some serious questions!If you can't simply quit an expensive habit, start now and gradually phase it out between now and new year then say it's a New Year's resolution.If you want something, make it affordable to your budget rather than over-stretching your budget in an attempt to afford the unaffordable."},

Despite years of traditions and trends in retail and shopping, the rise of technology and social networking has resulted in a huge shift in consumer’s attitudes and approaches to retail. Where once the idea of spending money before seeing the product seemed impossible, it is now common practice to hunt down an offer online before considering spending in store. It’s thanks to the current generation of 14 to 19 year-olds that shopping has become so technologically and socially integrated. This generation were raised on social media and smart tech, and it is an integral part of their lives rather than something they have learnt to adapt to. … it’s all about trust. The modern, savvy shopper wants to know the stores personality and ideals before committing their cash to the brand, and so offering online reviewing services will help portray the store as honest as well as having integrity.

It stretches some 6,853 km (4,258 miles) and flows through eleven different countries before eventually entering the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, it can be seen from space! It is the main water source for at least two of these countries - Egypt and Sudan - so the Nile is of the utmost importance to all of these countries, communities and cultures. It is essential to the success of life, itself. Its true source remains a mystery to many, even to this day. The fact is, it stretches an unbelievably long way and there is no doubt about that.So, frugal friends, how can I compare the mighty Nile to a pack of mince? That's easy - I simply show you how far I can make mine stretch and prove to you that it is a valuable source of food that can stretch across many days and feed many mouths. Quite simply, it is the Nile of meat produce if you don't want to eat offal.MINCEIt comes in many forms - beef, pork, mutton, lamb, chicken, turkey and even soya. To me, it represents protein in the diet and is classed as one of the staples in a frugal household. Most importantly, mince is cheap! You can buy it from as little as £3 per kilo or pay up to nearer £10 per kilo, depending on source, how lean you want it and percentage fat it contains. Prices fluctuate and, at any given time, beef, pork, chicken, lamb and turkey prices can affect how much it will cost you in the shops. My suggestion is to look for the best quality you can afford and that way, once you have stretched it out as far as it can possibly go, you will still be producing nutritious meals.  Let's start with a standard 500g pack of mince. Under less frugal circumstances, this would simply be browned and then cooked with onions and gravy to produce a single family meal and, as we all know, few people consider portion sizes with any great care, so a pack of mince would be used to feed a family of four. Even using the cheapest mince and serving it with the traditional gravy, potatoes and veg, this family meal could cost around £6 when cooking costs are incorporated. That's a cheap meal for many, I admit, but at £1.50 per person for a single meal, it's a small fortune if you are budgeting £1 per person for all meals. Here in Frugaldom, I tend to slow cook the mince and it's normally lean beef mince. We don't have any supermarkets within easy reach, so I need to rely on multi-buys on the odd occasion I can get to a mainstream store or else pay a premium to have it delivered. Either way, I'm paying top-end of the scale at almost £8 per kilo, which normally represents 10 x 100g servings (80p per person) so I like to bulk that out to get at least 10 servings from one 500g pack. How far will 500g mince go? Protein is of the utmost importance in our diet, we all need it in some way, shape or form and, for many of us, meat is the main source, along with the likes of eggs and dairy products. But did you know that a handful of mushrooms served with broccoli and corn can also make up a portion of protein while also representing part of our 5-a-day recommended vegetable portions? That's worth knowing when looking out for bargains in your local supermarket, especially as each of those items can be frozen. In the case of Scotch pies, we normally opt for serving them topped with baked beans or peas. Foter.com / CC BY-SAToday, I have had a quick rummage through the kitchen cupboard of stock-piled bargain buys and am now cooking up a batch of 'Nile' mince to see how far it will go in pie making. I have listed ingredients at current supermarket prices, although all were bought on offer when I stocked up with mine, so cost me less.Ingredients for Frugaldom Scotch Pie Filling 500g lean beef mince - £3.50100g diced onions - 10pBeef stock - 15p50g Granose soya mince - 50p75g basic sage and onion stuffing - 15p50g plain cous cous - 10pGround black pepper and salt - 5p250g rolled oats - 19p Total amount = £4.74 Once cooked and simmered down, this is enough to fill 24 Frugaldom-style Scotch pies but, of course, we aren't actually feeding 24 people, so I'll make quarter for lunches and freeze the remainder for future pie-making. (You can freeze the pie filling on its own or make and freeze the complete pies.)Traditionally, Scotch pies were made from cheap cuts of mutton, but a mince meat pie is a mince meat pie... see what's available to you at the best price, as mutton is seldom a supermarket option. Scotch Pie Pastry (per 6 pie cases) 250g plain flour - 10p85g lard - 13p115ml warm water - freepinch of salt - negligibleSplash of milk for glazing when baking - negligibleTotal amount = 23p (92p for 24 pastry cases) The trick with this pastry is to work it warm, unlike short crust. Warm the bowl, melt the lard in hot water before adding the flour and salt. If possible, try not to allow the pastry to get cold while making the pie cases. You want your cases to measure between 8 and 10cm in diameter and at least 3cm in depth. Roll out each circle of pastry individually and use a tin, ramekin dish or even the bottom of a wide jar to shape the pie case around it. Leave them to cool before filling them, this way they should retain their shape.Cut a flat lid for the top of each case, remembering to cut a hole in the middle to allow steam to escape while cooking. If you are fortunate enough to have individual pie cases, it makes the job a whole lot easier, but these pies are for enjoying, they aren't for decorative use, so imperfections simply add to the home baked appeal of them. Improvise wherever possible.Scoop a rounded tablespoon of the meat mix into each pie case, enough to make it about two thirds full. The filling should be almost thick enough to pick up and make into patties, which some people do, by adding breadcrumbs.  Add a top to each, pushing it down and pinching around the edge to allow about 1cm of a lip around the top of the pastry case - once cooked, this is where the mash, peas or beans sit. Give the tops a quick brush with milk or egg - again, this is optional - and then bake in a pre-heated oven as you would any other pie. I used my mini oven at 200C and baked for about 25 minutes.Overall, it would cost £5.66 for ingredients to make 24 pies when using prime steak mince - less than 25p per pie/person. This could be greatly reduced by cooking with cheaper ingredients, so don't be scared to mix and match while pie-making.In all honesty, a Scotch pie is seen by many as leftovers baked in pastry. Leftover mince or stew mixed with porridge (we cook ours with water and salt), plus the remains of the daily bread made into crumbs. Once mixed together, seasoned with pepper and baked in a pie case, it's anyone's guess what meal should be served (or has been included) when Scotch Pies are on the menu. I've even known people to eat them cold for breakfast!I'll need to return to this post to add more photos because today's pie got scoffed under half a tin of baked beans before I remembered that I was supposed to take a photograph. Sorry 'bout that' :)Some useful links from Wikipedia:What is a Scotch pie?Hot water crust pastryMeat piesHappy pie making, frugalers. They're a cheap, cheerful and nutritious way of using up leftovers and better still, they can be savoury or sweet.NYK Media, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Clearing Your Debts - Where to Start", "date": "Tuesday 29 October 2013", "text": "We might be broke but we shouldn’t be broken! What is best for you and your money? Is it a self-imposed debt repayment challenge or would, perhaps, employing the services of a debt consolidation expert help you more? … In my opinion, the best place to start with clearing debts is to understand how you got into debt in the first place and take a long, painful look at exactly how much debt you have accrued. This is where many fail to get out the starting gate, as the full realisation is one filled with such horror that the 'head in the sand' approach seems the easiest option. Easy it may be, but pain free it is not. For every day debt it is ignored, that debt can grow. Much better to stop it now and send it marching back to wherever it came from in the first place. Better late than never, as they say… … Only by seeing, understanding and accepting your own financial state of affairs can you take charge of the situation and begin bringing it all under control.

{"title": "These Cheap Boots were made for Frugal Walking", "date": "Monday 28 October 2013", "text": "A photo diary about walking and frugal footwear!  Farewell to my faithful, frugal foot-friends! My annual challenge budget for clothing and footwear normally comes in at under the £100 mark and this needs to include everything, so it helps to know where savings can be made when footwear is important. This fun and photo-filled blog post is the tale of my old boots and the many miles they have trudged over the past year, showing without a shadow of a doubt that you can, indeed, get plenty of mileage from just a few pounds. In fact, looking back at this, I think I should award ‘Regatta Outlet’ the Frugaldom badge of excellence. This is not a sponsored post, this is simply a look back over how well my frugal footwear has served me and I hope that it helps others in making decisions about taking up walking as a hobby rather than sitting it out because you don’t have the right shoes or boots.

Why do so many quake in their shoes when they suddenly realise that they are heading into debt or, worse still, sinking further into debt, and scratch their heads in disbelief at today's prices? This blog post came about after a recent (animated) discussion about the cost of living in today's modern British society. The other person failed to distinguish the difference between the cost of living and the cost of their personal lifestyle. (In my opinion, food, fuel and energy waste seem to play big parts in their lifestyle.) Why do we see such ridiculous food waste in Britain when there are countries across Africa and Asia still susceptible to famine? On more than one occasion, I have been told that if it concerns me so much then I should go post the waste food to the starving people. This attitude makes my blood boil! …  I set myself the challenge to spend no more than £1 per person per day for all meals and I have stuck with this for the past several years… What I have learned is…  Read more here and try out the free meal planner to ensure you get your 5-a-say even on a frugal budget."},

Whether you are trying to cut costs, reduce waste or generally make a difference to your diet, there is bound to be a forum topic to suit your needs.  From edible flowers to hand made chocolates – food is a fantastic subject and we would love you to join us in the forums discussing how to get the most for your money when feeding a family on a small budget. Now that we are into porridge, soup and hot puddings time of year, we can start experimenting with simple ingredients and cost out the ingredients while also looking at cooking costs. With the utilities companies already bumping up the prices of electricity and gas yet again, now is a great time to join us in the battle to beat the home budget, be it in energy, food or general household shopping. How many meals can you make from a single chicken? How many meals can you make from a pack of mince? Could you feed your family on £1 per person per day for all meals and still afford the toiletries, laundry and cleaning products in that tight a budget? Do you forage for fruit and berries to make your own jams and jellies? Have you ever tried cooking with cucumbers? Can you bake a loaf of bread for 25p? Would you like some soup recipes? Can you make your garden (or other growing space) produce basic ingredients that could become a meal? Have you baked cakes from courgettes? How do you make your pickle and/or relish?

{"title": "Big Adventures on a Small Budget", "date": "Tuesday 22 October 2013", "text": "Frugal Gran Fun on our Budget Scottish Adventure!(Part 1 of this post can be found here, where I first announced plans for some big adventures with eldest grand daughter.)October school holidays arrived at last and I was able to pack the tent and rucksacks then head off into the wilderness with my 9-year-old grand daughter, taking her on her first ever frugal adventure - to 'climb a mountain'. We headed for Stranraer, boarding the train for Glasgow and taking many photographs along the way.  It cost a grand total of £26 for the two of us to get into the big city (Glasgow) and then a further £5 to get us from there to our destination in Lanarkshire, where we were planning to hill walk.Along the way, we saw Ailsa Craig. This is a small island about 10 miles off the coast and is known locally as 'Paddy's Milestone'. It's part of an extinct volcano where they used to (and possibly will again) mine granite for making curling stones. At the moment, it is a bird sanctuary that you can visit by boat from Girvan. It's also for sale, if anyone has a cool £1.5 million to spare. ﻿Once we reached Glasgow Central Station, we walked to Buchanan Bus Station to catch the express coach to our destination in Lanarkshire. We passed a puppeteer putting on a free street display, we stopped to see a student demonstration against Monsanto and we stopped to enjoy a free performance by this  fantastic pipes and drums band known as Clanadonia. Grand daughter wasn't overly enthusiastic about their music until I told her the name of one of their songs - 'Hamster heid'. (You can listen to Hamster Heid here.) I think the combination of bagpipes and tribal drums is brilliant! Free open air concerts - how frugal is that in the entertainment stakes? We arrived in Lanarkshire at dinnertime on Saturday after travelling for about 6 hours. We spent Sunday catching up with family and then, on the Monday, we headed off to Black Law wind farm, near Forth. There are over 50 huge turbines, each measuring over 125m in height. We took a picnic and had that while seated under turbine number 43. From the wind farm, we were able to see that there was no snow on the top of Tinto Hill, our next destination. Unfortunately, we got absolutely soaked when a huge rain cloud arrived and burst over our heads! A curious find we made last year had to be checked out again and, sure enough, it remains to this day - a massive pine tree decorated with Christmas baubles! It sits by the edge of the forest that runs along the main road from Black Law to what's known as 'The Headless Cross'.  Tuesday dawned fairly dry, so we packed our rucksacks and headed through Lanark towards Thankerton and Tinto Hill. The summit of this hill is the highest point in central Scotland, at 711m or 2,332ft. It's a 5-mile walk from the car park and a perfect introduction for anyone interested in hill walking. On arrival, we couldn't see the top for low clouds!  Fortunately, the rain stayed away for the couple of hours it took us to walk to the top and back. It took us approximately two and a half hours to complete, walking at what I would call an easy pace, stopping for littlest member of our group to eat sweets, add or remove layers of clothing as required and check out the landscape while looking for all sorts of weird and wonderful beings! Visibility was very poor from about the halfway mark, so it made for an eerie first hill-walking experience for grand daughter. She did seem to enjoy it, though. The cairn at the top of Tinto dates back to the Iron Age and is the largest cairn in Scotland. We could just make it out before we reached the rocky scree and, although we had passed several other walkers, we found ourselves alone at the top. Like all good visitors to the site, we carried our pebbles to the summit to add to the pile. On a clear day you can see for miles and pick out many of the other Scottish peaks but we didn't get a clear day - maybe next time. We left our pebbles, on which we had written our names and the date, on the cairn. As you can see, 9-year-olds aren't very tall compared to the summit décor and the view was non-existent, but we made it! Hats and gloves were soaked by the swirling fog, grand daughter had to cling on for all she was worth to stay upright in the wind that blasted the summit and the place was deserted. Not quite a day for picnics, but it didn't stop us from scoffing what we had with us.  As we descended from the clouds we managed to catch a glimpse of the views lower down the slope. Despite the lack of sunshine we still had a sing and dance on our trip back down. Indeed, we jogged the final leg of our journey while singing all sorts of silly songs, pretending to be on exercise like army recruits!Our next port of call was the Carmichael visitor centre, where we went in for a late lunch. We also had a trip around the little animal park, meeting the hens, goats, pigs and a lovely Sebastopol 'furry' goose, among other creatures. Then it was time to explore their waxwork museum!It's quite a scary place, especially when you get further in to the part with Sawney Beane and family, displayed in all their gory glory! Entry to the waxwork exhibitions is free, although we did drop a donation into their collection tin. (But who is Sawney Beane, you might ask?)Alexander Bean (or Sawney) was an infamous Scottish cannibal said to have originated from East Lothian in the 15th Century. He lived with his wife and extended family in a cave at Bennane Head, between Girvan and Ballantrae on the Ayrshire/Galloway coast. We pass through the area when travelling between here and Lanarkshire but I haven't, yet, taken the time to go in search of the gruesome cave.After all the excitement of wind farms, mountains and waxworks, we had a surprise birthday party to throw, so we got ourselves some modelling balloons and had fun making balloon animals, designing cards, decorating a room and then enjoying all the party fare. Next on the agenda was a crafting and making day, when we did knitting, crochet, weaving, needle point and pompom making. After that we had a shopping day and then, on the day before our holiday ended, we carved a pumpkin.Lighting the pumpkin lantern marked the end of our first big, fun-filled, frugal adventure. Everything got packed up and we now need to wait until next year to do it all over again, but in a different location.I hope you enjoyed sharing our frugal mini-adventure.NYK Media, Frugaldom﻿"},

However it’s done, saving up is a very smart thing to do. Even setting aside as little as, say, £50 a month can add up over time, leaving you a sizeable pot of money to enjoy once you’re ready to call it a day at work. Saving alone is smart, but it’s even smarter to find the right account to maximise what you have decided to leave until later on in life. The right savings account could mean that you make a sizeable amount in interest, which means yet more money to play with once you’re ready to use your money. However, as most savings accounts are pegged to the base rate from the Bank of England (which is just 0.5% at the moment), it’s hard to find some that offer genuine value for money… read more"},

The crew and passengers on board ‘Octavius’ had all perished and the dear old Captain was still seated at his desk, writing his final blog! The last entry was dated 1762! This ghost ship had been sailing the frozen seas for 13 years!It would appear that everyone on board ‘Octavius’ had frozen to death, unable to afford any heating, unable to knit or recycle anything into warm clothing, unable to feed themselves by way of not knowing how to rotate stock, preserve and keep their larders, pantries and stores filled. They were basically unable to sustain themselves against all nature and life had to throw at them. Money, after all, cannot buy life itself.Our October frugal living challenge is about keeping our ships afloat. I love the sketch of ‘Octavius’! It adequately represents the length some people will go to enslave themselves to money when there are so many other things that money can never buy. We sail in pursuit of happiness, contentment and an enriched lifestyle. Money isn’t the be all and end all of life – knowing when to abandon a sinking ship and encouraging others to help save themselves is the best we can hope to do in the worst situations.So… let’s all help keep the boats afloat this October, in memory of the ghost ship ‘Octavius’. Legend has it that they only perished because the Captain was taking short cuts and planning to reach the unreachable without due consideration for the unexpected. But the unexpected is almost always what catches us out in the end. Be prepared… the financial seas can get rough during the winter months and we need to be prepared to ride out any storms.Join us HERE to take part in our October frugal living challenge, your captain for this month’s voyage of discovery will be Octavius FrugalusFrugal Homemade Laundry and Cleaning ProductsFrugal living in the country means no mains sewers, sometimes no mains water and certainly no ‘nipping to the shop’ to buy an individual item if you run out of it, so we need ways of combating such problems, should they arise.Washing Soda is our friend! First and foremost, it is suitable for use in septic tanks, which is where all the flushed or drained waste goes from a rural property. It should certainly make you think about what you flush down the toilet or tip down the plug holes if you aren’t used to dealing with your own waste – there are no sewers in the rural countryside! I am stunned by how many relocation households from town to country aren’t aware of this fact and go willy-nilly with all sorts of cleaning and laundry products, fancy bubble baths and bleach products. It’s quite shocking that they abuse our waterways in this fashion.Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own waste and, when relying on a septic tank, you are relying on the liquid (water) by product draining into the ground, into the local steams and rivers and then into the sea. Those of us with any sense, decency and respect for the environment will look after our septic tanks and be wary of what goes in there.Washing soda is septic tank friendly in that it isn’t contaminating your personal sewage treatment plant with toxic chemicals which, ultimately, may end up in the waterways. Washing soda is also cheap, at around £1 per kilo (at time of writing). It’s a giant leap forward in the frugal living stakes knowing what it can do. The back of any pack makes for a great place to begin your own research.Washing up liquid and laundry cleaner are two uses for soda crystals and by making your own, you can save a small fortune over the year. This is how I make mine…LAUNDRY 'GLOOP'1 bar of soap, grated1 cup of washing soda (or Soda crystals)1 litre waterA few drops of essential oil (if required)Boil the water, dissolve the soda crystals and soap in it, add the fragrance and then dilute to at least 5 litres if you don't want your liquid to set. Personally, I prefer to allow it to set then dissolve it one part cleaner to five parts water, then add to machine. For speed, dilute it, but for spacesaving, store in a wide neck container or bucket and dilute as required.You can store this in whichever plastic bottles or buckets you prefer. 5 litre vinegar containers with wide screwtop lids are ideal, but a lidded bucket is betterI make 2 lots, one has a few drops of blue dye in it to help 'whiten' whites.Washing soda is suitable for use with septic tanks, which is what I most like about it! Rural living means no mains sewage connections, so all flushed or drained waste has to go into a tank. Abusing your septic tank can have far-reaching consequences, as many a newcomer to the country has found out at their expense and humiliation.FRUGAL TIP: I've been using this diluted to up to 7 litres and it works really well. I use the 'natural extracts' soap, which is a natural, antibacterial vegetable soap with tea tree & lavender extracts, so no need to add in extra essential oil unless you prefer a stronger scent.Washing soda is one of the basic 'staples' of a frugal household kitchen cupboard. This, along with lemon juice and vinegar are excellent for so many things. Some people also keep *Borax and Epsom Salts in their store cupboards.WASHING UP LIQUIDHeaped tbsp grated soap (Natural, not heavily scented)Heaped tbsp soda crystals1 tbsp vinegar1 tbsp lemon juice3 litres waterA few drops essential oil (tea tree and lavender)Make up exactly the same as for laundry gloop.Please note that this will NOT lather up like ordinary washing up liquid. The mass produced liquid is chemically enhanced in the commercial product to create those soapy bubbles. I used 'Natural soap with lavender and teatree' soap. It's about 35p per bar, but it grates to give 8 heaped tablespoons.You can use vinegar as a fabric softener.I use same quantities of above that I would if using the shop-bought equivalents.Another option is soapnuts instead of washing liquid or laundry detergent. See http://www.inasoapnutshell.com/ for free sample (just pay postage) and for more information.The following is part of an old blog post from Frugaltips.org (American site)How to Make Your Own Cleaning Products By Frugal 101For kitchen and bathroom floors you need a mixture of 1 gallon of hot water with cup of white vinegar. The mixture is safe for hardwood, linoleum, tile, and pretty much every washable surface. You can also use this to clean your entire bathroom, not only floors.To make your own dishwasher liquid use water with lemon juice. All you need is cup of lemon juice and cup of warm water.To make a disinfectant spray mix a cup of borax with 1 gallon of hot water.To clean your windows use a mixture of 1 cup of water, 1 cup of rubbing alcohol, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.For cleaning kitchen cabinets use a mixture of cup lemon juice dissolved in 1 gallon of hot water.Toilet bowl cleaner can be made by mixing cup of baking soda with 1 cup of vinegar. Let it sit for 10 minutes or so, and scrub it with brush.Making these products doesnt require a degree in Chemistry. You will not only get the unnecessary chemicals and toxins out of your house, but save quite a bit of money.============Bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and washing soda (or crystals) are available in local stores and supermarkets. Borax is available on Amazon if you can't find it anywhere else.============I have been asked several times about why I don't use Borax. There are a couple of reasons:1. I have never needed it, even if it was available locally, which it doesn't seem to be.2. Despite Borax allegedly being as safe as table salt to handle, it is now listed in the Substances of Very High Concern list and has been reclassified as Hazard class Re-protoxic, Category 1B. Any product that contains above a particular % concentration of borax (about 4-8%) should display the warning \"May damage fertility and May cause harm to the unborn child.\""},
{"title": "Doing the Monster Mash with Autumn Root Veg", "date": "Wednesday 25 September 2013", "text": "Oh, Sweet Potato, you are HUGE!Frugal food is in abundance at this time of year and my fresh egg supplies are, thankfully, still plentiful. Duck eggs, hen eggs, bantam eggs, quail eggs... not to mention the glut of cucumbers I'm still harvesting, plus apples, berries and plums. So much for so little and all there for the picking to help keep the grocery budget to a minimum. Here in Frugaldom, we seldom sell eggs. It's more a case of giving them away and welcoming all sorts of gifts in return - home baking, greenhouse produce, garden produce, even furniture or DIY items that neighbours no longer require; I'll trade for anything useful! Today's egg deliveries have been done: I set off with my supplies and came home with carrots, onion and sweet potatoes to add to the potatoes, squash, marrow, beans and lemon drizzle cake from last week's exchanges. I love this way of life, it's just so money savvy in a waste not, want not sort of way. Today's sweet potatoes are absolutely massive! What does a frugal living person do with their root veg and squash? We do the monster mash!  Big pot of water on the hot plate and then let's start peeling... a few potatoes, a few carrots, a huge sweet potato and then, finally, the last of the squash. I don't salt the water to boil these and there's a very special reason why - chicken stock! My feathered livestock like this over their breakfast. Once all the vegetables are cooked through, I simply drain off the water into a bucket and it gets kept for using in the garden, the poultry feed or else into the stock pot to make soup. Zero waste. Brightly coloured monster mash can be made using most types of root vegetables, it's not just the preserve of potatoes, turnips and swede. I season them accordingly with salt and pepper, add a knob of butter or margarine, a splash of milk and then get mashing. Any surplus can be frozen, but I add some powdered milk to that before splitting it up into empty margarine tubs, it seems to help prevent the mash from going watery when it thaws. This autumn coloured monster mash makes for a very orange dinner and I normally serve mine with vegetable-laden stew. The veggie mash is much more nutritious than simple mashed potatoes. Not content with my autumnal coloured main meal, there's still the glut of apples to deal with, so crumbles galore! Add a bit of colour (and a few extra vitamins) by including a handful of stewed berries or a tablespoonful of homemade hedgerow jelly, which is what I did here. I do like my food to be colourful!  This crumble was made using wholemeal flour mixed with the sesame and sunflower seed bread flour. We seem to have a real-life micro community here, based on a few neighbours who can see past the 'frugal living' eccentricities and see the lifestyle for what it really is - a caring and sharing one that doesn't like waste. Not only did I return home with my bag of vegetables, I was also given 2 small bolster cushions that I can recover and a bag of wool oddments. What a superb day's trading it has been in Frugaldom and not a penny spent. Right, I'm off to finish making my free Velux blind so I can get part 2 of that blog post done. Hopefully, the blind will be completed tonight and hanging in the window by bedtime. NYK, Frugaldom."},

The fact that I             don't own a dog never entered my head! Read more... NYK Media, FrugaldomBeware! Rant about Power Company!I live in a lovely little rural street. We aren't on a bus route, I don't have a car and the nearest shop and post office are about 7 miles round trip on foot or by bicycle, which I don't mind when it suits me and the weather is fine. But here's the problem - we bought this fixy-up house complete with power supply by ScottishPower pre-payment meter. After resolving all the issues of replacing old wires, fuse boxes, sockets and switches, we could do no more - the main source of power and meter are the responsibility of the power supply company. But what do you do when said power company refuses to replace the meter for free when asked? We must pay to have it changed from pre-payment to standard metering system. Not a problem, we'll make do until they come along and do the compulsory change to Smart Meters - seeing as our Government has decided it's for the best that every household in Britain has a Smart meter fitted. I'm certainly not paying to replace the old prepayment meter with a standard one only to have it replaced again within a year or two. But this still means topping up the existing meter with credit. Normally, this would be a straightforward thing to do, just take the electronic key to your local store or post office and hand it over along with some cash. But what if you don't have a local store or post office? We had to give up our car late last year, it was scrapped and we aren't in a financial position to throw money at a replacement. So, what of the electricity meter top-ups now? What if you can't drive, walk or cycle the 7 miles and what if there is no public transport? It's OK for me to walk or cycle in good weather but it can be very hazardous walking along narrow, twisting roads and then along the main shore road, which has rough verges and no foot paths, during bad weather! Solution - invest in a computer module that allows you to top up your meter online. Great! Here it is! The super duper Scottish Power 'In Home' pay as you go PowerPod, which you need to pay for the privilege of being able to pay your electricity! So, we forked out the £13.99 for said gadget - much cheaper than the £65 or whatever they asked for to replace the meter. Problem solved! Except, my computer, along with probably thousands of others, gets automatic updates to Internet Explorer - the ONLY browser that is compatible with ScottishPower's wonderful PowerPod. Result - the pod is no longer compatible with the latest browser updates. It's pretty much been £13.99 down the drain unless I can resolve this problem. I am not technically minded nor do I know any computer tech people who will resolve the issues for free. I know, ask Scottish Power what to do about it...  Suffice to say, since making two different attempts at asking Scottish Power for their help in this matter, I have come to the conclusion that this is an issue for Consumer Watchdog. It feels like I'm being held to ransom by Scottish Power - I pay extra for the 'privilege' of having a ridiculously expensive pre-payment meter, I pay extra for the 'privilege' of having a, 'In Home' prepayment system that DOESN'T WORK, I pay extra by way of having to travel 7 miles every time I want to top up my meter, and I hav the option to pay even more for the 'privilege' of being changed to a normal electricity meter that will then need to be changed yet again when the Smart meters are introduced, which, by the way, we are all going to be charged for when they get here.  I apologise for my ranty post today but this really has got to me again, it is a clear-cut case of punching the little people in the guts and forcing us to pay at least 25% more for out power than those folks who can afford not to care how much energy their households burn. The more I try to cut down on energy use, the higher each unit becomes! If I cut to the barest minimum of, say, 5 kWh units of electricity per day, each unit would cost me about 19pIf I use 10 units each day, each unit would cost me about 16p which is roughly what I am paying, as we are entirely reliant on electricity for everything at the moment.If I heat the house to the Government's recommendations to avoid fuel poverty and provide us with daily hot water, I would need to burn at least 75 units per day during winter, a whopping great £70 a week, but those units would cost me about 13p each.Where is the fairness in this system? As reward for trying to use as little electricity as possible, wrapping up in extra blankets at night, wearing extra clothes by day, collecting sticks for burning and doing without the luxury of warm rooms and hot water, we get charged over 30% more than those who don't care! And worse still, no allowances are ever made for how far north anyone lives. I know how much colder it is here to the south coast of England, I know what it cost to heat a previous house in the north eastern corner of Scotland. So please, can someone give me an answer to my question... Why are rural dwelling, frugal living households who care about good health, lifestyle and the environment in which they live?"},
{"title": "Do You Ever Get the Urge?", "date": "Monday 9 September 2013", "text": "Amidst Chaos You Can Find Calm FrugalityIt's been raining for the past few days but it hasn't halted progress here in Frugaldom. We now have a larger pile of logs sitting at the back door awaiting sawing and chopping, but I keep getting the urge to do something a little bit different. So I did! The bargain poly-tunnel was recently moved into it's permanent position and I'm going to leave it built up over winter, hoping it is sheltered enough to withstand any gales or snow storms we may encounter between now and next spring. There's nothing planted inside it at the moment, just three old fish crates with the surplus cucumber plants that didn't fit in the little greenhouse. So, I set up my wooden airer and have been drying off some laundry inside the tunnel. This not using mains electricity for laundry is becoming a fun habit, but I digress... back to the log pile! At 3m long, these logs are screaming out to be turned into path edging going down through my slowly emerging permacultured garden. What better way to edge paths than with logs?  I don't know about you, but I love natural wood. This is cheap and cheerful wood, cut locally from sustainable, commercially managed forest. These are like the treetops after they are felled and the trunks cut to length and hauled off to the yards. The forestry commission here sells these logs for £22 per tonne. We went as far as weighing the logs and they weighed between 20kg and 25kg each. There were 44 logs in total, which got shared between neighbour and ourselves, plus we split the transport costs, so it totalled £20 for 22 logs - that's not even £1 for a 3m log!  The above is the first of the logs being laid alongside the length of path that was uncovered, from hereon in it's a case of digging, laying in some weed control (probably a recycled building merchant tote bag) and then getting some woodchips or gravel laid. Suffice to say, I can't wait to see the end result, even although I know it's going to take months. These are very rustic path edgings, but could also become raised bed surrounds and who knows all what else - I'm thinking bird hide at the bottom of the garden near the stream, as its a great place for photographing the wildlife. Cutting this post short as it's just gone 9pm and I have just received a rather interesting looking delivery by courier. Exciting, or what? NYK in Frugaldom.Edited in - Huge excitement here, as the late night delivery is the 'Twister' washing machine that's up for grabs in our free competition draw for those taking part in our Septimus Frugalus Challenge! Better still, it has arrived with a few other Ventus freebies for me to try! Excellent!"},
{"title": "40 Tips for September, the Month of Zero Waste.", "date": "Friday 6 September 2013", "text": "Don't Slip up on the Road to FrugaldomAs you know, we launched our 'Septimus Frugalus Challenge' on the 1st September and we are having a full month of waste not, want not in an effort to encourage a few others to join us in our quest for a frugal lifestyle. It's not just about zero waste on food, it's about zero waste on money.So far, we have had over 50 willing volunteers opt-in to take part in reducing their household budgets and minimising their waste in an attempt to save. (It's not too late to join us.) Here are a few of the more basic hints, tips and suggestions shared in the frugal forums:Cooking and baking from scratch helps avoid waste packaging.Take your own bags when shopping.Keep meals simple to use up what's in stock and make meals from leftovers.Get creative - make meals from garden produce, no matter what the combination.Preserve whatever fruit and veg you can, be it jam making, pickling, drying or freezing.Make a list, like a food inventory, for meal planning and shopping.Make a stew with whatever is lurking in your fridge, add some dumplings to bulk it out into a family meal if you need to make it stretch further. Compost whatever can be composted if it can't be eaten or fed to livestock.Portion control, measuring ingredients to ensure there's no waste.Trade your surplus among friends and neighbours - this can be anything from food to furniture to save it from being binned.Hair can be composted, if you are saving money by doing the haircuts at home, compost the clippings.Use a wire brush or re-useable steel wool instead of buying sandpaper for sanding old woodwork.Use a cloth for mopping up spills, rather than disposable wipes or kitchen roll.Avoid the use of disposable anything if it's practical, for that matter.Save old clothing, sheets, towels etc. for turning into other things - many frugalers enjoy quilting, dressmaking and crafting. If you aren't one of them, donate the clothing to charity, the recycle collection points or someone you know who can use the fabric in some way, shape or form. Leftover bread can be toasted or made into bread and butter pudding or crumbed and frozen for dressing things like fish cakes, scotch eggs, potato croquettes etc.Leftover cake (never in this house) can be crumbed for using as a topping over fruit crumbles or else sliced and used as the bottom layer of a trifle.Chipped, bashed or bruised fruit can be stewed, brewed, made into jam or used in fruit puddings.Many vegetables can be baked into cakes. Surplus at this time of year may be courgettes or root veg such as carrots or beetroot. Our courgette cake ideas are here.Get creative with broken 'stuff', even if it means posting a picture online to ask fellow frugalers for ideas about how to recycle or upcycle the item. A thin plank and a length of wood can soon become a shelf, a few broken tiles can become a mosaic, some laddered tights or holey leggings can become onion hangers or draught excluders, a couple of empty tubs can become storage containers, an odd assortment of paints can create a whole new colour etc.A freezer rummage can often find forgotten meat or fish products lurking at the bottom - so long as these were fresh when frozen and don't look or smell bad, why not cook up your own pet food and then refreeze in tin-sized portions? I bulk mine out using rice and vegetables - notes regarding how I make this can be found here.Nile Mince - batch cook mince to stretch into several meals to help use up leftovers and get more meals for your moneyStretching chicken - some call it rubber chicken, as one bird can feed a family for a full week or longer if you freeze the resulting meals and make stock for soup.Soup for every day of the year - it is one of the easiest things to make and can be made from almost anything savoury. You can even boil up your scrubbed veg peelings and peapods to make a vegetable stock. If they are no good for stock, boil them and feed them to your garden livestock.Recycle all your envelopes and packaging, even when sending to official addresses. I simply cover over the label with a scrap of paper and add a new stamp. (Inland Revenue offices have never complained, so why would anyone else?)If you need to buy them, recycle your plastic drinks & milk bottles into mini-cloches, plant pots, tubs, funnels, pencil holders, storage containers, bird feeders, even greenhouses! The milk cartons can be cut to make great measuring scoops.Plastic trays can be used for many things, including seed trays, freezer trays, bird baths etc.Greetings cards, calendars, wrapping paper etc. that can't be reused can be turned into postcards, gift tags, book marks, card embellishments, labels, decoupage or artwork of many other descriptions. My pictures hanging on my sitting room wall are made from the end off my wall paper - how much more colour co-ordinated than that can you get?Old woollen wear can be unravelled and reknitted or crocheted. It can be turned into blankets, used in crafting or, at worst, used as stuffing for all those draught excluders you're making this winter.Polystyrene packaging peanuts are great insulators as well as great for protecting breakables through the post. Save them for making bean bags or for making your very own hot pot, slow cooker or cool box.Cut open tubes of toothpaste or cream etc. to get at the last of it and be amazed by how much you still have to use. Worse, be shocked at how much you almost threw away in the first place.Make yourself up a 'crafty kit' for saving useful things like buttons, hooks, elastic and anything else that can be salvaged from what would otherwise have gone in the bin. I tend to throw all these sorts of things into a drawer then sort them out into margarine tubs.Fleece! We all love the stuff - whether it's an old blanket, dressing gown or old fleece top. Whatever it is, it's great for making into curtain liners or thermal blinds for windows during winter months. Toilet roll and kitchen roll inner tubes can be turned into seed pots or stuffed to make kindling for the fire or stove, if you have one. They also make great inners for homemade Christmas crackers, can be turned into 3-D artwork or saved for building into any manner of game, if you have the space. Did anyone else used to add one to their hamster cage as a tunnel? Seeds from tomatoes and peppers etc. can be kept, dried and sown to grow into more tomatoes and peppers. It doesn't always work but I've had some good successes in the past.Don't bin that old quilt! Cut it open, remove the filling and give it a freshen up to keep as stuffing. If you can't use it, give it to someone who can. If you want to wash it first, tie it inside a pillow slip and pop it into a cool cycle of the washing machine.Burning candles? Save all the ends to melt down into firelighters for anyone you know who can use them, or else use for new candles. Likewise with the ends of soap - save these and make them into new bars of soap or for grating and storing as an ingredient for your homemade laundry cleaner.Eggshells can be washed and dried, baked in the bottom of the oven while it's cooling after cooking dinner, then the shells can be crushed and used in the garden around plants to help deter slugs and snails.Be a bin raider - raid your own bins to make sure everything in there really needs to be there or if you can get creative and use it for something else.The most obvious choice for most people - make full use of local recycling opportunities - many supermarkets collect old batteries, companies pay for old mobile phones or electrical components, broken down white goods may contain working parts that can be reused or carry some scrap value... think before you bin anything, no matter how insignificant the item may seem to you. A penny saved is a penny earned, so the less waste, the better.This list is by no means exhaustive, it is just a few of the more obvious practices you can employ around your home. Teaching children not to drop litter is probably one of the top tips I can recommend, but it dismays me to see how adults think nothing of flicking rubbish out car windows or dumping full bags of rubbish that may well be worth something to someone in need. We are fast approaching the time of year where many parents tackle the annual clear out of 'stuff' no longer perceived as being needed or wanted simply in preparation for the next big invasion of Christmas gifts... no offence meant, but I can see nothing Christian-like in such actions and sincerely hope that all the frugaldom readers will think twice about how they can rehome any surplus or better still, teaching kids that toys don't expire after a year no matter what others might say.Mantra for frugalers:'Just because I don't need/want/use it doesn't mean someone else won't need/want/use it.'"},
{"title": "The Firewood Poem - Full of Helpful Hints for Winter Warmth", "date": "Thursday 5 September 2013", "text": "The Firewood PoemAs far as my research shows, this poem was written by Celia Congreve and believed to have been first published in THE TIMES newspaper on March 2nd, 1930. It is as relevant to many of us now as is it was to readers then. Beechwood fires are bright and clear,If the logs are kept a year,Chestnut's only good they say,If for logs 'tis laid away.Make a fire of Elder tree,Death within your house will be;But ash new or ash old,Is fit for a queen with crown of goldBirch and fir logs burn too fast,Blaze up bright and do not last,It is by the Irish said,Hawthorn bakes the sweetest bread.Elm wood burns like churchyard mould,E'en the very flames are cold,But ash green or ash brown,Is fit for a queen with golden crown.Poplar gives a bitter smoke,Fills your eyes and makes you choke,Apple wood will scent your room,Pear wood smells like flowers in bloom.Oaken logs, if dry and old,Keep away the winter's cold,But ash wet or ash dry,A king shall warm his slippers by. What you should know about purchasing firewoodA Guest blogAs the winter season sets in, it’s time to start thinking about getting warm. Many people are now turning towards woodheaters to heat their homes as energy prices increase, but thosenew to wood burning may not know what timber is best for theirstove.  You can easily buy firewood from yards, like Firewood, but if you want to save some money and seek out your firewoodyourself, you are going to need to know what you are looking for.Here is a very brief selection of your best choices, for an easy burnand low smoke fireplace.   Apple trees aresomewhat easy to split and have a beautiful smell when they burn sothey are a good option, however not many people go out to burn appletrees. One of the more popular options is green and white Ash, aswell as Alder trees. These trees are easy to split, don’t smoke orspark very much and have only a slight fragrance, so they are theperfect option for seasonal firewood. A variety of Oak trees are alsoperfect for firewood as they have many of the same properties as theAsh and Alder trees. Look out for these species of trees when seekingout private sales of firewood, although when looking forkindling, most wood types will suit because they are only used toget a fire going and keep enough heat to get a log burning. With alittle bit of know how, you can have your homely and romanticfireplace or wood heater burning in no time, and without having tospend a bundle."},
{"title": "Frugal Living, the September Challenge and a Country Cottage to Let. Wow!", "date": "Tuesday 3 September 2013", "text": "Almost 50 Challengers Signed up Already!www.frugalforums.co.ukWhat a great start we have had to our September money-saver challenge - Septimus Frugalus is proud to have each and every one of you on board for the trip. This is also our very first free giveaway, so all challengers who participate will be short-listed for entry into the free draw to win their very own Ventus Twister. For anyone who hasn't entered, the company has provided us with a special half price discount code - simply include the word 'laundry' in the code box, recalculate and your washer/spinner will become half price in the Ventus Free Energy* shop. For me, this September challenge is a chance to refresh and rejuvenate my money-saving habits andgive myself a few reminders about how not to slip into old habits. With all the helpful hints shared, we soon realise how easily money, energy and food savings can be increased. Something as simple as bulking out the leftover stew and gravy with sausages and herby dumplings to create not two, but four more meals can save you from wasting even the last of the gravy.Stir frying any leftover vegetables, including cabbage, makes a highly nutritious addition to any meal, assuming you haven't drowned it all in oil or fat, and by cooking on my hot plate, I'm finding it more economical than using the mains electric cooker.Reminding myself to run the laptops on battery power until they absolutely must get recharged helps save a few pennies extra in electricity, especially with two of us working  from home fulltime. My Ventus Twister has saved me the expense of buying a new washing machine - giving me time to both save and to look out for the best available deal. Who knows how long I'll rely on the little 'Twister', as it's even coping with jeans!Out in the garden, when I'm looking about the place as I hang out the washing, I see potential everywhere for improving my money-saving. Since the massacre of the potato beds, we now have enough potatoes to last some weeks but we also have the knowledge that potato growing in this manner, for us, just isn't economically viable. We now have the area cleared and prepared for relocating the mini poly-tunnel. I am sure that the 6m x 2m space will be far more productive as covered growing space and the potatoes, if we decide to do any more, can be done in the tubs.The greenhouse is producing well - so well, in fact, that I am overrun with cucumbers. I also have plenty of tomatoes, if the sun keeps shining and they all ripen. Mealtimes are healthy and frugal at the moment. Porridge for breakfast, eggs for lunch and then dinner cooked from whatever is available. I restocked the freezer last month and I have been using up old flour stocks baking bread. The ends of the loaves are ideal for creating frugal pizzas or else something served with eggs and/or salad.So what tasty lunchtime snacks have I incorporated into the first three days of this frugal September challenge?Pan fried bread in egg with chopped tomato, spring onions and cheese ﻿ Cucumber and mint sorbet Open sandwiches with quail eggs and garden salad I also made mini-scotch eggs and served these with salad, but I forgot to photograph them - you can tell I'm not strictly a food blogger! :)  Regardless of how frugal we are, there still needs to be spending - we simply cannot live without spending cash on some things, postage being one of them. So, I packaged up some rooted cuttings from my herbs and these got posted off to a couple of fellow frugalers as part of our trading system. I have already received an assortment of plants and flower seeds, including my comfrey that is now looking fantastic in its corner of the garden. I'm simply paying the favours forward, as so many other bloggers do, and loving this fantastic system that really only came to the fore, for me, when I was 'love bombed' last Christmas by Frugal Queen and her readers. Oh, and I also ordered a super bargain DVD box set - pointed out to us all by Aril,thank you for that - with a saving of almost £15 on RRP. Now for the exciting news! To Let - Country Cottage for your Dream Lifestyle Frugal living is good. Rural living is good. The whole waste not, want not, make do and mend, reduce, reuse, recycle ethos in life is good. So, dear frugal friends, it is with the greatest of pleasure that I can offer you this world on a 6 month trial basis, if necessary.  This cottage belongs to a friend and fellow frugaler who is currently looking for a good, reliable tenant and is hoping to find a like-minded follower of the frugal living ilk. Here's what they have to say about this charming cottage, which sits within a few miles of all amenities despite being in a rural location. This is what said friend had to say:  Our cottage is about to come up for rent. I wondered if you would mind promoting it amongst your frugal community as it is on its way to being a self sufficient haven.It is a two bedroom, farm workers cottage, gorgeous views of the estuary and hills. Solar panels, all appliances electric, shower, electric under-sink hot water systems, efficient storage heaters. Thanks to the log burner downstairs the heaters only have to be on low in other rooms when it's very cold. Really well insulated, recently decorated throughout and re carpeted. Double glazed, 11mm thick carpet underlay to reduce cold rising.Outside: greenhouse, large cold frames, wood shed, compost bins, patio area and lots of room to grow vegetables, keep chickens etc. We left quinces, rhubarb and raspberries in the garden.We are looking for £375 a month rent, £375 deposit. We are flexible on length of agreement, minimum 6 months. (Normal tenancy agreement conditions would apply.) We are happy if people want to change garden around etc., and would love it to go to a self sufficient type couple/family. So there you have it, lovely frugal friends and readers, an invite to come and live the good life in rural southwest Scotland is a home that is already on its way to becoming someone's dream. The owners are frugal forum members and they do still live locally, so your landlords (fully registered) would be within easy contact distance, but have now moved on to a slightly bigger project.  If anyone is interested in this property, please get in contact. This cottage isn't on a bus route, nor is it an easy walk to shops, so having a car would be an advantage. (Cycling could be an option, we have some fabulous cycle routes in the area, as well as the Galloway Hills, the Forest Park and not forgetting the Dark Sky Park status.)  All amenities are within a few miles and it's only five minutes' drive off the main A75, close to Scotland's national book town of Wigtown. In the nearby town of Newton Stewart, there are supermarkets, cinema, swimming pool, banks etc, plus two coaches each day running between Belfast and London, so access to Carlisle, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London are all fairly simple. This could be a dream come true for someone. Is that someone YOU?"},
{"title": "16.5p per Person for Frugal Breakfast", "date": "Sunday 1 September 2013", "text": "Breakfast for 6 and Change from £1It's Scotland, it's September, it's a PORRIDGE BREAKFAST DAY!Porridge oats currently cost around 75p per kilo for the cheapest supermarket saver variety and one kilo will make you 20 portions. (We use 50g per serving). The recommended serving on many of the bags is 45g, so be ever vigilant regarding sudden, unannounced pack size changes, as 990g would be the obvious choice. I AM WATCHING FOR THAT! This is the Scottish way of making porridge, so I was rather horrified when I discovered, at the age of almost 40, I might add, that others elsewhere make this like milk pudding.Per person 1 x small cup (~50g)  of porridge oats 2.5 x small cups of water (or as required)Good pinch of salt I  cook mine in the microwave, it takes only about 6 minutes maximum, but this timing will depend on how  powerful your microwave is. Don't forget to stir the porridge halfway through and let it  stand for a minute before serving. Serve with a little milk and a sprinkle of  sugar, drizzle of honey, handful of fruit... whatever you prefer. Allowing 7.5p for the oats and 8p for the salt, milk and sugar, the food costs are minimal.My microwave is 700w. A 6-minute blast with this costs almost 1p, so the REAL cost of a bowl of  wholesome, homemade porridge is only 16.5p per personIf you have a handful of dried fruit with this, rather than sugar, you can easily add on  another 10p, so maybe best save the fruit for a mid-morning snack if your budget is tight. So there you have it: you can feed 6 people a warm and filling breakfast for less than £1.Would you pay £1 for a bowl of freshly made porridge? Or perhaps you already have, if you've paid 99p for one of those boil the kettle and 'just add boiling water' concoctions that the supermarkets now sell. (And they're only 48g including whatever additives they may use.) In the land of frugal living, healthy eating isn't about labels and packaging, it is about health, nutrition and basic home cooking.  How much did your breakfast cost this morning? Have fun taking part in the 'Septimus Frugalus' moneysaving challenge this month - find out all about it here or by going to http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org/about1347.html"},
{"title": "Septimus Frugalus #Nonspender Challenge and a Free Giveaway", "date": "Saturday 31 August 2013", "text": "Septimus Frugalus Welcomes You All to a Free Giveaway and a Fun, Frugal Challenge this September. As announced yesterday, our September moneysaving challenge over at www.frugalforums.co.uk is about one month of frugal living - some handy hints and tips for newcomers, a few refreshers for us old diehards and an invite to try out the lifestyle that we all love. So, without further ado, let's get ready to frugalise the household budget and earn ourselves a handsome ransom by releasing the captive pennies from the bonds of consumerism. Taking part in the challenge is completely free, you simply need to join us in the forum HERE and post to let me know to add your username to the list. All names on the list (barring my own) will be entered into our free giveaway. I was trying to think of some easy examples of frugalising your budget, but was soon provided with a couple just by reading some of the responses. Here are a couple of really straight forward suggestions:Newspapers offer discount coupons, such as £5 off a £30 shop at a particular supermarket, in the hope that we'll all dash out and spend £30 whether we need to or not. Why not use these vouchers to stock up on particular items that you would normally use throughout the year? For some items, £30 can be a full year's supply of stuff that doesn't go off - tins, dried goods, toiletries, laundry products, paper products, coffee, tea or discounted goods that can be frozen when you get home - and the free £5 could equate to a full year's supply of laundry cleaner, if you stock up on basic soap and washing soda. What you don't want to do is fall into the trap of spending the extra £5 on extras just because it seems to be free. If you must do this, I'd suggest you use the extra £5 for something that can be used as a gift for someone else - it's the £5 saved on Christmas or birthday gifts.So what if your cupboards are bare and your freezer almost empty? This challenge is about making every penny count, so challenge yourself to replenishing the stocks by bulk buying, looking for the very best deals - remember it's all about price per gram, kilo, ml or litre, not about how many in a pack - and always keep a good stock of basic essentials for baking and batch cooking. Be prepared to learn to love soup - it's one of the cheapest, most nutritious and cost effective meals there is in the frugal living menu stakes. (Likewise with porridge made the traditional Scottish way - with tap water.) You can make soup from almost anything. We have a thread about soup-making in the frugal forums and also several recipes included in this blog site. That's it - the start of a new way of life for some, extra fun for others and, along the way, a few little extras just to make it more interesting. Nobody needs to be a gourmet chef, nor should they need to live on takeaways and fast food, we'll be having cheap, easy to cook meals that anyone can manage on a budget and we'll be helping one another along the way. We'll make do, we'll mend, we'll recycle, make, bake and budget wisely. All going well, we should have spent less, achieved more and maybe even have a few pounds left over to put towards winter and some festive fun. Everyone is welcome to take part free at anytime, so bring yourself over to our 'Septimus Frugalus' challenge (http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org/about1347.html) and have yourself some money-saving fun.

{"title": "Septimus Frugalus - September's Non-Spender Challenge", "date": "Friday 30 August 2013", "text": "Monthly Challenges in FrugaldomThe names of the months confuse me, what with the 'Sept' meaning seven when its month nine, 'Oct' meaning eight when it's month ten and so on, but September is almost upon us and, whether we like it or not, it's month nine of twelve and we're fast heading into Autumn. You can feel a definite drop in the temperature here in Scotland, to the point that the thought of lighting the stove crossed my mind. Shame on me!  Now wearing my cardigan, I will continue, safe in the knowledge that no fuel was burned and no unnecessary spending occurred. This is what prompted me into launching this September non-spender 'game' here in Frugaldom, by introducing you to Septimus Frugalus. Septimus Frugalus is the epitome of money-saving; every penny is a prisoner and no matter what it is, if it's taking up space then it needs to either be growing, earning or contributing positively to the overall frugal lifestyle.  For the full month of September, we are going to do as the great Septimus Frugalus does - hold our  money hostage and clear out the deadwood that might otherwise be cluttering up the frugal living process. We're having a month-long spending challenge throughout September, based on not spending unless it is absolutely essential. Click to go to the challenge The main aim of this challenge involves a basic introduction (or refresher course) to frugal living and it should be of some help to our lovely new forum members and followers, in preparation for the 2014 Frugal Living Challenge. ﻿ Wastefulness is bad, in our frugal books, so the month of September is going to be a 30-day challenge to polish up our frugal skills. This will include assessing the contents of the kitchen, garden and/or food stocks every day in order to use up what is already there, rather than buying anything we don't actually need. It will mean cooking with ingredients we may not have thought of combining in the past. There'll be batch cooking, baking, making and mending plus several other more fun things to try while we prepare for what's coming next - winter and the festive season! The challenge thread can be found HERE in the frugal forums, please consider joining us and see just how much fun you can have frugalising your household running costs and saving yourself some money. The September challenge thread is now up and running, please find yourself a suitable username and let me know if you are taking part. All further details are available in the relevant section of the Frugal Forums. Good luck and have fun frugalising your household budget in September.Edited in: Just in case anyone can't see the above links, the web address to the challenge on the frugal forums is http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org/about1347.html'Now You Know'As you may know, we began life as ‘Now You Know’, hence the NYK, away back in 1998. A group of us got together to try and beat the budget and try to afford to build businesses, create comfortable homes and generally live a good life that would lead us safely out of debt. Along the way, many fell off the wagon. In fact, if I’m perfectly honest, the current day group of frugal living challengers includes not a single one of the original group, although there are still a couple of them on the side lines who are still battling on bravely to keep their heads above water. ‘Now You Know’ began as an online newsletter and then developed into what was then known as an e-zine (an electronic magazine), before becoming what, to my knowledge, was the first online Scottish newspaper.  In 1999, we went into print, publishing a monthly newspaper. It didn’t last long – the big boys don’t like the little people playing with their toys and by toys, I mean advertising revenue. But that’s an entirely different story. The premise of the entire project was always, always, always to help others find ways of affording to do things they may, otherwise, not have afforded. Whether it was providing virtual or office support for home-based business, networking to promote one another, assessing budgets to help deal with debt, or even just demonstrating how to feed a family for a week on a tenner, it was always fun and frugal. Now, 15 years later, we are able to turn out not one, but two daily ‘newspapers’, and all at a cost of zero pounds. I earn nothing from the publications, nor do I have full editorial control or any rights to any advertising revenue, but I no longer need to pay a graphic designer and a printer £1,000 each month, nor do I need to pay a distribution company, an advertising salesman or the overheads of a busy office.  Over the past 15 years, I have been stripped clean of all those costs and do you know what? I wouldn’t have them back if you paid me. So, friends of NYK and Frugaldom alike – this is the current version of ‘Now You Know’, still covering Scottish news, views, reviews, stories, pictures and it sometimes even spills over into Frugaldom. If you want to become a part of it, there are a number of things you can do: Follow @Frugaldom on TwitterLike the Frugaldom page on FacebookJoin the free Frugal ForumsFollow this Frugal Blog Whatever you decide to do, remember we are about helping one another and making life and work affordable. We have challenges galore, including those for frugal entrepreneurs, new cottage industries, crafting, frugal living, writing, blogging, artwork, cooking and starting a new home-based business.  Just like Richard Branson, we began out journey with a small newsletter. Unlike Sir Richard Branson, we didn’t turn it all into a highflying multi-national phenomenon, but that, dear friends, would not have been frugal living. I often wonder how much debt is owed by big business and who, ultimately, pays all that back in the event of a collapse. I was saddened to see that in the case of MPG Printgroup, it is likely to be around £10,200,000.00 (according to administrator's report). That has to adversely affect many. It must be affecting every one of the 210 employees and their families. That’s another 210 families that could suddenly be thrown into what this nations deems ‘poverty’ (based on their income) and I think that is just wrong. But I digress – this was supposed to be a blog post about how to get your free daily copy of ‘Now You Know’ to accompany your free daily copy of The Microholding Daily.  NYK, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Frugal Gourmet - Cooking Delicious, Cheap and Easy Food.", "date": "Thursday 29 August 2013", "text": "Frugal Gourmet - a Day in the KitchenHere in Frugaldom, I've been making and trading lemon curd for quite a few years, but am ashamed to say that I hadn't made any this year, until today. The ducks, hens and quail are all laying well, so I always have a heap of eggs ready to use. This morning, we had our porridge (the cat included) and then I baked two small loves - these cost pennies each if you bake them in the breadmaker on 'Express' setting and use the cheapest of the cheap, bulk bought flour. Today's loaves are made from a 50:50 mix of gluten free bread flour with sunflower and sesame seeds and white soft bap mix. Here's the recipe I used, just in case you, too, are a bargain bulk-buying, batch cooker.FRUGAL DAILY BREAD300ml warm water  1 teaspoon salt  2 teaspoons veg oil  225g soft bap mix  225g sesame & sunflower seed gluten free bread mix  1 teaspoon dried yeast  Baked in the breadmaker on 'express' setting, which takes 45 minutes. I'd to split the above in half and make two small loves, as it's the hand-me-down twin pan breadmaker I'm using for this. ﻿ Next up - beef and tomato stew  I cooked the diced beef with some of the past week's tomato pickings and spring onions in a little salted water then added a sprig of fresh herbs - rosemary, sage and basil picked from the garden. A few cheap gravy granules and hey presto - a dish fit for kings. As is, this big pan of stew would probably serve 4 people, depending on what it's being served with at the time, but frugal gourmet suggestions include the addition of beans, lentils, chick peas or other similar protein-rich foodstuff to turn it into a batch cooked meal for 10 to 12. At lunchtime, I made soufflé omelette but decided to make the meringue version - 5 egg whites whisked into peaks, stir in one egg yolk, then salt and pepper to season - higher protein and lower fat that your 'normal' omelette, except that we had grated cheese melted over the top. :) Anyhow, it conveniently left me with 4 egg yokes, which is perfect for lemon curd! LUXURY LEMON CURD RECIPE 4 egg yolks (I use our own hens' eggs) 150g sugar 100mls lemon juice (or lime or orange or a mixture) 70g butter (or margarine) Beat the egg yolks and sugar together whilst gently warming the butter and lemon juice. Add the egg yolk/sugar mix to the pan and whisk together with the lemon and butter. (Today I am using 50:50 lemon and lime juice.) Keep this on a low heat and whisk regularly until the mixture thickens to resemble custard. If you are cooking on a log burner, it's easier to take the pan off the heat to whisk it, otherwise cook slowly over a low heat. Do not allow the mix to boil. Pour into a sterilised, pre-heated jar and leave to cool. Once set, keep it refrigerated.  This quantity is sufficient for one full jar and is classed as an absolute luxury, gourmet food when it's made with fresh eggs and butter. Check the ingredients in a supermarket bought 'bargain' jar and see the difference for yourself. This here is the real McCoy, nothing beats it in taste.This is today's lemon and lime curd, I'm using a 500ml clip-top jar. The jars were on special offer in a big name supermarket when I first got them - an amazing 3 for £2 - so I got £10 worth of them a few years ago and they have been great for all sorts of jellies, preserves, pickles and curds.Enjoy!The Microholding Daily(Click the link above to read today’s paper) Every day, you can receive our free online newspaper, carrying news and stories relevant to frugal living, microholding and smallholding.  The online newspaper picks out the best news, views and reviews via the pre-determined programme, selecting from what’s available from the Frugaldom friends, followers and favourite places found on Twitter. If you don’t have a Twitter account, don’t worry – The Microholding Daily is available free to all Internet users simply by subscribing online – the link is at the top right hand side of the main page. I hope you enjoy claiming your free subscription to The Microholding Daily."},
{"title": "The Frugal Route out of Debt (Part 2)", "date": "Wednesday 28 August 2013", "text": "Working Out Your Own Budget(Part 1 can be found HERE)Once you have estimated the amount of money you have coming into your household and have deducted everything that needs to be paid to sustain your accommodation, protect your income and get you to work on time, whatever is left is you basic household budget. It costs money to be in fulltime employment. You could have expenses such as travel, childcare, lunches, workwear and additional grocery costs if your working hours inhibit you, timewise, from cooking and keeping up with the running of a busy household. All of these things eat into your income, so don't forget about counting up all those costs - it costs you to work.  Whatever you have left, after paying for your work-related costs and the actual roof over your head, be it rented or mortgaged, is what you have remaining to pay everything else. I count Council Tax as being part of keeping the roof over your head. This is an example list of items that may need to be paid from the household budget:  Groceries  Toiletries  Cleaning products  Electricity  Heating (coal, logs, gas, oil etc)  Internet  Telephone  Mobile phone  Television licence  Shoes  Clothes  Gifts for others  Membership fees  Car  InsurancesPets  In addition to the above, you might also have luxury expenses like:  Satellite television  Socialising  Entertaining  Hair styling  Makeup  Beauty therapy  Gym  Hobbies  Tobacco products  Alcohol  Travel & holidays  etc, etc, etc  Separating the needs from the wants, or the necessities from the luxuries, is what has to be done until such times as you are standing on your own feet financially. As long as you have debts of any description, your household is not financially independent. Even a mortgage is debt, although many overlook this fact. (You can't simply stop paying a mortgage and expect to keep the house, can you?)  So, this gives you an idea of where your money goes, after you have calculated how much of the stuff you actually have. Step 1 - Work out your true budget Step 2 - Work on those figures until you have a plan showing that you can afford to pay for everything from that amount. It's what's know as living within your means Step 3 - Have some sort of contingency plan that will help counteract any sudden loss of income, especially if you have debt of any description. Clearing the debt is the obvious choice before any sort of savings pot can be afforded. Even saving loose change in a pot should be avoided, as every spare penny should be thrown at debts until they are gone. However, for the sake of sanity, some people prefer to save something, somewhere and there's no getting away from that fact.As you have seen from Part 1, the magical figure of £4,000 or thereabouts keeps springing up, hence the reason I have always based these challenges on that figure. To this day, I still use the same figure and I still run my personal challenge as 'Living on £4,000 for the year'. This, I can tell you, would be far easier if I lived in a less rural area. According to the www.minimumincome.org.uk website, as linked to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I need to earn £320.83 per week to lead what is perceived as a normal lifestyle. Well... you all know what I think of that! The suggestion that I should be spending £50.11 weekly on food alone had me laughing myself to sleep last night. (My average spend is less than £10 per person despite not having easy access to supermarkets.) In conclusion, I can say never trust figures you read or hear from third parties unless they are calculated using your personal figures.Year 1 of your new challenge to follow some frugal living techniques will always be the most difficult.   Having worked out what you think your budget should be, you now need to keep records and receipts for all spends, so you can compare these after the first year to the figures you had estimated.  Spreadsheets are great for this purpose, as you can input all your figures and calculate spends as the days, weeks and months progress. If you spot an overspend in one category, it allows you to reassess your figures and make some cuts elsewhere to cover those additional costs incurred.  Get a very basic free spreadsheet from our 'handy links' section in the frugal forums, or just ask in the members' daily thread, where someone will be able to point you in the right direction. If you don't have any software for reading or working in spreadsheets, you can download the Open Office free suite of programmes, also listed in our handy links page.  Remember, every penny or pound spent has an overall effect on your entire budget, so it needs constant attention to keep it within its limits.Join us in Frugaldom, take part in our challenges and see how quickly you can clear debts and pursue the route to a good life. It really is that simple and it can even be fun.NYK in Frugaldom. The Road to Debt FreedomLong and boring? Perhaps Full of personal opinions you may not like? Most Likely! A pack of lies? No, just an honest look at some spending habits. The problem with debt doesn't lie in how little money you earn, it lies in how you spend that money. Never having been in a household that has cleared £20,000 a year, I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like to have two fulltime salaries coming in, not even basing them on today's phenomenal (to me) minimum wage. In absolute honesty, the current minimum hourly rate has been close to the highest hourly rate I have ever earned as an employee. (That's probably more a reflection of my age than anything else.) So, here goes for a rollercoaster ride that can take you out of debt and into what many in modern society think is poverty - how weird is that and how deluded are they? I call it a good life!Poverty, to me, suggests starvation and deprivation with no escape! GETTING OUT OF DEBT ONCE AND FOR ALL - SOME SIMPLE CHOICES Stop spending on anything that is not needed. Pour a cuppa and sit down with a notebook and pen, then count up exactly what you have coming in each week/month/yearCount up every penny you are spending each week/month/yearTake a deep breath and pour another cuppaMake a start on a statement of your financial affairs.Set yourself a budget and stick to itLet your bank/building society/creditors know your full financial situation if there are any arrears involved Liquidate any assets you may have that could pay off any arrears. Declutter and sell your surplus, for example.Start tackling the debts, highest interest rates are best to be cleared first.If it makes you feel better (keeps you sane), clear off the smallest debt as soon as you possibly can so you can experience achievement as quickly as possible. Be realistic about your situation.  Be honest in setting your priorities and talking with your creditors.  Be kind to yourself, you are where you are, so there is no point in beating yourself up over it. (Thanks for this addition, Tad) You have now made a good start by looking at the possibility of calling a halt to more debt and turning your situation around once and for all. Now we will take a closer look at these simple steps, starting with number 1 - stop spending on anything that is not needed.  Basically, this means call a halt to everything, even if it's only for an hour to take the time to assess the situation. Determining your needs from your wants is a massive step to take for some, so the easiest way to do this is to look at everything you have bought or spent on since your last payday. Needs are the absolute basics to sustaining life itself - food, warmth, shelter, essential medications. Make a list, it's good to look back at it now and again to see how life changes on an almost daily basis without your noticing. Now try to list everything else, and I do mean absolutely everything, right down to how many miles you drove and every bill payment, debt repayment, bank charge and interest charge. I know, it's already getting scary just thinking about it, let alone looking at the figure on the paper or screen in front of you, so here are a couple of examples from previous years. We all need to start somewhere and, in the beginning, we all make mistakes. But we all need to set our own budget and stick to it. WHAT  IS A BUDGET? In very simple terms, it is a calculation of all the money you expect in, from which you need to pay everything. Your overall annual household income is what your annual budget is based upon and from this, all spending must come.  Only by knowing exactly how much you are spending can you begin to take stock and calculate or estimate how much money you need to pay your way throughout the year.  For the purposes of frugal living, we are aiming to spend less than we earn at all times or, at the very least, afford to pay everything on what income we have, even if this means making some drastic changes to future spending and earning plans.  However, many people (and companies, banks and Governments) end up spending more than they actually have, which results in debt.   Here are a couple of examples from 2007 (taxes, interest rates and benefits have changed since then): Lifestyle 1  Couple with 2 of a family, husband works full time on a salary of £30,000 and wife is a full time mother/homemaker (not sure what the politically correct term for this category is any more!) Total income is approximately £452 per week including Child Benefit.  Mortgage & Buildings insurance - £740 per month = £170 per week  Council Tax/Water - £125 per month = £24 per week  2 cars, both on HP - £300 per month = £70 week  2 x road tax, insurance, servicing, petrol/diesel etc = £270 per month = £62 week  Credit cards - £100 per month = £23 week  Loans - £100 per month = £23 week  Total expenditure before actual living expenses - £372 per week   Balance remaining = £80 for everything else  Equivalent to £4,171.00 for a full year The annual household budget for lifestyle 1 is £4,171.00Lifestyle 2  Couple with 2 of a family, husband works full time, wife part time, joint salary of £18,000 plus Child Benefit, total income approximately £300 per week  Mortgage & Buildings insurance - £303 per month = £70 week  Council Tax/Water - £100 per month = £23 week  Home Improvement loan - £266 per month = £61 week  Credit Cards - £100 per month = £23 week  Other debts - £100 per month = £23 week  Car - road tax, insurance, servicing, fuel etc - £100 per month = £23 week  Total expenditure before actual living expenses - £223  Balance remaining = £77.00 for everything else  Equivalent to £4,015.00 for a full year  The annual household budget for lifestyle 2 is £4,015.00It didn't really matter what the annual income was, there always seemed to be a significant difference in the way that income got spent. Attitude to debt differs from person to person, depending on how easy they can access it and then pay it all back. As another example, a single professional person earning £52,000 a year may well only have a household budget of £4,000 after paying commuting costs, the mortgage and upkeep of a grander house in a more expensive area, a sportier car, regular entertaining, foreign holidays, the gym and other luxuries they think are affordable, such as beauty treatments, designer clothing, a gardener and/or cleaner. No matter what your income bracket, we could all be in the exact same boat. Fortunately, we each have the freedom to choose how we stay afloat.  The £4,000 is a figure that has stuck with me for many years and seems as relevant now as then.No matter what you do or how you do it, you are always going to have to pay the cost of living. If you can reduce the cost of living and clear off ALL debts, then think of the fun you can have from thereon in - that is the good life.  Budget to within an inch of your life and see just how much it costs you to live. You can see by the above how I arrived at £4,000 and hopefully this will make things a little clearer for our newest readers and challengers on the www.frugalforums.co.uk, rather than having to search through years' worth of posts and pages only to find themselves in even older archives. Part 2 is coming right up, so don't wander far - I hope you filled a flask rather than repeatedly boiling the kettle? :)Edited in - Part 2 can be found HERE"},
{"title": "Big Adventures on a Little Shoestring", "date": "Tuesday 27 August 2013", "text": "Things to do before I'm... 10?The pink piggyIt is never too young to start your 'to do' list and learn how to budget so that you can afford to live a good life... is it? Frugal Gran at your service! This is the first of a series of blog posts that I'll be including here, as this huge adventure unfolds. You can follow them by following the blog or by clicking on the link called 'Frugal Gran' that will appear in the index at the bottom of the blog. It's going to be fun, fun, fun! :) It was eldest grand daughter's 9th birthday recently. Like all junior misses, birthday girls just wanna have fun... so she partied at the weekend with other junior friends.  But I wanted to do something a little bit different for this birthday, something that could grow and develop with her as she journeys through her final year of being a single digit age and then decide for herself if she wants to continue along the frugal path when she reaches the ripe old age of 10. I devised a plan, a secret plan, one that involved a 'to do' list. Then, instead of giving her a wrapped-up, tied with bows gift, I issued dear grand daughter with her personalised 'official invite' to join the adventure... and awaited her reaction! She absolutely loved it , is extremely excited and desperate to get started! What so enthrals a 9 year-old, you might ask? Fun and frugal learning, that's what! Here's how it works (so far) and I hope that you will all find this as entertaining as I did, should you choose to pursue a similar path. First of all, the secret paperwork needs to be assembled into a notebook format. Simply put, I printed out a homemade card on paper and inserted it inside several other sheets of paper, marked off headers saying 'NOTES' and added a 'Happy Birthday' graphic to the front. This is what it said inside: ==========================﻿Dear xxxx, This is your very special birthday invitation to come to Thrift Cottage for holiday adventures. You can arrange to stay any time you want and we will have an adventure, no matter what the weather. To prepare for these adventures, I have bought us some adventure kit, including the things in these photos.  I have been putting all the spare coins into the pink piggy bank, so we will count them all out when you come to stay. Then, we will go into town in search of our first big adventure before planning the next one. Keep this special adventure booklet safe so you can keep a note and photos of things you do before your next birthday. Being 9 is going to be great fun!Just to make sure we get plenty of time for extra special outdoor adventures, I have made sure we are all prepared for overnight stays.  The big 'xxxx' storage space at Thrift Cottage will also include crafting stuff and sleepover items, just in case we manage to get out to do some camping. Even indoor camping can be fun!  I couldn't find us any pink sleeping bags and pillows, so blue and purple will need to do, but these will go with the tent. Let's hope we get some nice sunny weather for the next school holidays so we can get started with our adventures as soon as possible. ========================= School is already back, here in Scotland, so the next holiday that's long enough for a big adventure is mid-October. However, there is time to fit in a couple of mini adventures between now and then, even if it means indoor camping and planning future expeditions. Believe it or not, Frugal Gran is every bit as excited by all of this! I hope you will all enjoy following us over the next twelve months, as we go off in search of new knowledge that will, one day, become fantastic future memories. Everything will be done on a shoestring budget in an effort to discover just how much fun can be had while following a frugal lifestyle.  I'll let you know how much is in the pink piggy as soon as it has been officially counted. Frugal Gran!Edited in: We counted out the pennies from the piggy and managed to just squeak in at £40. :)A Frugaleur Needs to Earn in Order to Balance the Frugal Books  Earning needn't be in cash, earnings can be in another's time, goods or services. Earning, as a frugaleur, isn't about becoming cash rich, it is about balancing the books, living within our means and affording a few luxuries in life. On the whole, most of us grow our own foodstuffs in an organic-type setting, no pesticides, chemicals or artificial additives. We brew our home-grown fruit, bake our own bread, make our own jams and preserves, have fresh free range eggs, give and receive individually crafted gifts and enjoy these luxuries as part of our frugal lifestyle. In some cases, we end up with a surplus and no storage space, so we trade.  On the whole, this trading is done among friends, relatives and neighbours, but we all still need to stick to the rules and play fair, in the same way we need to pay our taxes, just like any other enterprise. OK, so we may not earn sufficient income over a year to pay income tax, but that is down to the Government and their assessment of how much each person needs in order to survive. At the moment, they reckon an adult in the UK needs £9,440.00. If you follow Frugaldom, then you'll already know that's £5,440 more than needed, or, looking at it another way, over £100 per week more than I need to spend. In a shared, debt free household of, say, 3 working adults, that's over £1,000 per month more than the basic needs.  But back to surplus selling and trading among friends - who among us sells surplus eggs 'at the garden gate'?  In order to keep within the law, a simple label attached bearing your details along with the obligatory date plus 'keep refrigerated and use within 21 days' type thing does just fine. Your surplus eggs can only be sold in this manner, you cannot sell them into shops, bakeries, restaurants etc., nor can you wholesale them without more lengthy terms and conditions being met, regarding grading and stamping etc. Nor can you declare them as free-range, as this term is reserved for licenced flocks kept within strict guidelines and accredited by Government agencies as such. Your garden hens probably have more freedom than most so-called 'free-range' eggs, I might add.) This applies to most eggs - duck, hen, bantam... Quail eggs are exempt from much of the legislation, so these can be packaged, labelled and sold almost anywhere, either wholesale or to the end user. But one thing many people overlook is that, although quail eggs are exempt from part of the egg distribution legislation, quail are not exempt from the mandatory poultry registration. So, if you have half a dozen hens, a trio of ducks and a flock of 40 or more quails (all types) then your poultry numbers have met and exceeded the maximum 50 birds, meaning you must register your flock. Don't panic, registration is completely free and painless, you can even register online. (Details can be found HERE.) Now for the surplus plants, fruit and vegetables. At the moment, as long as we don't process these in any way, shape or form then we are free to trade off our surpluses among friends, family, colleagues and neighbours. (I doubt very much we need to consider the wholesale options, as we are looking at gardens and microholdings her, not acres of cash-generating crops on an agricultural business level.) But what if we want to sell our produce already processed into something else? Like eggs into lemon curd, fruit and berries into jams or jellies, or any other type of foodstuff other than 'as picked'? That necessitates taking the next step, which most of us already have: EU Regulation 852/2004 Hygiene for Foodstuffs requires Food Businesses to make sure that anyone who handles food is supervised, instructed and trained in Food Hygiene in a way that is appropriate to the work they do. Now, this leads us into a quagmire of quandaries regarding what denotes a business, so we decided that anything that generated income, cash or otherwise, be assessed as business because we are, after all, engaged in the business of frugal living. Again, no need to panic over this, as the safest and wisest thing to do is get yourself a certificate, simple as that. It costs as little as £15 and you can do it all online. As far as I am aware, there is no compulsory exam, just legislation stating that everyone handling food must gave received suitable training in basic food hygiene - the Environmental Health Department of your local authority can provide advice and guidance on specific queries relating to food safety and you can find out more about handling food safely from the Food Standards Agency website. For me, I prefer to be safe in the knowledge that I hold a certificate as proof of any training.﻿ Level 2 Food Safety and Hygiene* for Catering (including City and Guilds Accredited Certificate) can be done within a day from home, online, and needs no specific entry requirements for the course. It costs £15 + VAT and also includes a downloadable certificate that you can print from home.Happy frugaleur studying! It's time to start selling your surplus as jams, jellies, sauces, chutneys, pickles, cakes and bakes... Make your garden pay for itself.NYK in Frugaldom.* Links to the study course are affiliates, there are other companies offering similar services."},

{"title": "The Frugaldom Courgette Cake Challenge", "date": "Sunday 25 August 2013", "text": "Chocolate Cake with Courgette & RaspberriesWe've been baking cakes with courgettes here in Frugaldom for several years now, so this year is nothing new - except several more of you have asked about how to make the courgette cakes.  This is a great time of year for making the most of your surplus fruit and vegetables, even if it does mean baking them into cakes of what one may normally consider odd combinations.  Believe me when I tell you that the combination of chocolate, courgette and raspberry is delicious. Rule number 1 - Never be afraid to experiment with recipes if you are content to eat the end results, regardless of how they turn out after cooking. Various recipes exist, but I use the following, based on Shaz's original recipe, adapted to suit what I have available in my baking cupboard and garden: Original Recipe Ingredients 250g grated courgette 2 eggs125ml vegetable oil150g sugar 200g self raising flour 25g cocoa powderHandful of lightly crushed pistachios (optional)Half a teaspoon each of bicarbonate of soda and baking powder My Ingredients Today 125g grated courgette (from garden)125g raspberries (from garden)1 duck egg (from garden birds)2 quail eggs (from garden birds)60ml vegetable oil65ml melted margarine (25p per tin from Approved Food*)150g sugar 200g flour (Gluten free bread flour with sunflower and sesame seeds from Approved Food*)25g cocoa powder Handful of raisins (optional) Half a teaspoon each of bicarbonate of soda and baking powder Method Beat the eggs, sugar and oil/margarine together, add the dry ingredients, then the grated courgettes, raspberries and sultanas, stir well.  Grease and/or line 2 x 2lb loaf tins or 1 x 10inch round cake tin. Split the mix into the two tins if using the loaf tins, otherwise bake it all in the larger tin. Bake at gas 4 / 180deg C for about 45 minutes, or until golden and a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool before slicing.  If you decide to try making courgette cakes, don't forget to photograph them and share your results with our frugal baking challengers in the forum that can be found here. Owing to the fact that I had no self-raising flour and chose to use the gluten free bread flour, my loaves didn't rise as well as they may have. Having now cooled, I have sliced the first one, three of us have had a sample - it is extremely tasty and has a moist, sponge-like texture. The top photo shows a close up of the finished, sliced cake. In a word, 'yummy'!  This is my entry into the Frugaldom Courgette Cake Challenge. I hope you all enjoy taking part this year. Off for a coffee,NYK in Frugaldom  * Friend referral links"},
{"title": "A Money Challenge Involving Frugal Fun and Travel", "date": "Saturday 24 August 2013", "text": "A Frugal Trip to Northern Ireland.This is the summary of our frugal day trip of Thursday 22nd August 2013. It began at 5am on Thursday 22nd August and ended at about 11.30pm that same day. When we got to where we were going, the sun shone! I hadn't been to Northern Ireland since 2009, when we went for the day to explore Belfast, enabling me to tick off 'Visit Ireland' from my list of 'things to do' for that year. The Challenge - A budget of £100 to complete another couple of items from my bucket list. This trip took care of items 8 and 9 out of a possible 10 on my current list, so I have now moved number 10 to a new list and made it number 1 - you know, on accounts of my still being here and actually managing to achieve it? I need a new list so there are other things to move on to during and after the final quest from my previous list - in search of Aurora Borealis. The Bucket List - Items 8 and 9 8. Visit the Giant's Causeway9. Walk across the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge Budget = £100 for two of us (I seldom go anywhere alone, I'm a wimp.)Northern Ireland is quite convenient for those of us living here in the sometimes forgotten southwest corner of Scotland. We're now 26 miles from the ferry port, since they closed down Stranraer and moved all operations to Cairnryan. This is a blog post about fulfilling an ambition on a small budget.Trip to Northern Ireland's Antrim CoastFuel to and from port - £8.70  Secure parking for the day - £5  Return coach and ferry tickets - £32 x 2 = £64  Carrick-a-Rede Bridge (group) fees - 2 x £5 = £10 Giants Causeway - FREE (We didn't go in the visitor centre or use the shuttle bus service.) Coffees on the ferry - 2 x £2.50 = £5 (Including as many  free refills as you want.)Total = £92.70 or £46.35 per personCarrick-a-Rede rope bridge The Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge is under the control of the National Trust, so members can walk across to the tiny island free of charge. (My membership lapsed some time ago into the depths of non-frugality.) The queues for crossing this bridge are staggering, meaning we had no time to explore the area - by the time we crossed to the island, we'd to about turn and rush back to catch the mini-bus. For those of us who were on the tour, we were charged £5 per person, which I thought was a little naughty; the National Trust webpage clearly states £4 per person in a group. I guess the tour company make themselves an extra £1 per person by issuing these tickets but that £1 difference could have covered the cost of a certificate to say you crossed the rope bridge. We didn't bother buying one after that.The Giant's Causeway This is as awesome to walk on as it looks, although the place was absolutely mobbed with fellow tourists and day-trippers. Despite this, we did find a quiet spot to sit down and eat our sandwiches while taking in the magnificent views of the stones, sea and surrounding cliffs. In the event I am ever fortunate enough to return to this area, I would choose to spend more of my day exploring these surrounding paths and rocky outcrops in an attempt to fully appreciate the scale of the Giant's Causeway. The view we had from our chosen picnic spot on the Giant's Causeway. The stones themselves are quite fascinating, as are the little rock pools that can be found among them. Walking from stone to stone was like crossing a fantastic, wild patio made up of thousands of hexagonal stone slabs. (They aren't all hexagonal.) Their differing heights made me think of Indiana Jones attempting to avoid the one step that could trigger a deadly onslaught of rising and falling rock columns, as they suddenly sink underfoot, casting the unsuspecting walker down into an abyss. I've never seen anything related to Game of Thrones*  but several filming locations can be found around this area of Northern Ireland. In fact, there's now a specific tour for fans to visit these filming locations. The Giant's Causeway is now a world heritage site and has a very modern visitor centre of eco-friendly design. The building is set into the hillside and completely disguised from above by its turfed roof, over which you can walk. The first I realised I was on the roof was when passing the massive skylight windows. Many people were walking over these, but I found that a little disconcerting. The other rather disconcerting thing about this visitor centre is that it houses the main public toilets, tea room/restaurant and the gift shops. Nothing bad in that, you might think, except that it would have cost us £8.50 each just to get into the building! No thank you - a walk over the roof and down to the shore to appreciate the natural wonders of the Giant's Causeway was sufficient for us. There is a shuttle bus available, but this costs an extra £2 per person, again not very frugal or green, for that matter. Besides, it's only a short walk for anyone with a modicum of fitness.Old Bushmills DistilleryOld Bushmills distillery is said to be the oldest licensed whisky distillery in the world, funded in 1608. Our day trip included a brief stop here, just long enough for a quick trip around the visitor centre shop and for some photo-taking. This hadn't been part of our original itinerary, but it was a worthwhile stop just to be able to say we've been. Needless to say, we neither imbibed nor purchased any bottles of Bushmills whiskey.By pre-booking the day trip tickets, travelling as foot passengers and taking all our own food with us, this made for a very frugal set of life experiences and provided us with some great memories. The Giant's Causeway made me think that a trip to Staffa and a visit to Fingal's Cave might well become a feature on a future list of 'things to do' but, then again, the site of the sea-going liner sailing out of Belfast harbour made me think of cruising a little further afield, which means I would also need to renew my passport and find a willing companion with similar goals and aspirations. Hmm... I wonder, I wonder, I wonder.I don't think we did too badly considering how much we packed into our day. 5 hours of cruising, 'Brave' playing on the big screen, free Wi-Fi on board, all the coffee we could drink, some crochet time for relaxation and a lovely bit of top-up suntan while out enjoying some of Northern Ireland's top visitor spots and we each came home with change to spare. At less than £50 per person, this has to be a trip worth making. I'd like to thank frugal friend who accompanied me on this trip, making it possible for me to travel to Ireland in the first place - her excellent company was much appreciated. I think we chatted non-stop from the minute the day began until we got home again. Hopefully, she managed to find some new inspiration for future gem stone creations while we were off on our travels.Until next time,NYK in Frugaldom* Affiliated link"},

Simply add to basket and enter code JUST8 at checkout to claim.  It's a definite win/win situation here and I can honestly, with my hand on my heart, personally commend this company. I think we shocked them a little by shopping on their site as frugalers, rather than bodybuilders, but there's nothing wrong with muscling in on a lean, mean bargain when it's flaunting itself at you, is there? Here's how to make the most of the deal: visit the website - this is where you can claim your four free chicken breasts - and then go to the link that says 'lean meats', scroll down and select 'chicken'. From here, look for \"Premium Chicken Breasts - 1-1.15kg, Was: £9.75                         Save: £1.75 From                                                         £8.00\" - do not click to buy, instead, click to view the offer. Once you do this, you will see some additional information on left of the page that says \"SPECIAL OFFER: Buy one get another FREE! Simply add to basket and enter code JUST8 at checkout to claim.\" Good luck with this, the offers are all on limited timescales, so I hope you are quick enough to be able to make the most of them. On a gram per gram comparison, not even the cheapest supermarkets within a 50 mile radius of here can compete with these prices. Perhaps you could set up your own food co-operative for local friends and family - any excuse for a get together when the order arrives!Chicken is one of the main sources of meat protein for many of us who follow a frugal lifestyle, owing to its versatility, availability and price. When we get the opportunity to stock up on chicken breast fillets, we take it! I thought my bargain was superb at £5 per kilo but this is even better.For those who prefer cooking a whole chicken, there's another deal available, whole chickens for £4 each. In a frugal household, one single chicken breast can feed 2 to 4 people, depending on portion size and meal type, but one single chicken can feed many more.  Frugalers can make even a small chicken feed a dozen people no problem and still get a pot of soup out of the bones. (See forums for stretchy chicken recipes.) So, when I also spotted this offer, I almost fell off my seat! Whole fresh chickens for £4 each - that's 5 chickens for £20 and enough there for 60 meals plus sufficient stock to make soup enough to last the entire winter. What's more, if it's delivered free then there's no added expense of driving to the supermarket or trying to balance 5 chickens on a bike! Call a friend now, make the most of free delivery or else fill your freezer... if you have any space in it. By splitting an order with friends, all of these bargains are yours for the taking. My freezer is going to be over-flowing at this rate! It saddens me, somewhat, that I have almost no space to fit in any more bargains. I hope home of you can take advantage of this fantastic, lean, mean offer! In addition, there's usually a free sachet of seasoning and all that lovely packaging to be recycled!

{"title": "Frugal Food From the Garden. (NB: We don't eat the quail, we eat and sell their eggs.)", "date": "Tuesday 20 August 2013", "text": "Make Hay While the Sun ShinesPhoto from the old corn mill, Port WilliamAside from the fact that I am constantly being distracted by butterflies at the moment, I did, eventually, manage to get around to doing some work in the garden, mainly by way of tidying up the greenhouse and sorting out the tomato and cucumber bushes. The tomato plants were becoming so leafy that no light was getting to the dozens of little fruits that were hiding among the greenery. Hopefully, I haven't done the wrong thing in removing many of the lower leaves to allow the sunlight to get at the tomatoes. I was very late getting my tomato seeds planted this year, so they are well behind some of those I've seen elsewhere. I literally had to thin the coiling tendrils of the cucumbers because they were taking over the entire greenhouse and there's little enough room in there at this time of year. The closer I look, the more cucumbers I can see!   Down in the frugal poly-tunnel, I'm beginning to wonder if I've done the right thing is leaving the pumpkins - one each side supposed to be for each of my grand daughters in the hope of having pumpkins for Halloween. They are spreading at a terrifying rate and already have tiny pumpkins about the size of golf balls on them. The cucumbers will need to hurry up in there or they'll be swamped by 'the creature' that is a giant pumpkin plant!Comfrey as green manure A few weeks ago, some fellow frugalers and I were having a bit of a swapathon. I received some ginger mint, which is doing really well, and some small cuttings from comfrey, of which I had none in this garden. It's used as green manure and for speeding up the composting process, so I was hoping to be able to harvest it before the year ends. It's looking good! The above are the cuttings planted about a month ago. I'm delighted to say that the quail eggs I sent in exchange for the plants have, since, hatched - photo courtesy of Shaz. Da- old Japanese Coturnix Quail, (fawn x tuxedo)The herb gardens here are still growing at a an amazing rate, supplying herbs galore for friends and neighbours alike. The newest of the spiral gardens was constructed during the last week of May but it is already filled with herbs - and some unexpected 'guest' plants in the shape of sunflowers that have grown from seeds dropped by the birds. (Apologies for photo quality, the sun had set by the time I got around to taking these photos last night.)Hands up all of you who have courgettes to spare! I know that several of out regular readers have, so we are now organising a courgette cake challenge. Chocolate and courgettes go well when baked together and I'd like to thank Gill for linking us to her carrot and courgette recipe in my previous post.Yet another courgette trying to break free!The Frugaldom potato patch is in full bloom and we have already had some of the potatoes. These were all grown from past their best potatoes left over from early in the year - left to sprout and then planted. We have a major slug and snail problem here, so things do tend to beat us to it in the veg-eating stakes, but there are enough potatoes here to last a few weeks at least.We are still picking raspberries here but the rhubarb has now all gone and the bed being prepared for winter. I need to get a load of manure and straw to cover this over until next year. The next person past my door on a horse will be accosted and a request made for the contents of their stable. :) Next to be picked looks like being some blueberries and then there should be apples ready.BlueberriesWell that takes care of the garden update for now - I'll pick and freeze the blueberries for ice-cream making, as there aren't many of them while the bushes are establishing themselves in my 'log-man' acidic (ericaceous) bed but here's hoping they start picking up for next year. That's them been in there for about a year, now. Rounding up on the £4,000 budget challenge, I have £1,137.43 remaining to last me until the new year. That's after paying this month's telephone bill and purchasing the tickets for the frugal friends' fun day out to explore Carrick-a-Rede and the Giant's Causeway during our mini cruise to Northern Ireland later this week. And just for good measure, here are this morning's photos. Yes, you got it... more butterflies! Small Wall Brown ButterflyPeacock ButterflyRed Admiral Butterfly ﻿I really tried my best not to include any butterflies in this post but they made me do it, I tell you, they made me do it!

Providing Natural Inspiration for the Colour Schemes of Interior Design Projects. This post contains many photographsFrugal living version of alliums - onions left to grow How on earth am I supposed to get any work done when the sun shines and there's so much going on in the garden? Today was a glorious day, so I decided to tidy up the tomato and cucumber bushes in the little greenhouse, pick a few flowers, harvest more courgettes and weed the herb gardens. But then I spotted a Red Admiral butterfly on one of my 'frugal alliums'. From thereon in, the chase had begun!  Quite difficult to see in the bright sunlight, but there were numerous little white butterflies fluttering around the white Buddleia. I'm told these are female Orange Tips, but where are all the males? Another Peacock butterfly arrived, followed by several more, all landing on the white Buddleia or else settling on the stone wall to sun themselves.  This is the trouble-maker in my garden and everyone else's garden, as far as the brassicas are concerned! This one was just taking off when I spotted it - the dreaded 'cabbage white' butterfly. But really, who could possibly kill something like this? Certainly not me! I just need to learn to net my cabbages better in future and leave a few out for the white flutter-by brigade. Eggs of the Large White butterfly, hundreds of them have been laid on the undersides of the cabbage and cauliflower leaves and the eggs seem to hatch within days and then, almost overnight, it's caterpillar-fest and the leaves are stripped bare!  I decided to take a wander down to the wild garden, as that was where the Red Admiral had been heading and that was me - hooked for ages, just watching nature in all its colourful glory. Isn't it absolutely amazing that we can enjoy all of this for free? That's when I spotted it again - can you see the Red Admiral? Then I spotted another and another, but tried to focus on one at a time. These really are quite stunning. In fact, I think I may do my bathroom in black and white with a splash of red/orange. Close up of one of the Red Admiral butterflies. Now that it's in my sights there'll be no letting go until I've got the best photos I can with my little freebie 3 x zoom digital camera. The following is a selelction of the photos taken this afternoon when I should have been working! Red Admiral heading for the purple Buddleia. The scarlet colour changes to a bright orange depending how the light hits the butterfly's wings. Stunning! Red Admiral dancing in circles as it feeds on the nectar from the tiny clusters of flowers on the Buddleia.  I was transfixed! I spent so long photographing this butterfly that my coffee went cold and had to be microwaved! On closer inspection, there were all sorts of buzzing flying things on the Buddleia. I think this is a Hoverfly feasting. Isn't this just a magnificent specimen of a butterfly? The Red Admiral has to be one of my favourites, alongside the Peacocks and Blues.  Another buzzy thing that I'll call a Hoverfly despite the fact I can see what looks like a stinging part - perhaps it's an egg chute of some description! I'm praying my arch-enemy, Mrs giant wood wasp, doesn't appear, as I really don't like her.  Bumble bees aplenty in the Frugaldom garden but it isn't often that I spend any time trying to photograph them. I really should, as there are so many different types, colours and sizes. What are all these little creatures? Normally I run when I hear anything buzzing near me but down here in the wild garden corner, they are all far too busy feasting to bother about a big scaredy like me, thank goodness! Not sure what any of the insects are, nor am I sure what any of the flowers are, apart from the Buddleia. I'll call these huge yellow daisies. Oh wow! The Red Admiral has settled on one of the giant yellow daisies right in front of my camera! I can even see the little blue flecks at the base of the wings now, this really is a gorgeous butterfly! But I'm being called to go and get my coffee right now!  Another Peacock butterfly on the white Buddleia as I'm passing it on my way back to the patio where my reheated coffee is going cold again! I sat down to drink it and that's when we spotted the next target for my camera...﻿ I have asked for a definite identification on this tiny butterfly but I think It's what's known as a 'Small Copper'. It landed on the wooden planters where I have the strawberries. I was so engrossed in butterfly watching this afternoon that I forgot to photograph progress in the greenhouse and garden! I'll need to put them into a separate blog as I seem to have absolutely filled this one with butterflies again. Oops! Until next time,FrugaldomWelcome to Frugaldom﻿﻿﻿﻿Being prepared for entertaining guests and/or providing them with a comfortable place to stay at short notice isn't always easy, especially on a budget. That's why I'm sharing my five top tips for helping you become the perfect hostess!I can also recommend baking on the day your visitors are due to arrive, as there is nothing better than being met by the aroma of fresh bread or cakes and a pot of coffee. (I guess the same tips could apply throughout the house if you were marketing it for sale!)Top Tip #1 - Make the Room Look CleanLook at your room through the eyes of your guest and ask yourself the following questions:Is the floor clean? Are the windows clean? Does the woodwork look clean? Are the light and lamp fittings clean? Is there a layer of dust, soot or pet hair that shouldn't be there?Top Tip #2 - Make the Room Smell FreshThere's nothing worse than an impromptu overnight stay at a friend's house if you have to sleep in musty smelling bedding or a damp, seldom used room. It's enough to put you off even taking a cup of tea from your host, let alone staying overnight with them.Open the windows to air the roomVacuum thoroughly before you dustAir all bedding outdoors if at all possibleKeep pets out of the roomCut a few fresh flowers, even herbs will do, from the garden and have them in a vase rather than use chemical room fresheners.Top Tip #3 - Ensure the Room has all the Basic EssentialsIt's amazing how much more at ease your visitors will feel if they don't need to keep asking where things are or where to put things. Make them feel at home, think of what you need and even what you like most about your favourite holiday accommodation.Clothes hanging spaceBedside table with lampA mirrorA bin - it's amazing how many people overlook something as simple as a bin for use by their guestsA clock - we don't all wear watches or carry mobile devices, you know.Top Tip #4 - Home ComfortsVisitors want to feel relaxed and at ease when staying in a strange house A few home comforts never go astray, so you could consider the following:Clean towelsSpare pillowsAccess to Wi-Fi  (This is particularly important if, like me, you live in an area with no mobile signal.)Refreshments - coffee, tea, snacks (Nobody likes arriving hungry and then asking for something to eat, so don't forget to feed your guests. It's better to be prepared than to starve them.A place to sit other than on the bed - a comfy chair, perhaps?Top Tip #5 - Entertainment and Space to BreathLet's face it, if your guests are going to be staying for any length of time then neither you nor they will want to be in one another's faces twenty-four hours per day. Providing some light entertainment for them is always a good thing.Reading material, perhaps include some local interest stuffRadio, CD player and/or portable TV/DVD player - don't forget to tune in the radio and provide some CDs and DVDsBoard games, crafting materials etc. It's amazing how much fun your guests can have once they know nothing in the room is off limits. Show them what is where and make sure they know it's OK to 'play'House rules - if you have any of these, make a fun wall hanging so it's plain to see. It can have things like allergy alerts, food likes and dislikes, meal times, any rotas, whether or not smoking is allowed in the house plus where to find basic essentials.Freedom to relax, unwind and feel at home - if they are staying awhile, consider making a key to the door available and tell them to bring their slippers.There you have it - five basic tips about how to be prepared for unexpected guests while at the same time, making your guests feel welcome. A visit to a frugal home shouldn't be traumatic, stressful or something to be dreaded - it should be a genuine home from home experience to be enjoyed by anyone who stays.Until next time,Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Butterflies that Flutter by in Frugaldom", "date": "Sunday 18 August 2013", "text": "As Proud as Peacocks  Digital cameras are great inventions, aren't they? Frugal to a fault because we can snap willy-nilly without a care in the world when it comes to developing spools or waiting ten days to see what we managed to capture in our shots. A lunchtime stroll down to the poly tunnel to check on the cucumbers soon became a frenzied run to the house to grab my camera when I spotted all the butterflies fluttering around the Buddleia. These are my favourite butterflies as they are so colourful.   It's the first year I've had this particular plant in the garden. so I didn't know what colour it was going to be. As you can see, it's a white one. I was secretly hoping it would be purple when I was give it, but frugal gifts are frugal gifts - it's now growing like wildfire after just a year in the ground and working its magic with the colourful butterflies!   There were about a dozen Peacocks fluttering around, three on this flower alone when I ran to grab my camera. They were wheeling around, landing on the ground, on the wall, on the hedge, in the borders and on the Buddleia, making for a beautiful display. This one danced in circles around its chosen flower for ages, while the one on the wall nearby was content to sun itself long enough for me to photograph it.  Such a beautiful display of colour and it's all here in the back garden waiting to be discovered and then captured in digital format to be enjoyed by anyone who cares to look. I got some super close-up shots that I am going to save, print and turn into artwork for my bedroom makeover project. The following are a few photos from previous sightings when one of us has been able to grab a camera quickly enough to capture them on screen.   The small blue, which I still think is quite big, is a gorgeous specimen, with its furry body and silvery trimmed wings. This Red Admiral was spotted on the purple Buddleia that appeared growing out of the wall along the side of the patio at the back door.  Wall Browns are abundant about here but they seem to prefer the duller grasses and open areas to the hedgerow and bright flowers.  One of the commonest of all about our garden is the small tortoiseshell. These seem to get in everywhere, including the house, shed and outbuilding.This is the female 'Orange Tip', not to be confused with the big 'cabbage' white butterflies, the larvae of which have just completely demolished the leaves on my cauliflowers and ruined any chance of my growing cabbages this year. The male counterparts of these, as you may have guessed, have orange wing tips in place of the grey. The males have, so far, eluded being caught. (Story of my life!) Perhaps not much to do with money saving and a shoestring household budget but these are the types of frugal occasions that provide inspiration for budget makeovers and artwork plus they make time spent in the garden much more worthwhile when trying to create a wild garden.

{"title": "Changes and Updates on the Frugal Blogs", "date": "Saturday 17 August 2013", "text": "Moving with the Times yet Again.Just a brief note to apologise for any interruptions or strange posts while I am fine-tuning the blog and attempting to tie all the projects in together. Frugaldom and NYK (which stands for 'Now You Know') has been around for a long time and it isn't just about household budgets. It covers a whole range of subjects, each of which can be affected by any sudden changes in financial, home, work or family circumstances. At the nucleus of all our projects - past, present and future - is the fact that we attempt to find ways of making things affordable, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. (This should explain the horse-related stuff that occasionally gets a mention, as one of my challenges in 1997/8 was to show that it wasn't impossible for anyone to own a racehorse - there are always alternatives.) In order to take Frugaldom forward into 2014, we need to be prepared for changing situations with regards to what services are being provided for free and be prepared to move quickly if any of these service providers pull the rug from beneath our feet.  Blogs old and new are being linked by tabs at the top of the blog for ease of use. Ignore any pages that have no relevance to you, but feel free to investigate, comment or ask questions about any of the changes you see being made. Thank you for continuing to visit my frugal blogs, sites and forums. All questions will be answered as quickly and appropriately as possible and I hope you will continue to enjoy visiting Frugal Blog."},
{"title": "A Mystery Dessert and Thank you for my Free Chocolate @Approvedfood", "date": "Friday 16 August 2013", "text": "137 Days and Counting CostsMy latest order from Approved Food* has just arrived and everything was present and correct. It was ordered and paid for before I blogged about the 137 days, so has no impact on my remaining budget, but it does contain some extras along with all the usual stuff, like handy packaging boxes, bubble wrap and free chocolate - this time it's Fairtrade Cadbury's Dairy Milk. The reason this order was placed was to take advantage of the Hovis strong white bread flour.  My local village store sells bread flour but it's well over £1 for a 1.5kg bag and nearly an 8-mile cycle to go any buy it. The opportunity to buy 12kg for a measly £2 is certainly not to be sniffed at, so I didn't sniff, I ordered.  In Frugaldom, homemade bread is usually the only bread available unless you bring your own, so flour is looked upon as an absolute essential. Thank you to 'flourgirl' for pointing out this bargain in the Frugaldom Forum. Extras are difficult to avoid, even the very strictest frugalers can find reason for spending a few pounds extra, especially if it looks like a bargain. I needed a new brush for sweeping the floors, as my old one is almost worn out, so I bought a nice new brush head for £1.49, then popped a roll of bin bags into the order, another 99p. Some people won't consider such things as bargains but those people have obviously never lived in the country where we have no shops other than the local village stores. We tend to pay premium rates for most things and there's a limit to what can be carried in a bicycle basket. Speaking of bicycles, that was my next bargain buy - a pair of leather fingerless gloves for each of us. At 75p per pair, these are both fab and comfy. Things like biscuits and crisps got added, as I really cannot expect house-sharing H to bake his own and I can't bake them at the rate he can eat them, nor would I even try, so this is a small concession, about £5 worth of snacky things by way of assorted biscuits and crisps. I treated myself to six tins of tuna in brine at 99p per tin - something I love but he hates. And now for some rather more far-fetched bargains... mice! £1.20 for two and hopefully no more problems getting the touchpad to work on the laptop when my hands are cold, I'll simply plug in a mouse! Grow some nuts... peanuts, I mean!  These just looked like too much fun to miss, so I got two tins for £1.20 and will keep them for my grand daughters to plant in the hope we can grow some groundnuts, or monkey nuts, as many like to call them. (It's been about 6 years since eldest grand-daughter planted her apple pip and peach stone and both little trees are now growing, safely transplanted to the Frugaldom mini orchard.) What else did I buy? The order came to a total of £32.14 after getting bread flour, spaghetti, tuna, crisps, biscuits, the replacement brush head, bin bags and extras, let me see... oh yes! A toast stamp! I simply couldn't resist this! What with the spare room now being ready for guests, I thought it would be good to invite eldest grand-daughter to come for a weekend to try out what she calls 'her room'. She's very independent for a soon-to-be nine year old, so I know fine well that this will be 39p well spent to make her morning toast extra special after she has helped bake the bread the evening before, don't you think? I'm sure she'll love it! There's one item that would normally have been seen as an extravagance but also one that I know many of my friends wouldn't be able to resist either - a cookery book!  I'd looked at it on Amazon with RRP of £20 reduced to just over £12, so when it I saw it on the Approved Food* site with a price tag of just £2.99 (for a brand new hard back book), I was hooked. If for no other reason, I bought it because it's a manly enough foraging, hunting, gathering cookery book to give to my son, so he has more of a choice of meals than just spaghetti or chicken with rice. I should have read it by the time Christmas gets here, when he'll get it as an extra from Santa! Back on the frugal food train, I did drop something into my basket that I class as a mystery item. It's foreign and I think it must be mix for some sort of Turkish sweet rolls or biscuits. Has anyone else tried these? The packs weigh 400g each and they were being cleared at 8 packs for £1, so I reckoned, 'what the heck, give them a whir'.  My Turkish isn't good, so I'm currently trying to work out what to do with this using an online translator. There are basic photo instructions on the pack but I can't see what the quantities are or what the other ingredients are that need to be added.  OK, the instructions seem to translate into something alone the lines of cook in a small pot with 350ml water, 50g margarine and 25ml oil. Even if the above turns out to be instant mashed sweet potato cakes, 8 bags for £1 is still a whopper of a bargain IF I can decipher how to make them and they turn out edible!  I'm off to experiment in the kitchen with this product now.  I'll be back later, wish me luck!Edited in: Thank you, Tad, for pointing me in the right direction. This is a pre-mix and just needs the water and oil/marg adding, so I'll try making some tomorrow. According to recipes and descriptions for flour Helvas shown on other websites, this product contains nuts. It certainly tastes nutty. (I tried the flour to ascertain whether or not it was just flour or premixed with the other ingredients.) * Denotes a sponsored, affiliated or friend-referral linkChildhood Holiday Memories that will Live on Forever!Frugaldom was invited to share a special childhood holiday memory that still gives a bit of sparkle, so my mind had to regress some years - 40ish years, to be more precise!I've really surprised myself with this one but, unfortunately, I don't have access to any photos that there may have been - I don't ever remember anyone having cameras, which I find strange. Anyhow, a lifelong friend found this photograph and it's the hand-knitted white cardies and hand made floral outfits that awoke a very vivid memory of one particularly fantastic holiday.We used to go away to a caravan but I can't remember much about that, other than the year we went and said caravan had been destroyed in a huge storm. It must have been in the late 60s, because I don't ever remember youngest sis being there. It was a few years after that when we visited a magical holiday resort. I remember it was near the beach, but we had so much fun on the site that we hardly ventured near any sand or sea.We stayed for a week in a chalet; there was mum, dad, my two younger sisters and I in one chalet and aunt, uncle and two cousins in another. The sheer novelty and exhilaration experienced by us children just at being able to walk (or run full speed, as the case may be) to meet up with one another unaccompanied by parents vividly sticks in my mind. So, too, does my first ever experience of a donkey derby! 'Kid in candy shop' does not come close!I remember the funny little saddles with the loops across the front for holding on tight, the throng of cheering parents, the flags, donkeys going everywhere except in a straight line, fun, laughter and not a lot of pace from our long-eared furry, friends. That race day has stuck with me ever since then! In fact, the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that it helped shape my entire life. Now it's not every day you can define such a moment, especially when it involves a donkey! I actually had this drawing commissioned in 1998; it makes me think of that holiday park from all those years ago - how strange the way the human brain computes!The holiday club at the park was fantastic - we were allowed to go there without the adults! Shiny paper, glitter, glue and stars - I always remember the sticky stars and learning to make paper curls using plastic scissors! Memories are flooding back as I type this... a vision of my youngest sister, then almost two, dancing and jumping up and down on the wooden slats of the veranda outside the chalet!The fancy dress party! That just sprang to mind. We weren't prepared for that, so the thrill of being plastered in mum's make up and dressed in an odd array of clothing, flip flops and beach towels made it all the more fun. As for the treasure hunt, well... I remember searching in vain for an acorn and having the freedom to run around what seemed like an entire fantasy world, following clues that involved death-defying search techniques that could have ended in finding a unicorn rather than an acorn! And then the final night party! Awesome! I loved it! I absolutely loved it! And now you know why absolutely everyone I can think of loves a particular movie! Yes, 'that' movie! The one with the holiday of dancing.It was set in a holiday park and it involved fun and music and dancing - and a whole load of other stuff that faces us as we mature into adults, But these holidays stay with us forever and can be experienced again and again and again at any age, each visit bringing something new and exciting, especially when sharing your holidays with friends and family. My belief is that without people such as Billy Butlins, great American movies wouldn't have been half as great when they reached our shores.Wonderwest World photo from WikipediaIn the late 80s, we of the Scottish west got our very own holiday park makeover within easy reach of ﻿﻿home. This fun, colourful and exciting new place became known as Wonderwest World! I even know people who went on honeymoon here!A few years after that, a group of us girls took our own children to a similar park a little further afield ... the east coast of England!  Youngest sis was with us for that trip, too, along with her then 2 year old son. We all had an equally fantastic time - pony trekking, swimming, pedalling boats around the lake, exploring the leafy tracks on big tricycles and sitting gazing in awe at a man dressed as a huge teddy bear, reliving our childhoods and watching our own children doing the same as we had done all those years ago. Looking back, I am so glad that I have these great memories and that I later took the decision to offer such an experience to my own kids. Not so long ago, my daughter introduced her children to the thrill of a holiday resort, so love them or loath them, these holiday park vacations seem to have much more meaning in our lives than many would give them credit. To be honest, they would never have featured on any 'places to go' or holiday list I ever wrote, until now! Now I want to go and find out for myself what a modern-day holiday resort is like. Perhaps it could become a new challenge for Frugaldom, or something else to add to the bucket list.Once again, apologies for lack of photographs, but imagination alone should be sufficient to conjure up the magic, colours, fun, music and laughter associate with an amazing summer holiday loved by a bunch of under 10s. Did the sun shine? I haven't got a clue! We were too busy enjoying ourselves to notice or even care. I may have sat on a soggy donkey for all I know - it really didn't matter because nothing spoils a happy childhood memory.This blog post is my entry into a competition sponsored by Butlins Holiday Parks, helping your family make memories.Balancing the Household BooksHaving just assessed the remainder of my 2013 challenge budget, it's looking quite tight, possibly even in need of some jiggery-pokery!With 137 days remaining and an initial budget of £4,000 to run my household for a year, the law of averages tells me I should still have £1,501.37 to see me through to Hogmanay.The actual amount remaining is £1,219.98 and it is easy to see where prices and costs haven't been behaving themselves very well.GROCERYBulk buying of bargain food stuffs has accounted for a chunk of the money, with only £200.90 remaining of the original £912.50 to see out 2013. That's £10.26 per week to feed two of us plus whoever else visits or comes to stay for a few days. Thankfully, there's plenty of food in the house and the garden seems to be producing something edible, even if it's only courgettes, cucumbers and raspberries at the moment. (I based my figures on £1.25 per person per day for all meals, laundry, toiletry and cleaning products, I thought we deserved a little bit extra since the household had dropped from three to two.)POWERElectricity prices just keep on escalating and with two of us working from home fulltime, that means power being used seven days per week for computers, plus general household use and hot water. We don't have E7 power supply here, so no cheap night time energy. This year, to date, I have fed the meter £700, giving me a current credit balance of £62.92 and £140 left in cash. I am trying to keep within an annual limit of £840, so I have an average of £10.37 per week. This is not good news but at least we do have the logburner installed this year.HEATINGNext up is the fuel for heating - coal and logs. This also provides hot water and heats the radiators but we need to replace the back boiler and have a new fireplace installed. I had allocated £360 for coal and logs. We have been collecting sticks and wood throughout the year to try and help reduce the winter fuel bill, so the log and stick stores are full and there is a pile of logs awaiting chopping. This should keep us going until next year. From that budget, I have £132 remaining, fingers crossed for the September offer from the coal man.MOBILE PHONEWhat can I say? I allocated a budget of £10 to try and keep my ancient phone alive but it died on me through inactivity. We don't have a mobile phone signal here, so I have no real need for a mobile phone. Pity I wasted a fiver keeping it in credit! I now need to find a handset to transfer my sim card into it and retrieve everyone's phone numbers. Still, that's another £5 that I won't need to spend in this category.TELEPHONE AND INTERNETHorrendous how much it costs but I console myself in the fact that it's shared between two of us and it's much less now than I used to pay back in the 90s when I first started surfing the web. With line rental paid up front at a cost of £129 plus the monthly broadband and calls costing around £25.50, I had to call a halt to that and get on to BT to request a reduced package. The new rate kicks in this month, so I am hoping it all balances out at around the £30 including line rental. In 1997, I think I was paying £29.99 a month for access to dial up and we'd still to pay per minute while online! However it works out, I have £157.58 to last the remainder of the year.TELEVISIONAll we have is Freeview and the £145.50 licence paid annually. I could live without TV if push ever came to shove.FOOTWEAR AND CLOTHINGI spent more than  normal in this category because of my holiday trip to Ben Nevis. I couldn't risk going up there without suitable attire, so I bought what I needed... then never wore the jacket or trousers or waterproofs because on the day we climbed that mountain, we were blessed with sunshine. Even sitting on a metre of snow at the summit, the sun shone and no waterproof wear was required. I still needed the gear for getting fit enough to do the walk in the first place and it's all as good as new. It will get more regular use after summer. Plus, I still have £24.85 remaining from the original £100 budget - not bad, all things considered. :)GIFTS AND DONATIONSI allocated £350 to this category. We don't really do birthdays in the family or household, so there's still £276.72 remaining of this, of which most will be spent at Christmas.POSTAGE, DELIVERIES and TRANSPORTThese categories had to be incorporated because this year is my year without a car! Late last year, with the agreement of H, I bought two bikes and challenged us to live without a car after the old one got scrapped. Of course, things are still needed that we can't get out to collect on bikes, so I introduced this section to the budget. It covers any bus, train or taxi fares, petrol costs for friends I might lift-share with and delivery/postage for stuff ordered online. I allowed £240 for this and have spent £111.14 - not too bad compared to the cost of running a car and the spends include my share for the journey to Fort William for our Ben Nevis walk! £128.86 remaining.HOME INSURANCEThis got paid up front at the start of the year, so nothing left to pay on that until next year and 36p change from the £165 costs for buildings and contents.PETS£100 allocated for cat food etc but that budget got a bit messed up as I bought trays of cat food from Amazon while it was on special offer and paid for it using free vouchers I had accrued from Topcashback. As far as the cash allocated is concerned, there's still £81.87 of that left in the kitty. (Not literally!)MISCELLANEOUSThere was a whopping great £337 allocated to 'everything else' and that has been well spent on some great stuff. £71.84 remaining even after paying the frugal holiday with friends and trip up Ben Nevis.Adding all of these balances together amounts to £1,219.98 and from this amount I also want to tick off another two of my lifetime goals that can be done in one hit - to cross the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge and to visit the Giant's Causeway. Planning on taking a friend with me and hope to get over to Ireland within the next month. Budget of £100 estimated.It all looks perfectly possible to me.My 'EEK' challenge takes care of anything else, which pretty much falls under the category of business and covers things like poultry feeding, developing my microholding project and National Insurance, plus the renovations, which we're trying to do on a month by month basis without impacting too much on current savings plans.Finally, I do save loyalty points, always shop via a cash-back site and pay as much as I can on a cash-back credit card but all these extra little dribs and drabs of income contribute to the 'EEK' challenge. They help a great deal across the space of each year, possibly accumulating and extra couple of hundred pounds that I wouldn't otherwise have had. Then there are my LETS points for trading, whenever I get the chance. Every penny and every point counts in this lifestyle and we do this through choice - the choice to be independent and fight our own financial battles, to be free from debt and to lead the kind of life we want.That's my budget taken care of for the rest of the year, lets hope nothing untoward crops up suddenly."},
{"title": "Living Below the Breadline - No Holds Barred!", "date": "Thursday 15 August 2013", "text": "What is it Really Like Living on a Tiny Income?I don't live like this because I can afford to,I live like this because I can't afford not to,That's just the way things are!I'm a fairly laid back, down to earth person who has an irritating habit of not giving a damn about money. Like everyone else I know, certain things raise my hackles and then the soap box can get dragged out and, before you know it, I've gone off on a rant. This is one of these occasions, so beware you faint-hearted, well paid, do-gooders who only ever follow the frugal living lifestyle because you over spent on ridiculous 'stuff'. Some of us may never have earned more than the national minimum wage and many more I know possibly won't ever reach those dizzy heights! But we all need to live and pay our way in this world.So, when someone approaches me and asks me to locate a poor family to interview, I need to ask myself how to define 'poor'? Am I poor? ﻿There's enough work to do about this place to guarantee at least 80 hours of work per week for a long, long time, between web work, DIY, gardening, housekeeping, accounts and seeing to livestock, not to mention blogging! But there's no way I could ever pay myself  £495.20 to do it all. In fact, if I look at the hours put into my lifestyle and the actual cash figure earned, it probably works out at about £1 per hour. Boy, am I poor! (Or, at least, so it would seem to some.)So how is your day going, so far?Mine began with some web work followed by a visit to two lots of neighbours while I was delivering eggs and arranging to do some garden duties. I baked a ginger cake (Ginger Cake Mix 450g, 4 packs for £1 from Approved Food) so there was something to have with this afternoon's cuppa. (Kardomah Cappuccino Break 99p per Kilo, bought 10kg at the start of this year.)I'm so poor that I didn't use a main oven to bake my ginger cake, I used my mini oven, which was bought from a charity shop for £5.00 in 2008, just before my excursion to the Isle of Man. (See Bucket List tab at top of page.)I'm so poor that I'd to have freshly baked crusty loaf served with quail eggs for lunch. I'm so poor that after scoffing the quail eggs on toast, I'd to have some dessert - homemade raspberry ice cream topped with more of those freshly picked raspberries.  Now, as you all should know, satire is right up my street and sarcasm is never considered the lowest form of wit in this household, so I really do have to laugh out loud when I see or hear people whining about being skint when they have a household income of over £1,000 per week. What the heck would someone like me do with all that money? I spend an average of £76.50 each week. Whatever I have left over and above that is for renovating the house, saving towards extras and maybe even some long-term investments. My life may seem boring to some, especially as I can't travel far without a car this year, but I don't need to travel to work. It's right here, at my desk. Cosmetics and beauty treatments aren't my thing but I do like to disguise my silver streaks now and again. For this, there is henna. In fact, it's available via eBay right now with a buy two, get one free option, so I spent a whole £3.57 including P&P on beauty products this afternoon - go me! There's no private pension, no sick pay if I get ill, no huge portfolio of stocks and shares and the interest from my savings is laughable - it amounted to £3.54 this month. But nor do I have a mortgage, rent to pay or children to support any more - my children are up and away, leading their own lives, albeit nearby. I have a half share in a fixy up and follow a frugal lifestyle... it really is that simple. Does this make me poor? Chances are, if you are reading this then you are probably in a similar situation to me and making the most of this golden opportunity of living your life to the max without maxing the life out your money. But look at it from the Government's point of view - on which side of the line do we fall when they're spouting off their nonsense about living wage, minimum wage and average earnings. We who earn so little MUST be affecting those mean numbers, which means the numbers at the other end of the spectrum are off our frugal scales!Having started 2013 with a budget of £4,000 for the year and paying as much as possible up front - home insurance, annual telephone line rental, refilling the log store and, of course, my mountain-walking holiday, I find myself looking at making it through the next 137 days with just £1,219.98 to see me through to 2014. The cost of electricity is the biggest drain on resources but it's also paying for the pleasure and luxury of working from home. I don't think that sounds impossible and I don't think it sounds ridiculous - I think it sounds like a fun challenge!Join me for my next big frugal adventure - stretching the budget to the end of 2013 before starting all over again next year."},
{"title": "Is the Credit Crunch Just a Great Big Myth?", "date": "Thursday 15 August 2013", "text": "The Frugal RevolutionIs anyone really feeling the pinch of the credit crunch or is 'the credit crunch' simply something dreamt up by politicians and fed to the nation via the mass media so we spend, spend, spend on luxuries and leave very little for the bare essentials?Who are the poor and where are they? Can they afford computers or access to the Internet?Unpacking boxes, I came across some paperwork from the 90's and started flicking through it to take a look at some of the prices from back then.2013 - I live in a fairly rural location but still have a 2Mb broadband connection round the clock for a monthly fee of around £25 including my BT line rental. That allows me (or any guests) to connect wirelessly, if we have devices with such capability, and I can buy anything from anywhere at the touch of a button. I'm blogging from my pink 'notebook', which has 6GB of RAM and a 2.5GHz processor - this part means absolutely nothing to me. The laptop comes complete with full colour screen, graphics, video, CD/DVD, inbuilt wireless modem, camera and microphone plus a whole host of other stuff. All I do is switch it on and I'm online and virtually working, shopping, checking my bank balance or reading the news in minutes. It cost less than £400.001994 - The year we got our first computer, but I think it took us three years to pay for it! Need I say any more on this subject? (Please note this is not a photo of the computer we bought, it is just to draw a comparison between then and now - a duration of almost 20 years.)Yes, readers, that really does say £2,375.00 + VAT for colour and on top of that was another £99.00 + VAT for a 9,600bps fax modem, monthly BT line rental, monthly Internet membership fees plus, if I remember correctly, we were charged around 4p per minute for going online to surf the World Wide Web. It was very limiting, as not many people I knew were online at that time. It took until after the release of Windows 95 for me to actually get around to posting stuff online, opening my first proper 'store' in 1998 in a bid to try and offset the costs of being online in the first place. As someone said to me earlier today, \"We adapt and evolve... after a couple of years it becomes normal.\"What lesson did I learn from looking back at my own past? For a start I learned that had I held off and saved to pay cash, rather than buying the computer on interest free credit, then I'd have had a much better computer for far less money!By 1998, it cost me £399.99 for a new desktop computer. By then, Internet access had reduced to 1p per minute plus a monthly fee of £19.99 (plus your BT line rental).The moral of this story is... Technology moves much faster than credit agreements.There's more to come!"},
{"title": "A Frugal Concoction of a Day", "date": "Wednesday 14 August 2013", "text": "Chairs, Cucumbers and Fruit FizzToday has been a mixed sort of a day - web work, some research and updating on a long-standing challenge I once set myself to make a huge piggy bank and fill it... but that tale will keep for a bit longer.  This morning, I had a surprise awaiting me in the shape of another three new chairs! Did I show you the two I got yesterday? Here they are - an old pair of deck chairs that a neighbour would otherwise have taken to the tip. A bit of a scrub and a coat of metal paint should see these as good as new and ideal for entertaining on the patio. Normally, I need to borrow extra seating from next door when visitors arrive for barbecues etc. This morning, I found myself the proud owner of a further three chairs from another neighbour who is scaling down on surplus furniture.  This lovely pair of dining chairs will be incorporated into the sitting room come guest room in place of the huge office chair I have in there at the moment. After my cousin arrived for a few days' holiday last week, absolutely weighed down with more offcuts of fabric, sewing materials and an electric sewing machine, making some seat and cushion covers can now be added to my 'to do' list. There's some lovely red and cream material that should do just the job! Finally, on the seating front, there is this handy, comfy, space-saving, sturdy little folding office chair that, once recovered, should make a fantastic addition to my bedroom. Having been spurred into further action during the Home Improvement Hero challenge, I continued into the next room - my bedroom - to give it a budget makeover. Again, I'll save this for another blog post, as it's a total makeover on a tiny budget. So that's the tale of the chairs, now what's all this about cucumbers and fruit fizz? I had meant to bottle the champagne-style fizz yesterday, but somehow time slipped away from me and I ended up doing other things. Today became bottling day, so I rinsed and scalded everything in preparation. (See post here for how to make this for pennies per bottle.)  The liquid got strained through a sieve and returned to the bucket before ladling it out with a jug and pouring it, via a funnel, through a coffee filter. So far, I have done 5 bottles, but there's enough left for a sixth if I can find a suitable bottle soon enough to use it. The photo of the bottled fizz doesn't reflect the true colour, as this is a real rosy pink and has already started fizzing and fermenting. And now for the cucumbers...  I know I said we were going to have a good crop of courgettes this year, but the cucumbers are also growing at an alarming rate. I popped out to water them while waiting for the fruit fizz to filter and the closer I looked, the more cucumbers I saw. We've already picked and eaten a couple and I gave cousin one away with her for her sandwiches, as she's going off on a frugal campervan expedition this week, but I think I'm going to be looking for ideas of what to do with surplus cucumbers very soon. Some will get traded with neighbours, some will get pickled and as many as possible will get eaten - they are so good - but if they all grow to an edible size, I may need some help!So that was today's adventure in Frugaldom - 'bottling the fruit fizz' got scored off my 'to do' list, several new items got added and I didn't manage to get out cycling or walking. I priced up the spare parts to get my old bread maker back into full service and compared the price with buying another second-hand one via eBay. The second-hand one for spare parts looks like the money-saving option, so that's also been added to my list.Until tomorrow,Frugaldom."},

Two of my plants survived, but they're producing well, despite taking an early battering. I rescued these and transferred them to flexi-trugs on the patio.  ﻿As you can see, two plants make for a massive display, so you need a fair-sized space for them to grow. Mine are doing fine in their pots with about £2 worth of compost in each pot. Seeds were free, as I had them left over from previous years.   Nowhere sells courgettes about here and I was never a fan of them until I began growing my own. Now I know how frugal they are, I won't miss them out in future growing plans, that's for sure. This one plant has already given me two large courgettes and there are another three there that should be ready for picking soon. As long as I keep picking them, the plant will keep producing them until it's worn out - I'll let you know when that happens. In the meantime, I'm cooking with courgettes.  This is for tonight's dinner - I don't even know what it's called but it's all home-grown (some from a friend's garden) and I guess you could call it organic in as far as no chemicals or pesticides get used. I prepared it last night while making dinner using what was left over from the vegetables. INGREDIENTS 1 courgette1 large onion2 beetroots2 large potatoes METHOD Peel or scrub the vegetables then slice them.Arrange them in rows in a roasting tin. (I sat mine in a loaf tin liner to make it easier for lifting them out and to save on the hot water when washing up afterwards.) I drizzled them with oil, covered the tin with foil and then baked the lot in the oven for 45 minutes at 200 deg C. Tonight, they'll get finished off in the oven with some cheese grated cheese over the top and served with grilled chicken. The veggies that didn't fit into the tin were set aside and cooked with last night's meal.  We call anything like this 'Bowl Food'.  In the wok, I stir fried some chicken with onions, courgette, beetroot, sliced potatoes, tomato and basil.  It got seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and some spice mix. Next, I added a pack of savoury rice - 6 packs for 99p from Approved Food* - and boiling water, then left it all simmering until the rice cooked. (Whoever asked if the cheap packs of savoury rice could be fried, the answer is yes.)  Once cooked, it looked like this:    It's a bit of a carb-fest cooking with rice and adding in leftover potatoes but there were only a few slices left over from doing the baked veggie dish. So, that's two meals each sufficient to serve two adults for about £1.35 plus an estimated 40p for electricity for cooking. Chicken price is based on using 225g chicken breast, which costs £5.00 per kilo from Muscle Food* Next up will be courgette and chocolate cake - it tastes delicious! Check out the frugal gourmet tab at the top of this blog and join in the foodie discussions on the frugal food section of the forums. I'm still banging on about bread in there after baking a huge  25p loaf this morning.   * Denotes a link to an affiliated, sponsor or friend-referral page﻿"},
{"title": "Easy to Make, Low Fat, Raspberry Ice Cream", "date": "Monday 12 August 2013", "text": "Today's Flavour of the Day is Raspberry  It's August, we've had plenty of sunshine and the raspberries out in the garden are ripening by the day, so we're picking them as quickly as we can, using what we can and freezing the surplus. This year seems to be a good year for berries.As you know and as I am constantly reminding everyone, we are living in our rural idyll without a car and there are no buses, so treats and delicacies concerning anything frozen need to be home made - can't exactly cycle 8 miles for a tub of ice cream when the sun is beating down. Anyhow, I also mentioned that I'd been given a little battery-operated ice cream maker that originally came from an Avon catalogue (batteries not included), so this is my first attempt at making ice cream in it. Previous ice cream challenges have involved making and using a home made ice cream maker from coffee tins, hand making the ice cream just by stirring it in the tub periodically, making it and allowing it to freeze without stirring it and now this - a battery operated kitchen gadget. If you don't have one of these, don't worry, it's easy to improvise by simply stirring the ice cream every 10 minutes or so while it's freezing. INGREDIENTS﻿250g raspberries150g sugar250ml skimmed milk METHOD 1. Mash the fruit into a jug or bowl. To help things along a bit, I blitzed my raspberries in the microwave for two minutes to slightly stew them and then mashed them with a wooden spoon.2. Add the sugar and then pour in the milk. Mix this all together until the sugar has dissolved. At this point, I used a stick blender and whizzed the mix smooth. 3. Pour the mix into your chosen container or ice cream maker.  4. Place in your freezer and wait. If you are using a machine, it will probably auto stir throughout the freezing process. If you are freezing in an ordinary tub, take it out and stir the contents every 10 minutes to ensure even thawing and minimum ice crystals. That's it! Home made, low fat ice cream for you to enjoy.Managing the DoughUpdate to say that Approved Food* is offering customers the chance to buy 3kg bags of Hovis white bread flour for only 59p or two bags for £1.00 Huge savings to be made here, maximum four bags per customer while stocks last. Today, despite many infuriating interruptions to my broadband connection, I'm making a few changes to the frugal forum and weeding out what is and what isn't needed. (2 x BT vans just drove past the house - good! They must have located the fault.)In the current economic climate, I feel the Frugal Food section is essential. Within this, the bread-making section is very much needed, especially since those of us who live in the more rural locations can't just nip out to a shop and buy a cheap loaf. What do you do for your daily bread?Correct me if I am wrong, but my belief is that the cheapest loaf now costs around 50p from big supermarkets, 80p from Co-ops and well over £1.00 in village stores, so it is has to be well worth considering the costs involved in baking your own by hand or even, if time or space doesn't permit, investing in a breadmaker. I would love to know many of you bake your own bread, so please check out this simple poll and let me know if you are a baker or a buyer. It's much appreciated.I currently have a Lidl's bread maker with twin pans that I was given by someone who didn't like it and had used it only a couple of times. This has been in regular use here for the past couple of years.Although I do still prefer my old (second-hand from a friend who originally paid £5 for it via eBay) Morphy Richards that makes one large loaf, the machine with the twin  pans is able to bake two different loaves at the same time. Despite this, I have yet to perfect my technique, so if anyone has one of these, let me know your thoughts on them - politely. :)In the meantime, I still hold on to my old bread making machine, which must now be quite a few years old. It's kept in storage until such times as I source and buy a new pan and paddle for it. These were the parts that eventually gave up through wear and tear, just at the point where the paddle spindle attaches to the base. It was fixable for a while, but then finally the tiny pieces crumbled into even tinier pieces. This morning, I have had another attempt at fixing it to see if it will still work to any degree. The main machine works fine, it's just the unreliability of the mixing that stopped me from using it. Rather than risk wasting a batch of wholemeal flour and associated ingredient, I have used 1lb of the heavily discounted, past best-before-date, 'Soft Bap Mix' to test if the machine works its way right through the programme. It has been set on 'Fast Bake I', which is the fastest, at 1 hour 10 minutes, so I should be back soon to let you all know if this was a success or a total flop. I'm not too sure what the difference is between soft bap mix and bread & roll mix, so it could go either way - a lesson learned or a late, frugal lunch.Until then,NYK in FrugaldomEdited in - IT WORKED! This is the 1lb loaf baked in the old bread machine using the soft bap mix. The spindle stayed in place, the paddle folded and came out of the loaf, although it took a small chunk with it, and the loaf hasn't sunk in the middle, so it must have mixed OK. I am so happy to see my old bread machine back in use and, better still, I haven't had to buy any spare parts for it. What's more, it tastes delicious! * Friend referral link"},
{"title": "What's Been Happening in Frugaldom?", "date": "Sunday 11 August 2013", "text": "My Weekly Round-UpTaking part in the Home Improvement Hero Challenge inspired me to keep going with the budget room makeovers so, after completing my sitting room for a grand total of £47.58 I decided to move on to the bedroom, with a similar budget. Spurred on by the impending arrival of my cousin for a few days holiday, I was soon scrubbing and painting, vacuuming and dusting, attempting to make the place look a million dollars for next to nothing. Personally, I think the little bedside cabinet looks great after some scraping and scrubbing then the addition of some cheap stickers.Overall, it has been a dry and sunny week here in Frugaldom so when cousin arrived on Tuesday, we set up the barbecue and ate outdoors again. We had great fun toasting marshmallows over the last of the glowing embers and we each managed to drop gooey, warm mallows off the end of the skewers - not good when your washing machine has gone 'bang'!The local fix-it man took to his bed with a dose of the shingles, so he hasn't been able to travel to Frugaldom to investigate the washing machine fault, so I (hopefully) invested in a foot pump operated washer/spinner, which duly arrived mid-week. This has proven to be a most entertaining gadget and it did, indeed, remove the melted marshmallow from my breeks! Many smalls have been sloshed and spun this week in a bid to catch up with laundry.Cuz brought a load of perennials with her, so we got all of these planted into the borders and then picked more blackcurrants. Adding these to the raspberries and rhubarb that was picked, I got a batch of frugal fruit fizz started off in a recycled bucket. This will be ready for bottling by Tuesday and I should get about 6 bottles for a total cost of around £1, as the fruit is free from the garden.I had a bit of a batch cookathon, so have now added several cartons of stewed fruit, four lots of lasagne and some fruit crumble to the freezer stock. I slow cooked a pheasant and have a batch of game soup and there's enough meat left over after this evening's game and mushroom casserole to make pie filling, which will also go into the freezer for later use.Over the past week I have traded duck and hen eggs for cherry cake, mushrooms, peppers, onions, potatoes, beetroot and a big bunch of spring onions. I supplied mint, basil and parsley from the garden to a neighbour, we dug the first of our garden potatoes, picked the first of the courgettes and ate the first of the cucumbers that are growing in the new poly-tunnel. I forgot to take a photo of it when I picked it, so this is one taken last week.We sat outside until gone midnight on Thursday counting shooting stars, watched the International Space Station fly overhead twice, saw the Japanese cargo vessel HTV-4 fly overhead and I lost track of what else we were able to see in the black of night by simply looking up at the amazing sky with the Milky Way stretched out above us.I spent a grand total of £25.28 with £20 of this being the fee for sending off a replacement photo for my driving licence. (Photo was taken at home by digital camera and printed on photo paper we have in stock, s no extra expense there.)Having taken part in a Budget Bucket List blogging competition recently, I decided to create a new page for my current list on here; it now has its own tab at the top so it's easily found and updated. Not only that, I also added in my frugal gourmet page and plan on rounding up all my foody blogs into one tidy area. When living on a budget of £4,000 for a year with £1 per person per day to cover all food, it helps to know where to find simple food concoctions. (It's a great challenge and one that is so much easier got those who live within reach of a supermarket.)Finally, I have yet another new toy to play with this coming week...It's a little battery operated ice cream maker that my mum got from Avon some time ago and then never used. It had been lurking at the back of her cupboard, so she's given it to me to see if I can master the art of frugal ice-cream making. I never have cream, so mine will need to be diet ice-cream. Should be fun!Until next time,NYK in Frualdom."},
{"title": "Introducing Frugal Blog to Bloglovin", "date": "Saturday 10 August 2013", "text": "Follow my blog with BloglovinYou can now follow my Frugal Blog with Bloglovin.One more tiny frugal step forward in this vast network of blogs, forums and websites.Simple, Delicious and Ever so Slightly AlcoholicIt's the time of year when we find fruit and berries aplenty. The orchard fruits may not quite be ready for harvesting but many of us have accumulated a glut of rhubarb, raspberries, currants and even strawberries so we need to preserve what we can for the winter months. My poor gooseberry bushes succumbed to the nasty little Sawfly caterpillars, so the berries I did have were added to blackcurrants to make jam. All of the above can be used to make jam and jelly but it's nice to bottle up something with a bit of fizz for the festive season. WHAT WE NEEDA clean bucket1kg berries or fruit1kg sugarLemon (or lemon juice)Small cup of vinegar5 litres of waterSuitable bottles - screw top fizzy drinks bottles work fineSterilise the bucket as best you can - I rinse everything with boiling water before using it. Rinse the fruit and place all of it in the bucket along with the lemon (washed and sliced, not peeled) or lemon juice, sugar and vinegar. I prefer to boil my water before adding it, but many people don't bother doing this. Pour the water over the fruit and stir until all of the sugar has dissolved. You'll find that most of the fruit floats but it doesn't take long for the colour to begin flowing. This one looks a rich red, as it's made up of rhubarb, blackcurrants and raspberries.My bucket of choice this year is one that came with a resealable lid and originally contained 50 seed/fat balls for the wild birds. (These are also ideal for holding laundry 'gloop'.)Cover your bucket with a tea towel or similar to protect the contents from flies, dust etc and then sit it aside for a few days to infuse. I give mine a stir each morning. The resulting liquid can be bottled from as early as day three. Sterilise your bottles as you would jam jars, I like to rinse mine out with boiling water then dry them in the oven - a job best done after having finished cooking dinner so you don't need to go to the expense of heating the oven specially. Again I use the boiling water method to clean a large jug, sieve and funnel, then decant the fruit mix from the bucket through the sieve and into the jug. From here, it gets poured into the bottles via the funnel lined with a coffee filter, before sealing the bottles. These should then be sat somewhere cool and safe, where the process of natural fermentation can work its magic. Your fizz should be good to drink after as little as ten days but it keeps much longer, in my experience, as we have only just finished last year's batch. You do need to keep releasing excess pressure from bottles if you want to ferment this to a more potent alcoholic beverage and please do remember that it is mildly alcoholic and not a soft drink for children, despite how the final product tastes. This time around, I am reusing my recycled clip-top bottles, of which I now have five, and screw top fizzy drinks bottles for any surplus.  You can also make this drink using elderflowers, red clover, honeysuckle blossom or virtually any other fruit or edible flowers, just adapt the amounts accordingly. For example, only use about a dozen strongly scented elderflower heads or quarter of a bucket of red clover heads. (I have never actually weighed flowers when using them.)You can also use a mixture of elderflower and red clover or any combination of mixed fruit and flowers you prefer. Having tried several different combination, There still hasn't been one that wasn't agreeable - they all tasted lovely, especially chilled and shared with friends. I shall update this post as my champagne-style fizz gets fizzing. Frugaldom."},
{"title": "We Love Frugal Food! From 5p Soup to Mixed Fruit Crumble", "date": "Friday 9 August 2013", "text": "It's Time for the Game to Begin!Tomato and Pheasant Make a Good Game Soup This is a homemade soup I first blogged about in 2011, so you may already have a similar recipe. However, it's getting to 'that' time of year again, so I thought I would make myself a big pot of this over the weekend; there's a pheasant in the freezer needing used up before the new game season is upon us. This also gives me the chance to compare prices between now and 2011. I normally slow cook meat so all of the juices remain in the crock pot. Any oil, fat or grease can be skimmed off once it's cold. Everything remaining goes back into the slow cooker along with any leftover vegetables you may need to use up rather than send them to the compost or wormery. I like to simmer my stock on a low heat for a few hours overnight, so it's best to use a timer.Rinse a 500g pack of broth mix and a cupful of butter beans, then you can also leave them soaking in cold water overnight. I notice that the broth mix has increased in price to 75p/500g but there are still offers around where you can stock up at £1 per kilo. In the morning, the stock gets strained and then returned to the slow cooker, along with a couple of diced onions and carrots, the broth mix, butter beans and a tin of chopped tomatoes or equivalent - passata, home grown tomatoes or tomato paste. This time, I am using 100% tomato paste!This is the 4.5kg tin of tomato paste I bought from Approved Food for just £1.99! It also works well as a base for turning the end slices of homemade bread into frugal, speedy pizzas and for making up the likes of Bolognese, lasagne or chilli. It can even be used to make tomato ketchup.Season your soup with salt and pepper then leave to simmer until all the beans, peas, lentils and barley are tender. That's it, that's the frugal game soup of the day and it works equally well using a shin of beef, although this would add to your costs, as there's no main meal beforehand from a shin of beef.The pheasant cost me nothing, as I had traded other home produce for it, so any stock from leftovers is an extra bonus after having the roast dinner.Broth mix and pulses are always bought on special offer, when it's best to stock up on them for the winter months. I reckon they cost me no more than 50p in total. Butter beans, however can be swapped for something else, as these have gone over £3 per kilo. I'll be using a tin of kidney beans added in the later stages of cooking.Store's basic passata costing 23p in 2011 is now 29p, but you only need half a carton so you can use the other half for frugal pizzas. Onions, carrots and potatoes would normally be home-grown, but if you need to buy them then they'll probably cost less than 50p in total for what you'll useAt a rough estimate, 4.5 litres of soup will cost around £2.00 including the cooking time if you are buying all the ingredients, or around £1 if you are using home grown and bulk bought bargains.  Regardless of how you choose to source your ingredients, 20 portions of soup for £2.00 makes for a fairly frugal and nutritious meal. 10p per portion can be halved to 5p if you are of the frugal living ilk. This soup freezes well and makes for ideal soup and pudding lunches.  Speaking of pudding, the blackcurrants are still going strong and I am still using up rhubarb, so I stewed these two together today and turned one lot into crumble and the rest went into the freezer.  Quite a bit of sugar gad to be added to this, so it will be much more frugal to stew once the apples are ready for picking - they add some natural sweetness to the mix.  Raspberries are growing in abundance now, so I have several tubs of those already frozen and we are gathering about 250g per day from the bushes in the garden. These are being frozen as they get picked, apart from the ones that get eaten as a cold dessert or else lightly stewed into sauce for having over ice cream. It has definitely been a foody sort of a day today!  The cooked mince with tomatoes got made into four lots of double-portion lasagnes. These will go into the freezer later tonight and they'll do for speedy meals or else for H having when I'm away on my next jaunt. More on that soon. Finally, I may or may not have already mentioned that I have acquired a small ice-cream maker, so this is going to be experimented with over the weekend. I'm not sure where doing work on the bedroom makeover is going to fit into the equation but for now it's fairly presentable, so no need to worry about that. I want to make ice cream! The results of the #BudgetBucketList blogging competition got announced this afternoon and, although Frugaldom didn't feature in the final line up, it was lovely reading the winner's blog post and her plans for how to spend the £2,000.00 she won. You can read the winning blog here.  The bucket list has spurred me on to complete my next affordable item this year, so I am now planning my trip and will, hopefully, walk across the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge before my next birthday. After that, I'm on my way to the big 50! Still debt free and living this good life, so never give up on your dreams. Most things are achievable on a smaller budget than many would believe possible. Frugaldom Your Money and Your Life - Literally!HighwaymanI've recently returned from a trip away for a few days, one that took me to a place many would call civilisation. By this, I mean I left the relaxed atmosphere of my tranquil little lane in this rural idyll and crossed over into the modern world. Don't get me wrong, we are quite modern here - we now have broadband speeds of almost 2Mb, power failures occur mainly during bad weather and it's only a mile's walk to the main road, where a bus passes twice a day. But a few miles away, in nearby suburbia and urbania, I really do hope the citizens there have adequate insurance!Not once, but twice in the past I have found myself the subject of identity theft, I have experienced three burglaries at the homes of family members, one car theft and I've even had a horse stolen. A friend had her cylinders of gas stolen, another had their oil-tank drained while elsewhere there are poultry and pet thieves! It's getting beyond ridiculous, what with all these citizens' rights, unintelligible laws, red tape and few rights left for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves or their property.If your dog bites an intruder, you could be sued and your dog the subject of a humane destruction notice. If you tackle a would-be thief, you can find yourself charged with assault. If you try to protect your property by means that could inflict injury to any chancer trying to break-in, you could face prosecution. Insurance is our safest option, whether it's buildings, contents, pets, cars or our own lives. We of the frugal living ilk may think we have few possessions worth stealing, but we need to reassess this situation and look much more closely at what we have, rather than what we have not. (Can one insure against being sued by a burglar, I wonder?)Now we have 'apps' for everything - online applications that involve our real lives. Mobile phones have instant access to global networks at the push of a button, they have cameras, they may carry all your personal information, your apps can be password linked directly to your bank accounts, credit cards, debit cards, online stores and all manner of home and family associated information. Likewise with desktops, laptops, palmtops, tablets, games consoles, e-book readers and smartphones. Even portable media players are Wi-Fi enabled for quick access to electronic wizardry. Blackberry pickingPlease, just for a few minutes, do consider the implications of losing your most important 'gadget' - it could be stolen, lost, fall in the sea, dropped on the road, run over by a bus... any number of possibilities exist. How much of your life are you carrying about with you and how much are you leaving at home in an empty house? How much would your life be affected, even temporarily, and at what cost to make good any losses? In real financial terms, how wise is it to insure something that may be costing you hundreds of pounds each year to guarantee your personal convenience at the push of a button?Your money and your life really are in your hands if you own any type of modern technology. It looks as though insurance is our best choice, especially if we let vigilance, safety or security slip. With this in mind, I think we should be looking at frugal security measures to help protect our futures because even the fruit and vegetables in our own gardens could become the target of thieves during times of need. If this wasn't the case, sheep rustling wouldn't be on the increase in some areas!Frugaldom.Photo credit: JLM Photography. / Foter / CC BY-NC-ND (Blackberry picking)"},
{"title": "Laundry With a Difference - Review of the 'Twister'", "date": "Friday 9 August 2013", "text": "Footpump Action Washer and Spinner! I've been playing with my new toy, the Ventus Twister.  Having done some quick research about easier ways of hand-washing than turning your hands into fat white prunes, I learned of this device online and then quickly discovered that others had done similar research and had devised all sorts of contraptions using commercial salad spinners. These, however, proved to be far too expensive for a frugaler, as did the £60 or so price tag on the 'Twister'. (I ended up paying £29.95 + delivery for mine via good old eBay.) First appearances: It's much bigger than I had anticipated. I was imagining a tiny pedal bin barrel with a salad spinner inside, but this actually holds 14L of water in the main washing chamber. At the time of trying this, we had a power cut while upgrade work was going on in the area, so I had to do a cold wash (no hot water) and chose the filthy bath towel that I'd used to soak up the water from my flooded washing machine after it went 'bang'. Using cold water was through necessity, as the power outage lasted 6 hours. Using the shower cabinet as a mini wet room, I got the towel into the basket, added some homemade laundry 'gloop', left it to soak for 5 minutes and then got started with the 'foot pump' action, which is surprisingly easy to do! It didn't take long to froth up the water, despite it being cold!Pumping the water back out the 'bin' was easy, then same thing as above but without the 'gloop' until the suds were gone and water was running clear. The 'Twister' stays put (I was expecting to be chasing it around the shower base) thanks to the suction pads on the bottom of it, although I'm not sure how well these would work on grass in a wild camping situation. Then it's spinning time... suggested at 50 to 60 half-size foot pumps per minute! This does get the basket fair whirling around and all the excess water was removed from the towel, which was impressive - no dripping wet towel to carry out to the line - but I still gave it a hand wring before hanging it on the line. As you can see, despite it being a cold and quick wash, the towel came out fairly clean and dried quickly in the sunshine and breeze. Most impressed, as I wasn't expecting a towel to fit into the basket.As soon as the power was restored, I tried a warm wash, just filling straight from the shower. I discovered that by removing the shower head, the flex fitted perfectly into the inlet hole of the 'Twister', so that was ideal, especially with the aid of an electric shower and all the varying water temperatures available!The clothes were left soaking for a few minutes before starting the washing process. I'd easily know how well this works because the leggings and tea shirt I had in got a bit messed up when I accidentally dropped a skewer of toasted marshmallows on them! (Yes, we were barbecuing again!)Washing, rinsing and spinning completed with a small load comprising leggings, t-shirt, undies and jammies - quite a bit more than what I was expecting to fit into this - and all hung out to dry. They were clean!This is a great little contraption, BUT... I am going to share the things that should be considered before rushing off to spend your hard-earned cash on a washer that needs no power supply. In characteristic fashion, I am beginning with the cons, as opposed to the pros, because that's the way my mind works.CONSThese could NOT be used indoors on the kitchen floor, for example, because the water needs somewhere to drain away.It needs to be next to a source of water, although there is a length of hosepipe supplied.It isn't big enough to wash a duvet cover - but I'll no doubt try to cram one in, as I'm a bit daft that way!It doesn't spin all the water out of the clothes, only enough to allow you to lift them out without them dripping all over the floor.It's too big to cart on a bike along with all the other camping gear you would need if going alone - you'd need at least one other bike to help.Possibly uses much more water than an ordinary machine - I reckon you could easily get through 40 litres in one small wash, so not water meter friendly if you have one of those to consider... unless you recycle the water.Clothes take longer to dry than if they had been spun in a machinePROSMoney saving on electricity - no power supply is needed so this works anywhere you have access to water.It's fairly lightweight for packaging into a caravan or car boot if you're going camping, or even onto the back of a bike if several of you are going camping.The foot pedal is easy enough to be operated by hand.14 litres of water is quite heavy for carrying but I think it's light enough to sit on a sturdy draining board or in the sink, if you have one big enough, or even the bath. The hose pipe would reach from tap to washer, just make sure the drainage tube drains anywhere except onto your floor.Small capacity still allows for a full set of lightweight summer clothing, meaning you could do an electricity-free mini-laundry every day after an overnight soak and reserve your electric machine, if you have one, for larger and heavier stuff like bath sheets, bedding, jackets and jeans.Easy to utilise the rinse water for garden and plant-watering, assuming you aren't filling this with chemicals. Hmm... I wonder if I should use it in the polytunnel? That would certainly help the cucumbers!Makes you appreciate modern conveniences, sunshine, the summer breeze and the great outdoors in a fun-sort of a way. I can always hang my washing in the polytunnel if it's raining!I'm guessing these could help save money on nappies if you're using terries rather than paying for disposables.So there we have it - a simple, plastic contraption that may save you money on  electricity and could help water your garden while encouraging members of the household or family to play at doing laundry outdoors. I'll let you know how it copes with whites, but I don't have many as these are considered anti-frugal by me. :)I'll keep on spinning,Frugaldom."},
{"title": "A Washing 'Machine' for Campers", "date": "Monday 5 August 2013", "text": "Portable Washing Machine / Spin Dryer - Pedal Powered No Mains Required!* HALF PRICE * WAS £59.95 NOW £29.95This may be one of the silliest things I'll buy during 2013 and I do hope that it hasn't been done in vain, as it's a tiny item that is costing more than it has cost to give my entire bedroom a makeover!  When the washing machine went bang and I was left hand washing my 'smalls' every night, my hands were beginning to look like white prunes. As for my nails, well... they are very clean, that's about all I can say in their favour. The search began for a cheap and cheerful alternative, rather than diving in with both feet to invest in a new washing machine. I want to at least give the old one the opportunity of being fixed - but the local 'fix-it' man is ill and can't get to us until he's fully recovered. I may even start taking the machine to bits myself, but not having the correct tools could be a bit of a pain. Keep in mind my recent 'airing of the tent' escapades and my passing thoughts of 'wouldn't it be fun to have a camper van', then consider several more power cuts in our area and you can see where all this is leading. You got it - off grid alternatives!We do have a stream running through the bottom of our garden but the thought of slapping clothes off rocks on a daily basis is a little too far-fetched, even for the likes of me.  Search Lotto is my friend - it's my free ticket to the Lotto millions, so off I went in search of an alternative to an automatic washing machine, something to save my poor hands until I have my machine fixed. (Or replaced - perish the thought!) I found the Ventus 'TWISTER' Pedal Powered Portable Washing Machine, as seen on TV's 'The Young Apprentice'. On closer examination, the price tag on most of the camping store sites and, even, Amazon, made it look ridiculously expensive, but I then spotted those magical words displayed on an eBay advert - * HALF PRICE * WAS £59.95 NOW £29.95 *  The description included things like:Just fill with water, add clothes (ideal for underwear...) add a little washing powder and pedal gently for a few  minutes.You get clean clothes, and a little exercise!No power bill / No batteries / No inconvenience!Uses water sparingly and efficiently.Perfect for camping / caravanning / power outages / or simply use at  home when a small  load does not justify the cost or energy of your regular electric  machine.Well, I was won over almost instantly, but with an alternative thought in mind!To all intents and purposes, this looks like a glorified salad spinner housed inside a small pedal bin, so I am assuming it is going to be tiny. I have a 3 litre plastic bowl, looking at that I suspect that the 4 litre interior basket of this pedal-powered gadget won't hold very much, but should be large enough to 'rinse one's smalls of an evening'. I figure I'll be setting up said contraption in the corner of the shower, for ready access to hot and cold water, rather than using it outdoors. Of course, during sunny, summer days and doing a cold rinse, it will be ideal for doubling up as a garden watering device, as the amount of soap used will be minimal. (This is the plan, to date.)The other wacky idea I had is developed from my desire to create a 'tiny house' come bird hide come mini-summer house in what will, one day, become the secret garden. All of these handy little gadgets should be ideal for next year's summer camp if 9 year-old grand daughter decides that it sounds like fun to camp out at granny's!I'll follow up this blog post with a second one as soon as my clothes washing salad spinner arrives, letting you know how I get on and how well it performs. In preparation, I have made a fresh batch of frugal laundry cleaner.Until then, best wishes from a prune-fingered Frugaldom."},
{"title": "The Household Guide, Edited by Aunt Kate", "date": "Saturday 3 August 2013", "text": "A Charity Shop Gift to MyselfWho can resist a good book?Recently, I found myself wandering around a large thrift/charity shop in a small place named Ballantrae. (If the name sounds familiar, it could be because of the Robert Louis Stevenson book, 'The Master of Ballantrae'.) It's known as 'BRICC' - Ballantrae Rural Initiative Care in the Community - Ltd. (Further details can be found here.) The shop was packed full of old furniture, crockery, ornaments and the usual shelves of books, CDs and DVDs. The friend I was with is as much a book addict as the rest of us and loves nothing more than a good bargain, so were there for quite some time.  While sifting through the titles that lined the corner walls of this shop, I happened to spot a copy of 'The Household Guide', an old hardback with the spine missing - it had obviously seen better days, or had it been extremely well-used, perhaps? Flicking through the pages, it showed the date 8th January 1943 and the index read like a list from the ultimate frugaler's handbook! I was hooked on the old book, so paid my £1 and brought it home. What a revelation it is to read such old treasures, written back in the day when being a housewife was a career choice and being thrifty was what the War years were all about, except that's when everything changed forever.  My lovely old book contains handwritten notes, recipe sections for preserves, wines, sweets, desserts and all manner of meals. There's a month by month guide to what to do in the garden, a section on simple DIY and home decorating, a beauty section, home doctor section, pet care and, most importantly, a housewife's calendar that outlines the order in which things need doing about the house, along with a daily time-table! This will be a real eye-opener for many, as the day begins at 7am and ends at 9pm. But then again, most busy working mums still have days that stretch over 14 hours, often even more than that, depending on the demands of younger family members. Some of the articles included are absolute gems! I shall quote a few bits and pieces as I read my way from cover to cover - there's plenty of useful information regarding homemade cleaning products, stain removal, spend and save tips plus the sewing and shopping sections. What I am finding most entertaining, if that is the correct word to use, is the whole aspect of etiquette and how one should treat one's husband, friends, relatives and other visitors. Most enlightening!  At the very back, inside the cover, there is a handwritten knitting pattern for 'Gloves on 2 Needles' but, sadly, this has faded over time and may only be legible with the use of a magnifying glass. (Or it could be my eye sight just isn't what it was.) I'll let you know if I can ever decipher it. To round off this post, here are the \"GOLDEN RULES FOR HOUSEWIVES\".A place for everything and everything in its place.Don't put off till tomorrow what should be done today.Make the most of what you have. Don't worry about what you could do if you had this or that.Clear up as you go along and you'll never find yourself in a muddle.I think the above rules make good sense, don't you? Until next time,Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Frugal Bucket Lists and the Budget Bucket List", "date": "Friday 2 August 2013", "text": "Bucket List on a Budget This is another of the exciting blogger contests hosted by the guys at moneysupermarket.com, which means you can read all the other entries (or take part yourself) by looking for the hash tag #BudgetBucketList on Twitter and Facebook or by checking out the competition rules here. People laugh at me and my lists - I have them for everything from the steps I follow in my pursuit of a frugal life to renovating and decorating the fixy-up house, going places, doing things and, basically, spending in any way, shape or form. Overall cost is the major contributing factor in how things get prioritised for me, but my lists are rigorously maintained and always adhered to in an effort to pack as much into life as possible.When I saw the chance to blog about the subject of budget bucket lists, I thought it was great - even if it was a last minute write-up for me. I always have my lists to hand.Ignoring things like buying a cottage in the country, growing my own fruit & veg and keeping chickens and ducks in an orchard through which a stream runs, and aside from things like owning racehorses, meeting superstars and having one's own personal trainer, housekeeper and chauffeur driven car, my list is quite random, I'd say. ﻿The summit of Ben NevisUnder normal circumstances, my long-standing list would have included wanting to climb a mountain, but living in Scotland made this a fairly frugal choice. At the end of May 2013, I joined a group of friends at a hostel in Fort William and we all walked up Ben Nevis on an absolutely glorious day that allowed us every possible view. No amount of money could have booked such fantastic weather, so I count this as being one of my major goals achieved - and ticked it off my bucket list. So now I need to move onto the next of my less expensive goals...Visit the Giant's Causeway and walk across the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge.﻿﻿ Giant's Causeway  North Coast Photographic / Foter / CC BY-NCThe trip to Ireland is relatively inexpensive from here, as I live only 25 miles or so from the ferry port of Cairnryan. I can simply cross to Ireland as a foot passenger on the ferry and then catch the tour bus from Belfast that will take me to my chosen destinations. The day ticket currently costs only £32 per person. In all, I am expecting this entire adventure to cost me under £100 but I haven't managed to arrange dates or times to suit my travel companion. Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge: Samyra Serin / Foter / CC BY-NC-SA﻿The main hold-up is getting to Cairnryan for 7am, as I don't have a car and, as many of you know, don't live on a bus route - not that the buses run at those times, even from the nearest village. Around £50 of my costs will be on taxis to and from the ferry port but I think it's a small price to pay for what I would consider a once in a lifetime experience. Here's what's included in the day trip to the Giant's Causeway, with lovely photos of the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge.﻿Photo credit: spodzone / Foter / CC BY-NC-NDOn the not-so-frugal bucket list is my desire to witness the awesome spectacle of the Northern Lights. So many friends have been to see Aurora Borealis, including trips to the Scandinavian countries at what was deemed appropriate or probable times of year, but to no avail. We are all in agreement that in order to witness such a magical, yet natural, phenomenon, it takes longer than a weekend or even a week long holiday - it means being there for long enough to witness the event. September through winter to early March are the months with potential for spotting the aurora, but there is no way that I can just pack my bags and go exploring the north for 6 months - or is there? I started looking at the possibilities for real - how much would it cost?Going self-catering can cost from about £300 to £550 per week and that's a huge amount of money if it takes until March to even glimpse the Aurora - over £15,000 if I average the costs and include normal day-to-day living expenses plus transport. I do watch for Aurora alerts but it's impossible to book accommodation and then get there at short notice. But then again, not even by taking the 6 month option can anyone guarantee you will catch sight of the Northern Lights. For another few thousand pounds I would far prefer to buy a fixy-up property - something like this -  and then share it with everyone else who wanted to Aurora-watch. I'd have been on the first available ferry to the Shetlands had I been in the financial situation to do so when the above property was available! A small fortune needed to renovate but what a place to be if the Aurora Borealis put on a magnificent display! I'd then offer it for frugal, but phenomenal, winter breaks for those who couldn't normally afford such luxury. Back in the real world, £1,000 would afford me to take a friend / companion camping to the northern-most point of the Scottish mainland for at least a month, perhaps in October, with the outside chance of catching sight of the lights.Those are my chosen bucket list items - nothing far-flung that involves Atlantic crossings or sandy dessert adventures. Walking the Machu Picchu trail sounds fascinating, climbing to Mt Everest base camp sounds awesome and exploring Egypt's great pyramids looks fabulous. A fun-time looks possible in Florida with a trip to Disney, a visit to one of Canada's great 'Stampedes' or even visiting all the natural wonders of the world, as depicted by sites like Seven Natural Wonders, but these don't feature on my bucket list and if they did, they would come much further down any list than witnessing Aurora Borealis.A bit of travel insurance and life insurance wouldn't go amiss, perhaps a funeral plan so my kids don't have any worries when I eventually pop my clogs but these things are being attended to along the way. My bucket list is purely about experiencing the thrill of life before death catches up and I hope to be rattling my bucket for a long time, yet. There are certainly plenty of mountains to climb, islands to explore and spectacular skies at which to gaze right here in Scotland. Apologies for the last minute-ness of my entry, but I got the chance of a few days away over this past week and grabbed the opportunity, so I only got back last night. I also apologise to Gnat Bottomed Towers, Silver Sewer and the Frugal Handmade Home for leaving them not much time to type up their posts. Good luck, guys! :)Frugaldom. Edited in: I have noticed that many of the entrants into this competition have listed full bucket lists rather than just one budget item and one expensive item, so I feel it right to tag on the fact that my list has been long and included much of what others have written. However, it would appear that I have already achieved a great deal and that if I'd to die tomorrow, which I guess is the main point of a bucket list being completed, my biggest concern would be having my house in order by way of paperwork to avoid a messy estate. So much has happened during nearly 50 years of my life - I now feel a little guilty in not always recognising these things as having the potential to be other people's dreams. The far-flung travel and adrenalin-rush stuff aren't really me, but I now also realise that we each experience things differently and what some perceive as 'normal', or even 'mundane', by way of life experiences, others can only dream of and see them as thrilling possibilities.  Thank you to all for reminding me that even the smallest of achievements in our lives should never be taken for granted - they should be appreciated and recognised for their importance as life-defining moments.Second Edited-In Addition:The winners are listed here but I don't know how to find their competition blog posts as I don't know their Twitter usernames, sorry. http://www.moneysupermarket.com/life-insurance/competitions/budgetbucketlist/"},
{"title": "Moneysupermarket.com and the #HomeImprovementHero Competition", "date": "Sunday 28 July 2013", "text": "Is it possible to change the look, feel and even functionality of a room on a £50 budget? (Yes, it is!)My decorated pin board. ﻿﻿The view that greets me.DIY will always be the 'in thing' for those of us living on a tight budget so when I was asked by Moneysupermarket.com to take part in their Home Improvement Hero competition for bloggers, I was rather excited by the prospect, despite the fact that I didn't actually have a fully renovated room to decorate! When someone asks, \"Can you create something memorable in your home with a budget of £50?\" and then gives you £50 to try it, the challenge is most definitely on, so here goes!This is the room that I've chosen to give a frugal makeover. I'm almost certain that most folks already have a proper wall to decorate, so excuse us while we put that back together after having had a stove fitted a few months ago.  This is my room for transformation - it's a multi-functional room in as far as it's my sitting room, office, crafting room, dining room and spare room, plus it also serves as a dumping ground. If I can turn this room around on a budget of £50, I'll be over the moon! I started by researching what was needed to complete the chimney wall, as employing a joiner was out of the question, then hit the online stores (Amazon) via my favourite cash-back site. My first purchase was fire cement, hopefully enough to complete the job that needed doing. Meanwhile, my long-suffering, often bemused house-share set to work raking out bits and pieces from the out-building and shed that could be used to help cut costs. Because we are in the midst of a renovation, there are plenty of bits and pieces lying about the place, mainly salvaged leftovers from joinery or building work that has been done. I opted for the 'mosaic effect' with the plaster board when reinstating the chimney wall, rather than buying a full new sheet. It is insulated/foil backed plaster board that the joiner OK'd to fit on the chimney wall, as there's already a steel plate fitted in the area subject to the greatest heat. (Frugal choice - the metal radiates more heat when the stove is lit and it can't bend, crack or break.) Plasterboard, should you need any, is relatively inexpensive and can be bought from most builders' merchants from around £5 per 8' x 4' sheet. There was still a hole in the wall around the stove flue pipe, so I needed strong wire mesh to bridge the gaps and give grip to the fire cement. This problem was solved by using the leftover grill mesh that had been saved from a disposable barbecue. (I hate throwing anything in the bin that could find a future use and this is a prime example of waste not, want not.) Here in Scotland we don't tend to finish off our new walls by plastering, we often opt for taping and filling the joints and then just sanding them. The tape costs less than £5 a roll and the jointing plaster costs about £1.30 per kilo of the mix-it-yourself variety and we had some of each already, so no need to buy.While contemplating how to decorate the chimney wall, I decided that the old radiator, amongst other things, needed smartening up a bit, so I bought a little tin of radiator enamel (£2.99), a wall transfer/decal (£3.79), a roll of wallpaper (£10.85), packet of paste (£1.55), a pasting brush (£2.27) and a tube of gold-coloured artists' paint (99p). If anything seems expensive, it's because I don't have a car, so I need to order online and account for delivery costs.  My nest of tables have been with me since 1992 and have gone from house to house for many moves, so it's safe to say that they had seen better days. It's funny how some things have more sentimental value than others, isn't it? This table is one I rehomed when a neighbour was planning on sending it to the tip. (We used it at last weekend's barbecue.) As you can see, it isn't all that different from my old nest of tables, so I set about preparing everything for painting.  Scraper, sandpaper, some primer/undercoat and the remains of a tin of gloss got rummaged from the shed - the table was first to be scraped and sanded to remove all the flaking, peeling varnish. The legs were then removed to sand them.  Once scraped and sanded, everything got wiped down with a damp cloth to remove any leftover flakes and dust before undercoating with primer. This should give a good base for the gloss paint so that it doesn't simply run off the wood.  The things many TV programmes or magazines may not tell you:Non drip, fast drying gloss isn't neither non drip nor fast enough drying when using it outside in the blazing sunshine!The least little breeze and you have newspaper and dust stuck to your lovely new paintworkBugs, flies and midges seem to be attracted to paint and get stuck!Bathing said stuck bugs, flies and midges in white spirit does not revive them!Make sure your hair is firmly tied out of the way when kneeling down to paint the legs of a table, especially if there's a breeze!My crafting stuff was taking up far too much space it cardboard boxes, so a chest of drawers was commandeered and given a quick coat of gloss. Surprisingly, it stuck to the white veneer. I bought these flat-packed from Argos as part of a set about 10 years ago, so they have been dismantled and carted around the past 4 or 5 house moves and were rather the worst for wear. It was surprising how well they came up after painting them!All we could find in the shed was magnolia and brown emulsion - it was either that or a nougat-salmon pink (I don't think so)! Brown and cream won, so the chimney wall got done chocolate brown and the walls got a freshen up with magnolia. With only one roll of wallpaper, I opted to do only the top half of two walls at the sitting room end of this multi-functional room.A change of curtains from patterned to plain, which I already had, helped the transformation. Raking through my crafting supplies uncovered several suitable ribbons to turn into tie-backs. To attach them to the wall, I used a couple of old curtain rings and simply tied the ribbons through the loops. Colourful ribbons can brighten up anything in minutes, so never throw away any bows, ribbons, cord or string that comes your way. Guaranteed, if you decide to follow a frugal living path through life, you'll find a use for almost anything. Curtain hoops can be found in charity shops for 10p each, in my experience, but I already had a few in my 'stash'.Cheap artwork is another easy way to quickly transform the look and feel of a room and I was lucky enough to get some cheap picture frames. With what was left of the roll of wallpaper, I managed to cut enough to fill the five frames, which got hung on the chimney wall. They really are quite effective and I couldn't ask for a better match for the walls, could I?There are always people decluttering, so when a friend offered me a few bits and pieces, her £5 flat-packed shoe rack seemed like an absolute bargain. It was soon assembled and turned into storage for DVDs, CDs and board games.Time to polish my brass, but I have no brass cleaner. No problem, homemade will do for now: Half a cup of vinegarTeaspoon of salt Flour to mix it all into a paste The homemade version isn't nearly as good at cutting though the tarnishas the commercially manufactured chemical version, but it does give a bit of a shine. There's also the fact that this was free to make, as I had the ingredients in the kitchen. This gorgeous brass urn was one I rescued a few years ago, so it has now been brought indoors to sit by the stove. I'll add a pot plant as soon as I have repotted something suitable from the garden. (This was before it was polished.)Now for a few 'before and after' photos to show the overall transformation as it was taking place. ﻿The 'new' chimney wallThe stove got a good clean, as did the steel back plate. The brass items, at long last, have been hung alongside the (non) fireplace. The toasting fork is great for marshmallows when the stove's lit in winter!Corner 1 - this has become my entertainments corner﻿The shelves were rearranged and then filled with my books. The shoe rack is now home to DVDs and board games, with a couple of boxes of crafting supplies tucked safely alongside. The rail along the middle of the papered wall is made up from two lengths of skirting board.Corner 2 - the sitting room part of this multi-functional space﻿The one roll of wallpaper was enough to do both of these walls when only papering the top half of them and it helps that we have quite low ceilings. The couch is actually a double bed settee / futon, so this space also doubles as a guest room.The nest of tables - sanded down, painted and decorated﻿Rejuvenating the tables was a very straightforward project - scrape the flaking varnish, sand everything down to give it a rough surface, undercoat and then gloss it. The difficult part was managing steady hand-eye co-ordination when picking out the bits to highlight with the gold paint. The salvaged table - before and after.﻿﻿This table has replaced the bench set, which was only being stored here temporarily. It has now been dismantled and stored elsewhere until such times as the other room gets refurbished.﻿﻿Corner 3 - my work space has been transformed and I love it!﻿This is my office corner - a bit of tidying and decluttering has made all the difference, with the pin board now painted in gold and hung above the desk and the transfer on the wall really sets it off, in my opinion. I love the quote on the wall: \"Life isn't about waiting for the storm to passIt's about learning to dance in the rain\"﻿﻿Corner 4 - crafting and hobbies corner﻿I've left plenty of hanging space, as this room will also double as my guest room - but this challenge has prompted me to push on and get the cloakroom painted and put to proper use. The crafting materials have all been packed into the drawers and my 'McGonks' are stored in the baskets on the top shelf. Décor reflects my past by way of a few items relevant to long forgotten challenges from the late 90's. (A couple of personally identifiable items of significant, sentimental value have been omitted from the photo.)How I spent my £50.00Fire Cement 3Kg - £8.14 (1 x 2kg & 1 x 1kg) Roll of wallpaper - £10.85 Wallpaper paste - £1.55 Pasting brush - £2.27   Radiator enamel - £2.99 Transfer/decal - £3.79 2 lengths of skirting - £9.00 5 photo frames - £3.00 (Secondhand) Shoe rack - £5.00 (Secondhand) Small tube of gold acrylic paint - 99p  Total - £47.58  (Balance remaining - £2.42p)This has been an absolutely fabulous challenge set by the guys at Moneysupermarket.com! There were a few times during the preliminary stages that I was almost pulling my hair out at the enormity of it. The room really was like a storm that wouldn't pass, so I learned to dance in the rain and did the best possible with what was available. The makeover has created an illusion -  almost like several rooms emerging from one, each corner becoming an easily defined space without looking out of place. My visitors are now welcome anytime and I'm sure those who have sampled the delights of 'indoor camping' for an overnight stay here will be suitably impressed with these amazing changes. Frugaldom welcomes all comments relating to what has been achieved on this small budget and has to ask the question, did I make the grade as a 'Home Improvement Hero'?

{"title": "Filling the Freezer. #Frugal Food.", "date": "Wednesday 24 July 2013", "text": "Apologies Herbivores, We're Frugal Omnivores Here.OK, so I'm mildly stunned by high quality at low prices!The frugaldom grocery challenge is one that I quite enjoy, especially when there's the occasional plus point, like hosting barbecues paid for by third parties. Not only is it fun sharing such good fortune, but there are also the leftovers and the savings from not having had to pay for lunch or dinner on such days. My annual budget for all food, toiletries, cleaning and laundry products has been increased this year to a whopping great £1.25 per person per day - that's a 25% increase on previous years, just so we can enjoy a few luxuries now and again. (Basic essentials, if anyone wants anything extra like hair gels, aftershave or cosmetics, they buy it for themselves.)Quail eggThe frugal diet, to some, may appear fairly luxurious in as much as it includes things like scallops, freshly caught mackerel, pheasant, goose, freerange duck and hen eggs, trout, quail eggs, homemade champagne and any number of hand-made delights not normally associated with moneysaving. But these things aren't costing cash - they are freely traded among like-minded others who fish, rear poultry and game and spend time, rather than money growing, picking, preserving and making the best produce they can from fresh, home grown ingredients. (Have you tried freshly made egg pasta with spinach?)Here in Frugaldom, we don't eat any of our feathered friends, we simply keep them for eggs, so that means buying meat.Having lost ROSSPA, (a farm shop outlet that used to deliver my butcher meat overnight) I had been struggling to find an affordable supplier who could deliver. (We've no car and don't live near shops, remember.) My body-building son said he'd heard 'Muscle Foods' was a good company to deal with, so that's where I went. (As reward for doing so, they gave me the above link where all my friends could go and claim 4 free chicken breasts with their first order!)Their fresh meat is all ethically produced within Britain and the EU, they have won multiple awards and are Fine Food Guild members. Add to this the fact that they guarantee no added water or salt in their products and you can see the odds stacking up in their favour instantly.On the whole, we eat mostly chicken, so I was aware of current costs and offers in supermarkets even if I can't get to any of them to buy their produce, so when I saw the price of fresh chicken breast fillets at £5 per kilo, I was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, I instantly ordered 10kg and then added a couple of kilos of lean beef stew and mince to fill my almost empty freezer.The order arrived overnight and was exceptionally well packed, fully protected in thick insulating polystyrene wrap, bubble wrap and ice packs. Some of these ice packs were still fully frozen, despite the heat of today when my order was out for delivery. Better still, I've popped them into the freezer, too, to save for using in the cool bag for taking picnics on the bikes.Looking at the chicken fillets, they are quite huge - a single one diced will make a meal for two of us here, at least! (The secret to frugal cooking is always shred, dice, cube or grate to make things go further and add salad, veggies, pasta or rice etc.) The fillets came packed in 5kg containers, so I have individually wrapped them in cling film for freezing. I weighed a couple of them beforehand; the first fillet weighed 220g (about double some of the supermarket ones), the next 245g and, in total, I had 44 fillets each capable of feeding two. An average of 227g per fillet and almost zero fat to trim off them.But that's not all! You know us frugalers always like a little bit extra, well that came in the form of a free sachet of seasoning, a free sheet of thick, insulating poly-foam, some free bubble wrap, several free ice packs and free trays that I have washed, dried and used in the freezer. Once emptied, they'll get used as seed trays in the greenhouse. The poly-foam will be ideal to insulate planters during winter, to keep them off the frozen ground.Now I am not too sure what the people at Musclefood are going to think of this, as my only effort at building body beautiful is to walk and cycle a bit because I don't have a car, but they may find themselves being the suppliers for several other rural-living frugalities like myself and the worst part is - THEY SEND YOU MORE OFFERS! I've just been offered 1.5kg of veal for £6! First meal - stir fried chicken breast with onions, pepper, raisins pineapple and cashew nuts with noodles - enough to serve 3.My 'refer a friend' links are included or else you can go to http://www.musclefood.com/SK5873 and claim your 4 free chicken breast fillets when ordering. There's also a loyalty points scheme, so it's pretty much a win/win situation for frugal living pundits like me who love nothing more than a bargain slap-up meal.Don't get too carried away with these bargains - do as I suggest and see if you can find a neighbour to share your order so you can take advantage of the free delivery options whenever an exceptional bargain appears on the horizon. Or else have a body-builder in the family and combine orders. :)Having fun with a full freezer,Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Green Living Tips for Today’s Busy Families", "date": "Tuesday 23 July 2013", "text": "Green Living Tips for Today’s Busy FamiliesGuest blog Modern day families live a hustle and bustle lifestyle. Between driving kids to activities, working, shopping and maintaining a household, there is little time to think about the environment. Many decisions are made hastily and in the name of convenience because there is simply not enough time to plan for the long term and the big picture. The solution to this dilemma is to implement small changes that, over time, will become habits and part of the daily routine. As you change over to living greener, you will find that you often save both time and money in the long run. More importantly, you will be saving the planet and making it a better place for your children and for generations to come. Eating Green Food is a great place to start when changing over to a more environmentally friendly practice. The first thing you will want to do is buy organic whenever possible. You don’t want to feed your family the pesticides found on many commercially grown crops or the hormones fed to much of the livestock. Shopping at a local farmer’s market is a wonderful way to get organic foods and support your local farms. A convenient way to fit this in is seeking one out that is nearby to your children’s activities so that you can pick up the produce while waiting for the kids to finish up with a practice or club meeting. If you have the time to go a step further, try growing some of your own foods in a pesticide free garden at home. Try to ditch the processed foods that are filled with preservatives and chemicals. Keep a bowl filled with fruit accessible to the family for snacking. Veggies and dip are another healthy snack option. You can also bake some homemade snacks so that you can control the ingredients. If you are worried about the cost of buying organic foods, remember that if you take some other green steps, such as cutting down on your meat intake and no longer buying commercial cleaning products, your grocery bill should not show any significant changes. Another food related tip is to stop shopping for beverages altogether. The best drink for anyone in your home is water. You don’t need to buy cases of plastic water bottles to obtain it, either. Instead, invest in reusable bottles for the whole family that they can take on the go. If you do not like tap water, make another one-time purchase of a water filter. If you are a coffee lover and often visit your favorite coffee shop in the morning or between stops after school, consider buying one of their reusable cups rather than a paper or foam cup each day. If you do wind up with an old paper cup, think about using it as a planter or rinsing it out and using it to clean paint brushes during the kids’ next craft project. When it comes to preparing foods, use the microwave as little as possible. If you must use the microwave, be sure to never use plastics in it. The Environmental Working Group states that certain chemicals in plastics have been linked to birth defects, and these chemicals are released when heated.  In fact, avoiding plastics as much as possible is a good rule of thumb because they are terrible for the planet anyway. The worst offenders that you will want to avoid are those marked with a three, six, or seven on the bottom. Keeping a Clean, Green House For cleaning, there is no reason to buy chemical products. White vinegar can clean almost anything. If you also add castile soap, tea tree oil, baking soda and borax to your cleaning cupboard, you will be all set to clean your home from top to bottom with all natural substances, and for a fraction of the usual cost. Since you will be mixing your own cleaners, you will also be able to reuse the spray bottles, causing less waste. Cutting Down on Household Waste When you take your trips to the store, be sure to bring your own reusable shopping bags. They don’t have to be anything fancy or expensive. Anything you have at home that can carry groceries will do. If you can reuse bags, then factories will produce less of them. This saves trees in the case of paper and prevents harmful chemicals in the case of plastic. With paper, there are lots of ways to save. First, instead of sending out letters and invitations, use email and evites. To clean out your own physical mailbox, consider opting out of junk mail. Catalogchoice.org and DMAchoice.org are two websites you can visit to do this. You can also go paperless with most of your bills by visiting each company’s website or making a phone call to let the company know that you prefer to have your bills sent electronically. On holidays, be creative. Think of wrapping a gift in something you have around the house, like newspaper, fabric or brown grocery bags. Making your house run more efficiently is not as difficult as most people think. You can take some simple steps that will save your family a lot of money and the planet a lot of energy. Start with the refrigerator, because this is the appliance that uses the most electricity. Unplug it and clean the coils every six months with a vacuum attachment. Ensure its settings are placed where they are most efficient: between 38 and 40 for the fridge and zero and five for the freezer. Next, think about your water use. Consider replacing fixtures and toilets with low-flow versions. Use water saving shower heads, and think about getting faucet aerators. Only run your washing machine and dishwasher when they are fully loaded, and when it comes to clothes always use cold water. Replace your standard light bulbs with energy efficient fluorescent ones, and leave notes near room exits to remind family members to turn off the lights when leaving. When you have items plugged in, even if they are turned off, they are using energy. Use power strips to plug these in so that you can shut the strip off easily instead of having to unplug each item one by one. When cleaning out clutter in closets and garages, instead of just throwing things away, consider freecycling the items instead. Freecycling is just a fancy way of saying “giving it away.” What you don’t want, someone else may be able to use. You can donate the items or visit The Freecycle Network’s website and post what you have to offer to your local group. Often, someone is willing to come and pick up your unwanted clutter the same day. You can also utilize online classifieds such as Craigslist to give away items. This keeps items out of landfills and allows someone else to put them to good use. Busy families spend a lot of time in their cars commuting to work and activities. If you find your child has a local friend attending the same activity, ask the parents if they would like to have the kids carpool and take turns driving. This can free up time and gas money for both families, while reducing harmful toxins in the air. Keep your tires pumped up to save gas. When it comes time for a new family vehicle, consider a hybrid. Teaching Green Habits Children learn from their parents, mainly from watching what their parents do. The best thing you can do as a parent is instil a love for the planet in your children by cultivating that within yourself. When your kids see you taking care and pride in your environment, they will learn to do the same. Taking walks out in nature, playing outdoors, flying kites and watching the sunset are all wonderful activities that can deepen your family’s relationship with the Earth and help them appreciate the need for a greener lifestyle. Choosing to live green benefits everyone in many ways. The planet as a whole supports you better, your health thrives and your finances improve. Each of these simple changes can be implemented over time without the family feeling any major shift in their routines, yet the impact this green makeover will have on your family and your surroundings is priceless. Many thanks to Backupcare.org for sharing this post."},
{"title": "My Official Entry into #TheCharcoalChallenge", "date": "Monday 22 July 2013", "text": "Frugaldom's Big Summer Barbecue(s) on a Budget  I was recently invited to take part in 'The Charcoal Challenge', a bloggers' competition run by Moneysupermarket.com, so I jumped at the chance to throw the ultimate summer barbecue and the chance to win £250! (See www.moneysupermarket.com/home-insurance/competitions/the-charcoal-challenge/ for full details.) Not being the most organised of people, I still haven't got around to building a barbecue in the garden since moving here, so the fact that we were each being given £50 to fund this challenge was brilliant - first thing I did was order a small barbecue, which arrived within about 48 hours. Brilliant! Next up was decide on a date and hope that it fell within the current spell of sunny, summer weather.  The date came sooner than planned, when not one but two lots of friends, none of whom I'd seen in years, contacted me to say they were coming to visit. Trouble was, they were visiting on different weekends! Hmm... I wonder if I can make £50 stretch to two barbecues? The Charcoal Challenge was now on! Luckily, I have a stock of charcoal for frugal emergencies like power cuts, so carrying a sack of that home on the back of the bike wasn't going to be an issue, but the fresh food for the BBQ was going to have to be bought from the local village store. We don't have any supermarkets here, nor do we have a car, so nipping out to pick up some groceries isn't an option. The 7-mile cycle at a rate of knots along the shore late on a Saturday afternoon in blazing sunshine was actually quite enjoyable, even with the basket laden on the way home. I had also asked a neighbour to get me some sausages when they were in town at the supermarket, so we ended up with rather 'posher' ones than we would normally have bought, albeit on offer at 3 packs for £6. So, here we go for BBQ #1 on Sunday 14th July 2013 from a starting total of £50.00 £  8.65 - BBQ from Amazon (inc delivery) £20.68 - Chicken fillets, sausages, bread, peppers, red and white onions, tomatoes, snacks, sweets, kitchen rolls (cheaper than napkins) and reduced packet trifle.£  3.80 - Plastic cups [b]Balance remaining - £16.87[/b] I set about printing out a few 'Welcome to Frugaldom' pages, cut them up and threaded them onto some garden wire before hanging them across the garden path (left of photo) and then looked out some bunting and flags from previous events - these have been in a box for the best part of 10 years, but looked as good as new - you can tell we're in Scotland by the beautiful blue sky and sunshine? (No political statement is meant or intended here.) The new barbecue had only just been ordered, so it hadn't arrived in time for the first BBQ. Fortunately, I had a disposable one that we'd rehomed from someone, so it got put to good use!  Foodwise, I roughly chopped the onions, peppers and chicken then made up kebabs, adding a few mushrooms to the combination. More peppers got sliced and added to a shredded garden lettuce, tomatoes and half a cucumber donated by neighbours. I made up a strawberry trifle, hard-boiled a few duck eggs - which I forgot to add to the salad! - and raked out the most important BBQ tools of all ... assorted herbs, Avon Skin So Soft, citronella candles and the Factor 50! These are all very, very important ingredients for a Scottish summer barbecue - as are liquid refreshments, which most folks bring along for themselves. I did have a choice of  homemade elderflower or mixed berry 'champers'.The herb arrangement is made up of lemon balm, lavender, rosemary and bog myrtle. It does help a bit, even if it is just to swat at the pesky flies and midges if it doesn't keep them at bay. These herbs are all growing around my patio but they still don't stop the midges having a bite now and again.Finishing touches for this barbecue included inviting the immediate neighbours, raking out all the picnic plates (plus reusable plastic 'glasses' bought from local shop), borrowing some extra patio chairs from next door, finding the radio/CD and digging out some music. By 7pm, we were cooking with charcoal to feed our impromptu party of 7 and a jolly decent evening was had by all. I apologise to my guests for subjecting them to a photograph and sorry that all concerned weren't captured in this freeze-frame for posterity, but I'm sure all would agree that the evening went quite well.The new barbecueMonday morning dawned fair and dry (it's also Glasgow Fair Weekend, meaning this was a holiday weekend in some parts of Scotland) so we decided to head out for a walk before having coffee and cake on the patio. We'd just sat down to the mid-morning cuppa when the postman arrived, with this... Well, you know what that means, don't you? We have the BBQ, we have charcoal, we have 2 chicken breast fillets plus some peppers, mushrooms and onions remaining, plus some wine and 'nibbles' leftover... You got it! BBQ #2 in Frugaldom - the all new, 'use it up' barbie on Monday 15th July 2013. Leftover diced chicken breast, yellow peppers, mushrooms, white and red onions. Add to that a half bottle of elderflower fizz and it all adds up to yet another tasty al fresco meal. Yum!This £50 budget was stretched to the limit. The next visitors to Frugaldom arrived on Saturday, 20th July! I'd ordered some savoury vegetable rice, sparkling elderflower and apple juice, marshmallows and Texas style BBQ dressing from Approved Foods* and my £50 had already bought a new barbecue and fed 9. Let's see how much further it can stretch and how many more can be fed and entertained. I had a balance of £10.89 remaining to pay for enough food to allow for BBQ #3. Summer socialising in the sunshine is great fun - and I did check my home insurance to make sure we are covered for any third party liability and I do use some basic health and safety plus food hygiene common sense, despite my absent-mindedness. However, I can't wave a magic wand and alter time. ﻿Trying to get friends and family all in the same place at the same time to fit in with work and home commitments can be a nightmare, so I chose to take the only other route possible - split my ultimate summer barbecue into several smaller, yet equally fabulous, frugal barbecues. ﻿﻿﻿1kg of marshmallows!Of the original £50, I had already spent £39.11 including buying the brand new mini barbecue. My next visitors arrived on Saturday 20th July - frugal friends from Birmingham whom I hadn't seen in some years, along with Max, their little dog. It's all so exciting managing to catch up with friends and celebrating the occasion with an al fresco meal - I love it, even if I do end up chasing my tail or forgetting my head sometimes! (Or burning pots, breaking eggs, forgetting things and spilling stuff.) So far, my £50 had fed 9 and then there were another 7 mouths to feed. To all intents and purposes, people must think I keep a pet gran, but it was just too warm for my eldest guest, my spritely, eighty-something-year-old next door neighbour, to sit outside in the garden. Instead, she sat indoors, next door in her own house, but I made sure she was well fed and didn't miss out on the chatter. She even provided music from her conservatory, which is adjacent to my patio, albeit separated by the garden wall and gates between is.BBQ #3 - To make the most of the remaining few pounds, I called in the help of my son, who popped into the supermarkets in town with my list, got the best deals he could and then delivered the groceries to me on his way home from work. This was a great help, as it meant I got all of the following:£10.02 in supermarketChicken breast fillets - £3.95Mixed peppers - £1.98Mushrooms - 95pOnions - £0.25Sausages - £1.60Tomatoes - £1.29Lettuce, herbs, fresh eggs and chives from the garden to make up a bowl of salad.Spend - £10.02, so I still had 87p remaining from my original £50.But hold on, I must be able to do something with 87p, surely? Dessert, anyone?87p for 8 dessertsA cupboard and garden scavenge turned up the following:Strawberry jelly bought for 19p from Asda (19p)Angel Delight bought 3 for 99p from Approved Food (33p) Tin of sterilised whipping cream bought 4 for £1 from BB4L (25p) Tinned mandarins bought 10 for £1 from Approved Foods (10p) Dessert(The tinned mandarins have now increased in price to 8 for £1)Fruit picked from garden (Free) Chocolate - already had some but there was also a free Yorkie bar with last week's Approved Food orderTotal cost - 87p DessertThat's it! My entire £50 was spent. The 87p worth of assorted items got turned into 8 small desserts, so there was plenty to feed seven that afternoon. In fact, I had two desserts left over, as someone didn't want one. (Only small hiccup was that I couldn't get the cream to whip up properly, I'll blame the heat.)It was brilliant catching up with the Birmingham guests, especially as I hadn't seen them for four years! Everything that got cooked got eaten and the last of the berry fizz got drunk. Max, the visitor's little dog, even had a BBQ sausage.From the supplies bought, there was still salad stuff, several bottles of elderflower and apple juice, savoury rice, two desserts, a pack of veggie sausages that never got used and masses of marshmallows. Most of it got used up the following day, when we polished off the leftovers.It was excellent weather throughout both weekends and everyone said what a great time they had. Neighbours had supplied extra lettuce, cucumber, a couple of extra chicken fillets and beer. Last weekend's guests brought wine, flowers, juice and fresh bread, then my further-travelled friends brought a superbly thought out frugal gift of cheese, milk and dried yeast for bread-making! You can tell they all know me well!Not content with all of that, my lovely next door neighbour gave me a wooden dining table that was, otherwise, being ear-marked for the dump! Add to this the fact that we were unable to eat and drink all the leftovers and it makes the £50 look like a fabulous amount. I could easily have fed 25, even after buying the barbecue!For all of these things, I am truly grateful. I love it when friends visit and this challenge was a real tonic. Thank you to all who helped make the days special and thank you to Moneysupermarket.com for providing me with £50 and the chance to show how much frugal fun can be had, not to mention feeding an overall total of 20 over the space of four barbecues, on such a small budget. And lest we forget, here's what was left over for future use. There are also the 30 reusable plastic glasses that have been washed, dried and stored away for future use.All in all, this was a great challenge and showed me that it is still possible to feed partying guests for £1 per person and approximately £2 per person for special occasions such as the above barbecues. I love money challenges!This is Frugaldom's entry into The Charcoal Challenge. I hope you have enjoyed reading how I spent the £50. You can catch up with all the other entrants by using #TheCharcoalChallenge on Twitter.Until next time, Frugaldom."},

{"title": "Frugal Living and Peniaphobia", "date": "Friday 19 July 2013", "text": "Peniaphobia - a Fear of Poverty!1. Broken piggy bankApologies to anyone reading this who may suffer from this condition, but many people are completely unaware of its existence.The peniaphobia topic came up in the Frugaldom household this morning while discussing, of all things, horse racing. I house share with a sports-writing artist and he was putting together an article about tomorrow's Newbury race meeting. There's a horse entered into the Super Sprint at 3.50pm running under the name of 'Peniaphobia' and I found this most amusing. (You will appreciate the irony of this if you have followed the NYK challenges since the 90's and witnessed my outrageous racehorse challenge, which made it into the national press!) Anyhow, I was wondering if it was some sort of omen and I'm sorely tempted to 'have a wee flutter'. The odds are currently 8/1, so an each-way isn't out of the question, if I can find a free bet anywhere! Please do NOT take this as any sort of tip, as I am just pointing out the name of a horse while thinking 'aloud', I am not suggesting anyone does anything more than simply read this blog post. 2. RacehorseThis strangely convoluted discussion mixing the 'Sport of Kings' with the kingdom of frugal living brought to my attention the possibility of frugalers suffering not only from an obsessive compulsive disorder of rounding up or down their figures when budgeting and saving, but also harbouring an irrational fear of abject poverty. Not only that, but I also began to wonder if these occurrences were learned behaviour, rather than irrational fears. Since fully embracing 'frugaldom' and deciding to give all debts the heave-ho, I definitely found myself over paying regularly, rounding my debts down to the nearest whole pound, then £5, then it had to end with a zero and so on until the debt was cleared.Debt freedom came with a little less of a bang than I had expected - I'd become accustomed to all the rounding down, over paying and seeing debts shrivel before my eyes, living on a tiny budget had become normal! Happy to see my debts gone? Yes. Ecstatic and celebrating? No! I needed more of a challenge, so the focus switched to earning extra to build some savings. Pretty soon those saved pennies had to reach pounds, then fives, then tens and, before I knew it, I was obsessing about reaching the next hundred and then even the next thousand! At no point have I experienced any real fear of spending money, nor any fear of going broke or even of the money itself. After several years, I ended up blowing almost all of it on a share in a fixy-up property. But now that I come to think about it, the operative word here is 'almost'!﻿﻿ Once facts had sunk in about cash flow and my real cost of living was fully understood, I learned how easy it was to control my own budget - the wild spending mustang had been tamed. I had learned to be obsessive about pennies and pounds in the same way I had learned that being in debt was good for neither health nor happiness. I now have a very serious case of debt aversion, but tolerate a credit card for the purposes of earning cash back each year and having some form of guarantee in the online shopping stakes.﻿﻿3. Keep your budget under control.Thinking more about it, I can honestly say that I harbour no irrational fears of becoming penniless or poverty-stricken. I have raked the depths of my (some may say wacky) mind and cannot find any trace of such fear because I have taken control of my finances and have faith in my ability to live within my means. Wild horses wouldn't drag me back into debt! What's more, I can now spend money on things I want, rather than need, without having palpitations. I won't give debt the time of day and don't even buy a Lotto ticket nowadays, for fear of wasting a pound, but I still do my clicks and searches for points that get me a free Lotto entry most weeks. (If I suddenly became a millionaire, I suspect a horse or two would appear somewhere along the way!) Now I wonder if peniaphobia affects any of those who are following the frugal path or if, by following this path, they are staving off any such irrational fears of destitution. I wonder how others manage in far off lands, where starvation, sickness and malnutrition are real concerns. This is probably why I like being involved with Deki and why I am so looking forward to taking part in their Tenner Tournament. It is one small way of reminding myself that people who witness real poverty every day of their lives can derive so much from what, to us, is so little.Peniaphobia - a fear of being penniless or a 2-year-old colt by Dandy Man running in the 3.50 at Newbury tomorrow. I wonder if there will ever be a horse named Chrometophobia (fear of money)?Until next time,Yours thought-provokingly,Frugaldom.1. Photo credit: kenteegardin / Foter / CC BY-SA2.

{"title": "Spending on Plastic of a More Frugal Type.", "date": "Thursday 11 July 2013", "text": "Putting up the Poly Tunnel.Creating the Frugaldom microholding is incurring some basic 'getting started' costs but we are doing our best not to go over the top whenever we have a small windfall. I mean, the compensation payment from Scottish Power after surviving for almost 4 days with no electricity should probably have been ploughed straight back into winter emergency supplies, but it didn't - it got spent on plastic, but not of the 'flexible friend' type. This was more of the physical, literal sense of spending on plastic - or polythene. In order to be able to even start contemplating growing enough vegetables to last the household all year round, it takes time, preparation and, of course, some cash to get it all started. Some people are fortunate in that they have a huge bank balance, no debts and simply downsize to live the good life, but we didn't have that option. Ours was scrape by on the minimum while saving every other penny, then buy a fixy-up. Taming nearly quarter of an acre of wilderness before transforming it into a microholding without a proper budget is time consuming. Living in the fixy-up has been an experience, to say the least, but progress is slowly being made whilst we pursue all manner of frugal living routes. In the garden, I am trying to be organic and follow the basic principles of permaculture, but it also takes time. The good old Scottish weather is usually against us when attempting to grow anything posher than a potato and the slugs, snails, birds and beasties do a fine job of demolishing everything in their path. The plants need protecting and the homemade plastic greenhouse is full to overflowing. This is the review of the putting together of the  recently acquired 'Palm Springs' poly tunnel, one of my frugal bargains that I decided to buy now rather than wait any longer. Make hay when the sun shines! It's also done in memory of our recently departed, frugal friend, Sandi, whose sudden death was another sharp reminder to us all that we need to live it while we can, even if it's on a frugal budget.Here goes with the plastic age of Frugaldom...InstructionsWhy are these things always so sparse? They list the parts with a few numbers and then have a semi-accurate diagram showing you the structure without any indications of where to start. It was fairly straight forward, other than finding it impossible to line up the holes accurately to drop the bolt through the top of the arch, so we cheated - the neighbour came round and drilled them a millimetre wider. Then went home and ordered himself the exact same poly tunnel - that's a good recommendation for it right away, wouldn't you say?Process of Construction I thought this would be the easiest way of explaining it and showing just how daft I was to think we could start at 9pm and be done in an hour. Oops! :) It now needs to be well secured so any high winds don't lift the full thing - it'll be rocks around the edges for now. The builders' bags were an ideal size for lining the ground, it took three of them opened out into strip to do this and there's still some left over for laying elsewhere. That's us gained nearly 15' of lovely undercover space, but it is extremely warm in there at the moment. Likewise, the heat inside the little plastic tunnels is amazing. These were the ones costing £9.99 - not all that substantial but worth the money, I would say, as they are really easy to build and take apart, so can packed away for winter. They're none too small for the price, either, as each one measures a full 2 metres long and a metre wide. I haven't even thought about what will go in these but I suspect they'll be filled pretty quickly, none the less. The space where these will be used in future years is currently filled with potatoes, so they may end p being moved about the place until later in the year.The mini potting greenhouses are great! I've already turned one of them into a cucumber house byfitting it over the top of two fish crates containing 4 cucumber plants. Another two crates will be fitted alongside and these will be covered by the second little greenhouse. £12.99 bargains, in my opinion and again, these can easily be dismantled and stored during winter.I realise that this may all sound a little bit extravagant and expensive, some may even say it doesn't sound frugal, but I have been saving for 10 years to get to the point of being mortgage free with a garden big enough to create my microholding. My entire life was spent wishing I could afford to buy a smallholding but it's just not going to happen and I don't see the point of wishing any more of my life away - this is it and we need to make the most of what we have and create a lifestyle we love. Being completely debt free is the reward for years of scrimping and saving and doing without any luxuries. It will be some time before the house is completed, so still years of frugaling and on top of that, no regular, guaranteed income other than what we can earn from home while developing the microholding. It has to become self-sustainable, especially as I'm going to be working at it fulltime! The spends are investments in my frugal micro-business in the hope that they will reap rewards in the future.Frugaldom.Frugaldom's 'Everything Else Kitty'.As you know, my annual household budget challenge for all things household is £4,000, but I also have a very interesting revolving budget challenge known as my 'EEK' - the 'Everything Else Kitty'. The household budget includes groceries, toiletries, laundry and cleaning products, electricity, heating, clothing, utilities bills and the general needs of a frugal household, excluding Council Tax, which is simply non-negotiable and has to be paid. We have no rent or mortgage, we live in the fixy-up while it's being, err... fixy-upped. The EEK literally needs to account for everything else - including feeding the livestock that are part of the microholding project (It's a bit like smallholding but on a much smaller scale) and creating that microholding in the first place.  Everything Else Kitty has some huge responsibilities - if I want a holiday, the money has to come from somewhere. Entertainment and socialising costs cash, so that has to come from somewhere. That somewhere can be from a variety of sources - selling surplus eggs, cash back, vouchers, gifts, refunds, surplus plant sales or even Moneysupermarket.com when they invite you to take part in one of their competitions. I do love to grasp any opportunities that come my way.   So, when the opportunity arose to take part in the Charcoal Challenge, I leapt at it! The first thing I had to do was look at what was or wasn't already available - plenty of charcoal but we've no barbecue! It's on the list of 'things to make'.  \"Show us how you’d throw the ultimate summer barbecue for £50!\" they said. \"Show us how creative you can be!\" And, lest we forget, there's a prize of £250 cash to be won by one of the lucky bloggers taking part in this challenge! My £50 has been received and is now in the safekeeping of 'Everything Else Kitty', all barring £5.85 + £2.80 delivery that I have just spent buying a very frugal barbecue! Now all I need to do is get planning the best BBQ ever on the remaining budget of £41.35 and make sure there's something extra special about it. That takes care of July's socialising!Today is a great day! Not only am I getting the fun of planning a frugal (read that as paid for by someone else) BBQ party, but the new poly tunnel arrived yesterday and has now been built! It's looking great and the temperature inside it is definitely tropical. A seat and a refreshing drink of lemon balm tea whilst nibbling on freshly picked strawberries provided suitable reminder that life in Frugaldom is good. Then the postman arrived! My mini tunnels and mini potting greenhouses are here! (See earlier post for details and get later posts for updates).Frugal living means making hay while the sun shines, so it's blackcurrant picking for me this afternoon before I can begin playing with any of my new toys! The 'Everything Else Kitty' won't feed itself and it has been getting slightly over-worked recently and I really don't want to have to dip into the household budget for anything garden-related. Bad enough I had my frugal trip up Ben Nevis in May, never mind overspend on plastic! ;)You can follow the frugal living challenge updates on Twitter @Frugaldom or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/NYKMedia There are also forums where you are free to join and participate in any of the challenges."},

{"title": "We're Having a (not so frugal) Frugaldom BBQ!", "date": "Monday 8 July 2013", "text": "£50 Budget Sounds Like Loads!Look at this! It's exactly one year since we had temperatures in the high twenties here in Elrig and, once again, history has repeated itself - only we are reaching 30 Deg C today. How much better can it possibly get? Well, £50 better, that's how much! That's the amount of money that Moneysupermarket.com has given me to throw the best budget BBQ possible, to share all the fun of the sun and feed/water my guests while they're here and then blog about it. (If you are on Twitter, you can follow the tales of the others taking part by checking out #TheCharcoalChallenge). Now all I need to do is take stock of what is already available and then get this event organised. I know for a fact that we have disposable BBQs and plenty of charcoal, because these things are kept for emergencies in most frugal households - if the power goes out in rural Frugaldom, a BBQ in most weathers (even in snow) can be a great way to cook up a quick meal when the stove's not lit. Right, first things first... preparations need to start now and we need to throw our best BBQ ever this summer. The forecast looks great for the rest of this week, right through to Saturday, so that's time enough to organise the garden to provide space. (Can't forget there's a poly tunnel to be built here this week.)Food and drink, entertainment and a bit of extra decoration for the all important party feel - doesn't sound too difficult to throw all that together once I've got an idea of numbers. Who wants to come to a BBQ in Frugaldom? :)"},
{"title": "Frugal Gardening and Glamorous Gold", "date": "Sunday 7 July 2013", "text": "Absolutely Fabulous!Middle of the year after completing the tax return is always a good time for assessing your income and expenditure. You know if you have enough in the kitty to afford the summer holiday or even get things done about the house and garden. It's an absolutely fabulous time to seek out bargains and even look in awe at the ultimate in glamour garden wear...  GOLD HUNTER WELLINGTON BOOTS!  I kid you not! Here they are in all their golden glory - sadly being discontinued by our Capital city's wellie makers, which seems such a shame seeing as I have only just discovered them. Right now, you can buy a pair of these genuine Hunters for less than £35! Don't get me wrong, I didn't invest in a pair, but I do see good footwear as a long term investment. I simply couldn't warrant such a rash spend while spending on other things. (Aren't gardens addictive once you start seeing what you can BUY for them? My addiction is quickly being curtailed and moulded into one of copycatting, using whatever I can lay my hands on to make similar stuff' without having to buy it. But I digress, yet again. So, if anyone wants to get me a glitzy pair of gold Hunter welly boots them for my next birthday, feel free to try and locate a size 6. I shall treasure them with 'gilty' pleasure. There are other stunning colours available at around the £35 mark but before launching into full blown 'must have' mode, there is a way of bringing that price down even further... here's how:  By registering through a site like *Topcashback you can visit your chosen online stores via their links and qualify for discounts. Better still, these discounts are paid to you I cash or, as per my preferred method, you can receive a further 5% on top of your cash back by taking it as an *Amazon voucher.  ﻿  This evening, I was placing an order through Gardening Direct, as they have a half price sale on and always have some fantastic monthly offers. My basket was bursting, as we frugalers tend to play IE Windows shopping quite often - filling our baskets with all the things we want to buy and then emptying them again - or is that just me? I did leave a couple of items in there but that's another blog post. Anyhow, I spotted the glamorous golden wellies and would have added a pair to my basket had there been any of the correct size. (Probably just as well that there weren't!) At £34.99 they were just too tempting. Here goes for the discounts...Deducting the future £3.50 cash back brings them down to £31.49, less another 17p for switching cash back to an Amazon voucher, we're now down to £31.32 for a pair of top brand name wellies that can retail at closer to THREE TIMES that price in certain stores. But wait... there's more! If I paid using a 1% cash back credit card, which is seeing only the original £34.99 price tag, that's another 17p off the overall cost, bringing us down to £31.15 - not bad for a pair of Wellington boots that are classy enough for festivals, glitzy enough for fancy dress, comfy enough to walk miles in and durable enough to give you years of pleasure while working in your microholding. And what's even more fabulous about these boots? They are totally waterproof in winter! You know what? I have almost talked myself into finding me a pair of those super-duper, cheeky, chic, classy, glamorous, glitzy, totally over the top Hunter wellies. I wonder how easy it is to pedal a bike while wearing them? NB: Many sites charge a delivery fee, don't forget to account for this when working out the best available prices.* Denotes affiliate or refer-a-friend linksFrugaldomEdited in - I eventually did find (and am now the proud owner of) a pair of gold metallic Hunter (Huntress) Wellies! :D"},
{"title": "Back on the Trail of the Frugal Microholding (Part 3)", "date": "Saturday 6 July 2013", "text": "Making Decisions Affecting the Creation of our MicroholdingPart 3 of 3FILLING IN THE GAPS! This is the concluding part of my 3-part blog for the weekend, bringing you up to date with progress (or lack of) and arriving at a decision that wouldn't have been made but for the events over the past few days. I'll start with our patio area, as I was hoping to make it very productive by way of the fact that it gets plenty of sunshine and is particularly well sheltered on three sides.On the left, you can see the vacant gap in the top half of our developing garden. It is fairly flat, stony and has very little soil. It also sits in line with the pipework for the septic tank, so any digging and backfilling would need to accommodate that.Looking from my kitchen window, I can see all of what we refer to as the patio. It's basically a concreted area where the old outbuildings once stood, along with what we were told was some sort of lean to greenhouse or old-style tomato house. The main outbuilding has been renovated - this will, one day, become the eco arts studio - and the big hole in the centre filled in to create another garden feature. The colourful flexi-trugs along the wall contain a variety of plants, from fuchsias to beetroot, cabbage and courgettes. So far, the slugs have left these alone!On the opposite side of this concrete square, I have a row of all my plastic tubs that have been accrued over the years, each planted up with seeds of one description or another. Next to these are the strawberry tubs that haven't really produced as well as they could have. They need thinning out and feeding up to ensure they continue to crop in years to come. It is from these tubs that all the runners get potted, so I do tend to have strawberry plants popping up all over the place and am constantly trying to think of where best they can go to ensure they grow, get sunshine and don't get attacked by birds or beasties. This year, I am clearing out the raised bed where I planted all my Saffron crocus bulbs - the bulbs are still looking OK and the plants do grow, but I have never had a single flower from them. This leads me to believe that they don't like where they are at all! The raised bed can just be seen at right hand side of this photo.This is how the hole in the concrete 'patio' area is looking now. Last year I scraped it all out and made a mini-pond, lining it with bubble wrap and feed sacks, surrounding it with rocks and planting it up with cuttings taken from the bottom of the garden by the edge of the stream. I call it the critter garden, as it seems to attract visitors of all description, from toads to lizards and frogs. This is who was in it yesterday.I added the bird table at the narrowest part and then turned the other half of the crumbling mess into a circular bed, where I planted many of the strawberry runners and then surrounded them with spinach beet to use for feeding the rabbit. Sadly, the rabbit is no more.Beyond this, off the end of the concreted area, is where I made my blueberry bed for the three little bushes I got last year. This was constructed from the logs cut from a neighbour's conifer and I employed a little bit of eco-artistic licence to the final piece, which I call my log man bird table.Blueberries like an ericaceous or acidic environment, as do heathers, so I add whatever tea leaves, pine needles and bark chippings I have to help these along. So far, so good - the only thing the slugs and snails have got are the sunflowers, which grew from falling bird seed that must have been there from winter. Behind this lies two old fish crates covered with my half price sun-tunnels. Each crate contains two cucumber plants.So what is all this really about? We are doing our best to cultivate the wild garden, making the most of whatever can be salvaged and recycled, trying to grow plants from other plants and fighting what often feels like a losing battle against the elements, the insects, the slugs and the snails. What more can we do?ANSWER - SPOT A BARGAIN AND JUST GO FOR IT!This is my fantastic bargain that I have been spurred into buying now rather than putting off any longer. It is approximately 15' long (4.5m) and just over 6' with and high (2m), comes complete with a fixing kit and delivery is FREE. Yes, folks, I have finally taken the plunge and bought myself the long awaited frugal poly tunnel! The vacant space in the middle of the garden is ABOUT 8' x 18' once fully cleared and this is what is going to fill that space. Now I know that some folks who may happen to read this post will wonder what the great excitement is all about but, for those of you who know me, you know how much I try to prioritise my spends while living in the middle of a renovation project but this purchase, which was on offer with £100 OFF the price, is something that I will put to great use during my battle with the elements and the critturs that foil my growing plans at every opportunity. In memory of Jayjay - this will become the hub of my future growing enterprise of microholding and fundraising.Frugaldom.Getting to Grips with PermaculturePart 2 of 3 Part one dealt with the bottom half of the Frugaldom garden, where there may one day be a productive little orchard and from where we are provided with our eggs from the hens and ducks. Part two is about how things are progressing and how well we can utilise the space we have that is both productive and in keeping with the principles of permaculture. This is my blackcurrant patch and the rhubarb is along the wall behind this. For some reason, blackcurrants absolutely LOVE this garden and are producing so much fruit that I may need to develop this into something a little more lucrative and self-sustaining than jam making. These bushes just haven't stopped growing, so I took hardwood cuttings (seen right of photo)and now these, too, are laden with ripening fruit. By the looks of things, there should be both blackcurrants and blackcurrant bushes available for sale later this year. To give you an idea of how productive these bushes are, I have sufficient jam to last me the next two years plus several kilos still in the freezer from last autumn's crop. Orders can be taken now if anyone would like any. With luck, I may even still have a record of what types they are - I know these earlier cropping ones all originate from my Ben Connans.I have a shed where I house a few quail for eggs - a delicacy that we afford ourselves owing to the fact that the birds are relatively inexpensive to keep and that I, one day, would really like to develop that aspect of the microholding further, but other things have taken priority. Alongside the shed I have this 'spare' patch of ground, bordered by more raspberries and gooseberries. This is the patch that will feature in my next blog post, as a final decision has been made about what to do here to make it as productive as possible. There's no soil, as such, and last year's attempts to grow anything in it failed miserably. All we succeeded in doing was feeding the slugs, snails and sawflies, which have completely stripped my gooseberry bushes this year, again!You all know how much I love my herb spirals and my circular gardens - they are all just so productive, easy to build and easy to maintain, so I now have four of them! I have two spirals and two circular beds of varying sizes and each is as productive as the next. Obviously, the first one built a year ago is ahead of the others, but they will soon catch up and become self-sustaining. On the right, you can see the first one we built last May/June. The sage has been left to flower and last year's strawberry runners are filling up the gaps nicely!Next I have the circular beds - one large one next to the first spiral and one smaller one linked to the patio area. Both are thriving in very different ways and both have been integrated with bird feeding stations.This is the larger of the two, planted with assorted herbs, including one of my personal favourites, lemon balm - a type of mint. I also planted a cutting of lemon thyme in this bed, a gift from a fellow frugaler, so it's a place that the midges don't tend to frequent. The lemon balm is great for its citrus scent and as the basis for a cup of lemon tea. Even daughter appreciates fresh lemon balm mint tea. Many cuttings will be propagated from this spiral bed so I have them available for trading at a later date. Indeed, all of the herbs growing in it at present have come from cuttings elsewhere. In the background, you can see my 'bug hotel' alongside two small square raised beds. The above photo shows the newest addition - the second spiral bed is now showing signs of coming to life with mint, basil and rosemary.This is the bug hotel as it looks now. The main frame of the structure is built from an old wrought iron clothes rail, which has been built up with bits of concrete blocks, bricks, logs, pieces of pipe, plastic drinking straws, mesh and all manner of things found lying about the garden. An old piece of felt was used to cover a bit of board as a roof for it all and this now doubles as a shelf, where I can sit the pots of cuttings.The honeysuckle has now wound its way around the top of the frame and is beginning to bloom. The little wooden box at top left is a butterfly box, a cheap bargain discounted item bought from an Aldi store. I don't think we have managed to attract any butterflies in there yet, though.The two raised beds were purchased new while reduced in an online sale - bought via Topcashback to give me just that - cash back that converted into Amazon vouchers to give me a further 5% value. These were used in last year's Biochar experiment but I failed to see any difference between using the biochar and not. It's still in the box at the left, where you can see that my cabbages and sprouts are needing moved. The largest patch of greenery is a rogue Nasturtium and a sunflower that must have been dropped by a passing bird. The bracken fern behind it should really get pulled out but it seems to keep the slugs off the seedlings. I really need to get these seedlings thinned out as there are carrots in there, too. On the right, are my spring onions and a row of all year round cauliflowers that will also need transplanting very soon!Despite me saying these were only going to be temporary, my plan being to improve the beds and get back to square foot gardening this year! Now look at it - two full beds of spuds that now need banking up with even more soil and compost, mixed with whatever else I can get my hands on, as soil isn't something we have much of about here. I am already regretting having potatoes in here taking up all this space. There are more potatoes sprouting in the micro-orchard among the edible hedging after we must have missed some of the potatoes there last year!This is the polythene greenhouse that I was built last year. It's made from 2\" x 2\" and whatever bits and pieces of wood and board were left over from having the out-building renovated. I can easily walk in and out of it but anyone taller than me (most are) needs to duck down to get inside. Suits me just fine for pottering about, although it doesn't allow much growing space by the time the potting table is in it. The tomato seeds went straight into the ground but I don't know if they will grow quickly enough to produce fruit. The green box alongside is my posh wormer, bought with my £2  coin savings pot last year. The worms have multiplied and I have hundreds of babies in there now, plus it is producing plenty of that wonderful worm juice fertiliser. My grand children think their granny is crazy for keeping pet worms, but that doesn't stop them from feeding said worms while here visiting!Finally, to round off part 2 of this three-part post, this is the old aviary cage we got around 10 years ago. We no longer use it for finches, so it has been lying in pieces out in the shed at the bottom of the garden. Looking at it, I thought to myself, what better way to support the beans and peas than to get them to grow up the cage while waiting for it to become an integral part of the permaculture garden? I have several plants to train up and over this, which will also house bird nest boxes inside it to protect any little visitors from the cat! At the moment, I have beans in troughs on two sides and will have peas on the other two sides, but I am sure the Russian Vine, ivy and honeysuckle cuttings will be well established by next year, turning this into a piece of environmental art as part of our eco-arts project!Now that we have reached the end of part 2 of these 3 significant posts, I hope you wont mind my ploughing on with the third. I think it's the most exciting part!Frugaldom.Too Small for Smallholding? Try Microholding!Part 1 of 3 It's been two years since we moved into our fixy-up. That's another two years of scrimping and saving, trying to get an eco-renovation done on a very tight budget and trying to create a semblance of normality in the wilderness that was the garden before the property lay empty for a couple of years. I'm pleased to say that we do now have water running from the taps rather than all over the house and through the roof, mains electricity reinstated, a phone line with broadband, a flushing toilet, an electric shower and a stand along multi-fuel stove (although this still needs some work done to complete the installation properly). We have some floors, even managing to uncover and salvage the original stone tiles that make up the hallway, but everything else is taking far more time and money than anticipated. But we can see the path we're taking, so that has to be good. Garden progress is even slower! Weeds grow very fast, almost as fast as the dreaded slugs and snails munch through my plants! And this year's exceptionally long winter with several feet of snow certainly haven't helped matters. Regardless, the 90m x 10m strip of wilderness is slowly taking shape on what little budget we afford it.  OK, so it's painstakingly slow, despite trying to get it to a stage that it will produce food for us as quickly as possible. I've been trying my best to do as much as possible with as little as possible, salvaging useable 'stuff' in an effort to try and follow a frugal version of permaculture. As you can see, the Foxgloves are in full agreement with this strategy. The bottom of the garden remains untouched barring what the hens have managed to achieve for us by way of clearing the ground. Moving from the hen run we have the burn, which has flooded once during the severe rains we had last year. Next to this is the wild bird corner, seen above, which is surrounded by Foxgloves and a selection of shrubs donated by friends or traded for through our LETS (Local Exchange Trading Scheme) group.   It's a very pretty corner of the garden and one where we were happy to see Blue tits nesting this year in the first of the boxes we'd hung in the old plum tree. What with that and the ducks having the run of this part of the garden, it makes for an ideal shady retreat - if the old wooden bench remains with us long enough to enjoy using it. All around the edges, I have planted raspberry canes but these have taken on a life of their own and will need sorting out later this year so we can train them into neat productivity in future years. About halfway down the garden, we dug a pond and linked it to the stream, hoping this would help siphon off any excess surface water during floods. There's another wooden bench beside the pond but you tend to get soaked when sitting there if the ducks decide it's more fun to bathe in the pond than swim in it. They do love their pond but, like everything else about here, the pond project hasn't been completed yet.   The willow whips have sprouted and had to be cut back this year, the reeds have rooted and are growing well and the little fruit trees that had to be rudely transplanted from the previous garden at a less than suitable time of year seem to be recovering from the upheaval, some even beginning to produce fruit. (Only apples and cherries, the pear and plum trees are much slower) but that's as far as the central garden project - the micro orchard - has reached, so far. But the ducks love it! In true permaculture fashion and in support of several pleas to leave parts of the garden uncut to attract and benefit bees and other insects, I have banned the mowing of the daisies and buttercups that grow among the fruit trees, barring a path through them to get to the bottom of the garden and reach the hens. In this mid section, we also have the duck housing and two compost bins but I have to say they will never produce sufficient compost to sort out the entire garden, so I have had to invest in pre-packed bags for starting off seeds and getting the vegetables going. The hedgerow is slowly becoming edible, as I have all the raspberries, crab apples, blackcurrants and elder. We'll see how things go with those before embarking on any further developments in that department. Apologies if these posts seem to be rather image heavy, but it's the easiest way of recording progress so I may look back this time next year and see what progress has been made. Frugaldom www.microholding.co.uk"},
{"title": "Appreciating Friendships with Kindred Spirits", "date": "Friday 5 July 2013", "text": "Frugal Living and Life ItselfIn memory of 'Jayjay14', who sadly passed away on 3rd July 2013.Make a donation to The Brain Tumour Charity HERE These past couple of days have been rather strange, what with all the reflection and consideration being given to future plans and security during retirement. All the 'what ifs?' These thoughts are never far from the back of my mind but have been thrust to the fore, once more, by the sudden death of a very popular member of our Frugaldom Forums. The sudden loss of one of our friends, after such a short illness, has deeply affected many of us, so this blog post is in memory of 'Jayjay'. On 2nd May 2013,  to the shock and dismay of us all, Jayjay announced the dreaded news that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. As Jayjay herself put it, \"it's all a bummer\". And so things took their natural course and we all too soon lost a very dear friend, just like that!  Frugaldom is about making life comfortable, enjoyable, affordable and debt free. We have been chattering away, setting challenges, comparing notes and sharing tales of our lives on a daily basis for over 10 years, eventually setting up dedicated 'Frugaldom' forums in June 2008. Jayjay joined our merry bandwagon in February 2010, so we have all shared a great deal during our frugal travels, highs, lows and everything in between. We are about cutting costs, killing debt, saving for the future, making the most of everything and hoping to have the health and well being to enjoy all the fruits of our labours... so when someone is suddenly snatched from our midst, it leaves us all at a loss. Several have asked the question, 'what is the point'? Well, the point is this... life carries on regardless and the memories of our dearly departed friends are carried with us so that we may learn to appreciate things that we might otherwise have overlooked. Life itself, for example, and all the little things that we witness, random acts of kindness, sharing, giving... and then we instantly forget. Spending money is something that us frugalers are seen to hate doing and, for many, participating in an act of impulsive spending is a bit like spotting hens' teeth! We save, we budget, we try to spend wisely and we make purchases when we are ready and able to do so without incurring debt. But we also need to enjoy life and love what we are doing RIGHT NOW, even if some of us are still struggling to pay off debts and mortgages or live within our own means. Investing in the future needn't just be about pension plans and retiring to the country because the future is tomorrow and, until then, all we have is today. The future comprises a whole load of memories that we are collecting each and every day of our lives, treat every today as the present and every tomorrow as the future. Speak to your nearest and dearest, don't feel compelled to act your age if you don't want to and don't feel pushed into complying with consumerist society or those who think they know best what's good for you. Set a good example, be prepared and never put off until tomorrow what can be done today. Treat others as you would like to be treated and develop a self-reliance that rewards you with the self-confidence to 'go for it', whatever 'it' may be... and if that means locking away funds for your own funeral, writing a Will when you're young, paying off your mortgage early or spending £5,000 of your savings on a cruise, then so be it. Never forget that life is for the living and that fun can be had by all, regardless of how little cash you have, how bleak life may seem or how down you may feel. Nature has a way of providing, even if it's just a glimmer of sunshine on a rainy day. After much thought and consideration, I spent cash today on something that will hopefully bring great enjoyment and further my quest for a better life of self-sustainability. I know that by making this purchase this week, the item will remind me each day of Jayjay, by way of the fact that I learned something worthwhile from our virtual friendship. Rest in Peace, Jayjay. You are in our hearts and minds and your memory will be carried with us forever.In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be sent to Manorlands Hospice/Sue Ryder."},
{"title": "Needs and Wants of a Frugaler", "date": "Wednesday 3 July 2013", "text": "The Age of Frugaldom We've lived in the plastic age, seen the rise of microchip technology, gone from just having the BBC on terrestrial TV to having over 100 digital channels, learned of holes in the ozone layer, global warming and peak oil and we now hear tell of future power cuts because the National Grid simply isn't expanding capacity as quickly as we demand the use of it electricity. In part I of this strangely convoluted series of posts, I listed the very basics of what we need and want out of life. This was followed by part II, which looked at some of the world population's biggest fears - Financial instability, Global Warming, Extremist groups / terrorism and Nuclear developments. Now I'm going to recap and elaborate on a few points, for those of us who plan on preparing ourselves for frugal retirement rather than risk being left with nothing. Please note that none of this constitutes financial advice in any way, shape or form - these are my personal thoughts, nothing more. What do we NEED?  Food and Water - requires fresh air, fresh water and growing substrate for basic foodstuffsClothing - requires basic materials for weaving into fabricShelter - requires construction and building materials Energy - for heat, light and everything else associated with energy productionGood health - Nutritional diet and health care when neededFitness - Income dependent, but the more disposable income people have, the more they seem to spend on how they look and feel. Where do we begin when attempting to safeguard our own future?  I am going to begin at what I perceive to be the start of a long and winding road, but will travel in the knowledge that the road can come to an abrupt end at anytime, so all my investments need to be transferable to family to help  prepare them for their own futures. FOOD - Keeping a good supply of nutritional food in the cupboard is great. However, fresh food is no good for long term storage, it needs freezing and that needs a guaranteed power supply. Investing in alternative sources of energy has to be worth considering.  Stockpiling all those household bargains that we know we'll use in the future - toilet roll mountain springs to mind - helps us keep ahead of the game, especially in a crisis involving the sudden depletion of savings or loss of the household income. That's always a scary prospect. Here we would need to fall back on whatever we can grow, rear, make, produce from home, but growing or rearing it takes time and we may not have that much of it if income dries up and savings have all gone.  How about investing long term in growing space and everything needed to ensure that it can be as productive as possible? It needn't be acres of land, poly tunnels and a limitless supply of manure and fertiliser; even the smallest spaces can be utilised in a productive way, if we know how! Likewise, knowledge of what's safe to eat when foraging is helpful and knowing how to preserve food is paramount. We might even be looking to traditional skills, like making/using potash and other DIY plant foods and fertilisers. Investing in companies that develop and market such products could be a good place to start for your pension fund, if you have some spare cash to risk. Tesco and Sainsbury's seem to be doing OK, all things considered! I sometimes wish I'd invested a few pounds into Associated British Foods PLC ten years ago, even if the biggest proportion of their net profit now comes from the clothing industry by way of Primark. WATER - can we be assured that there's enough of the stuff to go around not just now but in the future? We pretty much take it for granted here in rainy Scotland, but we aren't totally exempt from droughts. Investing in technology that can produce safe drinking water from alternative sources could be another good place to start trickling some long term investment funds. I always thought fuel cells sounded like ideal solutions to energy and I believe water is their waste by-product. If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty of water solutions, read about the International Space Station and what's known as the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS).  CLOTHING - As adults, we shouldn't really drastically change shape all that often, sour size should remain pretty stable throughout our lives, barring severe medical issues and pregnancy. We don't need two wardrobes filled with clothes and 30 pairs of boots and shoes, we simply need appropriate climate/weather wear. Now I do know that even the most frugal of us can be tempted by shoes but do we really need all that many? Clothing-wise, there's really no reason why we shouldn't keep a bottom drawer for future use because as time has adequately told, what goes around in the fashion industry almost invariably always comes back around. Wellies will never go out of fashion by anyone who ventures outdoors in the rain.  SHELTER - Clearing off all debts, including any mortgage, is great. This not only reduces the future cost of living by way of us having no mortgage or rent to pay, it also ensures that we cannot lose the roof over our heads, short of some unforeseeable disaster. Shelter from the elements and a safe haven from the outside world has to be seen as a basic need, regardless of how large or small your living space might be.   Some people say that investing in property is out-dated, but let's face it - we all need a place to call home. At the rate the population is expanding, available building space is fast reducing. In all honesty, I can envisage the use of smaller and smaller living spaces, perhaps to the extent of self-sustaining micro-communities springing up in our midst - the static trailer parks of the future. (Another good reason to hold onto any land you may already have and invest any spare cash into eco-friendly construction companies.) Just to be doubly safe, I bought a tent!ENERGY - Oh dear, where should I begin so as not to rattle too many cages? It is a fact that our main sources of energy are fossil fuels and nuclear power, there is absolutely no escaping that. It is also a fact that if the infrastructure isn't in place to keep up with ever-increasing demand, then we will face shortages. How they deal with those shortages could be two-fold; prices will continue to increase so we are 'encouraged' to use less, plus there could be rationing during peak times. As demand grows, so, too, must supply and that means extending the capacity of network while also spending billions upon billions of pounds trying to generate enough power to pipe round that supply system. Willing individuals have little effect on this inevitable process, so governments will be forced to take action and enforce energy saving measures on us all - households and businesses alike. We know we need energy, so we should be investing in good, environmentally friendly, renewable sources using what we have readily available to us - the natural elements. I've been keeping an eye on hydrogen fuel cell development for some years now, but recently added in the carbon-based graphene technology. Whether or not cold fusion, the LENR energy catalyser or solar docking stations ever come on the market remains to be seen, but it's probably best to keep an eye on those developments, too. I'd still love to install solar power to the shed and concoct a way of deriving power from the little stream that runs through the bottom of the garden, but technology is not my strong point and the stream floods halfway up the garden during extreme and prolonged rain. HEALTH and FITNESS - I've already invested in pedal bikes for the household and some discounted outdoor wear for walking. I do have a heavy-duty pair of steel toe-cap wellies that got worn when working around cattle but I was serious when I mentioned investing in a decent pair. Did you know that Hunter Wellington Boots were originally designed for walking in Scotland's rugged terrain and combating its unpredictable weather? And they now come in a multitude of modern, jazzy, snazzy colours, designs and finishes! I lumped health and fitness together to keep this shorter than it might have been - I'm not managing that very well, I always have far to much to say when I get onto the topic of frugal living and all that can be done while living the lifestyle. Healthy eating is something I need to really focus on, as it's not easy keeping sufficient fresh fruit and vegetables and a reliable, healthy source of protein in the house when living nowhere near well-stocked shops, butchers or greengrocers. No delivery vans here other than the fish van, but that's probably good for the frugal budget as I am not tempted to overspend on non-essentials. The price of fresh fish is beyond my frugal grocery budget, so I'm sorry to say that I don't support that local business.Finally, frugal living is also about frugal ways of working, so saving at home is just one side of the coin. Playing this 'game' in a working environment is where we coined the term 'frugaleur', which basically means a frugal entrepreneur.

{"title": "How Will I Ever Afford Retirement?", "date": "Tuesday 2 July 2013", "text": "Frugally philosophical thoughts about how to avoid abject poverty in the event that the State Pension collapses and we're left without an income.Part IIHaving had a quick look around at what people (and nations) fear most, it would seem there are four main threats. Whether these are perceived or real remains to be seen, but fear them, many do. In no particular order, here are what look to be the biggest fears of all:Financial instabilityGlobal WarmingExtremist groups / terrorismNuclear developmentsI can't say that any of the above surprises me in the least, as it simply boils down to money and self-preservation. Let me think, where have we heard that before? \"Your money or your life?\" This brings me to an abrupt conclusion about the future of our financial well being during retirement - it matters not one jot as long as you are alive and well enough to live life when the highwayman comes calling. Nations may rise and fall, sea levels may rise and fall, we frugal Scots will vote for or against independence as we see fit but, at the end of the day, it's all about life until the end. So let's get ready to live it for less in a way that helps secure our own futures.My main priority is to slash overheads - the basic cost of living. No rent, no mortgage, no debts whatsoever and nothing that ties me to a lengthy contract. Looking around to see what ill-fate could possibly befall me to foil any such plans, I begin to see how little we are taught about self-reliance, self-sustainability and self-responsibility, so I want to redress that balance and ensure that my future is secure in my own hands and less dependent on others. Think ahead - what do we need to live and enjoy life without fear of discomfort? Where could we possibly save cash so that it will grow and provide us with a secure future during retirement? Where is it safe to save it so that it needn't be lost completely in the event we don't see out life long enough to retire, more to the point? Lest we forget, the highwayman isn't averse to daylight robbery and his weapon of choice can inflict sudden death! (I'm a cheery wee soul, really, but let's get real and face facts - our ticket to life doesn't include a 'use by' date!)Right, back to basics - food, water, clothing, shelter and energy with the health, wealth and fitness to enjoy life. That's it! Those are the basic essentials that we all need and into which we should invest, be it financially or practically. Knowledge is power, as they say, so learn as much as you can about food production & preparation, making & mending, DIY and energy saving while balancing a healthy lifestyle with a fun fitness regime. And share your views freely.If we are financially savvy with it, we can enjoy the speculation of accumulation by way of long term investments that are guaranteed to be there for generations to come, serving us well when needs must. The wisest investments, I would think, would be those that cannot be manufactured or mass produced - personal skills, personal space and the environment in which we live. Entrepreneurs, did you know that it's 90 years since Clarence Birdseye, an American taxidermist, invented the concept of frozen food? But we still aren't eating synthetic food, it still has to originate in nature, albeit with a genetic helping hand now and again. Since the above and other such conveniences, we seem to be freeing up more and more time, finding more and more things to buy and spending more and more time trying to earn cash to pay for a whole heap of ludicrous, unnecessary 'stuff' just because it's there. Think labour saving and time saving with an element of 'cool' mixed with gimmicky 'must-have' and you might be onto a winner in the invention stakes, but there's also a huge amount of money to be made in security, be it home, personal or virtual and alternatives to fossil fuels. At first I thought the hydrogen fuel cells would eventually develop into something big but it's been so long now that their shine has tarnished. The naturally occurring elements and exploration of space have to be at the fore of research and development, surely, as planet earth cannot expand to accommodate the billions of humans as well as all the flora and fauna forever more.I don't have the magical answer to the ever-asked question, 'what is the next big thing?' What I do have is a head full of useless facts that all seem to be pointing in the same direction - civilisation, despite all these leaps forward in science and technology, still isn't all that civilised. There are still wars, famines and epidemics, there are still murderers, rapists and thieves and there are still no life-sustaining environments outside of our own planet. Wondering about how to afford to live in the event that a tiny Government on a tiny island cannot afford to extend me a tiny amount, sufficient to pay for the bare essentials, becomes so insignificant that I may well simply never ask the question again. I'll just save what I can, live my frugal lifestyle and invest in long term benefits like those provided by a good pair of wellies, a waterproof jacket and a productive garden. I may even buy myself a parasol for the patio and just sit there watching the herbs grow while contemplating life as we know it.'Frugaldom' Could be the Answer.Frugally philosophical thoughts about how to avoid abject poverty in the event that the State Pension collapses and we're left without an income. Part 1 Continuing with my musings on the topic of retirement income, I was told not to take this lying down... so I lay down to contemplate the future! We learn all the best lessons the hard way, I think, but I'm not entirely sure why that is. I suspect it's because we're usually too impatient and want to get on and enjoy ourselves without waiting to study the more intricate details - a bit like putting together a new DIY project without reading the instructions or, as we all know to our detriment, signing some agreement without reading the small print. We want the feel good factor and we want it now! As previously mentioned, I got my tax return done for another year and I'm as poor as I thought I was. On the plus side, I have apparently paid enough qualifying years of National Insurance to entitle me to the full basic State Pension of £110.15 a week, but I need to wait until the end of 2030 before I can claim that! That's only another 17 years to wait and find out if the Government can actually still afford to pay me a State Pension!  My calculations are basic, to say the least; based on my current lifestyle and increasing it in line with 2.5% inflation (a conservative guesstimate), my £4,000 per annum becomes over £6,000 - things could cost over 50% more by the time I retire and could be double their current prices by the time I reach 85! (I may not, in which case I'll need to hope that the tiny life assurance policy is sufficient to cover funeral expenses - happy, am I to be dwelling on such thoughts!) So, back to the lying down thinking of this long-term possible predicament, where and how best could a frugal living person such as me invest my paltry savings? The volatility of the stock market worries me, the potential for the collapse of the banking industry is a real possibility and keeping cash 'handy' isn't an option if there's potential for the Government to completely change (or even abolish) hard cash. Future fantasy it may seem, but the ring of truth cannot be ignored. What do we NEED? Food & waterClothingShelter EnergyGood healthFitness What do we WANT? ComfortEnjoymentRelaxationStress-free living As frugal investors, we need to look back and see what progress has been made over the last 50 years in order to be able to grasp the possibilities for the next 50. The old quote about man living for three score years and ten is now outdated - some haven't even given up fulltime work by that age now and could still have about 30 years to go; that's like another lifetime for some reading this! Nuclear powered electricity for homes first came to the fore in 1951 but let's skip forward to the 70's, because I know many of us were around then. Looking back over this relatively short period of time, we see the following inventions developed and brought to the mass market: Pocket calculatorsVideosCompact Discs (CDs)Satellite broadcastingCar phones and mobile phonesComputersMass produced electronicsMicrochip technologyGames consolesWorld Wide WebHigh speed Internet accessCloning & Genetic Modification The list is endless, but even the most frugal of us have experience of at least one of the above and we no longer consider things like digital communications or genetically modified foods as anything special. (I use the 'genetic modification' term broadly.) We have power at the touch of a button, can speak to people practically anywhere in the world and can do most things at whatever time of day or night we want. We can go virtually anywhere in the world, we can travel further and faster than ever before and we can even go to the edge of space and leap to earth in safety - how fantastic does all of that sound when we look back over history? How crazy is it that I can sit here right now and key in a few letters on a keyboard and see the Sphinx and Great Pyramids in aerial view or travel along YOUR street, looking at your neighbourhood? It's phenomenal! We have witnessed a whole new world develop before our very eyes and, with every new day that arrives, we see the beginnings of the next new world unfolding. Stay 'with it', because history has a habit of repeating itself. It may not be an identical tragedy, the exact same virus or a similar weather phenomenon, but nature rules supreme and we can never know what's around the next corner. We COULD soon reach a stage where our elderly residents are reaching the age of 150! Oh my, I have wandered completely off course again and need to get back on track - we're supposed to be solving the problem of affording our retirement, not wondering what life could be like at 150... I need coffee!"},
{"title": "Food Standards Agency - Statement on TB risk from meat", "date": "Monday 1 July 2013", "text": "Badgers, Bovine TB and Beef-EatingSpeedy badger!Food Standards Agency - FSA statement on TB risk from meatHaving read several conflicting 'stories' on various sites, I thought it safest to post the above link to the Food Standards Agency, as they are the people who should know best. Humans cannot normally contract TB by eating meat from an infected animal, it seems to be a case of those who have had the misfortune of contracting the disease were in close, prolonged contact with infected animals or else making a habit of consuming raw, unpasteurised milk. Pasteurisation was invented for a reason.It should be noted that the sale of all raw cows' milk in Scotland is prohibited, so anyone buying, selling or otherwise supplying such could be charged with a criminal offence.On the plight of the badgers, it needs to be said that there are fair arguments both for and against the current culls and I am not 100% convinced by either of them. And for the life of me, I cannot work out how, where or why a badger infected with Bovine TB would bite a seal pup, as reported recently. If, as the case suggests, the seal pup was infected by a badger bite, this would also suggest to me that similar could occur to any humans sustaining a bite from an infected animal - and badgers can bite! We love going out to watch them and photograph them but we must never overlook the fact that they are, after all, the largest relatives of the weasel family.So - like most things, this mainly boils down to costs and costs dictate that the less expensive option in the long run for our tax-paying society is culling badgers that have been breeding with little to no form of control since The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 was enforced.Here's hoping that our Scottish population of badgers continues to thrive and that TB can be eradicated without the extermination of Brock and Co. From the Scottish numbers I have crunched, I can't actually see the co-relation between badgers and cattle."},
{"title": "Frugal Investments for the Future", "date": "Sunday 23 June 2013", "text": "Penny Penguin, Phil the Pig and Cash Cow.Penny PenguinAll this frugal living has to be leading somewhere, but we need to remember that we are all at different stages in our frugal journeys and, despite travelling by many different routes, our final destinations are all the same. So, I am going to recap on the origins of this challenge for the benefits of those who have joined us along the way and speculate on its eventual end. Way back in the eighties, many of us faced financial difficulties when we had sunk all our income into what we thought was a sure thing - a secure roof over our heads.  Thanks to such easy access to credit along with the readily available interest only mortgages, associated tax benefits through MIRAS (Mortgage Interest Relief At Source), domestic rates and those fairly inexpensive endowment policies that we had all been tempted into buying as soon as we hit 16, many of us leapt at the chance of taking control of our own destinations as home owners. But then all the rules changed! Drip feeding Penny the Penguin wasn't going to pay for all those mistakes we'd unwittingly made! Not in any particular order, but here's a few of those shocking changes that none of us predicted, mainly because we didn't pay attention to the importance of politics, global finances or world affairs.Domestic rates ended and we were subjected to the Poll Tax / Community Charge / Council Tax which, for those of us in small starter homes, took us from £120 per year to several times that, almost overnight!MIRAS got abolished, which affected the income.Interest rates soared to an unprecedented 15% Yes, that's right, I said 15%, as in 30x the current base rate. (Imagine in your mortgage repayment costs doubled or even trebled over the next year - could you cope?)Eventually, endowment policies began maturing without there being anywhere near enough in the pot to cover the cost of the mortgaged property at the end of the term.Phil the PigThere were many other events along the way but by then many of us were in over our heads. Rules can change at the drop of a hat. Banks can crash! Stock markets can crash! We needed to watch for the signs and take action as soon as possible, but didn't. Tangible assets seemed like the only way to safeguard your own futures, that's about all we could hope for - but many couldn't. The pig needed filling, but many could no longer afford to 'Phil the Pig' in time. Cash CowMany have had to learn the hard way that juggling a budget is one of the most serious and most important aspects of keeping control of your own future security. Over the years we can easily turn a blind eye to what is going on around us, especially if it has no direct affect on our own lives, but then one day, we are sharply reminded that we are not immune to disaster. That is why we are all in search of the elusive 'Cash Cow'. Have you found (or created) your 'Cash Cow'? Have you even started looking?Frugal living may be the answer. Bulk buying bargains that you need, will use and can safely store long term, making the most of offers when available, reducing your costs by walking or cycling rather than driving, investing in some inexpensive hobbies that can be made pay for themselves along the way, running your home like a business and catering to the needs of the family on a seasonal basis rather than following the trends of the day and overspending on non-essentials... these are all good starters. The less you spend, the more you can afford. If you need to pay off debts and maintain the very roof over your own head then so be it, but make it fun while you do so.It took me many years to reprioritise my own finances. I enjoyed my luxuries and thought nothing of robbing Peter to pay Paul, even although Paul needed every penny he had. A new balance had to be struck and it came about slowly. I gave up spending completely to set everything out in columns of numbers - what I owed, how much cash I had coming in, every penny that went out and how much all the non-essential spends were costing. It didn't take long to see that the spending on 'extras' amounted to more over the space of a year than I actually paid out in debts, and by debts I mean money owed on credit - I didn't include the mortgage and was fortunate in that I hadn't any serious debts that involved collection agencies or county court judgements. But the warnings were there to be seen.Debt clearing became second nature but also became like an addiction. I nicknamed it financial OCD owing to the fact that 'untidy' sums screamed out to be rounded down to the next whole number, no matter what. For example, if the balance showed as owing £3,927.52 then that extra 2p HAD to be paid no matter what, but that led to HAVING to pay the 50p to round it down to the next whole pound. Pretty soon, you get into this compulsive habit of seeking 'tidy' sums, so that £3,927.50 would NEED to be paid down to £3,925.00 because '5' was a much tidier number. The saga continued until the debts were eventually cleared. Yes, it can take years, but it is worth it, even if the financial (or numerical, if you prefer) OCD prevails. It works equally well when it comes the time to start rounding up the numbers in the savings pot!Having made a challenge of clearing off every penny I owed and vowing never to pay another penny in interest on debt again, the challenge of frugal living really began and that meant affording to live while also earning enough to be able to save. As there had been several of us all doing similar, we then set up the challenges online, eventually moving them onto the Moneysavingexpert.com forums in late 2007. We have pursued many trains of thought along the lines of both money-saving and money-making, the biggest challenge being to save and buy a house outright - without a mortgage. This was eventually achieved in 2011 after a total of twelve house moves and many other very expensive life events that can affect anyone at any time. Along the way, I have had to start again and again with savings as major life events come along in the family. Likewise, I have had to start the gardens over and over again, owing to having had to move house so often. So it is fair to say that I have had quite a bit of practise at budgeting, growing fruit and veg, salvaging firewood, preserving, making do and mending, not to mention all the extra cash-generating challenges along the way. These have included credit card shuffles, free bets & bingo, paid searches, affiliate marketing, surveys, investing in stocks and shares, buying Premium Bonds, setting up micro businesses, running online stores, using cash-back sites and any number of other small money-making schemes that I could possibly entertain.Every penny does count and each of those pennies leads you to the next pound in the savings stakes.Now, I live mortgage and debt free in a rural location in a run down house with a decent sized back garden. There are no buses and I no longer have no car. There are no supermarkets for buying all those wonderful cheap products that so many people take for granted, nor do I live within a delivery area of any. We pay premium prices for almost everything, yet it is still possible to live on a relatively small budget without feeling impoverished. I remain self-employed and continue to pay National Insurance premiums but have fallen beneath the threshold for income tax - but there's no way I will NEED £9,440 to afford to live when I have been living on less than half of that during all the years of these challenges. In fact, if I continue to follow my plan of living on £4,000 per year, I could afford to save over £100 PER WEEK if I earned the lower threshold limit, as set out by HMRC. If their National Minimum wage is anything to go by, I need only 12.5 hours of employment to afford to live. (Puls whatever number of hours it took to cover the costs of having that job, of course.)Sadly, the above is what many do NOT want promoted to the general public and that's mainly because if everyone lived like this, we would bring the country to its knees through our lack of spending. Those of us who do live like this are penalised for saving in banks by way of little or no interest being paid, so we need a fair contingency plan before any more rules get changed. Even tiny things can make huge differences over the long term. One perfect example of this is seeds! How many of you have planted seeds from shop-bought tomatoes, peppers, apples or even grown your own from dried beans and peas? I know I have! Now we see modified, sterile produce that will no longer reproduce in this way. It won't be long before we will have to buy all our seeds and then there's the possibility that we won't be allowed to trade off our surplus without incurring financial costs. And so the saga continues...Self sufficiency is no more. We need real cash to lead 'normal' lives. The time has come to begin a new challenge - one to safeguard a future that could stretch into retirement while knowing full well that, at any time, the Government could change everything and leave us without a State Pension. Ludicrous as the above may sound, it is not beyond the realms of possibility. National Insurance premiums alone cannot possibly amount to how much a pension costs nowadays, especially with many people living well into their 90s. But if we cannot afford to save enough while working to pay our keep when not working, where will that lead?My question, after a long-winded post that spans 30 years, is this - how do we get in at an affordable level and generate some income from the next 'big thing'? Finding the answer to this question is another challenge! It's also the dream of many! Frugal entrepreneurs aspire to many things but we cannot overlook the fact that frugal living needs cash whether we are able to work at it or not. If you are young enough to find employment with a safe and guaranteed pension provision, so be it. If not - what would you do if the State Pension all but disappeared?Frugaldom (in philosophical mode)."},
{"title": "Bringing the Frugal Budget up to Date!", "date": "Friday 14 June 2013", "text": "My Year so Far!﻿McGonks﻿End of the tax year has been and gone, my annual tax return is staring at me in pity and the annual statement of interest from the ISA is barely worth the paper, ink and postage it cost to get it here. In all honesty, the new financial year is already a disaster.  The business bank account, which is run in true frugal fashion without an overdraft facility, states credit interest = 0.00% while the possibility of running into an unauthorised overdraft would incur a 23% pa interest charge. It is all wrong! I don't blame anyone for charging through the teeth for unauthorised borrowing - it's a bit like stealing, isn't it? But not being able to earn interest on savings while the financial institutions are using our money is a disgrace! The interest rates may have held for a ridiculously long time at their ridiculously low 0.5% historic low, but borrowing is NOT cheap! In fact, it has become so bad that many more, sadly, are turning to 'pay day' loans attracting phenomenal interest rates, rather than simply calling a halt to their own spending and reassessing their own spending patterns.  It's beyond me why anyone would want to have those sort of debts hanging over their heads rather than do without luxuries. I scratch my head so often that folks must think I have lice! At the beginning of 2013, I listed all my personal challenges on here, but feel compelled to remind myself so I can take stock of the situation and see if I am making any real progress. Here goes! Live on £4,000 for the year (2013 will be year 7 for this)Grocery Challenge - included within the above total - increased to £1.25/person/dayFrugaleur Challenge - Establish a new micro-businessGet fitter, not fatter - always trying!Hand make gifts for friends and familySave all loose changeEco-renovate the house without incurring any debt - this is a 5-year challenge, started in 2011EEK - Everything Else Kitty - all other spending must be cost or cash neutralDo without a car - cycle, walk or lift share for the full yearTick off a few more items from the 'to do before 50' list.Best to work through this numerically, but I can already see where I am failing and where my priorities for the second half of the year must lie.£4,000.00 - I began the year with a household account balance of £4,000 and have tried my best to spend accordingly. After deducting approximately 25% of this for Council Tax, £145.50 for the TV licence (a luxury) and £165 for home insurance, I was left with £2,728.46 to 'live' for the full year. That's an average of £52 per week for the household. Winter was long and harsh, we were snowed in for about a week, lost power on numerous occasions and spent a small fortune on electricity trying to heat the place. Now, as of 14th June, I have £1,192.53 remaining to last until 31st December 2013. With 200 days remaining, if I am to succeed in this year's challenge, I have only £41.73 per week, on average, to spend!GROCERY CHALLENGE - Since we're one less in our shared household this year, I thought I would be rash and increase the budget from £1 per person per day to £1.25, giving me a grand total of £912.50 to last the year. This includes toiletries, cleaning products and laundry products, so it's still quite a tight budget, but I know that it's part of my job to make it work - and work it must! I have £458.20 remaining and have just spent £32 via a Groupon offer - 135 luxury 3-ply toilet rolls with free delivery. Sorted in that department for the next year, at least, and I'm sure I can stretch the balance over the next 6 months by supplementing it with garden produce, even if we do need to eat copious amounts of salad leaves, rhubarb and blackcurrants, not to mention all the eggs produced by the hens ducks and quail. The homemade laundry 'detergent' is a must, as is bulk buying, batch cooking, preserving and taking advantage of bargains anywhere available.FRUGALEUR CHALLENGE - This is really difficult because I had planned on making some spare cash from a craft-related project but then ended up selling the items to raise funds for a local charity. On the plus side, the new 'McGonks' (www.mcgonks.com) project paid for itself quickly, based on the fact that everything being used was either given to me or bought cheaply as offcuts or surplus. A serious effort will now be made to try and make it financially sustainable while also helping fundraise for charity. Besides that, it ties in well with items 4, 5 and 10 of my personal challenges list. (£675 cash for charity raised to date.)GET FITTER, NOT FATTER - We don't need expensive gym memberships here in the frugal living sector. We live in a fairly rural location within easy reach of lochs and seashore. We can walk, cycle and swim without it costing us a penny and any cut back on food consumption can only mean further savings on the grocery budget. A frugal diet is fairly healthy anyway, as it means cooking everything from scratch and growing whatever fresh produce you can either in pots or in the garden. Making the McGonks has helped this challenge as we now have a photographic diary of where they go, a fundraising challenge and even a frugal trip to the top of Ben Nevis, which was fabulous! Tied in nicely with item 10 on my list!HANDMAKE GIFTS - I'm notoriously bad at this as I am not very artistic and don't really have any real talent for crafting. I can do the basics of knitting, sewing, embroidery, crocheting and other stuff like that but actually getting my head down and concentrating on it for any length of time seems beyond me - I talk too much! If there's no company, I get easily distracted and lose focus on what's supposed to be getting done. Must try harder - I wonder if the nieces and grandchildren would like McGonks for Christmas? I doubt it very much! :)SAVE ALL LOOSE CHANGE - Still saving it religiously, dropping it into the appropriate jars for coppers or silver but spending so little cash means there's seldom much left over by way of change. Still, it mounts up into pounds eventually, then can be spent on something more substantial.ECO-RENOVATION - That's now two full years since we came here and we have managed to save quicker than we spend while doing little bits about the property. The new roof is on the back of the house, we now have proper windows in kitchen and bathroom, we have running water, electricity, a multi-fuel stove, the main hallway refloored, new cupboards in the temporary kitchen and the outbuilding has been rebuilt. The house still looks like a bombsite to the uninitiated, what with no plaster on walls, no ceiling in living-room and the old fireplace currently ripped out to leave a hole in the wall, but progress is slowly being made without too much waste. Indeed, the old fireplace has already been turned into another spiral herb bed in the garden. EVERYTHING ELSE KITTY (EEK) - This has taken a bit of a battering, as I'm aiming for a cash neutral year. Things that get paid from this include keeping the poultry, reclaiming and rebuilding the garden, National Insurance contributions and all manner of things not included in a basic household budget. The weekend holiday trip to Fort William, for example, had to come from this, as had several items of necessary clothing for the walk up Ben Nevis. It's the 'everything else' things that mount up and can kill a budget stone dead before we've even had time to notice. When you look at it from the point of view of having £8.75 per person per week to spend on groceries, toiletries and cleaning products, you can see the massively negative impact the likes of a takeaway meal might make, or the fact that the poultry may stop laying for a month but they still need feeding and bedding. Unexpected events crop up, charities need supporting, a pet needs a vet, a car needs repairs... the list is endless. Thankfully, we no longer have a car to drain funds but the extras still mount up, especially when things in the household need replacing. Year to date I have spent £445.29 but have only accrued £340.08 in extra income, generated from cash-back sites, sales of surplus eggs and, lest we forget, the whopping great £108 compensation from the power company after the 4-day power cut during the snow storms. The amount of interest generated from my meagre ISA savings is negligible, amounting to a ridiculous £1.50 per £1,000 per month! It's an absolute joke! As for the Premium Bonds, (I kept a few) they have won me nothing for the past 2 years! My free Lotto tickets, on the other hand, have given me three wins! Such a pity that the £5 or so had to be split twenty ways in the syndicate! Bottom line is that my 'EEK' is currently running in deficit at a rate of £105.21 This needs to be remedied soon, as the next load of poultry feed is due this month! Oh, and I also bought a tent! (Don't even ask!)DO WITHOUT A CAR - So far, so good! Working from home helps, as there's no commute anywhere, but as the sunny weather approaches, the urge to wander is creeping back in again. The shortest route to the local village store is just over 7 miles round trip, so cycling is much faster than walking and I'm limited by what I can carry on a bike, so spending is capped. However, getting further afield is going to be a challenge. I have several places I'd like to visit but each involves at least a 20 to 30 mile trip, so this challenge is being tied in with numbers 3 and 4 of my challenge list. I should get fitter cycling and I can thoroughly research my Frugaleur project by bike. One day, I may even invest in a newer bike.THE BUCKET LIST - Well, it's kind of a bucket list, it's my list of things to do before I'm 50, developed from my list of things to do before 40, which eventually became my list of thing to do before 45. One of those things was to go up Ben Nevis, so that was happily achieved on 25th May, at the same time as promoting the McGonks and fundraising for the local lifeboat. Also, I'd never been hostelling before, so that was another new experience. I found it a little expensive compared to camping, so bought a friend's tent when she was decluttering. I am sure 'tales of the tent' will be forthcoming in the not so distant future.That's it, my 1 to 10 of challenges and the current state of the budget. I'd like to become more pro-active in the moneymaking side of things but creating the microholding and developing the McGonks project now is my job, so where do I draw the line? I have no more binding contracts - last one was paid up to March - so now it's time to take the bull by the horns and go it alone, so to speak, in the self-sustainable living stakes. How difficult can it be? :)Please feel free to ask any questions and join me in the forum at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org if you'd like to discuss any of the items mentioned in this blog."},
{"title": "Six Weeks Behind this Year!", "date": "Wednesday 12 June 2013", "text": "The Growing Season is Higgledy Piggledy!What more can I say about this year's growing season? It's now 12th June and we are only a fortnight into the planting/sowing season here if you are relying entirely on growing outdoors with no artificial heating of any description. Between power cuts and the heaviest snowfall here in 60 years, it has taken much longer for the ground to thaw and warm up enough to plant or sow anything, so it is good to see a few signs of life about the place, at long last!Hawthorn is normally what I judge the weather by, relying on its other name for guidance - May - the month it flowers and the month that you ne'er cast a clout until it's oot, for us Scots. This year, however, the 'May' is just blooming now - almost six weeks later than 'normal'. So, without further ado, we had to start sowing and planting at the end of May and beginning of June, then we get hit by a fortnight of exceptional weather with temperatures reaching into the high 20s! Rainfall was minimal, if any, during the past fortnight but it eventually clouded over and we had showers all of yesterday and early hours of this morning. There's another very light shower now, but not serious enough to have curtailed outdoor plans. Yesterday's wash-out meant time in the kitchen, stewing the rhubarb that got picked and turning it into eight crumbles - six have gone in the freezer - while baking biscuits and a couple of cakes to use up surplus duck eggs. This afternoon, a bulk cooking session with mince and leftover veggies has netted me six double portion lasagnes, five of which will go into the freezer once cooled. It worked out at less than 75p per lasagne and each will feed two of us a main meal. The crumbles were probably less than half of that. Still having problems with the oven, though, as it is not distributing the heat properly, resulting in burning on one side and undercooking on the other! It will need to last until the kitchen eventually gets done properly and only then will it be updated.Salad leaves grow just fine in tubs, so this photo shows the first produce of the year from here in Frugaldom. Salad leaves just keep on coming and do exactly as stated on the seed packets - you cut them or pick them and they soon grow again - a definite grazing box if ever I saw one, even in our wonky weather and growing them outdoors. Salad leaves mean I no longer even attempt to grow lettuces in any quantity. Perhaps I'll sow a few seeds and grow half a dozen.The herb beds are doing amazingly well here, especially the herb spiral that was built as part of the permaculture plans. This one has barely needed weeding, as it is now chocablock full of herbs and strawberry plants. What doesn't get used gets left to go to seed, so the purple flowers from the chives add a splash of colour. The massive clump of sage at the top has completely engulfed the rosemary so that will need thinning out soon, but cuttings were taken last year and they did survive the winter to be planted out earlier this month. I now have two circular beds and two spirals, as we like them so much. The latest spiral was built from the stonework that was removed from the old fireplace; it saved having to pay to have all the rubble and stone removed for disposal. The circular bed is beginning to take on a life of its own now that last year's cuttings and thinning are all beginning to grow and spread. I love herb beds - they are so easy to maintain, quick to grow and encourage all sorts of experimentation in the kitchen. The parsley grew right through winter and even survived being buried under more than a foot of snow! I now have a bird feeding station set in the centre of this bed, so I'll need to keep an eye out for stray sunflowers.If anyone is wondering about planting or sowing seeds at this time of year, mine are way behind many I have seen elsewhere, but they are growing with the season. It's the only frugal way without incurring the costs of extra heating in a greenhouse. Plastic is all mine have been under and the seeds only got planted a fortnight ago with more being sown last week.The photo on the left shows the rate at which the courgettes are growing. I sowed two seeds into each of the six sections and it looks like I already have 10 healthy plants with the other two seeds just beginning to germinate. I can't explain why they are growing at different rates as they are all in the same compost, all get watered together and the tray gets turned every few days. The photo on the right shows a tray of cucumber seeds that were sown the same day as the courgettes. Again, there's a marked difference in the rate these seeds are growing. They are also much slower than the courgettes. You can just make out the beginnings of the 'true' leaves forming on the first of the seedlings. The healthiest of these will be transplanted onto the floor of the plastic greenhouse with the others being passed on to friends or else planted outdoors in the hope that we get some lengthy summer sunshine.In the main garden, potatoes were planted after adding a good layer of the homemade compost. These have just begun to grow now, with quite a few shoots appearing just over the past couple of days. We have two small beds of potatoes, sown from surplus Navan and Maris Pipers that began to sprout. I haven't bought any seed potatoes at all, as I simply cannot warrant the costs when making do with a temporary patch in the garden. Hopefully, we'll eventually get a proper potato patch one day in the future, but we're still at the 'make do and mend' stages of gardening, despite having been here for 2 years.Last year's metre square raised beds have been used for spring onions, Utah giant onions, all year round cauliflowers, carrots, cabbage and broccoli. The Biochar experiment was a failure for me, bur it has been left in the 'test bed' for this year, so we'll see if there are any improvements. Again, my seeds were only sown this month, so they are just beginning to emerge. the first of the spring onions were transplanted from a tub I had in the greenhouse. These all need to be kept under wire mesh to prevent the cats from using the boxes as litter trays!This time last year we were picking strawberries on an almost daily basis. This year, however, the plants are just flowering and the first little green strawberries are beginning to form! I'm not sure if there'll be any ready in time for the tennis. Last year, they were almost all eaten by then. I did get excited when I thought I spotted ripe fruit earlier today but it wasn't to be...... it was nothing more than a red leaf on one of the plants! Finally, I have to mention the fruit garden and the micro orchard. The rhubarb has done rather well. despite the late snow, and the blackcurrant bushes look absolutely laden. The young fruit trees haven't produced much bloom this year but I can see a few little cherries forming on the tree closest to the duck pond. There may not be much fruit growing on the old Victoria plum tree at the bottom of the garden, but there's a family of blue tits cheeping and tweeting in the nest box attached to the trunk and bird corner is beginning to look good. Beyond this, the garden is still a bit of a wilderness but the hens are managing to keep it clear of weeds.So, that's the general round-up from Frugaldom - not much growing in the garden yet but plenty of eggs being laid and the permaculture side of things seems to be heading in the right direction. Plus, there's still time to plant more seeds if I can clear space. The wormery survived the winter and is now producing lovely 'worm juice' plant food, the tomato and pepper seeds have finally germinated and, sadly, the sawfly invasion has, once again, picked on my gooseberry bush. I wonder if rhubarb leaves would help alleviate the problem? I'll let you know as soon as I try it. Raspberry bushes look wild - must learn how to cultivate them more productively.Until next time,FrugaldomFrugal forum can be found at www.frugalom.myfreeforum.org and you can also follow @Frugaldom on Twitter."},

It will soon all be over, done and dusted.We set off tomorrow morning and travel just over 200 miles north to Fort William where 10 of us are meeting up and planning on walking up the mountain on Saturday. We are all walking for different reasons and/or causes. I would have loved to have raised £1,000 to help keep our local lifeboat afloat but, sadly, many friends have just refused point blank to support this by way of donation. If I am honest, I have been very stupid and allowed myself to take it personally. After 4 months of trying to overcome back, knee and hip problems in order to get fit enough to even attempt such a strenuous walk, I felt insulted by the total lack of support by some of those around me and disgusted by the belittling comments, but apparently walking up Ben Nevis is easy and almost anyone can do it! Well, for me, IT IS A BIG THING and I can happily live without such thoughtless comments!All the details are linked to the www.mcgonks.com website and I shall update whenever possible over this coming weekend. At the moment, I have nothing much left to say on the matter and shall consider future options carefully after making the most of what I expect to be a very enjoyable and very challenging weekend. Good luck to my fellow walkers. :)"},
{"title": "Unpredictable Weather is a Major Pain in the Neck!", "date": "Thursday 18 April 2013", "text": "CATCH-UP TIME!We've had a horrible couple of days weatherwise but there have been a few gaps between the clouds, leaving it dry enough for long enough to get the washing out on the line. Laundry is something few think about nowadays, when they have modern central heating, tumble dryers and so little time spent at home to do things the frugal way. (I don't iron anything that doesn't need ironed.) We have neither central heating nor a tumble dryer here - not yet, anyway - so it is very much a case of hoping for dry weather, pegging wet washing on the line and then getting it over the airers to finish drying if the sunshine and wind have been insufficient.  So...  today's washing is on the line, but I need to nip to the shop for a few essentials. Easier said than done, when 'nipping to the shop' entails almost 10 miles round trip on a bicycle while attempting to pedal in blustering winds - it's like hitting a wall sometimes! Hmm... there's always the option to sling on a backpack and walk, but that takes about 3 hours out of the day and runs even more of a risk of running out of dry weather. In fact, we just did and it's now raining! Washing is now back in off the line, the bike's back in the shed before I even got the shopping basket attached and I dont know if I should trust the weather forecast, which said it would be raining all day, or trust looking out the window - we've had a couple of hours of sunshine, there's a hower just now, I can see a tiny bit of blue sky but there are still plenty of grey clouds looming. Maybe I'd be as well doing something else, instead! Get some bread dough on the go, bake some rolls and biscuits, make a pot of soup, distribute some eggs to the neighbours, plant some potatoes, water the seedlings in the greenhouse and try to arrange to get a joiner out here soon, so there's at least one room done in the house. Life is so exasperating, sometimes!"},
{"title": "Kindling Sticks and Free Firewood", "date": "Sunday 14 April 2013", "text": "Who Buys Kindling Sticks?Recently, I was chatting to someone on the phone when they asked me if I'd be interested in buying chopped sticks for kindling the fire. I found this quite amusing, as the thought had never really crossed my mind to BUY such a thing, despite the fact that I do shell out almost £1 at a time for a box of firelighters. I'd prefer not to, obviously, but needs must when you are in a hurry to get some heat going in the place and the sticks and logs are damp. Anyhow, the conversation prompted this blog post. Pallets make great firewood, most rural dwellers with open fires, stoves or logburners know this and most downshifters soon learn. Not only do the pallets split into fantastic firewood, they make great kindling sticks. But burning pallets isn't always the best thing to do, especially as a frugaler. First and foremost, we need to build them into other, more important things that we need. Pallets are like gold, we treasure them. If, like us, you have no vehicle in which to transport pallets, then any that do come your way have to be used accordingly, otherwise it's a bit like burning money. To date, we've had duck houses, planters, fencing, quail housing, compost 'bins' and log stores all built from recycled pallets and offcuts of wood, but we are now down to our last 3 pallets... a tragedy, in my book! There may well be more in the future, but many of the builders' merchants are now charging for them or else insisting they be returned, so I'd to think very carefully how best to utilise the last of our stash. The decision was soon made... we need a stick store, thus freeing up valuable space in the log store.Stick or log stores are easy to make, when you think about it - they just need to contain the fire fodder and keep the rain off it while allowing the wind to blow through and dry it all. So, another little corner was cleared and the three pallets propped up and nailed together, secured with a piece of board across the top. The top board has now been felted and a raised base made by laying straps of wood across the bottom.  We've already begun filling it up with all the sticks that are beng collected from around the garden and along the roadsides as we walk/cycle - most brought down by the weight of the recent snow. It shouldn't take long to fill it up at this rate, then it's just a case of keeping it topped up with whatever kindling we can lay our hands on for free. A cubic metre's worth of free, covered space dedicated to storing free sticks - nothing like being prepared. This basic design, if I can even call it that, is the same one used for so many pallet projects. I've even seen goat housing and poultry sheds built this way and, nearby, there's a wildlife hide constructed in the exact same manner. A piece of tarpaulin draped over the front is sufficient to stop the rain blowing straight in and soaking everything.Next time you spot a pallet lying by the roadside, in a skip or cast aside in any other way, think of the real frugalers - we simply love our old pallets.Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Please Send Warm Weather Soon, Thank You.", "date": "Thursday 11 April 2013", "text": "And Now We Have Rain.It seems such a very long time ago,That winter hit us with everything it could throw, Yet, here I am, sitting just so,Looking out the window and still seeing snow!A very bad poem, indeed! But it's true. Now, to add to the mix, the rain has begun to fall. I doubt very much if it will be enough to wash away the acres of snow we still have around this area, but it's a start. Take a look at the photo - that's me standing next to one of the drifts that still blocks a local lane. Time to light the stove, I think, as I can see my breath in here again! The prolonged cold spell hasn't done anyone any favours, that's for sure. The garden has barely been touched this year, other than some basic tidying and clipping the straggling brambles that nothing seems to stop from growing. There are buds on many of the trees and fruit bushes, so they must sense something better coming our way soon.Indoors can be much colder than outdoors when the sun shines during winter here, so there have been quite a few extra miles of walking and cycling done, carrying with me my trusty basket and taking the opportunity to fill it with firewood. I'm mostly taking advantage of all the fallen sticks that have dried to tinder and become perfect for lighting the stove. Alternative energy that's helping to reduce our overall carbon emissions! Dry firewood, hand collected, brought home by bike.You don't need to walk or cycle very far to find an abundance of free fuel lying by the roadsides. Around this area, there's not even the need to venture into the forests or woodlands, as there's so much lying by the roadsides that can be salvaged. Most of these crushed, fallen branches are now so dry that they ignite instantly and are soon burning hot enough to boil the kettle within minutes - a warning, indeed, to landowners, farmers and gamekeepers of the dangers of wildfires spreading during moor burnings! We have collected quite a few bags filled with already charred gorse wood and this seems to burn with frightening ferocity!Free heat is never something to be scoffed at, especially when we consider the cost of electricity, and is always welcome during the cold months here in Frugaldom. Some also say it's carbon neutral, so a bit of a benefit to be had in that department, too - no fossil fuels used in cars to collect or move these sticks, as we're walking and cycling nowadays. It also gives us far more opportunities to take the time to photogrph the wildlife that lives all around us.Having to adapt to not having a car has been quite a smooth transition, I have to admit. It certainly makes you think more about how far you are going and how heavy the load will be that needs carrying home. I have now switched to a wicker basket on the back of the bike for collecting sticks, as it's far easier to just lift that off and sit it by the stove.In the greenhouse, which is unheated barring any sunshine, the wormery has been safely under cover and its occupants are thriving. Last week, while feeding the wrigglers, we spotted several babies wiggling about the place, so it may well be tme to start tapping off that lovely 'worm juice' soon and preparing the raised beds for this year's veg-growing. Just send us a little more sunshine and a lot less frost to arm the ground enough to sow something soon.On the 'working from home' side of things, the new googly eyes have arrived to complete the next batch of McGonks and we have just published the first ebook of the year:\"What if the Famous had Allotments? A quirky guide to vegetable gardeners of fame and fantasy.\" It was written by 'Northsider Dave', whose blog you may already read. The new ebook should, hopefully, be available to download to your Kindle by this evening. I'll post the link here as soon as it becomes available. Good luck with the new book, Dave! :)"},
{"title": "Easter Round-up in Frugaldom", "date": "Sunday 31 March 2013", "text": "First of all, I'd like to share the news that we have just managed to break through the £200 mark with our fundraising, trying to help raise cash towards replacing the local lifeboat. Our main challenges takes place Bank holiday weekend on 24th May, 2013, when we'll be leaving Port William and travelling to Fort William with the aim of taking members of Clan McGonk to the summit of Ben Nevis - UK's highest mountain.Today, which also happens to be Easter Sunday, is the first day of British Summertime here in UK but our local Scottish weather wouldn't have you believe that. It's around 5 Deg C in the sunshine, the ponds are still frozen and there are still lanes blocked by snowdrifts. It is, however, dry and breezy, so frugal line drying of laundry is a boost. The roads are also clear enough to gt back out on the bikes, assuming you're careful and stick to main routes. This is the bike sitting next to the roadside on the main route into our area - still quite deep with snow, to say the least. I took the opportunity to stop for a couple of photos to show how much had melted on the exposed areas - vast swathes of grass now showing through, but with lengthy drifts along the walls. The above was taken at lunchtime today, over a weeks since the blizzards hit us. Yesterday, we cycled down to the local village to meet with someone who is keep to establish a project that really appeals to me - one involving a food co-operative for local growers and producers, along with a community based cafe and work space for the local artists and crafters among us. The project revolves around the old corn mill and adjoining 16 acres of land. There are already hens, ducks and pigs there, plus the two Clydesdale horses that are being put to work, hauling out debris and ploughing the land where a heritage variety of wheat will be grown. It's hoped that the old water wheel can be restored and put back into use, powering the mill, while outdoors can be run as a self-sufficientish smallholding, providing fresh food locally. There's also a small fishing boat and scope for a wide variety of fruit and vegetable plots. And lest we forget, the favoured mode of transport could help reduce carbon emissions if work and local travel was done by horse power, on foot or by bicycle. It all sounds great, I just hope the project can get off the ground and achive success.The bartering system may well come into play, but the project needsto establish itself and garner the support of the locals in order that it may progress. Spud, one of the Clydesdales, has already endeared himself to the village by being put to work during last week's power cuts, when he was out and about pulling fishcrates filled with fuel and delivering it to places that modern vehicles simply couldn't reach. Photo here is of Charlie and Spud relaxing by the side of the burn that flows alongside the mill.Aside from visiting the old mill, we also had a stop off at the shore, where it was rather amusing to see snow lying along the edges of the slipways, right to the water's edge. Sunny it may be, but warm it is not. Who knows how or when anything can be sown in this weather but one thing's for sure - we'll be needing many more logs and pinecones before it's warm enough to do without the stove indoors and the prospect of being warm outdoors is still looking pretty distant, even in the greenhouse. Speaking of which, I wonder if there's space for a couple of fullsize polytunnels at either of the nearby frugal projects? Must ask!"},
{"title": "Winter Struck with a Vengeance!", "date": "Wednesday 27 March 2013", "text": "Why It's Fab to be Frugal!A full week has passed since my last blog post and I have to apologise for that. However, 3 of those days we were without power during some of the worst snow storms people in this area have seen in their life times! This southwest corner of Scotland just doesn't normally get severe winter weather. But I'll get to that in a moment or two. On Thursday 21st March, we had a fabulously frugal outing to the beach. It was a glorious day of sunshine and blue sky, there was a blustery wind but the heat was getting through despite this, especially when cycling with the wind driving us onwards along the roads at a jolly speed. I packed a picnic lunch into the cool bag, loaded it onto the bike and then we headed off to take some photographs for the eco-arts blog.  In all, we covered about 15 miles, so everything is within fairly easy reach when the weather plays fair. Cycling along the shore was bright and breezy, then it's a simple case of wheeling the bikes down onto the beach, where it's safe to leave them. Let's face it, Frugaldom isn't exactly situated in the busiest of areas and tourist season doesn't start for another few days. The beach was completely deserted, as it is on most of our visits. We explored some nearby caves, where smugglers may once have hidden their booty. There's local folklore relating to certain caves on this shore having been inhabited by troglodytes - I just love that word, don't you? Now, of course, the cave is nothing more than a bin, filled with whatever has been blown in over the winter. On my next visit here, I must remember to take a rubbish bag and gloves so I can clear the place out a bit. I is such a shame to see it filled with plastic bottles and the discarded waste blown after being tossed out the windows by passing motorists. Sadly, there are no bins within the vicinity, so I'm not quite sure how I'd lug it all to the nearest suitable disposal point. On Thursday night, the power supply must have been interupted because I woke around 7am on the Friday morning to the clunk of the meter and the whir of the electrics stirring back to life. It had been fairly windy through the night and a friend had even pointed out that the sky looked like it was cooking up a big storm. \"Be prepared!\" That was the last thing I remember thinking on the Thursday night - thank goodness I took heed!We have Velux windows upstairs here, but when I looked out in the morning there was not a single thing to be seen - they were completely covered in SNOW! The house was freezing - no central heating here and the electric heaters had gone off due to the powercut - so I grabbed the camera (as one does in such emergency situations) and went out to the front door to be greeted by this! I was able to get online to access some local news but the power went back out before 8am. That was the start of the snowy weekend that will go down in history for many of the locals here, as they just aren't used to seeing this amount of snow land on their doorsteps: they had no power, no preparation time and many had no emergency supplies. By now, we were blocked in by the drifts. Nobody wandered far on Friday while the blizzards blew and the snow drifts grew.'Wilbur' was lit and the kettle was on the go constantly for hot water, hot drinks and warmth. I cooked the breakfast porridge on the stove top, boiled a ham and made a pot of soup for lunches, cooked the potatoes, the veggies, fried bacon and eggs... Wilbur has been working 24/7 since Friday morning and I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to be prepared for inclement weather combined with no mains power.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Our open fire couldn't be lit because it has a back boiler that heats the water and radiators - it is driven by an electric pump. Those with gas or oil central heating had nothing because it's all reliant on electrically driven pumps. Those with solar panels and wind turbines were no better off, as these are connected to the National Grid - none are stand alone with power storage facilities. ﻿﻿The road is under there somewhereMost about here do have camping equipment and generators, so the street ran pretty much as normal with the help of some additional community spirit, but no amount of that keeps the place ticking over when fuel supplies begin to run out - and that began happening when the power failed to return after 48 hours in sub-zero temperatures and high winds drifting the now very deep snow - this was the top end of our road on Sunday.Several miles away, suppliers had run out of gas and the petrol stations had no power to pump fuel for any vehicles even if they could have reached the forecourts. Our main road beig dug out at the weekendAll the roads blocked, even the main trunk road that links the Irish ferry port at Cairnryan to Dumfries and then Carisle. It's the Irish-English link route. This A75 Euroroute soon became impassable, with hundreds of vehicles and passengers stranded. The snow ploughs couldn't get through the roads! When the tractors became trapped in drifting snow, it was the turn of the 'big boys' in their 'big toys'. As I write this, our roads have now all been cleared, leaving massive walls of snow along either side. Feed lorries, fuel lorries and other deliveries have all made it through and things are running relatively smoothly BUT the snow has begun falling again and the temperature has not reached much above freezing since last week. It's beautiful to look out on the white landscape and was especially so on Sunday, when the sun shone brilliantly from perfect blue skies. This photo shows the road we normally walk along when doing one of our circular routes - it was cleared by Monday but that was as far as we could get along it on Sunday. Those on the other side were stuck and without power for many hours longer than us here on the 'main' road.Food supplies here are always relatively good, wth plenty of longterm items and 2 freezers running. But freezers need electricity and defrosted food needs cooking or using up quickly. I am very fortunate to have my stand alone multi-fuel stove for cooking. My frozen food has all survived despite 3 days without power, by way of packing the free space with bags of snow. The hens and ducks are laying daily, so eggs were shared with neighbours who happily swapped for a few carrots to make extra soup and a couple of packs of firelighters, which are always needed for emergencies. The power company flew along the route of the powerlines and had emergency repairs done relatively quickly, in my opinion, while our local lifeboat crew down in the village helped countless households to cope. An emergency Facebook page was set up to help snowbound residents of Dumfries and Galloway, although I was unaware of that until I received a phone call from a friend of a relative of an elderly resident within walking dostance of me needing help. Our roadsides currently look like this, but without the blue sky, as that's now turned to more snow. To get those roads cleared as well as keeping the elderly relatively warm and fed plus help struggling farmers dig out stranded livestock, it meant community spirit was raised tenfold. Hopefully, we wont see a repeat of this event for a long time, but we are forecast more snow and the odds are heavily stacked in favour of a white Easter. For now, the crisis has been averted and many have even managed to get out and enjoy the exceptional scenes created by this sudden and very unusual weather event. Some of us even got as far as to find the time to create some eco-art by the roadside! I hope you like the Snowcat!Note to all who plan on following the frugaldom lifestyle: ALWAYS keep your old-fashioned, 'plug into the socket' phone handy. Wireless handsets are brilliant most times but completely useless during power cuts. Don't forget that there is little or no mobile phone signals in remote or rural areas. Keep rechargeable batteries fully charged.Keep candles and matches handy at all times and ensure you have safe locations and holders for them..Keep a stock of long shelf-life, fast cook foodstuffs, instant coffee and dried milk.Ensure you always have sufficient medication, if required.Always keep a plentiful supply of pet and livestock feeding/bedding/supplies.Know where everything is in case it's needed in a hurry.Frugaldom forums can be found at www.frugaldom.myfreeforum.org"},
{"title": "Vernal Equinox Updates", "date": "Wednesday 20 March 2013", "text": "When Day Equals NightWell folks, that's us passed the worst of the winter months where daylight hours were outnumbered by those of darkness. With any luck, the weather will decide to shift in a more sunny direction and allow us to make a proper start on gardening. To date, it has either been too wet or too cold to do anything, not to mentin the place being frozen solid or, in many places, covered in snow. For many, there is the luxury of heated greenhouses but that's not so for the frugal living among us - we have trouble enough heating our homes without trying to heat glass (or plastic) houses. The Frugaldom greenhouse has stood the test of winter this far but to be fair, we get very little snow in comparison to elsewhere and the garden here is far more shetered than previous ones. Nonetheless, the lack of sunshine means there's not a lot happening out there at the moment. I had sown some spring onions and salad leaves into tubs - the spring onions are coming along slowly but the salad leaves are no further along than they were a month ago! The wormery, on the other hand, seems to have thrived in there for shelter. Each time I check, the worms seem to be more and more active. Let's hope the £2 coin savings pot proves to have been invested wisely. The frugal fitness is something I'm still not entirely coninced about, despite having been wthout a car snce the end of November. The trip to the shop is now far less daunting, even on a grey day, and I must be getting fitter, as I can now manage to go for a 10-mile cycle over and above the 7 to 10 miles (depending on route taken) round trip to the village store. Prices are getting to be horrendous. This morning, I cycled down to the store and bought spreading cheese (£1.19), a small block of cheddar (250g), a small pack of oatcakes, 4 bananas and a very extravagant loaf of bread, as a special treat for sandwiches. That little lot set me back almost £8! As followers of a frugal living lifestyle, free from the constraints of the nine to five, the biggest pleasure we have is our ability to get out and about whenever the weather permits. I love exploring, seeking out unusual locations or ones that are a little off the beaten track, while building up a collection of associated photographs and articles relating to these places. Perhaps, one day in the future, you will visit and experience Frugaldon for yourself, and you'll already know which of these places you would like to visit for free.This area of Scotland in littered with cairns, old forts, ruins, caves, church and chapel remains and, of course, we also have hilltops with trig points for 'bagging' - another free hobby. Yesterday, we visited the old site of Chapel Finian, where we ate a frugal packed lunch before stashing the bikes and then setting off to hike up a nearby hill in search of some cairns, ruined homesteads and ancient hut circles. The above photo shows the ruined chapel by the roadside. The trig point number to the left shows the first one we have found at ground level rather than summit - I'm guessing that's why this one has a 'G' number instead of an 'S' number. We didn't have much of a climb before reaching what looked like a ruined homestead with walled fields. I haven't been able to find out any information about this particular location and we didn't have time to exploe it more fully, but its in the diary for future visits (with picnics) and further investigation. A bit more climbing up a very wet and muddy trail that zigzagged up the hill through dead bracken, gorse and brambles soon led us to the biggest cairn we have visited in this area to date. It has to be over 3m high, but felt even bigger than that when I stood next to it and looked out across the bay - what a viewpoint! This particular cairn even had an extra wide base that could have been built for sitting on while keeping watch. (Over or for what, is a mystery.) At this point, we'd to turn and head for home without exploring any further as a shower of sleet began to fall and we could see the cattle on the move. My fear of the bovine beasts means I give them as wide a berth as possible and avoid them completely whenever I can. Back home and the frugaling continues - no further renovation work has been done to the house but I now have the dining bench set moved into the sittingroom where the pot belly stove is almost constantly on the go. The wee stove just ticks over, not quite blazing enough to boil the kettle, but warm enough that the cat is happy to sprawl in front of it for most of the day when the weather is bad. The dried pine cones are fast disappearing, so we really need a few completely dry days to get out and collect some more of those - they burn well.  Since giving up the car, our household carbon emissions must surely have dropped and the savings have certainly grown a little quicker. There's very little to spend on nowadays, what with no car running costs or petrol to pay. I may, however, need to invest in some new brake pads for the bike. Switching the worn back brakes for the not-so-worn front brakes will suffice until such times as I have gained sufficient Amazon gift vouchers from my Topcashback account. Since joining a few years ago, I have earned £728.35 cashback! That's a huge amount of free money for a frugaler! The other added bonus for this month is the cashback accrued from the credit card. Where some people hate credit cards, I love mine! It gets used for anything and everthing, paid off in full each month and it also pays 1% cashback on all transactions - fee free! I should manage to recoup about £50+ from that, as things like building materials and poultry feeding got paid with it, as do any online transactions. Now I need to take stock of how the winter has gone and prepare for spring organising and summer fun, including getting some serious crafting done. The McGonks project needs to be cranked up a notch, there's some fndraising to be done for the Ben Nevis hostelling holiday and I'm wanting to make a nice, multi-cloured wooly blanket for over the back of the sofa bed so that there's a cosy, multi-purpose bedsit available for guests brave enough to sample real frugal living."},
{"title": "The Real Good Life", "date": "Thursday 14 March 2013", "text": "LIFE IS GOOD WHEN THE SUN SHINESCash-paying work has been a bit thin on the ground recently, so I've been able to get out and about whenever the sun shines, researching for articles and writing what I want rather than what I'm paid to write. Renovations can wait - we're almost water tight, we have logs and coal, and there's plenty of food in the half-completed kitchen.Working from home and frugal living while having no rent to pay and no car to run has many major advantages. I'm not denying there can be disadvantages but, when the sun shines, folks like us can just take off and do as we please. I can clock up more miles on my trusty two-wheeled steed - the secondhand bike. Mine is a mountain bike and H's is a hybrid meant for road use, but it's been behaving very well over the farm tracks, forest tracks, fields and cattle grids. As you can see in the photo, my bike now goes nowhere without the black cool-bag, (a freebie from several years ago) which normally holds lunch and emergency supplies or else basic groceries from the local store. (You can pack quite a lot in there when you have to do so.)The weather, although bitingly cold, has been fair, meaning it's warmer out than in when living in a house with no proper central heating. Sitting at the computer and reading the screen through your own breath cloud isn't a good look, so getting warm means light the fire, light the stove or exercise. You'd think I'd lose weight doing this, but I never do! This post is a run through of what March has brough, so far: it came in like a lamb, let's hope it doesn't go out like a lion! 01 March 2013 - We decided to head out to the highest point in our area. The Machars is an area of lowland in southwest Scotland, within the Dumfries and Galloway region. We're on a peninsula that has no large hills or mountains, only a few fells, Mochrum Fell being the highest, at 197m / 646ft. We left the bikes at the foot of the hill and walked up a route that took us past two shepherds' cairns and then to the summit trig point, where there's a cist, trig point and remains of a much larger cairn. Cost for this outing - FREE.02 March 2013 - Grandaughter was visiting and, although it wasn't all that sunny, it was dry and bright enough to get out for a picnic. (She'd brought her bike with her.) We cycled out to the old church ruins at Barhobble, where we left the bikes and climbed Changue Fell, which is right next to Mochrum Fell. We ate our picnic while sitting at the church ruins and then cycled home, stopping off for a walk along the edge of Elrig Loch to see all the Greylag geese that are visiting for winter. Cost for this outing - FREE.03 March 2013 - Glorious sunny Sunday so we packed another picnic and went off-roading through the forest on the bikes. It always amazes me that we seldom see another person during our travels. We have all of this around us and yet few take the time to enjoy it. However, whispers of an impending windfarm being built in the neighbourhood has many locals up in arms about the destruction of the countryside, devaluation of properties and several alleged health risks associated with working turbines. I'll reserve judgement. Cost for this outing - FREE. 06 March 2013 - After peering at maps and searching online, we agreed on a circular route that meant a shortcut home cross-country. This proved to be very eventful, as I have a bit of a fear of cattle and don't like to find myself too close to them. Let's just say that today's route gave me a free lesson in hard, fast and furious pedaling over very rough terrain whilst dinging my bell and screeching at cows that didn't seem best pleased to see us on our bikes! Thankfully, no calves and no bull! Cost for this outing (other than the few pounds possibly lost during my frenzied escape from galloping cows) - FREE! We do try to get out most days for either a walk or a cycle but I won't boar you with the more mundane trips to the post office, village store or walk up the hill with my 'get fitter' walking buddy. There's so much to see and so many places to explore that it's difficult knowing which, if any, will be of interest to frugalers. On the whole, I visit only places that are free, so I'm hoping that's enough to interest anyone who reads this blog. Frugal living means frugal fun.10th March 2013 - This was a good trip, barring the sad state the old farm steading was in with the remains of several dead sheep scattered about the fields plus discarded veterinary-type containers and general rubbish! This building belongs to the Marquis of Bute and was formerly an agricultural school of some description. It's dated 1890, so not all that old, and sits on farmland that's also home to the trig point we wanted to visit, at Craigeach Fell. We cycled to Craigeach and left the bikes in one of the derelict outbuildings, where they'd be kept dry in the event the rain or snow arrived. All around us seems to be getting snow at the moment but we have been luck, so far, with none. Cost of this outing - FREE. 11th March 2013 - Pulled on the walking boots and decided to find out if the ground was frozen enough to allow us to walk a circuit cross-country by following the footpaths. It was very soggy and still flooded in parts. We almost made it, until coming face to face with some horned, hairy beasts while cutting down onto the shore road. These 'friendly' critturs weren't showing any signs of taking off in the opposite direction, so, rather than make a run for it and land over an embankment, we back-tracked and completed the walk along the main farm track. Cost of this outing - FREE. 12th March 2013 - Today I cycled to the agricultural merchants to settle my monthly poultry feed account. Normally I would just telephone and pay by card, but the sun was shining and the 17-mile trip on the bike didn't seem so daunting. Once there, I even treated myself to some luxury 'CoolMax' walking socks for the trip up Ben Nevis in May - they were cheaper in the agri-store than I'd seen them online for the exact same make. Lovely day turned to lovely evening, so friend and I did our regular 4 miles over a nearby steepish hill to the next village and back. We always see something while out there, whether it's birds, deer, snow on the peaks of Snaefell across the water on the Isle of Man or the flashing of the Mull of Galloway lighthouse across the other side of the bay. Tonight's sunset was worthy of a photo. Total cost of outings - FREE. 13th March 2013 - The day began as normal, I needed a few items from the shop and the shop, depending on which route I take, is at least 7 miles round trip. Yesterday I took the bike and H accompanied me, as we had a little research to do for some written articles. The entire trip spanned out to just under 15 miles, but I did remember to buy the fruit, cheese and sugar. In fact, I was really rash and spent about £3 extra on lunch stuff, when we decided to do three exploratory trips in the one outing!  We climbed the steps to the site of the ancient Barsalloch Fort, where we demolished the most of lunch. Cost of visit - FREE Next, we headed further along the shore to the Gavin Maxwell Memorial, on the road to St Medan Golf Club - Scotland's most southerly golf club. This impressive bronze otter stands looking out over the bay at Monreith. Gavin Maxwell, author of 'Ring of Bright Water', was born in Elrig House, about which he wrote in his slightly less famous novel, 'The House of Elrig'. It is from this book that I have learned quite a bit about our area. Cost of visit - FREE There are several beautiful picnic spots around Monreith, many with seating provided, but we continued on our way to explore our next target - Kirkmaiden. This is one of Scotland's oldest churches. It has a small graveyard and some fantastic stories attached to it. Tradition has it that the original bell was removed and sailed across the bay to be placed in another church of exact same name, but the boat sank before it reached the other side. The little red stone building is the burial chapel of the Maxwell family, who still own the nearby estate. As far as I'm aware, Sir Michael, who considers himself frugal, is the only Maxwell who now resides there. He seems to be a bit of a character, as I'm sure anyone who saw him on the TV series 'Country House Rescue' will agree.Cost of this excursion - FREE.So there you have it - a peak into the life of a Frugaldom dweller. None of the above are all-day affairs, so it leaves plenty of time for the more mundane things in life, like housekeeping, cooking and earning a small income. Perhaps it isn't the perfect life for a gregarious socialite with a penchant for foreign holidays, glamour and glitz. All of tese things can be put together on a miniscule budget, so it isn't like we couldn't afford to set ourselves another challenge. I think I prefer simple living.Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Is Bread and Butter Pudding Still Frugal?", "date": "Thursday 7 March 2013", "text": "BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDINGBread and butter pudding has always been a firm favourite of frugalers everywhere throughout many generations for the mere fact that it's nutritious, filling and uses up any leftover bread that may, otherwise, have been chopped and fed to the birds. Worse sti, there are many who would simply bin it! Not so a frugaler! The remainder of a dry loaf can be adapted to many things, as per several previous posts - homemade French Bread style pizza, bread crumbs for Scotch Eggs, homemade croutons and, of course, pudding! Being of frugal nature (or possibly forced into such a mode by circumstances dictated by failing finances) many of us bake all our own bread. whether by hand or by machine, it still has a crust and can go stale quicker than your ordinary, preservative filled, shop-bought soft loaf. Using it up at all stages is a must to avoid waste, so let's try for ultra-frugal bread and butter pudding. IngredientsBreadMargarine or buttery spread(real butter's for special occasions)Eggs (from the garden hens/ducks/quail)Milk (we don't have a goat, so this was cheap UHT skimmed)SugarSultanas (cheaper than raisins at the mment)Cinnamon & nutmeg (added luxury) MethodThinly slice the bread then lightly spread margarine on each slice. Cut into smaller pieces and lay along the base of an ovenproof/microwave proof dish.Sprinkle a layer of sultanasI used a duck egg and 3 bantam eggs plus about a pint of milk and beat these together with about a tablespoon of sugar.Pour some egg mix over bottom layer of bread then repeat the layers - I managed 3 layersAllow the egg/milk mix to soak into all the bread - press it down into the mix if need be, just as long as it's all covered.Sprinkle a lttle cinnamon, grated nutmeg and a little extra sugar for added flavour. CookingOnce your dish is filled and all the egg/milk mix absorbed by the bread, place the dish in the microwave. My microwave is rated 'D' at 700w, so I switched in on full for 5 minutes. I then removed the dish, sliced through the middle of the pudding, pressed it down and returned it to the microwave on full power for a further 2 minutes, which seemed to be enough to cook it through completely. Let it stand for a couple of minutes when you take it out the microwave, as it's still cooking at that point. NB: Unlike the oven-baked variety, which takes about 45 minutes in a pre-heated oven, this frugal version of the pudding will not go golden brown or crispy on the top. Your bread and butter pudding is now ready for eating and can be served with exra milk. If you thk about it, it has alost everything you could want in a tasty, filling meal, especially if you use wholemeal bread, which is what I normally make here. It has fibre, protein, calcium, fruit and you dont have to use sugar, you could easily substitute that with a thinly sliced banana or apple and perhaps a drizzle of honey. This is a great, easy, cheap recipe, even with sultanas costing £1 per bag. It should be sufficient for 4 servings and probably works out at less than £1 to make for twice the amount you'd get in a cheap, shop bought one but it is not frugal if you need to rush out and buy eggs, bread and spices purely on a whim while having a passing notion for good old-fashioned bread and butter pudding. Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Petrol is HOW MUCH per Litre?", "date": "Saturday 23 February 2013", "text": "COUNTING THE COSTS OF TRAVELMy blogging is sporadic whenever there's nothing much to say, so I shall fill you in on what the past week or so has produced, here in Frugaldom. Looking back, it has been rather an eventful two weekends and this one isn't even halfway through, yet.First of all, my new superduper cheap silcone cake tray arrived, so I had great fun making muffins - 18 at a time (6 in the one I already had), all different types. We're still eating muffins - hot, cold, with custurd, without custard... you get the picture. I made a load of muffins! This, of course, does not bode well for the frugal fitness plan of getting slim and trim for the big May Challenge! With this in mind, friend and I decided it was time to make a serious start on our 2013 hill climbing challenge, so we packed all our gear last Saturday, filled some rolls and a flask of tea, then headed for the Hills. We aimed for Cairnsmore of Fleet, which is the highest of the Solway Hills. At 2333 feet, it squeaks in as a small mountain and one that's normally a relatively easy climb. Hmm... except February is NOT the best month to attempt this, especially if you don't know your way about said hills. We managed to fight our way to the start of the summit track despite deep mud. We managed to get through the forest despite the persistant drizzle and squelchy paths underfoot. We managed to cross the windswept logging track and ascend further up the hill, wading our way through what can only be described as a riverbed of slush and fast flowing meltwater that was worsening by the minute. The horizontal, wind-driven rain was battering into us! We even managed to clear the zigzags higher up, despite the swirling mists and driving rain, but then the freezing fog, high winds and snow began closing in on us and we thought better of it. About one single kilometre from the summit, we had to turn back. Downwards through the snow then fog and rain, saturated and in need of a cup of the by now, cold tea. And just to rub salt in the wound of our failed attempt... WE WERE PASSED BY A RUNNER! Well! I'm not sure about you or anyone else, but I erupted into fits of the disbelieving giggles and simply had to sidetrack the guy for a photo. So here it is - my friend 'Woo' with the crazy runner who said that after eight different ascents of Cairnsmore of Fleet, he was yet to see the view from the summit!After almost 5 hours of walking, soaked through, we had to visit the supermarket on the way home and do the grocery shopping. It was horrible! The shelves were bare and there were no reduced items!This being the year I challenge the household to live without a car, travel is severely restricted. I can venture only as far as my secondhand bike or legs will carry me... or as far as a friend will drive.Being without a car hasn't really hampered us on the 'getting out and about' front because there's plenty to do and see about here. Since last weekend, we have visited several lots of interesting standing stones, for example. The site known as Torhouse is the furthest we have managed to go so far, at just over 11 miles from here. On a dry day, which it was, there's plenty of scope for picnics and exploring the archaeology of the place, including a large stone circle, a rather interesting looking rocky ridge and several other standing stones nearby.There are many strange stone feature strewn about our local landscape. Some are said to be marking the graves of long-forgotten kings, some the remnants of pagan ritual sites and others as hilltop markers from days gone by, probably lookout points during times of warring or religious oppression.It's not like I get out and about on shopping trips - no shops here - nor do I get away for many day trips when there's no public transport here, so it's all very frugal, by way of visiting places that are free to explore.Surprisingly, we have few forests around us here in this little part of Scotland, so it was lovely to spot a red squirrel last week. Not surprisingly, I wanted to go and look for more, so the bikes were utilised again, but this time in a more off-road sor of a way. It's a shame to think that this forest may soon become the site of a windfarm, but it's equally a shame that so few people visit. Perhaps more will if they build their massive wind turbines and lay in proper bridleways or footpaths! In the meantime, I shall continue to collect fallen pinecones and watch the local planning application updates with interest.Getting further afield is difficult without engaging the help of a friend or hiring the services of a third part. I could, of course, walk the mile and a bit along the lane to the main road, where there is a daily bus into the ferry town of Stranraer, about 25 miles from here. This I will try very soon, I just need to check they haven't changed the bus timetables or it could turn into a very expensive mistake if the need for a taxi arose. It would cost me more than a week's grocery budget to get a taxi from there! But I do want to explore the possibilities, especially as that's the location of our nearest railway station.That's what those in power want us to do, isn't it? Car share, walk, cycle and/or use public transport? Afterall, the pavements, paths, cycle routes, buses and trains are all publicly funded or subsidised by the taxpayers' dosh, are they not? Just like our British farm produce is Government subsidised, yet frugal lifers cannot afford to buy it, nor rural lifers find it to buy it. But we should be grateful that somebody somewhere benefits! (I'm not even going to start on the horsemeat 'scandal', it's all old hat to those of us who campaigned about it in the 80s.)For now, I am going to focus on how much money can be saved by giving up the car. Savings are two-fold, as there's the financial aspect (tax, insurance, servicing, repairs and fuel) and the carbon footprint/environmental issues, which have to count for something.So here we are, living life without a car. It should be great, we should be fit, healthy and save a small fortune. Unless, of course, you live in a rural area where there is no public transport, there are no pavements or proper footpaths and no shops to visit for the weekly groceries even if there were cycle routes to get there. Add to that the winter weather that sometimes makes walking unsafe, far less cycling, and you can see that it's not all that it's cracked up to be - there's no help available from anyone. But the car has long gone, so we have lost the option to backtrack on this challenge.I need to get used to cycling. After about 12 weeks of weather-induced, sporadic practice, I have managed to achieve a distance of about 20 miles. It isn't quite far enough to visit the nearest Co-op but it's enough to reach the nearest village store. Today... my bike has a flat tyre and is in need of new back brake pads. Our nearest bike shop - a little local one run from the back yard of the owner's house - is 23 miles round trip! I've contacted them and am hoping the puncture repair holds for long enough to let me practice cycling that far and then cycling that far, when I can pay for something called 'slime' to be put in my tyre tubes. It's meant to provide up to 3 years of puncture free cycling. While there, I can get new brake pads and a shopping basket fitted to the front. I'll budget £50 for this, as that's almost the cost of an MOT but should last me for a long time. Now to raise the extra £50!Isn't it great when the Government of your own country overlooks the fact that Britain has rural communities made up of people who don't necessarily have the financial ability to just pay someone to 'fix' their problems? The simple solution may well be to go and find a better paid job but I ask you, where does one find a well-paid job in a rural location, or even a job that's within walking or cycling distance of home? HOME is about the only place we can work, unless we want to be dragged into the benefits system or burn a few thousand pounds each year on car travel and everything else required of employment.  Back to the day in hand.An emergency DIY puncture repair was done and then we cycled around the 'short' circuit, which is a fairly scenic, seven point something mile trip around single track lanes beginning and ending along the road running parallel with the loch. The sun was shining, there were loud gaggles of Greylag geese by the water and the tyre stayed inflated, so that was my little bit of excitement for this afternoon. Now I am off out for a walk to stretch my legs and fit a short hillclimb into the exercise regime. Ben Nevis may be over 200 miles away and over 4,000 feet higher than any hill about here but we all need to start somewhere and 'free & local' is what's on the frugal fitness menu.Until next time,NYK/Frugaldom. :)﻿"},
{"title": "Cooking, Cleaning and Cash Generation!", "date": "Monday 11 February 2013", "text": "Frugal February ContinuesFirst of all, I'd like to thank everyone who has kindly contributed to the Port to Fort Challenge. We are sticking rigidly to our fitness plan and, thanks to all the helpful advice, suggestions, recommendations, eBay, Regatta Outlet and the donations we have received so far towards the lifeboat fund, it is making it a most exciting and enjoyable challenge. Photos of the preparations can be found in the events section of McGonks' Facebook page here. It's a public page, so you can ignore the registration process if you don't want to join the site but still enjoy following our exploits to get fit enough to climb a mountain. Friend reckons we should take posh frocks and stilettos for the photo shoot at the summit, but I'm not too sure about that, as much fun as it may sound! :)We are now approaching the £200 mark with the donations count, so please help spread the word that we can accept gifts/donations directly through PayPal by sending to nykmedia@aol.com or else by using the dedicated donations page via www.mcgonks.com If you 'donate' via the page, PayPal charges for the transaction If you 'gift' directly, there is no fee, so the full amount can be transferred to PIRSAC lifeboat. As they say at the harbour, 'HELP KEEP THE BOAT AFLOAT'.But I can't overlook the frugal living, so onwards and upwards with that campaign. Febrary, in similar fashion to January, can be an expensive month. Starting the year with £3,000 to pay for everything was a huge decision, but it is one that I do think can be achieved. There's no rent or mortgage to be paid and the council tax is not included within my £3,000 budget becauseit's simply not negotiable - it needs to be paid. I've just renewed the household insurance and was pleasanty surprised when the quote arrived at approximately £165 for annual buildings and contents insurance for two of us. Had I still owned a car, I could also have taken advantage of the free AA Roadside Recovery option it offered! My fingers are crossed that the £38.38 cashback processes, but TCB is already showing that the transaction has been recorded. Over the weekend, I made three batches of muffins - plain/vanilla, sultana and chocolate. It was a bit of a pest, as I could make only half a dozen at a time, having just the one small muffin tray, a silicone one I got secondhand, that holds only 6 cakes. Despite how UNFRUGAL it may sound, I don't mind the oven being on for three loads of baking - it helps heat the otherwise freezing kitchen - but I do object to not being able to batch bake. Amazon got another visit, where I found a 12-muffin silicone tray for a mere £3.53 and the offer of free delivery. Surely it must be a mistake? I've ordered one and paid using gift vouchers that I've saved from my Topcashback transactions and will let you all know if the offer is genuine and if the muffin tray is full size. (While checking my TCB account, I discovered another £15.98 available to claim, so that should be on its way soon. Excellent!)Next on the agenda - laundry duty! I had completely run out of laundry liquid and had resorted to ordering a pack of detergent from Approved Food - Radion Washing Powder 800g for 99p - but I think it still works out more expensive than homemade. Now that the stove has been fitted, I can get back to boiling up a batch on the stove top without worrying about excessive electricity useage, so that is what I am currenty doing. I've just grated in the bar of soap and the place smells of lavender and teatree. There's a load of washing in the machine in the hope that the rain stays away and lets me get it out on the line, but the airer can now be set up in the same room as the stove, so things aren't quite as bad as they have been. In fact, they are looking positively positive. I just need to organise all my crafting materials and move them into the 'new' room so I have, at last, got a dedicated workspace. On the subject of crafting materials, which involves the McGonks project, I would like to extend special thanks to Debbie B. from Dagenham for sending me a parcel of assorted wools and 'glitter brads' which are going to be put to good use for an order of 'goth McGonks' that I need to make. I have managed to source offcuts of black fur from eBay and it arrived at the weekend, so I'm all set for my next McGonk mission.The chest freezer needs defrosted and inspected. A friend has emailed me a set of diagrams (sourced online) so I can check for drip trays and drains, as the problem seems to be water running from beneath the freezer, despite it still appearing to be fully frozen inside. Fingers crossed that it's something as simple as an overflowing drip tray! In all honesty, I would prefer the freezer be relocated to the outbuilding, but that depends entirely on whether or not my housesharing friend wants a freezer in what will become his studio workspace.There have been no inbound telephone calls since setting up the new phones and I didn't make any out-going calls over the weekend. I did, however, remember to charge the batteries for the required 24 hours before plugging them in and testing to see they worked OK. The intercom button worked but nobody picked up the second handset when I tried it. I wonder why? :)I'm now really hopng the weather improves soon as it seems about time to start focussing a little more attention on the garden. It is looking really neglected. The gate has been getting left open to allow the ducks into it so they have done a fair job of rooting about under the fruit bushes but the amount of rain and freezing winds has done nothing to tempt me any further than the greenhouse, so far. The worms in the wormery seem to be thriving in there and they were all looking foarly active this week, so they got a layer of peelings to start work on and produce me some worm juice for the seedlings that have come through over the winter.Right, this was supposed to be just a brief update, but has turned into a saga. Apologies for that. I hope everyone is well and that you are all getting into the mood for switching from winter sewing to spring sowing. I have all my seeds at the ready, do you?Frugaldom"},
{"title": "February's Frugal Fun and Fitness", "date": "Thursday 7 February 2013", "text": "First Week of February Almost GoneSun setting over Luce Bay and the Mull of GallowayI thought I would do something a little different for today's post and show you a bit more of the area in which I live. Apologies now for this post being image heavy, I hope it doesn't pose problems for anyone.  Often, people find it difficult to comprehend frugal living in a rural environment, so this should let you see how rural Frugaldom is. It is in no way remote, yet some see it as exactly that, especially those who live in towns or cities where everything is available right on their doorstep.﻿﻿This year we got some snow - an unusual occurance for here.This is where I live. It's not a village, nor is it really a hamlet, it's whats known as a clachan - a little row of about 20+ houses that came about when the estate owners needed staff and those staff needed accommodation. A few new houses have crept in along the way but on the whole, it's a fairly quiet neighbourhood, being set a mile off the main road and about 4 miles from the village. These photos were taken in full colour, but there was no colour to be seen, owing to the snow and clouds.﻿﻿﻿Walking to the top of the hill behind the house, this is the view in the snow. The little red arrow marks the approximate location of our nearest village store, about 4 miles from here.﻿﻿ We've had a really mixed bag of weather here since 2013 began. January brought high winds, high tides, torrential rain, hail, sleet, snow and even some sunshine. Having no car during all of this mixed weather doesn't encourage many trips to the village, either walking or by bike.  When walking, it's about 7.5 miles from house to shop and back but cycling is closer to 10, by the time I detour to miss the main stretch of 'A' road, which terrifies me when the lorries go hurtling by at up to 60mph.  Regardless of which route is chosen, arriving in the village at high tide pretty much guarantees you a soaking, whether it's raining or not. Last week, the sun was shining here when we left but it was blowing a gale and battering down with hail by the time we made it to the shop and, once again, I'd forgotten to ceck the tide times! This is the main road running into the village - timing is everything when cycling and on this occasion, I got my timing wrong. I was spitting salt for the next quarter mile. Choice in the shops is very limited and everything is much more expensive than in supermarkets. Keeping to a very frugal grocery budget is very difficult, so the loss of ROSSPA has been a huge blow to this frugal household. This is what I managed to fit into the bike pack last week and it cost me £8.85 Those small blocks of cheese at the front weigh only 180g each and the peppers were and absolute luxury!February, of course, is Frugaldom fitness month, when I make the most of the shortest month of the year in preparation for spring, hopefully shedding the extra pounds gained over winter and getting fit enough to tackle the garden.  I'm using a website called www.mapmywalk.com to record the various workouts and have set myself a challenge to complete a minimum of 100 completely free workouts before going for the frugal, fun, fitness weekend to Fort William, when we're climbing Ben Nevis. During January, I managed to fit in 16 hours of fitness training and clocked up 75 miles of outdoor walking and cycling. This past week, excluding today, I've managed 6 workouts covering a total of 32 miles already. My enthusiasm for this year's fitness challenge is being helped along by a friend who has decided to join me on the Ben Nevis trip. It's great having company for training, as this is the one thing that normally lets me down... hating doing anything alone! So, this is her first experience of the February challenge and we're making it as much fun as possible. It's frugal and it's free, but we still afford a few luxuries! Like tiny digestives (Approved Food multi buy) and some soft garlic cheese as part of our picnic lunch sat atop the nearby iron age fort during our weekend walk. (I need to make plenty of frugal gourmet soft garlic & herb cheese to deter 'Woo' from buying extravagant 'Roule' while in town!) Having my frugal entrepreneur project on the go is also helping to add an extra element of fun into the 'get fitter, not fatter' stakes, as including a McGonk in the photos is quite entertaining. I sewed a keychain onto the back of 'Beag' McGonk, who I take almost everywhere with me, and he now gets hooked onto the front of the bike when I'm out cycling. He gets hooked onto my back pack when I'm out walking and, for shorter trips, he can clip onto the zipper of my jacket. Here he is clipped to the front of the secondhand mountain bike that I treated myself to after giving up the car. The roads around here are great for walking and cycling in that they are fairly quiet, other than occasional farm traffic. Most are fairly narrow lanes and seldom used by 'normal' traffic and in places, it can be more like cycling off road than on.  This is the lane I have been using as part of a training circuit. It would be fabulous for running but, as stated previously, running just isn't my 'thing'. For starters, I make far too many stops to take photographs, so timing my laps is a bit of a joke. As you can see, there's plenty of snow lying on the Galloway Hills in the distance but not a sign of any here. We often walk this road but on this occasion, I was cycling.  These photos suitably reflect the area in which I live - there's nothing commercial about the place: no shops, no cinemas, no gyms, no buses... spending money within the immediate vicinity isn't always an option. But there's always online shopping, as we are lucky enough to have Internet and even broadband - to a certain extent. The GardenThings are beginning to grow!  The heathers in the tubs have done really well, some staying in bloom for most of the winter, but now there are many signs that spring should be on its way very soon. We have flowers! The miniature irises are all blooming and several of the other spring bulbs are beginning to put in an appearance. 'Beag' McGonk seems suitably impressed by the added splash of colour. Elsewhere, there are snowdrops springing up, even out in the wildest corners of the landscape.  The New Phones Arrived!The new handsets have arrived and will be ready to be put into use as soon as they are charged, so I should be able to make my first 'comfy' call tomorrow evening, when calls are free after 7pm. I'll then have the rest of the weekend to catch up with everyone, spreading the news of the new arrivals, But I mustn't forget to hang up and then redial if it looks like going over the 60 minutes. Running up anything extra on the phonebill is a no no, especially after going to the expense of paying the year's line rental in a lumo sum to help save extra pounds.  Finally, friend and I have one more week of walking preparation before our first big adventure up a hill. Next weekend, come rain, hail or shine, friend and I are filling our backpacks and taking a trip up Cairnsmore of Fleet. At 711 m (2,333 ft), it is the highest of the Solway hills and I'm told that on a clear day the views are spectacular. There's certainly plenty to see up there, but I'll save the information for next weekend, when I hope to have enough photographs to make up a dedicated blog post. Very excited about this as it will be a first visit for us and the McGonks."},
{"title": "What's In Your Pocket?", "date": "Monday 4 February 2013", "text": "Keeping up with Modern Technology\"We want people to celebrate life’s ‘little wins’. We’ve all experienced the momentary thrill of finding money in our pockets that we didn’t know was there... You can spend the money in any way you want, as long as it gives that feel-good feeling to you, or someone you know.\"﻿The invite arrived from those lovely people at MoneySupermarket as part of their 'What's In Your Pocket' blogger competition. On acceptance of their money challenge, I was given £20 cash to indulge myself! I think I've made the most of my little windfall!As an extreme frugaler attempting to live on a revolving budget of less than £4,000 a year, the thought of shelling out £20 on sheer luxuries is a very daunting prospect! I gave up the car in favour of a bike in December 2012 and then lost a chunk of my income at New Year. And lest we forget, there's a major renovation project ticking along, albeit very slowly, while Im also trying to organis my fundraising trip of a lifetime to climb Ben Nevis in May. Budgets are tight, finances have been allocated and contingency plans made. But this spending 'challenge' is different - it's completely free money - it's exciting!Getting away from it all was certainly my first thought, but that's not the easiest (or cheapest) thing to do when you live in a rural location with no car and no public tranport. It would cost the entire £20 just to get a taxi to the nearest Co-op and back, IF I could locate a taxi! Moving swiftly on... My microholding project! Creating, establishing and maintaining a debt-free, self-sustainable lifestyle that combines outdoors with indoors in an effort to provide both food and an income - that is the whole basis of Frugaldom. It means working between house and garden while maintaining communications with the outside world. We've no mobile signal here, there's no phoneline in the office/studio space outdoors and this is my current telephone!I bought this phone/fax/copy machine secondhand for £20 in 1998. It plugs straight into the phone socket and needs electrical connection for the copier or fax to work, but I no longer use those. Using the telephone depends entirely on being 'there', which is in the livingroom, standing by the window and almost in direct line with the television. If anyone's trying to watch said television at the time a call comes in then they can't, it's as simple as that. Any calls taken or made are from this one location. So, my frugal friends, you can imagine my sheer delight when I suddenly found myself with £20 to spend on absolutely anything and spotted these! Yes! I have, at long last, moved up in the technological world of modern telecommunications and have now ordered two magical little handsets so that anyone can take or make a call from anywhere around Frugaldom. Amazing as this may seem, I have been without a cordless phone since we moved here and it is one of the most annoying things EVER when you call a company and they ask you to follow on-screen directions at your computer! My computer isn't even in the same room as the telephone! (I will, of course, keep the old phone so we can make calls during power cuts.)Not only will these wireless handsets benefit the entire household, they will instantly resolve the problem of not hearing the telephone ringing when up the stairs, in the kitchen or out in the garden. I can simply take a handset with me! :) These will make life so much simpler during the gardening months when trying to juggle veg-growing with waiting in for calls or even just chatting to friends or family.I am so utterly delighted with my purchase that I'm like the cat that got the cream. Even although many of you may think it's a ludicrous thing to have done with the money, you have to remember that I live a frugal life of make do and mend with zero leeway in the budget for frivolous or luxurious spends. I have no sorce of income apart from wha I earn from home. There are no shops around me, no buses or taxis, no entertainment venues, cinemas, health clubs or fast food takeaways. We don't have a pub nearby and there are none of my friends within safe walk of here after dark. Finding my precious bargain was how it was meant to be - otherwise, why were these reduced to £19.99 on the very day that I found myself with a magical £20 to spend? The penny change has gone into my charity box, as I'm currently fundraising (see www.mcgonks for details of the Port to Fort Challenge) and saving all my spare change for the local lifeboat. Thank you, once again, MoneySupermarket for another EPIC, fun money adventure.NYK in Frugaldom.Edited In: \"We thought you'd like to know that we've dispatched your item(s). Your order is on the way, and can no longer be changed.\" YEAH! My new phones are on their way! I am going to feel like a highflying, eccentric, overly-indulgent, wealthy and extremely lucky lady when I am sunbathing on my patio sipping my glass of homemade champagne whilst nibbling on freshly picked strawberries or quail egg salad sandwiches, while chatting to all and sundry from around the globe - possibly even filing my nails in between times. Luxurious convenience is on its way! :)"},
{"title": "What's Better than Finding a Fiver in Your Pocket?", "date": "Friday 1 February 2013", "text": "FINDING £20 YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING!Welcome to fabby, frugal, fit February. Not only is it the Frugaldom month of weight control - getting it back under control after the festive feasting - it's also fix the finances month, making any corrections to overspends, bringing things up to date and making the most of not paying Council Tax if you opted for the 10 monthly installments. It's never usually about spending, that's for sure.But something extra special arrived this month! I 'found' £20. It's not like it was lying in the street or anything, it's more of a windfall, courtesy of MoneySupermarket.com and their 'What's In Your Pocket?' competition.So where does an extreme frugaler such as myself begin when presented with the opportunity of having a little 'fun with my mun' when the opportunity arises? GOOD QUESTION!It's a bit like asking what I'd do if I won a huge amount of money on the lottery! I'd renovate the house, have a 6 month vacation while the work was being carried out, go exploring, eat expensive food, sample fine wines and all sorts of delicacies, splash out on gifts and play at being the secret millionaire to help others realise their lifelong ambitions and dreams. I'd probably quit work and focus on helping others with their fundraising activities and generally have some fun but still keep it frugal... I just can't help it.Feet back on the ground, it's £20 and I don't want to blow it all in a oner, so I'll need to think about it for a bit...I've given up the car in favour of walking or cycling, but it's a 10-mile round trip to the nearest shop when avoiding the main road. I've just booked to go for a long weekend hosteling and hill walking in Fort William, doubling this up as a fundraiser for our local lifeboat. I'm in the process of putting together a photo library of McGonks that will be incorporating many places and activities.I've recently updated my list of 'things to do before I'm 50' after wiping off several that were no longer feasible from a financial or fitness point of view.Right, how can I get my lucky £20 to cover all of the above and still afford some frivolous 'just because' fun? Friends and fellow frugalers are already uttering suggestions on Facebook! Coal? Logs? A headtorch? A shopping basket for the old bike? Hmm... I actually quite like that last suggestion but have already adapted a picnic cool bag to fit the bike. :)Back soon with my thoughts on what to do with all this dosh!"},
{"title": "Winter Warmers", "date": "Tuesday 29 January 2013", "text": "Preparing for SpringI'll try to keep this brief, as it's supposed to be a quick update prior to the end of the month, but so many things have been happening recently!First of all, the stove has, at long last, been fitted! Yeah! The job was completed on Sunday and 'Wilbur' has been blazing gently to settle him in for the past day, being lit again first thing this morning. The difference is utterly amazing! As expected, the stove/logburner installation project was done on a budget. The new hearth takes the form of two stone slabs traded for locally with friends who are having the remains of an old fireplace in exchange. The fireproof backplate is an offcut of sheet steel sprayed black with stove paint. In all, I think the entire works, including having the old chimney opened up, repaired and fully lined, cost approximately £600.The plasterwork all needs reinstated, but I can live with it like that until spring. We've already moved the couch into the room and are slowly emptying the livingroom in preparation for having the fireplace in there rebuilt. But better still, the stove top kettle has been used for the past 2 days, meaning we haven't had to switch on the electric kettle! Brilliant! Everything is drying out nicely and it means there's a warm room in the house to return to after a cold, wet walk. I like that part the best! We're also well prepared for power cuts now.The budget is doing well, despite everything! All the major spends during the first month of the year take their toll - annual telephone line rental for one thing - and that certainly isn't helped when you lose your regular source of income, which I did at New Year. As of 1st February, I'll no longer have a source of regular, guaranteed earned income, it will be based on whatever, whenever, as I'll no longer be committing myself to contracts. But that's another story.February, as you may all know from previous years, is my major effort to shift the excess 'flab' gained over winter. Shortest month of the year, so minimising the food intake doesn't seem so bad when it's for just 28 days. It gets me back on par for the spring and, of course, this year's BIG fitness challenge, to climb Ben Nevis. I do quite a bit of walking, so that's nothing new, but I've never climbed a 'proper' mountain, unless you count the Merrick . My 'relearning to ride a bike' is sporadic, depending on how slippery the roads are, but winter probably wasn't the best time of year to lose the car. On that subject, the household has now been without a car for two full months and we've worked my way up to 20 miles of cycling, which is almost enough to get me to the Co-op and back. It's certainly enough to get me to the post office or village store, so that's all that counts for now.As for hill walking... different story! Frugaldom lies in a fairly flat area and the highest hill I've ever climbed in my life is the Merrick, which I did in August. This tiny lane, only 2 miles long, is the hilliest road we have about here. I'm told that if we (friend's coming with me) can walk back and forth along this five times consecutively, then we are walking fit for Ben Nevis - but it won't prepare us for the intensity of the prolonged ascent or descent of Britain's highest mountain. It's going to have to, because it's the best we've got! (I'll go play in the Galloway Hills whenever a lift is available.)  We need to be fit enough to climb Ben Nevis in May, when 9 of us are meeting in Fort William. (Still room for one more if anyone I know is interested?) As it rarely snows here, but can snow on the summit all year round there, I certainly made the most of what little we had! In the short space of time the snow lay here, we climbed two of the little hills nearby so I could test my super-duper, reduced in sale, Regatta boots. I still can't get my head around how they can be waterproof when they look like loose-weave fabric, but my feet remained dry at all times, even during a very squelchy, muddy walk to the loch. This bodes well for the Ben Nevis walk, as I'm assured the big hill will throw everything it's got at us, both on the way up and en route back down again. Fundraising is going slowly. I'm not deducting any expenses from the funds raised, the cost of the trip is being met by each individual as per any other holiday. I'm not sure where I'll find sponsors but I did make a few baby McGonks to sell in the charity auctions. The results were very disappointing, to say the least. Of those that did sell, I'd like to thank the buyers for helping me get off the starting blocks with my charity fundraising to help with our local Lifeboat Funds. I see a few more pounds have just dropped into the pot, so I'll go and count to see if we've made it to £40 yet. If anyone would like to donate via Paypal, please feel free to do so by gifting payments to nykmedia@aol.com with reference 'PIRSAC', which represents the Port William Inshore Rescue Service, Scottish charity number SC027347.

{"title": "A Haggis isn't just for Burns Night", "date": "Monday 21 January 2013", "text": "HAPPY HAGGIS McGONKIn celebration of Burns Night on 25th January, I prepared a few Haggis MGonks as part of my Frugaldom's 'frugal entrepreneur' project. I have highlighted the fnal lines of this rather famous poem by Robert Burns, where he clearly states that the way to a girl's heart is through a haggis and what better way to put a smile on a loved one's face than to present them with the cutest, most frugal, handmade Haggis they'll probably ever see? Haggis is a traditionally frugal dish, one that uses up plenty of what others may overlook and all bulked out with oats to form a tasty meal. There's nowt beats it, especially with a heap o' mashed neaps and tatties - seasonal produce that should have come from the garden. Sadly, this year, we have no turnips and don't even have a haggis for Burns night, as I've had no way of getting to a shop that sells them. Even an Aldi haggis would do - must put out the call now to see if anyone can beag me a couple before they all fly off the shelves! Address to a HaggisFair fa' your honest, sonsie face,       Great chieftain o the puddin'-race!

{"title": "The Financial Situation Seems to be Getting Worse", "date": "Wednesday 16 January 2013", "text": "Another One Bites the Dust! After hearing the devastating news of our favourite online grocery supplier ceasing trading, contingency plans have had to be made here in Frugaldom. The loss of ROSSPA struck us a mighty blow in the wake of giving up on owning a car, as the online fresh produce supplier was the ONLY only who would deliver to our door - no need for cars, buses, taxis... Alongside ROSSPA, it looks like we could be losing our only shoe store from the town - DE Shoes - and then there's the recent losses of Comet and now Jessops and HMV. Our high streets are being decimated and there's not a thing we can do about it. Recently, I learned that our village lifeboat is under threat - changes in legislation mean they must replace the lifeboat or else risk being sunk by red tape. Perhaps this is something we CAN hep save! Port William Lifeboat (PIRSAC) is an independant lifeboat operating in Luce Bay and Wigtown Bay. It is registered as a charity (Port William Inshore Rescue Service, SC027347) and the lifeboat is crewed by volunteer's 365 days a year, tasked to service by Liverpool Coastguard. It receives no funding other than what the group can raise locally, so our trip to Ben Nevis with the McGonks is being used to help raise some of the £65,000 that's needed to help replace the boat. Please join us on McGonks' Facebook Events Page to follow our progress. Thanks to the MSMSecretSanta challenge partnering Frugaldom with Frugal Queen, many of you on here will know that the subsequent 'love bomb' and secret Santa gift brought me a mountain of crafting materials for my 2013 McGonks project. Thanks to this, I have been able to make several McGonks and have now listed them in a charity auction to kickstart the fundraising for the lifeboat. You can access the charity auction at http://frugaldom.ebid.net/. (We're still waiting to hear the outcome of the Moneysupermarket.com Secret Santa Challenge.) What now? How will the loss of my lifeline to groceries affect the Frugaldom household budget? With no car and no supermarket within 20 miles, there are no other delivery options. ROSSPA had been a God-send for us ruralites, offering reasonable prices and overnight delivery. I'm guessing that it was the delivery that killed it - charge backs, refunds, lost or damaged items... they all add up and can kill a small business stone dead in no time if the cash flow hits a problem. So, how are we going to redress the balance of losing our only delivery service that brought fresh butcher meat and veggies to Frugaldom? First, I'll focus on further costcutting, while getting fit  enough to climb a mountain and trying to raise much-needed funds for our local lifeboat. Main item on the home front is the grocery challenge. With £912.50 to last a full year for two of us plus any guests or visiting family, things are going to be pretty impossible if I need to rely on a local corner store that's 7 miles round trip and where bread costs £1.80 per loaf! APPROVED FOOD The above is going to be the salvation of the Frugaldom grocery budget challenge and I have just received my latest order, thanks to al of you guys who read my witterings onlone. The 'refer a friend' links have been brilliant, paying up to £5 in store credit for each friend who registered and ordered. My credit, over the past year, has amounted to £98 and that buys an awful lot of groceries in a clearance outlet. We have the garden. OK, so we bought the house with almost a quarter of an acre of garden and then found out only half of it was suitable for growing anything, on accounts of the flood levels from the burn that runs through the bottom of it but, with luck, the little orchard we planted will survive the occasional saturation. The ducks don't seem to mind and the hens, so far, have been wise enough to stay up higher than the winter water levels, so we can still have eggs when our feathered friends are laying. Vegetable-wise, the top half of the garden will be devoted to things like carrots, onions, brassicas and peas, as these are the things we use most. Potatoes I can buy locally by the sack at around 40p/kilo and I have patio tubs for things like salad leaves, radishes and spring onions. The recycled plastic greenhouse will be used mainly for peppers and tomatoes, plus I have plenty of strawberry plants, herbs and soft fruit bushes.  For the past few years I have been trying to get some sort of growers and producers co-operative formed so we can trade fresh produce. I got as far as arranging landshare and the owner registered a few acres as a smallholding so we could rear a few pigs: I needed people to join the group but, although they were all happy to trade for fresh produce, no one was prepared to travel to cultivate said land. At the weekend, we dragged out the bikes and cycled to the above to see the owner and to estimate the distance from here to there. It's 4.5 miles, so not all that long by bike even when you pedal as slowly as me. It means we're within fairly easy reach of a rather well established orchard, land for cultivating and woodland that can produce fuel. All we need to do is work out numbers of hours we can dedicate to the project and how best to proceed. Houseshare, of course, will not agree to rearing 'meat' of any description, so there still lies the problem of sourcing that. All I can think of for now is the little Co-op store about 10 miles from here but I'll need to be fit to cycle there and back with a box of groceries. I do have a small cool bag, so I'll also need to devise a way of securing it to the back of the bike. Toiletries - I have stacks of these, probably enough to keep me going for another year. Toilet rolls, however, aren't the easiest things to juggle on a bike, so I've been thinking about where to store a bulk pack, if I can buy them online and have them delivered at a decent price. Suggestions for cheap loo rolls appreciated. Bread & milk - I have 3kg of milk powder and always try to have a few litres of UHT milk in stock. The local store currently charges £1.43 for 2 litres, which shouldn't be too difficult to carry home on the bike inside the cool bag. I also have a friend who visits most weekends who is happy to pick up milk from the shop on the way past. Bread... that will be homemade or nothing, as will cakes and biscuits. I have quite a plentiful supply of assorted flours in stock, thanks to Approved Food and the similarly trading Food Bargains. My latest 'Approved' order arrived this afternoon, so I'm now stocked up on really cheap ham stock cubes and more cappuccino. Having been expecting the delivery, I soaked a bowl of split peas overnight and now have a big batch of pea & ham soup in the slow cooker. (I need to source an affordabe supply of red lentils.) Sorry it's such a lengthy and wordy post. Once I start, I can forget to stop - I'm the same out walking or cycling, hence the reason my 10 mile bike ride at the weekend ended up being just over 20 miles. Oops! :)"},

For some of us, it's a trip of a lifetime, something that's been on the 'to do' list for some time but without the opportunity ever arising - until now. Everything has fallen into place and looks 'good to go', right down to the fact that I've just finished about 5 years of work for the same company and that work has now finished.Renovations are nowhere near complete, income has halved and I have more challenges on the go than ever before but, fortunately, this particular challenge means I can roll a few of the others together - mainly the 'Get Fitter, Not Fatter' and the current year's Frugaleur challenge, the McGonks. The holiday is a long weekend over the bank holiday at the end of May and it's being done on a very strict budget, but one that I feel is fair and affords a few extras along the way.I have set my personal budget at £200 to include EVERYTHING - clothing, travel, accommodation, food and fun! A friend from the village is my travel companion from here and we're meeting the others (9 of us booked so far) in Fort William, so this exciting adventure has been aptly named my Port to Fort Challenge. (For the benefit of those who don't know, we live in the Port William area of southwest Scotland.)'Port to Fort' began when the booking was made on 4th January, giving us 140 days to prepare and get fit enough to walk up Ben Nevis. I'm taking Beag McGonk, as you'll have seen if you follow that blog, and a special Ben Nevis edition McGonk is being designed this weekend to accompany us. In addition to this, we hope to raise a few pounds by way of donations and sponsorship to help support our local lifeboat. (Details on www.mcgonks.com)Fort Wiliam is just over 200 miles from Port William and, after much research and number crunching, it works out at a fraction of the price and less half the time if friend takes her car. We have budgeted for 12 gallons of fuel @ around £6.50 per gallon and rounded it up to £80 to be on the safe side. That's £40 each as opposed to over £100 each on coaches and trains!Most of us have booked into a hostel for 3 nights, so the accommodation should cost at most, £67.50 each, depending on whether we choose bunks or opt for private rooms. Taking the car means we can pack the weekend's supply of food and drink from home at no extra cost and allow ourselves some 'play money'. So far, that's a total of £107.50I wasn't planning on buying anything new to wear but then thoght better of it - safer with a spare pare of walking shoes or boots, so off I went to check for cashback, voucher codes and discounts. What a result!Going via TopCashBack, I visited the Regatta Outlet, where they have up to 70% off in their current sale. There's 4% cashback for using the TCB site PLUS if you use code RJMS20 before 13/01/13, you get another 20% off the reduced prices. BRILLIANT! I have just spent £45.55 including delivery for a new waterproof jacket, pair of trousers that zip into shorts if it happens to be warm and a spare pare of walking boots! I am seriously impressed! I already know their walking shoes are good as they carried my safely up the Merrick and have trodden many, many miles since then. Total cost now standing at £153.05 Next stop was checking out the list of basic essentials, as late May is still liable to be sub-zero on the summit with the possibility of thick snow. For anyone interested, this link will lead you to the .pdf  check list for the essentials. along with safety instructions  I have printed us each off a copy and will laminate these. I already have most of what's listed but popped onto Amazon and invested in a couple of extras, paying for them with vouchers already accrued from Topcashback. Total spend on Amazon was £5.55 as I opted for free delivery. Total cost now standing at £158.60The 'Port to Fort' budget of £200 for the 4 day break and think that is sufficiently frugal to pay for a once in a lifetime experience. I just hope we don't get rained, fogged or snowed off during bank holiday weekend. I also need to hope that I can get fit enough quickly enough to survive the trip. Port William area isn't known for its hills, In fact, this is about as steep as it gets - a couple of miles walk that has a category 5 climb up the slope of the lane. The Fort William hike, from our hostel, is 13.44 miles up and back down the highest mountain in Britan. I'll need to be fit enough to trot along my little Port William route at least five times consecutively in order to come anywhere close to conquering Ben Nevis.I have much work to do!Ben Nevis Photo credit: overgraeme / Foter / CC BY"},
{"title": "Eggs-citing Meals Once More!", "date": "Monday 7 January 2013", "text": "Winter Solstice Has Been and Gone, the Hens are Starting to Lay Again!I won't go as far as to say that spring is in the air, as it's done nothing but rain since Boxing Day, but the shortest day has been and gone and the bantams are beginning to lay us some eggs again. Nothing from the hens, ducks or quail just yet, but it's early days and there are only two of us here eating eggs, plus a neighbour who will buy any surplus as and when available.  Egg laying has begun before I even needed to use the frozen duck eggs, so it's a double whammy - enough freshly laid ones for mealtimes and a dozen or so duck eggs in the freezer for baking.  What I miss most about freshly laid eggs is the ability to whisk up a souffle omlette! So here's how it goes in the Frugaldom household. The bowl for all the bits and pieces gathered throughout the days goes to compost, wormery, garden, fire accordingly - tea from bags go in the garden bed where I have heathers and blueberries, as they like acidic soil. Souffle omlette for frugalers:First of all, you'll need two bowls - one large glass bowl for the egg whites and a smaller cup or bowl for the yolks, the omlette in my photos was made using 4 bantam eggs, so that's equivalent to 2 large eggs or 3 medium ones. Separate them carefully, as you don't want yolk in your whites at this stage. Next, you want whatever you have available for your omlette - in this case, it was a few slices of bacon and a bit of diced onion. I always remove the rind from bacon but that's personal choice. I also always finely dice the onion so it cooks quicker, hence costs less in electricity (or gas) if you're using a cooker. Bacon gets chopped so it fries quickly - everything about this recipe is quick, despite it sounding slow by way of the 'souffle' part. You can literally use anything in this omlette - chopped tomatoes, mushrooms, ham, chopped sausage, peppers, sliced hot dog... if it cooks quickly and needs using up, it's in the frying pan! While this is cooking, beat the egg whites until they can stand in peaks, as though making meringues. I don't add any salt when cooking with bacon, as there's usually enough salt in that. Salt is one of those things that's down to personal choice, so I won't dwell on the subject - I choose not to use it unless it's a plain omlette. Once your egg whites are ready, tip in the yolks and fold them in gently with a metal spoon. I don't know the relevance of the glass bowl or the metal spoon, it's just something my gran told me years and years ago - plastic bowls and wooden spoons are no good for whisking eggs. Perhaps it's something to do with the temperature and heat reflective qualities, I really don't know. Once you have mixed the yokes with the whites, you'll have a bowl of yellow foam. Don't over beat or over mix it, or this lot will begin to separate and you'll kill all the bubbles that are holding the 'foam' together.  Now tip the whole lot over the top of whatever you have sizzling in your frying pan and let it cook through. Give it a few minutes before you attempt to loosen it from the edges or turn it. I remember learning how to make suffle omlettes at school, where the teachers said fold it in half and allow it time to cook through the middle, but that's far too tempting to then serve as a single dish for one person! It's purey psychological, as far as I'm concerned. If you really want to make an impression and don't feel confident in turning the omlette, CHEAT! It's less frugal to cheat, as it means switching on the grill, but a quick blast under there ensures the top is cooked and you can take the time to melt some grated cheese over it, if you're feeling particularly extravagant. For some, presentation is very important. For others, like us at lunchtime, it's taste that counts, so I don't mind if the thing breaks in the middle when turning it.  This is how it looks on the underside and, in my opinion, it tastes delicious, is very filling, is nutritious and is a speedy hot snack that can be made with leftovers whenever you have sufficient eggs.  If you end up using duck eggs, use no more that two. If you are forced to use quail eggs, use a full dozen. As far as I am concerned, these quantities will adequately feed two hungry adults. This is a link to my list of '101 Things to do with Eggs' page, a great starting point for the times when you find yourself with a glut of eggs and a shortage of willing buyers. Recipes are not included but you can easily find them online by searching the appropriate terms. Now I need to concentrate on more healthy meals for a few months, as I have begun my 2013 'Get Fitter, Not Fatter' challenge, which I'd like to complete before the summer holidays. If anyone is interested in taking part, join us in the Frugaldom forum, where you can either share your progress or follow the endeavours of others. There are no faddy diets or expensive gym memberships, it's frugal fitness at its best - fun and free!"},
{"title": "Post-Festive Activities for Frugal Living", "date": "Friday 4 January 2013", "text": "Start the Way You Mean to Go On.The festivities are over, we're now firmly on our way to beginning the 'normal' year of juggling income and expenditure on a daily basis. For the frugal living among us, it's probably the best time of year to get organised, especially if you know you have post-festive credit card bills to pay off at the end of January. So where do we start?By now, you should have used up all the festive meal leftovers, turning them into an assortment of dishes both for using up and for restocking your freezer. Stock for soup can be frozen but I made all of mine into soup, then froze that. It gets the job done before 'normality' resumes.Next job to do is start the preparations for Christmas 2013!Yes, you read that correctly. Frugal living means always being prepared in whatever way you can, right from the first day of the year to the very last. I can't say I go as far as ironing the wrapping paper received from gifts, but I do save whatever I can, along with tissue paper, gift bags, string, ribbons and bows. Next job is sorting out the Christmas cards - ideal gift tags for next year and for salvaging the more fancy bits and pieces for homemaking future cards.From my pile of cards, I split the fronts from the backs, setting aside the backs as spare card for recycling into the feet and bases of future McGonks. This card will either get painted or covered in felt, fur or fabric. The fronts of the cards are kept for making gift tags, festive post cards and for cutting up to make embellishments for future card-making activities. (The top photos show little bits and pieces cut from the cards, along with some interesting 'jewels' that will make great additions to future projects.) I apologise to anyone reading this who spots their card sent to Frugaldom but it's being recycled and put to good, future use, rather than binned or burned. Only the little trimmings from the outer edges get added into firelighting materials.That has been my today's job, in between rejigging the budget to incorporate a hefty drop in income in 2013. (I received notice of termination of self-employed work-related contract yesterday.) In lieu of this (and giving up the car), I have slashed the household budget by 25% to £3,000 for the year.Believe it or not, the above means surprisingly few changes - the only real one is that there's no contingency fund for everything else, so 'everthing else' needs to finance itself in a self-sustainable manner - garden, poultry, dedicated workspace etc, etc, etc. In addition, there's no gifts budget! Everyone is being told it's homemade or nothing. It should make for a much more interesting and creative year ahead, because I'm not prepared to jeopardise plans for getting the essential home-repairs done. I will not allow the cost of living to eat into savings, I'll simply cut costs further! That's the plan, as of this evening. Let's hope there are no further surprises to help fire 2013 from the cannon! It's already been blasted by December's events with the car et al.January is always an expensive month in Frugaldom - there's the annual *telephone line rental to be paid, insurance, extra costs of electricity during winter, the coal bunker needs refilling and the usual start of year preparations include recovering from the extra costs of the recent festivities. Credit card bills need clearing to maintain debt freedom, contingency plans adapted to incorporate any new year resolutions and, as always, rainy day savings still need to be put aside. Heat preservation is essential, so here are a few of the things we frugalers do: Extra layers are worn, single glazing gets lined with bubble wrap to help preserve heat, likewise with door panels and attic windows, curtains get hung over drauhty doorways, fleece blinds (or curtain linings) fitted as soon as darkness descends and draught exluders are all in place.  The worst spot for heat loss in this house is the chimney! It sucks the heat from the livingroom in similar fashion to a giant, blood-sucking leech! When the fire isn't lit, the fireplace needs covered - anything does, even cardboard cut to size, as long as there's no fire lit and no hot embers! The updraught alone is usually enough to hold it in place.2013 - another year of waste not, want not! Have frugal fun!*Annual line rental with BT, who offer a discount for paying 12 months in advance. In 2013, the cost is £129, equivalent to £10.75 per month rather than their standard charge of £15.45 - a saving of £56.40 over the year. You'll find details of it here."},
{"title": "Shopping on a Frugal Budget: Less than £1,000 for the year.", "date": "Wednesday 2 January 2013", "text": "Making a Start on the 2013 Grocery ChallengeSince writing this post for the start of the 2013 grocery challenge, a few changes have occurred that meant altering the budget accordingly and incorporating some new shopping strategies. Rather than begin again, I thought I would simply update here as a reflection on the year's events.The bread is now baking, (Hovis bread mix is on offer at 50p per 1.5kg from *Approved Food and I stocked up before Christmas) so I thought I'd make a start on this year's frugal grocery budget. As all true frugalers may know, dried goods are our best friends; they are among the most economical foodstuffs to have in stock for snacks and meal making. Pasta and noodles are no exceptions - kept dry and sealed, they'll last for years. It's only Government legislation that forces labelling to include 'Best Before...' dates on such things. These, however, should NOT be confused with 'Use Before...' dates, as the latter are for health and safety reasons, indicating food that cannot be stored longterm. My budget challenge was been set at £950 for 2013. I've cut myself some slack this year to allow for extras needed to sustain energy levels when cycling extra miles, feeding guests, feeding workmen and generally allowing our frugal household a few luxuries now and again. We're down to a household of two but sometimes have 3 or more. This amount is for all groceries - it equates to £1.00 per person per day for all meals (2 @ 365 days = £730) plus £20 for extra mouths to feed plus £200 for all toiletries, cleaning products and extras.Buying groceries isn't a simple case of popping to the local shop or supermarket when you live in a rural location. For a start, there are no shops and there are no supermarkets. There are two small local village stores about 7 miles round trip from here, but the nearest supermarkets are of the smaller variety, the closest being a little Co-op about 10 miles from here. For anything bigger, it's a 40+ mile round trip and none of the stores deliver. Last year, we gave up the car and it's over a mile to the nearest road that has public transport running on it, so cycling, lift-sharing or home deliveries are our three options. Making the most of free vouchers, coupons and referral fees is what allows for the occasional slurge on extras.APPROVED FOODS*This has been my first port of call in 2013. It's one of a couple of places that frugalers can make the most of bulk discounts on dried foods that are close to or just past BBE dates. Better still, once you register with the site, you can invite all your friends to join, which earns you a few pounds in referral fees. My referral fees had reached £15 over the festive period - enough to place an order! After including the packaging and delivery charge, the total amount came to £20.66, so there wasn't much left to pay after deducting the free £15. Here's what I ordered:9kg of dried chop suey noodles £3.995kg of cappuccino mix £4.98Case (32 packs) of cat food £3.99Toilet rolls £1.49Washing powder 99pDelivery £5.25I don't normally buy washing powder, as I usually make my own laundry liquid - the instructions can be found HERE - but at 99p I thought I'd have a bit of luxury to see me through to making the 2013 batch. Maybe the stove will be fitted soon and I won't even need to use the electric cooker to make the laundry liquid! (It got fitted - fitting a log burner or multifuel stove)'Chop suey' literally means assorted pieces, and that's what we usually have left in the fridge of a waste not, want not household. The addition of some noodles to stir fried leftovers can turn almost anything into a lovely 'chow mein' type meal. We eat this quite often and although I do have a pasta maker and hens/ducks/quail that lay eggs, this box of chop suey noodles will be excellent for quick meals. It will also last me throughout the year and free up extra eggs for selling.We're coffee drinkers in this house, although I am trying to drink more tea so I can cut down on my sugar intake. But when a kilo of instant cappuccino mix shows up at 99p when it currently costs me £1.29 for 100g of instant coffee, I'd be mad to miss the deal. 5kg should see us throughout the year and it will be cappuccino all the way! (The powdered coffee whitener is currently 99p for 3kg, so I stocked up on that before Christmas.) Cat food - the frugal mouser doesn't often get foil-topped servings, she normally gets about a quarter of a can of Kitekat (12.5p) so she is in for a treat for the next month. One per day is sufficient for her, as she has ad lib dried food and water. (I'd normally buy a tray of Kitekat from Amazon using my free vouchers.).Opening balance - £1,000.00Today's spend, less referral fees - £5.66Balance remaining for 2013 - £994.34Happy shopping in 2013, everybody!Edited in: Since setting my grocery budget, several things have changed. First and foremost, we have had to incorporate many further price increases into other areas of the budget. In fact, most things that I include in the annual household budget have increased - telephone & internet charges, electricity, coal, transport costs, postage, insurance... the more I think about it, the more I can see that the only things NOT to have increased are the direct taxes we pay each year, such as Council Tax, TV licence fees and income tax, so it hasn't all been bad. As a self-employed person, I no longer earn enough to pay income tax! How embarrassing is that? It pretty much descends me into 'poverty' status, despite what I consider to be a fairly rich lifestyle afforded through sharing home and bills with A. N. Other, plus there's always the potential to re-incorporate a third person, should future need arise.So, how is the frugal grocery budget going? Well, we discovered a fabulous company called 'MuscleFood' that can deliver fresh produce overnight, meaning an affordable freezer order was no longer out of the question.  (I wrote about their meat bargains and cheap quality chicken here.) Additional help came in the form of some great friend referral commissions which, at £5 per pop, meant I was able to partially fill my freezer with some free chicken, beef and gammon. Thank you to those who have already joined me as a customer of this great site and might I recommend it to everyone else whose staple diet comprises lean chicken - 4 free chicken fillets still available via my friend referral link.Secondly, I ended up making homemade cat food for part of the year and will possibly continue to do so, as pet food is becoming a ridiculous price, considering it contains so little by way of actual meat!It's now November 2013 and my frugal grocery budget has been reduced to a balance of just £61.99 but I have to say, the cupboards, fridge and freezer are pretty well stocked and the Christmas dinner is bought and paid for from that. How well I make the balance last remains to be seen, but I will need to buy milk, lard, fruit and some fresh vegetables between now and the end of the year.Overall, it's been good so far and I am confident that I'll make it through to 2014's challenge within budget. Bulk buying toilet rolls and kitchen rolls while they were on offer has greatly reduced that part of the budget, meaning that more can be used for other things. Having the foresight to be prepared to act fast when bargains appear has been one of the big success stories of the frugal living challenge, as has stock-piling dried and tinned goods, batch cooking multiple meals and cooking everything from scratch. It all equates to less wastefulness and what I hope is a healthier diet. Now I just need to concentrate on shifting the excess weight and ridding myself of that, pound by pound, in similar fashion to killing off past debts.Looking forward to seeing a few more new names joining us for the 2014 challenges and I'd just like to remind everyone that it isn't too late to start preparing, as out November challenge of preparedness has just begun. Pop over and join us in the Novus Frugalus challenge in the forums soon.* Approved Foods 'recommend a friend' link"},

You may need to register (FREE) in order to read everything but it's the only way we can exercise any sort of control over scammers and spammers. Having had a look around while trying to summarise my past few years of frugal living, I located a link to June 2008, when I first added the Frugal Living message boards to the website. Hope nobody minds if I list it here for ease of access at any given time. It's from three houses ago and handy for looking back over various prices, budgets and events that occured during that time. Apologies for any dormant links if anyone happens to take a look back at our past endevours. After a bit more 'web tidying', I came across some of the  2005/2006 messageboards that are still listed online, so I have taken the liberty of adding a link to them here, too. These 'historical hystericals', as I like to call them, can help highlight the major changes that have occured over the years, as well as remind us of some seriously funny (verging on ridiculous) situations. Looking back on this particular challenge, however, I am almost tempted into resurrecting it.  Anyhow, I won't babble on, as it's Hogmanay. I hope you have all had a great year and that 2013 will bring everything you hope and dream of, without breaking the bank. Live long and prosper, as they say, but prosperity doesn't need to be about cash in the bank.

The fact is that it did! The festival of 'Christmas' was all but banned in Scotland until as late as the 1950s, so our celebrations were more about welcoming in the new year and, to this day, celebrate we most certainly do - all over Scotland and the Scottish Isles. The often ridiculed traditions of tartan, shortbread, whisky and bonny purple heather are all in evidence at this time of year and the practice of first-footing carries on regardless. There won't be fireworks for us - we live amidst farms, where livestock graze - but there will be the usual 'two fingers' (a unit of measurement used for pouring a half of whisky) to all who venture near. Hogmanay is actually a very frugal tradition, one that's based on common sense, community spirit  (no pun intended) and basic human decency. Neighbours visited neighbours bearing gifts of coal (warmth), shortbread or black bun (food) and whisky (drink) - the basic necessities for survival. Houses were thoroughly cleaned (health) before midnight on the 31st, all debts were paid off in full (wealth) and all ashes from the fires cleared out in readiness to begin afresh, happy that the longest night had gone (happiness). Oot wae the auld, in wae the new!If only people could see that it's about setting their homes in order and taking stock of what really matters - life itself. (Perhaps if Governments cleaned up and cleared debts each year then we wouldn't get into such a mess in the first place!) CHEERS! SLAINTE! DOON THE HATCH!IN time honoured tradition, most would suggest a rendition of 'Auld Lang Syne', but instead, here's a verse from an old Scottish poem that I'm sure Rabbie Burns wrote for us frugalers: Here's tae us                      Wha's like us                      Damn few,                      And they're a' deid                      Mair's the pity! Photo credit 1: foxypar4 / Foter / CC BYPhoto credit 2: djwtwo / Foter / CC BY-NC-SA"},
{"title": "Living on £4,000 for a Year", "date": "Sunday 30 December 2012", "text": "Time to Balance the Budget! Once again, I am going to attempt to stick with my frugal living challenge to live on (or should that be off?) £4,000 for the entire year.On Wednesday 28th November, the car failed its MOT and proved to be an uneconomical repair. On Monday 3rd December, the car got scrapped. We have decided to attempt to do without a car in 2013, but we won't be without wheels. We live in a rural location, we are not on a bus route and there are no local taxis. The main road is just over a mile from the house, so we can walk there and flag down the occasional bus - I think there are two per day. I've asked friends about lift-sharing and have registered with Royal Mail so I can  pre-pay and print postage labels, then all I need to do is pop the mail into the box or hand it to the postman.With what was saved on the final month's petrol, scrap money and refund of road tax from the car, it paid for two secondhand bikes. December 2012 was the first time I had cycled in 30 years! My 2013 challenge includes seeing how easy it is to manage without a car, despite living in a rural location, and keep the overall annual household budget below £4,000.00 while having frugal FUN! Having a prepayment electricity meter normally means going and topping up the key at the post office or relevant PayPoint. That's not easy on a miserble, windy, wet day when the post office is a 7 mile round trip, so I bought a Scottish Power 'pod', which cost me £13.99. I can now top up the meter online. After considered paying the £60 to have meter replaced, I decided against it. Why should we need to pay extra when the power companies will soon be installing Smart Meters into every house in the country? We'll ALL be charged for those, both gas (for those who have it) and electricity, once the Government plan is rolled out fully over the next few years.My new challenge budget has been finalised! It reflects  groceries, electricity, heating, telephone, Internet and TV for the household, but gift buying, clothes, mobile phone, postage, travel etc is my own only... housesharing means no joint-accounts, no joint family affairs and, if I want to blow the balance on a horse, the house or a foreign holiday, I'm free to do so. But I promise not to buy a horse!The Finalised Challenge Budget for 2013Groceries, Toiletries, Cleaning - £1,000Electricity - £800 Coal - £200 Logs - £200 Other - £12 (firelighters, matches etc) Mobile - £5 Telephone & Internet - £360 TV - £145.50 Footwear & Clothing - £50 Gifts - £100 Transport Costs - £75 Postage & Deliveries - £35 Home Insurance - £100 Household Pets - £60 Everything else - £857.50 TOTAL = £4,000.00 In a change of plan, I will not be deducting council tax or buildings insurance from my budget, so I've shared some of the extra money among the gifts, fuel and groceries categories, while leaving the remainder under the category of 'everything else'. Without a car to worry about, I'm feeling positively LOADED for 2013! Frugal living has never looked so good! I've managed to fit in a few miles of cycling to get used to the bike, a set of mud flaps, lights and a back rack have been fitted, so I can stay drier going through puddles, be seen and carry the basic essentials home when visiting the shop. Recent eBay purchases included fleecy leggings (99p per pair) and hi-vizibility vests (99p), so I think we're all set to roll into the new year. The freezer is full, the cupboards are full, there's enough coal to take us through to the next visit by the coal man and I've already started collecting kindling sticks to replenish our dwindling supply. January is always a fairly expensive month for me, so the budget takes more than its fair share of hitsduring the coming month. With luck, winter will be kind to us and there's plenty of work to be done about the place in between keeping up to date with my 'eBidding', making McGonks and writing about life in Frugaldom. Finally, a couple of the bantams have started to lay eggs again and I haven't even used the eggs from the freezer, yet. Pancakes, omlettes, quiche and homemade pasta can now be reintroduced to the frugal menu and who knows, we may even have some lemon curd back on the go soon. All comments and questions are welcome - frugal living is about making affordable living fun while steering clear of debts. If you're looking for a money challenge, feel free to join us online anytime in the Frugaldom Forums and I will do my best to keep the blog ticking over in more diary-like fashion for the benefits of my wonderful subscribers. You'll also find a version of this challenge on the Moneysavingexpert forums, where many people prefer to go, just search for the 2013 Frugal Living Challenge and you'll find us. :) Thank you for showing an interest in frugaldom and all it entails. I hope everyone can have some frugal fun in 2013."},
{"title": "Reminiscing in Frugaldom - Part II", "date": "Saturday 29 December 2012", "text": "Rolling back the frugal years... to the FT.com As suggested in Part I, the real 'troubles' at NYK towers didn't really begin until after Y2K had arrived. 1999 was similar to 2012, in as much as there were doomsday soothsayers whining and groaning about the end of the world being nigh. Apparently, they thought all computer technology would halt on the last stroke of midnight, as we went through Hogmanay 1999 and into the 21st Century. Satellites would crash from the sky, communications and utilities systems would crash and all sorts of apocalyptic nasties would occur.  My 11 year-old son had met with a nasty playground accident late in 1999 that led to him needing home care for several months. This had meant handing over the NYK reins to a third party, providing them with transport, laptop and access to all the relevant information.  Someone was recommended to me, I did what research I could, I checked out their credentials, I took them on freelance, then discovered the truth! The first I knew was when said individual met with some sort of accident in which the provided laptop was wrecked, losing all the files. This was followed shortly afterwards by a series of even more extraordinary events, ranging from the emergence of bogus advertising clients to written threats and the implementation of a funded campaign to put us out of business. (Campbell, if you are reading this, thank you! You opened my eyes to the truth once and for all - trust nobody!) But lest anyone gets confused, the newspaper company responsible for the put-us-out-of-business campaign was NOT the Financial Times, but I'm getting to that. We pulled the entire publishing project after distributing several thousand free copies over Christmas 1999, then switched everything online, kicking up a gear on the money challenges, Cyberdosh in particular. It really made my day when I read the following quote in the FT.com that same month:\"... readers interested in value-enhancing ideas should log on at ideas@cyberdosh.com...\"  this written by none other than the chairman of W. H. Smith, himself! I was inundated with enquiries and offers! Y2K saw the dawning of a new era. I travelled south with a friend and met with some business people who, in true Dragons' Den style, assured me that Cyberdosh was worthy of major investment - I was stunned by the names of the proposed investors! Figures were mentioned, directorships discussed and certain conditions laid down that would need to be met. For the uninitiated, these business angels may look good on TV when they invest small fortunes in new businesses, but we see only the edited highlights. We never hear of the legalities or formalities that can tear families apart, wreck marriages and create merry hell in so many ways that it's best I don't even begin to explain here. 2001 - Did I make the right decision? 2003 - Relocated - Divorce finalised 2007 - Debts almost cleared and most of my 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 challenges are still online for anyone to read. 2011 - Threw every penny I had into a joint-savings pot to buy a fixy-up that I named 'Thrift Cottage'. This became my 10th address in ten years, having moved around Britain from Lanarkshire to Aberdeenshire to Suffolk to Wigtownshire. You can do the arithmetic for yourself. At the top of the Merrick for my 48th birthday﻿So, here I am, a debt free divorcee, fast approaching 50, still housesharing, but now as part-owner of a 200-year-old, partially-renovated, terraced cottage on a quiet street that has nothing more than a post box and a 'no coins accepted' phone box. The household of three dropped to two earlier this year, I have a tiny (self-employed) income and a massive chip on my shoulder that's made up of many smaller chips. A few weeks ago, the car got scrapped and it isn't being replaced. 2013 brings a whole new set of challenges, none less than attempting to manage without a car when there's no bus service and the nearest shop is over 3 miles from here. To replace the car, we have secondhand bikes. Work is slow, income is falling, prices of most things are rising, rural living doesn't lend itself to finding bargains, home repairs need doing, the house needs heating and we still need to live.  I will try my best to document the progress as honestly as possible throughout the coming year and if anyone wants to share the challenge of frugal living and/or working, please join me in the daily forums at frugaldom.myfreeforum.org As you'll have guessed, come hell or high water, I fought to keep NYK Media - and won! But in so doing, lost home, husband and the small fortune I'd have made if only I'd been able to meet those blasted terms and conditions. 29th December 2012 - I'm still asking myself the same question! Did I make the right decision? Who knows! Only time will tell. For the coming year, I have set my household challenge budget, once again, at £4,000 for the full year - breakdown of costs listed in the forums - but this time, I'm including council tax. This accounts for almost 25% of the entire budget. Energy costs account for even more and groceries for almost as much, so it's an extremely tight budget. We all need a challenge in life and proving that money isn't the be all and end all of everything is mine. I hate the stuff, but we can't live without it! Coupled with the frugal living challenge, I have my frugal working challenge, knowing as the Frugaleur Challenge. This entails earning extra income from home by way of a brand new business idea. For 2013, my new business revolves around McGonks - handmade Scottish gonks. But their tale will be told elsewhere. 2013 is my WTF year - WORSE THAN FRUGAL!Computer Science Geek / Foter / CC BY-NC-NDHaving been 'working' online since the early 90's, it's time to backtrack and make allowances for those who haven't. I do tend to forget how many years have passed and that we've moved on another generation.I've seen so many names come and go that I think that's what sometimes disillusions me about life online, the Internet and all that stuff.Running frugal or money-related challenges means doing it continually - it's like it can never end for me. Those who take part usually move on to the next chapter of their lives as soon as they're on their way to resolving whatever problems brought them here in the first place.New sites begin, new forums open, new challenges repeat old, new blogs... for those of us who came here so long ago without the cash or wherewithal to make a career of it, debt-free obscurity is about as much as we can ever hope to achieve. As long as it's within our own means and we can live with the consequences of our own actions, possibly that's all that matters.1994 So, a look back over the years, courtesy of the Internet Archive, which has been around for a long time, just not quite as long as I'd have liked. It's been there since the mid 90s, but I didn't pay it much attention back then - I was too busy getting used to using a mouse and enjoying the hype of the soon-to-be-released Windows 95! Back then, things cost an absolute arm and a leg. Our first 'proper' computer and printer were bought on credit at a cost of well over £1,000 - it had 16mb of whatever and the modem was a 9,600bps! Prior to that, it was an ancient Amstrad that took cassette tapes and an age to load a single game! Technology has moved so far forward since that point that it's scary!﻿﻿The Compuserve guys back in 1996Connecting to the Internet was a bit hit or miss in the early days. By 1996, we had Compuserve with a standard phone line, billing was by the minute. It was the epitome of luxury that few could afford, so my first thought was to help make it affordable! Initially, this meant not going online very often. The introduction of '0845' local rate for America Online was an absolute God send back then and, by 1998, they had introduced multiple accounts and a fixed monthly fee! The cost of using the Internet was then controlled by your telephone company billing at local rates per minute.I'd done a basic City & Guilds course in IT, learning word processing, spreadsheets and databases. Being 'computer literate' seemed like the right thing to do. Indeed, it seemed like the only way to go, especially for those of us who were working from home.In 1996, Motley Fool arrived on the scene. It was one of the first money-related sites I remember being a part of, even attempting to set my frst online money challenge. (At that point, it was mainly US based, but it reached British shores by 1999.) The site developed into one more apt for stocks and shares investors - which is probably how I ended up doing that for one of the later challenges. But the Internet was still a luxury few 'normal' folks could afford. I couldn't, so I needed a plan to make it affordable.In 1998, I opened an Internet cafe - Charlotte's WWWeb - complete with shop front, art and crafts group, writers' group and office facilities for all the frugalers to pool their resources and share the costs of promoting their goods and services, spreading the costs of accessing the world wide web. Learning how to develop a basic website was a real eye-opener and bears no resemblance to how things get done nowadays, that's for sure.That same year, eBay took to the virtual stage in USA and our own eBid came into being here in the UK. The Internet service providers saw fit to offer fixed fee accounts and the wonderful world of online selling had arrived! It was around that time that the Government saw fit to provide Internet access through the libraries - our local library was practically opposite, so it virtually ended the Internet cafe idea! 1999 - We needed to advertise our multifunctional frugal business centre, we needed a way to help promote the crafters and writers, we needed to cut overheads and survive! We began publishing 'Now You Know'.Back then we used message boards, chat rooms and e-zines plus the basic, essential websites. We published the newspaper both online and in print! Web logs (now known as blogs) hadn't yet fully fledged their technological nest, but word was spreading. With no funding of any description, there was no way of promoting anything, so hooking up with Lanarkshire Television, a private enterprise nearby, seemed like a good idea - mutual promotion whilst taking on the mass media establishment. We set up Scottish Web TV (.co.uk) - nobody was interested, so we shut it down again. (In 2007, plans were set in motion for a relaunch, but it never happened.)By 2000 we had three online newspapers running - 'Now You Know', 'Paranoid Times' and the 'Lanarkshire News'. That's when we launched the Scottish Web Directory. I placed all the money challenges under the heading 'Cyberdosh' (cyber/online, dosh/cash) and began trying to fund it, going further afield and seeking suitable premises.28th May 2000 - Copy of a rather apt archived page of notes showing that clootie dumping has featured regularly in my writings! I'd never realised that before now! Our forum, back then, was exciting! The discussions were fed directly to the local TV station, live on air - anyone remember the sliced sausage discussion?(In 2009/10, an online newspaper began to emerge. The owners have the audacity to advertise themselves as \"Scotland’s first truly online newspaper.\" I'm sure you can understand my contempt at this blatant lie.)2001 Disaster everywhere! I was finally presented with a massive opportunity to develop my project commercially, but there were conditions... sadly, those conditions simply could not be met. It was the beginning of the end, as far as marriage, home and business* were concerned. Sometime later, around 2002, Martin Lewis set up his 'Moneysavingexpert' site and the associated forums. My version of moneysaving was not made welcome there at all during the early days, so I left - I was struck off his site, if I remember correctly! I retreated, only to return in 2007 and relaunch the challenge to run it parallel with one I had running on eBid! The Martin Lewis ideal appeared to be to screw every company around to get the best bang for your buck - as long as you weren't having to do without, that's all that mattered. Hmm...For those of us who simply don't want to screw the financial system, or who have no justifiable reason to do so, money-saving is about getting back to basics and living within our own means. I'm never going to sell my websites in a deal reported to be worth up to £87 million, I'm only here to promote frugal living and working! As part of the economy, we are deemed pretty much worthless, from how I see it. Now I know that Mr Lewis was said to have promised £10 million of it to charity and £1 million in support of Citizens Advice, and I applaud that - if it ever came to fruition - but so what? Martin Lewis has probably never tried to live on £4,000 for a year! (I'm assuming everyone knows that Moneysupermarket.com bought out Moneysavingexpert.com)Frugaldom is about NOT spending money, it's about getting back to basics, accepting the fact that consumerism can wreck lives and that it just isn't for everyone; it is alright to turn your back on society's pressures to comply and spend, spend, spend, it is alright to be thrifty or frugal!I have existed on whatever income there has been, I have struggled to overcome debts accrued, I have seen close friends suffer to the extent they literally went over the edge and into the abyss and I have witnessed those I have helped in the past go right back down the spending path of destruction, no lesson learned. I will keep on frugaling, I will keep on cutting costs wherever and however I can and I will fight to remain debt free. But this frugal living and working lark isn't easy, so we need to make it FUN!That's roughly my story to the point at which things went completely off the rails. That's also the point from which I have been trying to recover, fighting my way back to 'normality', shunning consumerism and trying to live a better life - a life without debt. I do use credit cards, paid in full every month, so I do technically have debt from one month to the next, but how else can we safeguard ourselves as online shoppers when a Debit card offers no such protection? I do hate that fact, but I also appreciate the fee-free, 1% cashback accruing from my use of the credit card.Nobody really gives a stuff about anyone other than themselves until they face a personal crisis. People come, people go, major events, catastrophes and tragedies occur, money comes and money goes, debts come and go, life carries on regardless. It's acceptance that matters most:Can we live happily on our chosen route through life? Can we live within our own means? Can we shake off the self-inflicted shackles of our past?Can we see a better future?Are we prepared for circumstances that are completely beyond our control?I'll apologise now for this rather gloomy overview that has barely come close to the present, but my journey has been a long one. It is this fact that I want to emphasise to all the newcomers who are still at the start of their frugal journeys. Don't let debt bog you down, don't fall for the hype - follow what you know is the right path to financial freedom and prove that it's possible to live a normal life without succumbing to unneccessary spending. IN the long run, the less you spend, the more you can afford - so what will you do once the debts are all gone and your time and money are your own to do with as you please?Any given day sees the realisation by someone, somewhere that they must take control of their own situation and make important changes. It's accepting that these changes need to be made that shows we are on the right track. No matter how difficult certain situations might get, it's our acceptance that we need to face them and resolve our own problems that matters most. Yes, there is help out there if we care to look for it, but confessing to needing it and then accepting it, let alone seeking it out, is something that we can't all deal with; for many, it can lead to feelings of guilt, shame and failure.Stripping things to the bone, the frugal lifestyle makes us all survivors! To hell with what others might think! We may never get what we want but perhaps we only think that we want it in the first place!My first priority is in ensuring that I never again owe anyone any money, (business or domestic) which means spending as little as possible. If this seems mean-spirited or self-centred to you then go and read another blog, because this one isn't for you.Part II will follow shortly, in preparation for a brand new start to 2013. I hope I haven't bored you all to tears and I also hope you'll see through the next post, then join us in 2013 for a no holds barred, nitty-gritty reality check on spending, while making the very most of life itself.Frugaldom."},
{"title": "The Frugal Festivities", "date": "Thursday 27 December 2012", "text": "﻿FRUGAL CHRISTMASIt's been a quiet couple of days here and most unlike Christmas, owing to the sunshine after all the rain we've had recently!This has been the first ever Christmas that I haven't spent with family, so it was rather strange. Not having a car means no longer being able to just jump into it and drive to visit anyone and none of my family lives within walking or cycling distance. So, for a number of reasons, I haven't, yet, seen any of the members of my immediate family.Christmas Eve brought Santa, unseen, at some point to leave a heap of goodies! I'm now the proud owner of some 'bling' (mud guards, a back rack, panniers, LED lights, metal cleaner and a bicycle pump) to jazz up the £40 mountain bike I'd bought. This is also classed as a frugal investment, as it means I'll can carry all my workstuff safely on the bike down to the village and have space to bring back essentials, like milk. Still no basket for the front, though, so a fast, frugal solution has now been found.Christmas Day dawned bright and sunny! How odd, but how convenient!My cycling companion is the long-suffering, second occupant of 'Chez Frugaldom', my house-sharing partner who was talked into foregoing a shared car in favour of having a bike. A secondhand one was duly arranged for delivery a few weeks ago - before he could change his mind! He wasn't going away for the holidays, so the sunny Christmas Day saw us out cycling as soon as all the festive phone calls had been made. Indeed, by the time we returned home, it was sunset, so dinner wasn't served until after 6pm! The frugal festive feast comprised homemade soup, followed by roast chicken dinner served with all the usual Christmas trimmings, barring the brussels sprouts - I didn't grow any this year - and bread sauce, which I hate. A friend makes braised red cabbage, which we share, so we had that along with the stuffing, pigs in blankets, cranberry sauce, honey roast potatoes and carrots (no parsnips here this year) followed by homemade clootie dumpling. We were soon stuffed! Mind you, between then and bedtime, I still managed to squeeze in some biscuits and cheese, then crisps and dips!I think I may have gained a stone in weight just over the past couple of days!As I said previously, I still have no basket for the front of my bike but what I did get for Christmas, was a posh new handbag from my mum. I'm sure she felt sorry for me when she saw I was still using the same one that I'd rescued from the charity shop a couple of years ago, but I like it, it's real leather and has sufficient space for everything I need, including my camera. Guess what I did with the old one after receiving the lovely new one? That's right, I strapped it onto the front of my bike! Now I can safely carry my camera, emergency supplies, polythene cloak, mini carton of juice and even a banana for snacking on, right there in my hand/bike bag. I'll fashion a better connection for it soon, but it serves the purpose for now.Christmas night was a recycling night, winding all the paper and cardboard packaging into kindling sticks for the fire whilst sitting in front of said fire, watching TV. I salavaged any bubble wrap or polythene bags for using elsewhere and plan on using the basket (savoury hamper made up by daughter) to store sewing bits and bobs once it's emptied.Boxing Day dawned fresh and bright, so we were, once again, able to get out and enjoy the surrounding countryside, this time with a stop off for a coffee and catch up with 'neighbours', if you can call them neighbours when they're over 6 miles from here. It was quite a bitter breeze or, in Burns spaik, 'bleak December's winds' were 'baith snell an' keen!' Looking across towards the Galloway Hills, we could see traces of snow lying, surrounded by fast falling clouds that were heading our direction!The homeward trip was a little slower, owing to my lack of fitness resulting in total lack of speed when cycling up even the tiniest slops, so we arrived home about ten minutes before the rain, which I feel was most fortunate! My daughter and son think I'm a little crazy for reverting to a bike but getting fit for summer should be fun, as my eldest grand daughter is more my 'mini-me' than her mum's - she loves ponies, got a bike for Christmas and, at the age of 8, already has her very own little sewing machine, crafting boxes and a love of recycling! (Very proud granny!)Boxing Day dinner was a near repeat of Christmas dinner to use up all the leftovers and tonight, it's chicken (again) to use up the last of that! I'm rather glad that I've invested in a little piece of beef for New Year!I hope everyone has had a lovely, festive, frugal few days and that the coming weekend will see you prepared to welcome in a brand new year. Many of the 2013 challenges have been posted to site already and, as you know, my personal Frugaleur Challenge for 2013 is to create a little cottage-industry style business from handcrafting and selling McGonks. I now have a whole unit stuffed full of fabric offcuts, wool, stuffing materials, threads, buttons, needles, crochet hooks and countless other bits and pieces that will be recycled into frugal Scottish gonks and am now applying to have my economical arty-crafty project considered for inclusion in 'The Big Burns Supper' next month, as part of their art/craft vending machine project. It's all very exciting, but I'll keep you all posted on progress.Today - I've been catching up with work and washing, the dehumidifier from H's studio has been wheeled indoors to help dry wet laundry and I'm now having all the bits and pieces fitted to my bike, ready to tackle a fully-laden post office run. Fortunately, if it's raining, Royal Mail has a superb website that allows me to pay for and print all the labelling needed for sending out work stuff and we have a post box in the lane, so bad weather needn't hamper proceedings. If it doesn't fit in the box (McGonks don't fit through the slot), I hand mail straight to the postman when he comes to empty it. It's great!Off to check the stock now, as the remainder of the Christmas chicken is being turned into the next batch of soup.Keep on frugaling! It's frugal fun for everyone and it's the fun part that makes it all worthwhile.Until next time,Frugaldom"},

{"title": "Frugaldom's Christmas Clootie Dumpling Recipe.", "date": "Monday 24 December 2012", "text": "Great Granny Kerr's Traditional Scottish Clootie DumplingOur 'secret' frugal recipe, passed down several generations of the familyGet a large stockpot of water on to boil before you start, so the water is ready for the dumpling. Place a plate on the bottom of the pan, so the dumpling can bounce off that, rather than the bottom of the pan.INGREDIENTS12oz plain flour4oz shredded suet3 tablespoons of sugar3 large handfuls of raisins (or sultanas or dried fruit)1 teaspoon cinnamon1 teaspoon all spice or mixed spice1 teaspoon gingerMix all of the above dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then add:1 large tablespoon of treacle1 large dessertspoon of syrupEnough milk to bind the mix together into a soft consistency without it going mushy.Lay out a damp cloot / cloth and sprinkle plain flour liberally across the middle part, where the mix will be poured. (I use a round cloot/cloth cut from an old cotton tablecover, but a piece of muslin or even a cotton tea towel would do.)Pour all of the mix into the centre of the cloth.Gather up the edges and tie them all with string or a piece of cloth, leaving enough room for the mix to expand as it cooks.At this point, there's also an old tradition of having everyone pat the dumpling before it gets immersed in the boiling water. I suppose we also need to remind folks to wash their hands, first, if this tradition is to be followed.Gently lower the post-patteddumpling into your pan of boiling water and cover it with the lid.This now needs to be kept on the boil for about three to three and a half hours, always ensuring that the water level doesn't drop too much.  It's also wise to check that you have left enough room for the mix to expand in the cloth. We don't want any episodes of dumpling bursting oot its cloot!Traditionally, coins or lucky charms would be cooked in the dumpling, as gifts for whoever found them in their serving. This practice has slowly fallen by the wayside for health and safety, food hygiene and dentistry reasons, but some stalwarts still follow tradition! (I'd advise sterilising the coins or charms in boiling water and then wrapping them in greaseproof paper before adding them into the mix to be boiled in the pudding. HSE can be so strict, nowadays! Ho, ho, ho hum!) Best to ask your host or hostess if they're a true traditionalist before biting into a big mouthful of clootie dumpling, especially if they happen to be a wacky, Scot. Oh, and if it does happen to be a Scottish host, make sure they know you're talking about the clootie dumpling and not their kilt, before asking how traditional they are, otherwise it could make for a very embarrassing scenario at the dinner table, especially after a few wee halfs! Removing the dumpling from the cloth can be a bit hazardous, so use strong tongs to lift it from the boiling water and take great care not to drop it or drip boiling water on yourself. I find it easiest to place the whole thing into the mixing bowl until the cloth is untied - a tricky process that's easier done if you have long nails, rather than burn your fingers. The prongs of a fork work quite well, too. Turn the dumpling out onto a large plate - at this stage it will look very pale and pasty or, as we say here, 'peely wally'. Sprinkle the dumpling with sugar and place into a hot oven for approximately 15 minutes, keep checking it doesn't burn. Traditionally, the dumpling would be sat on the hearth by the open fire. During its time in the oven, your dumpling should develop a lovely, brown, leathery-looking skin. At this point, it is ready for eating hot, served with cream, custard or milk. You can decorate it with a small sprig of holly and a dusting of icing sugar, if you really want it to look 'posh'.If it's not needed at this time, allow your dumpling to cool, wrap it in tinfoil and keep it until it is needed. Dumpling freezes well, whole or sliced.Once thawed, dumpling can be reheated in the microwave, oven, grill or steamer.If reheating dumpling in the oven, wrap it in tinfoil to prevent it from drying out, you can uncover it for the final few minutes.If grilling, it's probably best to slice the dumpling first.If reheating in the microwave, plate up the servings and cover them with an upturned bowl or microwave safe cling film. Dumpling can be reheated in a steamer or by steaming over a pan of boiling waterDumpling is very versatile.  It's a fruit pudding that can be eaten hot with a topping of your choice, or it is a fruit cake that can be sliced and served cold, in similar fashion to fruit loaf. But better still, it can be sliced and pan fried as part of a traditional breakfast fry-up.Have you had your dumpling this year?MERRY CHRISTMAS!"},
{"title": "Frugal Fun in the Sun, After the Rain", "date": "Sunday 23 December 2012", "text": "What a Difference a Day Makes!After the awful weather we've had since solstice, we were again subjected to high winds last night followed by a lovely, sunny day today! It seemed a shame to waste it, so as soon as the washing was done and hung out on the line, we set off to investigate what havoc the rains had played. I did try to walk along the road late yesterday afternoon, but only got a few hundred meters before it turned into a river, so I couldn't walk any further without going back for my big wellies. This morning dawned sunny and bright. According to news reports, several of the local roads were closed because of flooding and a coule more had be shut to allow for removing falling trees. (Clocked some firewood potential!) Today, I followed the same route I had taken yesterday, to see how things had progressed overnight, but only made it around the first bend before discovering that there was no way through without risking falling down the embankment!  Our babbling little brook was still spewing water in all directions and, rather than the tiny stream, it was still a raging torrent, in places, so we certainly weren't going to get far in this direction, so we about turned and headed back up the hill and out the other way. The lie of the land meant that any flooding further up would be either shallow or flowing down the hill. As it turned out, most of the water, barring one big puddle, had run off and was gushing into the ditches along the edge of the trees. Once we reached the crossroads, the decision was made to head uphill, meaning any surface water was running, rather than standing hiding potholes. It was a lovely day, so a trip to the nearby standing stones seemed like a good idea. Getting up to the top of the hill would let me see all around and get an idea of just how much water was lying about the place. One thing I forgot to consider was that once reaching the field that leads to the stones, it would be flooded! No chance of climbing up to the top. But if anyone is interested in this beautiful spot at the Chilcarroch standing stones, I have an album of photos on Facebook here.Never mind, this is on a circular route, so a trip around the next village would make for an enjoyable couple of hours and we could stop at the motte hill en route. The main reason I wanted to go to the standing stones was to take more photos to preserve the views for future generations, to show the panoramic scenery from there before it possibly changes forever!  Nearby, posted by the side of the road, is the reason I am suggesting why the aforementioned horizon may change. A kindly, absentee landlord has taken it upon himself to propose a lovely windfarm for the area, comprising 18 turbines at an overall height of 134m - that's about five times the height of the town's historic county buildings.  As you'll can guess, this has caused a certain amount of unrest within the community, pitting neighbour against neighbour and, in some cases, tensions are rising. Being of the frugal and as green as possible ilk, I should probably be unquestioningly 'all for' such developments, but I'm still sitting on the fence, trying to sift through conflicting reports of how feasible these wind farms actually are. (Personally, I reckon the only way to find out is to temporarily shut down all non-green energy-production sources for 24 hours and see how well wind power copes with demand in an emergency situation. The realist in me realises this would probably result in the outbreak of major civil unrest!) It's difficult to comprehend how high 134m actually is against a green, treelined horizon so, me being me, I HAD to investigate this for myself after hearing of this development application a few months back.  I set off and went exploring a real windfarm purely to give some scale to the 'problem', if that's how one perceives it. Trouble is, I could find only 125m turbines, so you'll need to imagine another 30' or so added to the top of this one I'm standing under in the photo. To make it easier to spot me, I have enlarged the relevant portion of the photo and tagged it on bottom right. The red arrow to left of this is showing you where the black spot above my head is in both pictures. THESE THINGS ARE COLOSSAL! We live in a low level, military tactical flying zone, where aircraft can fly to levels of as low as 50m from ground level...  But I digress - back to the day in hand and the circular route of frugal fitness and fun, past the standing stones, heading for Druchtag Motte and nearby Mochrum village, location of our local parish church.  Once again, I was foiled. I managed to jump over the flooded verges, negotiate the marshy approach and get through the gate to the hill fort, but scaling it was not going to be an option, it was simply far too wet and slippery. However, being a huge fan of such places, I do have a collection of photographs from previous, dry-weather visits, as we love going picnicing to the top of this hill. It's fun, it's frugal, it's free and it's very photogenic, like many of the sights we are blessed with around these parts. I really do love the area, even in the worst of weathers - it beats living in a town (for me) anyday! Photo album here, for those interested. Onwards through the village and no signs of the roads, fields of verges being any drier, but it's amazing how much fun you can have slooshing through fast-flowing puddles and along lanes that look like river beds. Trouble is, you tend to get very wet. Probably just as well the sun wash shining and the wind was blowing at a rate of several knots. We were heading down hill now, so there was a great deal of water lying in the surrounding fields, run off from the nearby lanes, hills and bursting streams. I should apologise for this lengthy pictorial post, I do tend to get carried away a little when out and about with a camera. You'll can tell that by the 1,700+ photos I have already loaded onto my Facebook page over the past year or so. But fear not, we're almost back at Frugaldom and not a penny spent.  You'll have realised by now that there are very few spending options about this corner of southwest Scotland, so it's rather easy to be frugal in that sense. The downside is having to pay a premium for ordinary stuff like food and fuel, while making do without sewers, drains, mobile phone signals, shops, modern conveniences, public transport and, if you are off the main 'street', mains water - it's from private wells. Frugal rural living in no way resembles frugal urban living, that's for sure. :) Here is something that I found rather entertaining, although it's certainly not funny for the farmer. On the right, you can just see the top edge of a five-bar gate. These are normally about 4' high and are hung several inches above ground level, so this 'puddle' is fairly deep! Fortunately, it had receded off the road enough for us to proceed on our way.  I'd to stop awhile and survey all around it and try to remember what is normally there. It's weird! No matter how often you pass something and 'see' it without looking, when it becomes unexpectedly obscured, your memory fails to tell you what is normally there. Or is that just me getting old? On the left, in this next photograph, that's all that's left showing of the huge scarecrow who normally stands along from the gate. This isn't far from home so, on that note, I'll end my ramblings, content in the knowledge that the flood waters are receding, the sun shone, I got my free dose of vitamin D, succeeded in completing 10.46 miles of trundling round wet roads and then ruined all that lovely exercise by coming home to have several mugs of (instant)coffee, cake brought by friend, and almost a full pack of ROSSPA discounted dates! OOPS! I did remember to bring in the washing: despite the sun and the wind, none of it had dried, so it's now on the airer! I need to sort out a panload of chicken for curry and hope we can eat it all within the next 24 hours, as there's no room in the freezer for anything else until after Christmas dinner. Friend brought some cartons of lovely braised red cabbage - an annual tradition here, as she's ace at making it - that have been crammed into the last available space! In exchange, she left with a bottle of  homemade mixed berry 'pink champagne'. Fun and frugal festive times! Hope everyone has had a good weekend.Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Surveying the Lie of the Frugal Land", "date": "Saturday 22 December 2012", "text": "Fools Rush in where Angels Fear to TreadMicroholding is another life choice I made several years ago - it's like smallholding for people who can't afford to buy or rent their own land. Since leaving home to follow my adult route through life, I have moved house 13 times, this is my 16th address. Every one of those addresses has had garden space where I have started trying to grow fruit and/or vegetables and, where possible, keep chickens, ducks and quail. The garden in this first photo was the smallest ever, so stretched to no more than some pots of herbs, salad leaves and an attempt at composting. This was taken in 2006, at the cottage we rented after a family crisis in 2004 forced me to relocate - again! The following year, we'd to move house again, but it was a good move as far as gardeing was concerned because the garden was massive in comparison to the little green postage stamp we'd been restricted to at the cottage. It was great fun sorting it out, as the owners had already begun planting veggies before they left and let out their house. Some of you may even remember these photos from posts done back in 2007, when I finally used the proceeds of my £2 coin savings challenge to buy the plastic greenhouse, extended the veggie plots halfway up the garden and dug out the first 'micro pond'. We had a hedgehog lived in this garden and a serious snail problem, along with major cat problems from the 12 or so cats that lived between the houses on either side. These photos were taken in 2007 and then 2008, showing progress made and the lovely old fruit trees that grew in the top half of the long, thing strip of back garden. I loved that garden, was very proud of progress and very sad to leave it behind, when we'd suddenly to move out the following year. From there, we went further out into the country, renting a run-down, semi-bungalow with a scrap of garden area that hadn't been cultivated in some time.  Time to start over, again...  I was living in hope that this move would be for the long term. It was tough going while trying to create any sort of garden from the rocky soil, if it was even worthy of being called soil! Anyone remember this, from when we first moved in 2009? It took a full year of clearing and digging to get much growing in there, then we managed to get the little greenhouse from neighbours, who moved out from the house next door. It was starting to get interesting by 2010 - we had the chickens, ducks and quail, plenty of eggs and over a mile of driveway for foraging wild berries. We also had sheep escaping into gardens and cows munching everything they could reach by pushing over the broken fence! Then, at the start of 2011, we were dealt a particularly cruel and unbelievably vicious blow! Once again, we had to uproot - literally - and find a place to stay, after being pretty much made homeless. Fortunately, the legal bigwigs were able to protect us from that, delaying it long enough to allow a solution to be found. But it let me see, once and for all, how little one can trust those you think can be trusted. Of course, that's when the car chose to give up the ghost and houseshare lost his income! We threw every penny we had, right down to the contents of my son's coin tin, into buying a fixy up - this place! It wasn't habitable, but we'd no option other than to move in as soon as we had electricity and running water, even if it did mean carrying buckets of water from the burn to the house to flush the toilet until that got fixed! That was last April, and this is what we had acquired by way of garden. (Anyone remember this?)  More work was done in that 'garden' during the latter half of 2011 and first half of 2012 than in any other garden. This, at long last, was going to be HOME! It's ours, there's no landlord, there's no mortgage, there's just an awful lot needing done to turn it into a proper home and the usual legalities to resolve when you throw all your savings in with a third party to jointly buy property. (Those technicalities have still to be ironed out, so 2013 MUST include having a will made! I have been sharply reminded of this by the four deaths that have occured in the family over the past 14 months!) Work continued, as per all the blog posts - clearing the hen runs at the bottom of the garden, digging into rubble mountain, clearing the banks of the little stream that runs throught the bottom of the garden, creating a wildbird garden, planting the mini-orchard, digging a duck pond, planting all the fruit bushes, digging raised beds, herb gardens, building wildlife habitats, a recycled greenhouse, even a brand new shed! It was starting to look fabulous in summer (what we had of it), with a load of colour and the fruit canes and trees all beginning to settle after their rude uprooting last year from the previous garden. It's been a long time in happening, and there's still a huge amount of work to do before the place comes anywhere close to becoming a microholding. A friend who is a permaculturalist (is that the right word?) visited and, from thereon in, it's been a case of observing the lie of the land to determine where best things should be sited for the longterm good of the garden. THANK GOODNESS we did! The Mayan calendar may well have foiled the doomsday believers, the earth did not end. But, here in Frugaldom, yesterday's midwinter solstice definitely marked the end of an era and this morning saw the dawning of a new age - one that acknowledges once and for all to any doubters that  nature is the ultimate dictator in how we lead our lives. We NEED to respect that. Losing the car last month was a bit of a big deal for us, but we'll manage without it somehow. Seeing the garden destroyed is something I'm not relishing the thought of, so fingers crossed! Right now, I need to hope that the hens survive the floods by staying on the upper levels of their coops, which are down by those trees, and that the water level stops rising soon, otherwise even the ducks will have no safe place to go. This is a sharp reminder that we need to follow the natural course of things, keep to the contours of the land and, most importantly, show respect for our environment and all that sustains life on this planet. Keep safe everyone, let's hope the rain stops soon and the water levels drop quickly. I realise that this little garden problem in Frugaldom is nowhere near as serious as events documented on the news, where towns are flooding, rivers are breaching water defences and landslides are closing roads, nor does it come remotely close to the devastation caused in foreign lands by tsunamis, earth quakes, tornadoes, droughts, epidemics or famines, but surely it comes some way to demonstrating how lucky we are that we have the ability to choose how we solve our own problems and lead our own lives. There are many millions of others can hope for nothing more than survival. Cheers for now,Frugaldom - with sand bags at the ready, just in case!"},
{"title": "Feeling Lost on the Road to Financial Freedom", "date": "Friday 21 December 2012", "text": "Twisting and Turning - Taking the Frugal Route.In support of a fellow frugaler and blogger. :) This is the route I chose to take about 15 years ago. To many, it looks like it's all downhill through a rather bleak landscape, with nothing to look forward to but reaching the bottom, when things will hopefully level out and allow time to relax, go with the flow and even enjoy the ride.It's the frugal route, it's the needs prioritising the wants, it's the saving combatting the spending and it isn't easy to navigate if you happen to take your eye off the road, even for a brief moment.Here's the latest update on my 2012 Challenge:The following was the rejigged (several times) budget for 2012 showing total amount followed by what's left (in brackets). This was for household of three that then dropped to two.Groceries, Toiletries, Cleaning - £1,200.00 (-£18.59) Electricity - £800.00 (£15) probably won't be enough, but will try to make it last. Coal - £245.00 (15p) Logs - £165.00 (£4.75) Other - £64.50 (£6.25) Mobile - £10.00 (£5) there's no signal here, so why feed the thing more than it needs?Telephone and Internet - £318.00 (NIL) TV - £145.50 (NIL) Footwear and Clothing - £50.00 (-£16.07) Gifts - £60.00 (-£69.59) Car - £750.00 (£12.59) Postage and Deliveries - £47.00 (-46p) Home Insurance - £75.00 (£75) Household Pets - £70.00 (£9.77) Total remaining from £4,000 = £23.81 As you can see, there were a few fluctuations after switching about balances. I deducted £100 from car budget and switched it to groceries and I didn't renew contents insurance - my contents are minimal, to say the least. Gifts budget is something I need to really work on, as I am so easily tempted when it's for family.  That HAS to stop and I have to make much more of an effort to handmake gifts. Trouble is, you can't handmake things like concert tickets. (Nor do I want to become that crazy old lady who gives strange creations to grandchildren for Christmases and birthdays that they hide and then only produce when granny visits!)Clothing budget went over because I bought some leggings, hi-vizibility vests, gloves and hats for all the extra walking and cycling we'll need to do, now that the car's gone. On the 'EEK' front - this stands for Everything Else Kitty - over the past year, I have raised an extra £1,808.80 from sales, winnings, vouchers, cashback, interest on savings and cash gifts from family. There was also a small payment from the scrappy when the car got put to sleep, plus there will be another few pounds due at end of the month from savings interest - a pittance - and, hopefully, a couple of months' worth of road tax refunded. Over the year, I have spent £1,806.46 outside of the strict household challenge budget - pretty much spending it as I get it - but I did use the bulk of my Amazon vouchers (transferred from Topcashback* and Nectar points) for gifts, cat food and bulk buys, plus set up my new micro-business for my part in the 2013 Frugaleur Challenge. (McGonks!)   I still can't thank Frugal Queen enough for her activation of that love bomb! The explosion after shock is still rippling through Frugaldom whenever the post man knocks on the door (like he did today, again)!The EEK (Everything Else Kitty) is what pays for that little bit extra in life, so it is a very important part of any frugaler's annual budget. If I don't have it to spend and want to steer clear of all debt, then I can't spend it without earning it as extra - over and above my normal or regular income. It should be noted that my 'EEK' earnings, even when added to my regular income, still don't come anywhere close to the national minimum wage, nor even the income tax threshold, but I do still pay my self-employed National Insurance Contributions, despite falling below the threshold for those, too! That's my only current contribution towards a retirement pension!In comparison to others, I feel rather rich on my meagre income. The house is paid, there are no debts, each penny is my own. I am choosing to forego the car, I choose to live on a tight budget while saving what I can, I houseshare with a like-minded frugaler (read that as well-trained) and I choose to live this lifestyle because it's what I enjoy doing. Many people can't accept that fact and think I should buy a car, get a 'real' job (self-employed from home apparently isn't real 'work') and then throw a heap of cash at the renovation to get it done quickly. Hmm... of those people, I'd rather have mylifestyle than their's.  So, back to the original photo at the start of this post, if downhill is what you see, then find some free wall space and prop yourself up like this to look again...What you'll see is a meandering path that leads us safely through the rocks and hard paces of life, gently rising from the depths of debt - be it loans, credit agreements, hire purchase, credit cards, binding contracts or mortgages - to scale the heights of financial freedom. Along the way, we'll pass all manner of exciting and beautiful things that help us achieve our goals - smooth curves, gentle slopes, some spectacular views and, if we are lucky, some fellow travelers following the same route. It's sometimes weary and sometimes precarious, but it's heading in the right direction. A few fellow travelers will be passing us on their way down, descending the fast route, spending their cash less than wisely. These are the friends we try to waylay, in the hope they may turn around and accompany us back up the winding road, rather than risk plunging over the edge or hitting rock bottom unexpectedly faster than they'd thought possible. Others will be heading in the same direction, perhaps at a different speed, either overtaking us on their way or being overtaken by us when our own speed is faster than we realised.At the end of the day, when we look closely at the reality of this 'meandering rollercoaster', we may all be on the same path. Finding ways of feeling good about it all the time can be tough. Some days we simply need to take a break, or even backtrack a little so we can survey the lie of the land and then take a run at the next hill. On such a life changing journey, and that's what your adventure into frugal living can be, nature has provided for every creature to rest awhile and recharge. You just need to turn over any rock to see what's lurking below it, then decide which you'd rather be, or else decide why you'd rather be who you are and carry on regardless.As a final offering, this is what some folks think of me when I'm of less than cheerful disposition, shall we say! More than just a little nippy, or just plain 'crabbit', as we Scots normally put it. :)Photo credit 1: Photo credit: snarl / Foter / CC BY-NC-NDPhoto credit 2: Fuschia Foot / Foter / CC BY-NC-NDPhoto credit 3: NYK Media, taken on the beach nearest to Frugaldom* Referal link for cashback  If nothing else, I hope this post makes someone, somewhere smile."},

Now get a free hobby that the whole family can enjoy and take part in our 2013 sealed pot challenge in the Frugaldom Forums As a longtime frugaler, I have also been a great fan of recycling and that doesn't always just mean separating green, clear and brown glass or putting your old papers in the appropriate bins. It can mean making one thing out of another, turning waste into something fun and/or practical. As you'll see from the above, several of the frugal living challengers started by making sealed pots and banks from paper. These were made in 2007 as part of a previous challenge, but some are still going and look as good as new! The challenge is still running and will continue into 2013.To help get you started, here's what you'll need to make your first sealed money pot or animal bank: EASY PAPER MACHE ANIMAL BANK RECIPE - NOT TOXIC 1 inflated balloonEgg carton or similar for snouts/noses/feetScrap paper for ears, tails etcPaint for decorating - emulsion, poster paints etc or else use coloured paper on final layer of papier mache.1 cup flour3 cups waterNewspapers/magazines/wrapping paper/old bank statements or bills (once you pay them) torn into strips.

Some people store them in airing cupboards, some sit them on shelves or racks over radiators, others simply leave them sitting some place dry for longer. It's best not to sit them in the kitchen or bathroom, where steam can build up and slow the drying process. You don't want the flour paste turning sour because it's taking so long to 'set'.Once completely dry - it 'sounds' dry when tapped - you can paint it in whatever design you like.You might also like to take a look at McGonks - our 2013 recycling enterprise using offcuts of fabric for arts and crafting.Happy bank-making,Frugaldom."},
{"title": "How to Stretch the Frugal Grocery Budget", "date": "Wednesday 19 December 2012", "text": "Rural Living and No SupermarketsI'm often asked how I manage to keep the grocery budget so low when we have no easy access to supermarkets and, therefore, no access to all those lovely yellow stickers and 'reduced' items everyone seems to always be boasting about online. First of all, I have a small budget, so it has to stretch much further than one set in a more urban location. You very rarely get the opportunity to buy 'cheap' groceries when living in a rural area, so growing your own fruit and vegetables of any description is always a good idea. We also keep hens, ducks and quail for eggs.Until recently, we were a household of three, but we're mostly down to two, nowadays, with occasional fluctuations. Previously, the grocery budget had been set at £1 per person per day for everything but I have increasef that to £1.25 per person per day, to add a bit of luxury. For a household of 2, that's going to be £912.50 for 2013.If you can buy vegetables in bulk cheaply, there's no real need to grow vast quantites of, say, potatoes, carrots or onions when you could be growing or rearing something a little more exotic (or expensive) in your garden. This winter, I have bought bulk sacks of potatoes (£9 for 25kg), carrots (£1.99 for 10kg) and onions (99p for 4kg), so these should see us right through until spring. Meanwhile, we have all sorts of fresh herbs, quail eggs and even saffron being produced in the garden.When prepping the veggies, I can boil a huge pot of potatoes then mash and freeze the surplus into margarine tubs. Adding a bit of milk powder to the mash means that it doesn't go watery once defrosted, it tends to be more creamy. I sometimes do carrots or swede in my mash, too, as they boil well together. Excess carrots can be washed, chopped and blanched for freezing or else stored in crates of sand. I have to admit to never having tried over-wintering them in sand, as I prefer to have them at the ready for using in stews, soups and casseroles.Food miles - do they matter?I would love to be able to grow, buy or trade everything locally, as in within cycling distance of the house, but that's never going to happen. 'Local', for me, needs to mean 'buy British', which is what I try to do as much as possible. I grow what I can in the garden and we have a local store in the village, which is about 7 miles round trip from here, but prices can be unaffordably high on a frugal budget. We no longer have a car, so home deliveries are now paramount - but no supermarkets deliver within our area. Solving this problem is what led me to the' frugal four', although they have, since, reduced to the 'thrifty three': Approved Food*, Food Bargains* and ROSSPA.The above sites offer rural frugalers every opportunity to save money on grocery shopping. The first two sell close to sell-by and/or past BBE date foodstuffs, often in bulk, with a fairly reliable and economical delivery service. The latter is an ever diversifying farm shop that sells fresh produce, including British meat, fruit and vegetables online and delivers overnight. Let's face it, for someone without a car who lives at least 20 miles round trip from their nearest small Co-op, the £5.50 delivery option is excellent value. It would cost me more than double that for a taxi, as I'd never manage to haul 25kg of foodstuffs in a shopper on the bus. Apart from that, there is no bus!This afternoon, I took delivery of both a ROSSPA and an Approved Food order, but I'll start with ROSSPA, as that's where the 10kg of carrots and 4kg of onions originate. I ordered the following:Kitchen towels x 4750g unsmoked gammon joint1.2kg fresh Cumberland sausages1.2kg fresh Scottish beef mince1.3kg fresh British pork chops2 x 5lb bacon (approx 4.55kg)10kg carrots4kg onionsCinnamon sticksPickling spicesThe boxes always arrive overnight with meats packed in polystyrene boxes (complete with chill packs) and everything else bubble wrapped and surounded by egg cartons... now yoy know where I get all my packaging and where I store the eggs when all the birds are laying! The above order came to a grand total of £36.90 including postage and packaging and arrived within 24 hours of ordering, despite this being a very busy week for all concerned.The first thing I do is work out how many meals are among the order, to gauge the price. Everything gets split up into alternative packaging and then straight into the freezer. (I double checked with ROSSPA and all their butcher meat is fresh, none pre-frozen.)Here I have to admit to falling foul of plastic freezer bags, but I do reuse any containers I have available, including those saved by my less frugal friends and relatives, from takeaways.From my £36.90 order, I easily have sufficient meat for at least 35 meals for two, plus several pots of soup. Even the bones from the pork chops can be boiled to make stock for a decent pot of broth and each pot is enough to feed two of us for several lunches, especially when cooked up with plenty of vegetables and some rice, grains or pulses. Homemade soup can cost less than 5p per portion to make - see homemade soup recipes for costings - so you can see how the items listed in today's post could feed us for many weeks. I'll probably stretch it much further than 35 meals by adding extra carrots and onions to the mince and making spaghetti bolognese, lasagne and chilli. Cue the pasta maker, as egg pasta is really cheap to make when you have your own garden hens laying eggs. (Little 'Bernice' started laying again just a couple of mornings ago.)As 2013 will be the first year the household will be without a car, it will be a huge learning curve. I'm sure we will manage, especially after having had this month to practice on the bikes. Thankfully, a friend has offered to deliver me a Christmas turkey at the weekend, when I can pay her for her troubles. I just hope she finds me a little one, as the 2012 grocery budget has almost been depleted.The homemade 'pink fizz' is fizzing away in the kitchen. I gave a friend away a bottle of it this afternoon, so let's hope it tastes as good as it looks.Back to the kitchen for me - I still have almost 20kg of cooked chicken to organise from my Approved Food order. I was a bit dubious of ordering this in bulk but, having tried one bag last order, I opted for 10 x 1.95kg bags this order, at a total cost of just over £35. The cooked chicken is boned and chopped - looks to be all white meat - vacuum packed in its own juice and past BBE. It is brilliant for chicken curry, sweet and sour, pies, hot pots, in wraps and even served with gravy as part of a frugal Sunday dinner. It also appears to be safe to freeze after opening the pack - I am living testament to that, as is Scruffy cat. :) It looks like I'll get at least 6 meals for two out of each pack, so a cost of less than 30p per serving and no need to cook.Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com*Refer a friend affiliated links."},
{"title": "Handmade Christmas on a Frugal Budget", "date": "Saturday 15 December 2012", "text": "Hand Making ChristmasSnowman SoupThis year, I'm in a bit of a quandary as to what to do and how to proceed as far as cards and gifts are concerned. Basically, most folks I know are skint and opting out of gift-giving or card sending. I can't really blame them on the cards thing, as it saddens me to see tons of pretty cardboard binned or burned after the festivities are done and dusted, and it doesn't help that the cheapest postage stamp is now 50p, which is enough only for the flattest, non-embellished cards. Anything fancy and we're into the realms of 'large letter' postage. For those on certain benefits, (I can't tell you which ones as I don't know) thre's the opportunity to purchase a limited number of discounted stamps, so make the most of it, even if it's just to help a friend, as I know some are doing.For details of the 'snowman soup' featured in the photo, see blog post here.My middle name, or one of them, should be 'disorganised'! I do try my best to save up as many vouchers and points as possible throughout the year so I can afford Christmas but it never works out that way! I shop online via Topcashback, collect Nectar points, Co-op points and accrue credit card cashback. The sum total can amount to well over £100 worth over the year, which a small fortune for me! It buys all sorts of essentials through the year - like cat food, bulk food buys and assorted gifts that can be sent directly. Trouble is, the voucher savings never last long enough to complete the Christmas shopping. I need to get inventive and make gifts that can be posted for the minimum First Class amount of £2.70, plus I now live in a tiny community where everyone exchanges cards, hence my need for extras.Tonight's job is card-making and I can cheat a bit with the bulk of them by way of the cardmaking kits I bought in a charity auction. These will be hand delivered to friends, family and neighbours. The further afield ones all get sent to one address for sister to distribute accordingly. I would show you the kit cards all made up but can't, as a couple of the recipients would see them before receiving them. :)NOTE TO SELF: Double sided sticky tape and sticky tabs are just that - STICKY!After completing the kit cards, it will be time to move on to the individually created ones for gran daughters, nieces and nephews. Coupled with that, I shall also create my entry card for the bloggers' competition that was announced following our completion of the Secret Santa challenge.The Christmas Card Crafting Competition will need a blog post on its own, but everyone is free to take part. Here are the details I received from Money Supermarket about the 'Christmas card craft off' challenge:We want to see photos, guides, tips and the different stages you went through – and in exchange you’ll be in with a shot of winning one of the incredible prizes, which are on offer to the top three entries in each category:  Adults1st – iPad Mini2nd – £100 Hobbycraft vouchers3rd - £50 Hobbycraft vouchers Children1st – iPad Mini2nd – £100 Hobbycraft vouchers3rd - £50 Hobbycraft vouchersLike any good frugaler, I'm determined to secure my entry into the competition, but need to get my personal Christmas cards out before that.  Back soon, Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "A Proper Thank You for my Love Bomb!", "date": "Thursday 13 December 2012", "text": "How Does a 'Love Bomb' Work?Stéfan / Foter / CC BY-NC-SAI am still trying to work out how the love bomb works - I understand the concept and love that I was the recipient of one, but am stuck for what happens next. I feel a bit like the picture shown here - Indiana Jones and an avalanche of presents.What's the protocol?How does one respond?Indeed, how does one thank people properly when contact details are so scant? If anyone can clear up this little problem for me, I would be very grateful. Perhaps you could all send me your addresses via the contact page on this blog and allow me to send each of you a frugal, micro McGonk. Yes, that's a good idea... please will the following people send me their return addresses so Clan McGonk can begin infiltrating many more frugal homes! :) Edited in at lunchtine:Look what the postman just brought into Thrift Cottage! An awesome collection of wools, the likes of which I have never seen before, from an anonymous frugaler. Wow! Can you tell this knitting game is new to me? Last time I knitted (prior to the wrist warmers) was when I was pregnant; the result of that period of my life is my 25-year-old daughter who now has two daughters of her own! Ooh, what fun I am going to have with all these fabulous yarns! I can't even think about where to begin...My sincerest gratitude goes out to all of you and I hope there is some small way in which I can show my appreciation.I'd also like to include this:It's a photo of a few of the little McGonks I have been making from all the lovely Secret Santa and love bomb bits and pieces I've received. (The speckly fabric is from the offcut I bought via eBid.), It's the start of my frugal micro-business project, all helped along by some wonderful, kind-hearted frugal bloggers. The grey McGonk at the front is one I made last night. This is being donated to the local children's storyteller and will, hopefully, help introduce the pre-school children who attend her story-telling sessions in the library to the joys of frugaling and recycling during her 'Frugal February'. :)Froogs, I have been tracking your Secret Santa parcel and it seems to be doing some amount of travelling between depots, I really hope it reaches you soon. Current update states it's at depot (it doesn't say which one) and arrived there at 3am this morning. Maybe that means it has gone out for delivery today or has even reached you by now, after leaving here on Friday. Fingers crossed!Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Fun, Funky, Frugal Knitted Wrist Warmers", "date": "Wednesday 12 December 2012", "text": "Easy to Make Winter WooliesThis afternoon, we went a trip out to the nearby loch, primarily for a bit of fresh air and exercise, secondly to take a couple of photographs of the frozen landscape. I thought I'd wrapped up warmly enough - jacket, hat, scarf, gloves as top layer, leg-warmers over wooly tights and thick socks as under layer and several other layers in between, but I was wrong! Juggling a camera and wooly gloves while balancing on a bike isn't easy, especially in sub-zero temperatures, I can tell you!The trouble I had is that my sleeves kept riding up my arms and leaving a chilly gap between the bottom of them and the top of my gloves. What I needed, and as soon as possible, I might add, was some sort of glove extensions that could bridge the gap. I returned home and, while thawing out with a mug of hot chocolate, I planned my next mission - wrist warmers!My recent bounty of crafting, knitting and sewing goodies came in really handy this evening, that's for sure! A quick scour through the 'stockroom' and I had soon selected a little pair of bamboo knitting needles and the remains of a ball of fairly chunky, vivid pink wool. Without a pattern and being very rusty at the old knitting game, I tentatively cast on 30 stitches and began knitting - just straightforward, simple, plain stitches, nothing fancy. It was all done at a painstakingly slow speed, so it took me about 90 minutes to complete my first square before casting that off and starting over again. The second square was completed  a tiny bit quicker, but still took me over an hour. Once I had completed both of the squares, I folded each in half and hand stitched along the edge with wool to create 'tubes'.  Now you simply turn these inside out to hide the stitching and there you have it - your very own, handmade wrist warmers! These simple wooly tubes fit snuggly around wrists, bridging the gap between gloves and sleeves! One small problem remained, however - a way of keeping the wrist warmers in place - cue the crochet hook! I cast on a line of about ten stitches in a fetching shade of purple wool and did a double row to produce a little wooly 'strap'. Two of these were made and then one stitched onto each of the wrist warmers, across the thumb part, to help keep them in place while wearing them.I'm extremely pleased with my latest creations and hope to make good use of them while making the most of any winter sunshine. As you can see by the photographs, I couldn't wait to try them on - or could that be a reflection of how cold it is here? :)In total, it took me just over three hours to complete my project! If I'd to price these for selling while counting the time at National minimum wage, we'd be looking at over £20 per pair, so these are like the ultimate in luxury designer wear for this frugaler! I can't thank the donors of the wools, knitting needles and crochet hook enough for the help these have all been in producing my new winter woolies this evening.I can highly recommend these and will probably make several more pairs to ensure some colour co-ordination in my winter wardrobe. I may even do some as gifts for Christmas.Frugaldom. :)"},
{"title": "Frugal Food Treats for the Garden Birds ", "date": "Monday 10 December 2012", "text": "Don't Forget to Feed the Garden BirdsAs temperatures plummet and the prospect of another long winter draws in, it's time to check our wild bird supplies. Seeds, nuts, berries, fruit and suet are all firm favourites, as is a bit of cheap cat food. (Mealworms are a treat few frugalers can afford, hence the cat food.)Frugal living may be based on a very tight budget but the 'waste not, want not' in all of us can usually stretch to helping the wildlife on our own back doorsteps.Here in Frugaldom, we have an assortment of feeding stations dotted about the garden, mostly of the homemade variety. (This is my logman feeding station, he's made from part of a felled conifer tree and some bottle tops for eyes and nose.)I buy wild bird food by the 20kg bag from the local agricultural merchant and have it delivered along with the poultry feeding, so it's available all year round. Otherwise, anything left over that's suitable gets put out on the tables.The Bluetits love peanuts and fat-balls, but we need to remember to remove these from their net bags to avoid the birds catching beaks, tongues or claws in them. The Robins eat almost anything, the Coal Tits love peanuts and the list could go on and on and on. In fact, wild birds could eat us out of house and home here, so I try to make feed last as long as possible and as interesting as possible.Peanuts in shells (leftovers from Halloween, perhaps?) are great for stringing together and hanging in hedges or trees - the bluetits quite happily dangle there, pecking away at the shells and feeding on the kernels. There's also a cheap way of making the fatty treats the birds all seem to love.I have an empty herb tub that I line with tin foil - you'll see just shortly why it has to be lined. Into this, I put a couple of handfuls of mixed wildbird feed in plus any seeds, crumbs, sultanas etc that have been left aside for any reason. As long as your tub is at the ready, you can tip in the hot fat anytime you fry. Having bought several tins of sausages from ROSSPA, they come canned in lard, which is great for making the feed blocks as it sets hard quite quickly. You can also set the seed, fruit and nut mix inside half coconut shells and then hand these from trees or posts. The other thing you can do is place string (non-nylon) in the middle of the seed blocks then tie them up once the fat has set hard.To speed up the process, you can pop the cooled blocks into your fridge or freezer. Obviously, if you live in freezing northern parts of the country, you'll find it's cold enough outside to set the feed blocks hard. This is one I have setting now, after having fried up a tin of sausages to add to a little chilli I had leftover - it meant it fed two of us instead of just one. During the hardest of winters, it's also a good idea to provide a daily supply of water, as most of what's around will be frozen. The starlings will probably bath in it, but if that's what they want to do, who are we to say otherwise.Now all I need to do is try my best to keep everything out of reach of Scruffy cat, which means hanging it up high enough that she can't climb or leap up and grab the birds!Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},

Seriously, we cannot take such things lightly and although I have almost dismissed any thoughts of pursuing the matter, I would very much appreciate some feedback.Here in Frugaldom, we work from home, as you all know, witing, crafting and offering an assortmnent of art-related works, virtual admin and publishing services. We use sites like O-Desk, E-Lance and People Per Hour. So, it comes as no surprise that we occasionally get paid by others to post in forums, while having the benefit of knowing who else is involved in the set up and running of such sites. That's how we found DS and his forum site - when he was advertising to hire posters for his new forum.Personally, I was not hired to post on the above forums, but I did offer my services free to help out a business partner, who was being paid to post. However, all was not well and things on the site just didn't appear to me to be run in a sufficiently professional manner to warrant any more of my free help. Indeed, one incidence forced me to withdraw my services completely, including removing many of my previous posts. That's when the site administrator decided to log into MY POST and rewrite it!My typing is not great, of that I shall freely admit, but I do know the difference between 'i' and 'I'. Likewise, I know the difference between 'lose' and 'loose', so the mere fact that he chose to include the phrase, 'saw looser', which I think is supposed to mean 'sore loser', makes this all the more laughable. For the purposes of  providing police evidence, should the need arise, I have screen printed the relevant posts, which include the following proof positive of when the illegal act took place:\"Last edited by djs on Thu Sep 20, 2012 7:08 am, edited 2 times in total.

Nothing more, nothing less. For Mr Shackleton (I presume) to have felt the petty need to doctor one of my posts in such a despicable manner, reflecting so negatively on my character, I feel no guilt in publishing this report to alert others to the abuse they lay themselves open to when registering to use a forum.

{"title": "I Got Love-Bombed!", "date": "Saturday 8 December 2012", "text": "Festive Love Bombs and All That Stuff...  There's no other way of saying it, I got love-bombed last week! I'm still in shock, over-awed by what happened when someone detonated the love bomb. I was completely taken by surprise, totally unprepared and at the mercy of the postman and all he could carry to my mailbox! During November, I set up the 2013 Frugaleur Challenge, launching it to coincide with Global Entrepreneurship Week. It allows us to establish the ground rules and get a head's start before 1st January 2013. This year's challenge, as I explained in a previous post, has been grossly increased to a whopping great £50 start-up budget and a 13 month period to plan, start-up, develop and grow a micro-business from home. We of the frugal living brigade need to earn our income somewhere and there just never seems to be enough of it to go around, hence the continual series of mini-challenges going on throughout the year. Priorities are things like paying off any debts, overpaying motgages, saving loose change in sealed pots, shopping via cashback sites and pursuing all manner of activities in order to succeed at decluttering, making do, reducing, reusing and recycling.  For some, it is still a case of trying to keep up with the rent and monthly bills! Becoming, and staying debt free is the ultimate goal. Anything more than that is an absolute bonus.  So, for 2013, McGonks are my thing! I now have a website, Facebook page, blog, an adoption centre for rehoming my furry little friends and, this weekend, the launch of Kindle subscriptions to their stories, available via Amazon both here in UK and in USA. Back to the love bomb - I have been talking McGonks non-stop for nearly a month now, while I scour Frugaldom and send out search parties to family and friends, looking for all sorts of bits and pieces suitable for my latest project. There had to be some spending, it was unavoidable - especially when I make treasure trove finds on places like eBid!  Well! While I have been busy beavering away at putting together a unique secret santa gift and creating my McGonk empire, I have been inundated with gifts of all shapes and sizes, replenishing my diminished crafting stocks and ensuring that the McGonk project gets off the ground.  Fellow frugal and crafting bloggers, I salute you! In the true spirit of the love-bomb, I shall, of course, 'pay it forward' at every opportunity and in any way possible. Now I would like to mention a Christmas Crafting Competition, again being hosted by our friends over at Moneysupermarket.com. This should appeal to even the youngest crafters, as it's a Christmas card making contest. I think the McGonks might be able to pull a few bits and pieces together in order for Thrift Cottage to submit an entry, don't you? Details can be found here. It's been another busy day here, what with all the McGonk challenge preparations, but I'm glad to say that they now have their own 'Clan McGonk' blog. (Feel free to follow, subscribe, read and share.) This is where all their news and great adventures will be recorded in 2013, as I don't want to swamp the frugal living blog with cute, furry, frugal gonks. Finally, today is the last day of the stirring of the pink champagne-style fizz! It smells delicious and is just starting to bubble and ferment. It's ready for filtering and bottling, so that is tomorrow's job. I'll drain off the liquid through the jelly bag and then pour it through a paper coffee filter, just to ensure all the 'bits' are out of it. The colour is very rich, much more like a sparkling red wine than a pink champagne. At 15p per bottle, it's frugal fruity fizz no matter what colour it becomes. I may even transfer the strained fruit to the big pan and boil what's left of it into a jar of festive, gourmet jelly! After that, there probably won't be much fruit left for the compost or the worms. Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "The Secret Santa Competition", "date": "Friday 7 December 2012", "text": "SECRET SANTA COMPETITIONHow can I possibly NOT write about #MSMSecretSanta challenge? I mean, Frugaldom is taking part in the challenge! It has been so difficult trying not to talk, post or blog about anything that could possibly give away any of the secrets!So here goes with the first of a couple of posts for today, as this is the day I finally get to put my Secret Santa gift together to send it out to my allocated 'partner' in all of this, Frugal Queen in Cornwall.I guess the first thing you have to think about when exchanging gifts with a stranger is, let's try to get to know a bit about the other person. So, I went back to the start of her frugal journey to get up to speed on the Cornish frugal situation and then tried to put myself into that self-same situation, wondering what I would really like from a Secret Santa. £25 is a fairly hefty budget in any frugaler's eyes, so this was going to be like a major gift of indulgence and luxury.There are so many things one could do with £25. For a start, it's more than my entire weekly grocery budget, so careful planning had to go into even the minutest detail. There couldn't be waste. Posting the gift means packaging it and sending it off by courier. Mine hasn't been collected from here yet, but Frugal Queen's has already arrived - and I love it! Thank you! It really ws like Christmas here yesterday! (Can't say what it is until next week.)[At this point I should explain that we live in a fairly rural location, I have no car and the nearest post office is a 7 mile round trip on foot. There is no pavement or footpath once you get to the main 'A' road, and it's bitterly cold & slippery. Walking to the post office with the secret santa gift isn't an option, so mine is being couriered. It also means we are at the mercy of the van drivers, if they have sufficient time to reach us before evening then they will, but it may end up being Monday collection for Tuesday delivery. We can't really get guaranteed overnight delivery here.]Back to the present (another pun)! Packaging - minimal waste, so it's recycled in a very frugal way. Having been fortunate enough to have already received my parcel from Cornwall, I am doing a cheeky return, popping my gift to 'Froogs' in the packaging that arrived here, from there. The actual gift itself is inside the posh, reuseable chocolate box that I requesitioned, complete with these beautiful ribbons! (Sacrilege to even consider binning such a box!) I think we're allowed to show the parcels, just not divulge what's inside!\"But what's in the parcel?\"Well, we actually called a meeting about this in Frugaldom, because where I live isn't exactly known for its abundance of shops. We have two small grocery stores and a post office down in the village; that is it, as far as general shopping goes! (NOte to readers, I like it this way as the less I spend, the more I can afford.)Frugaldom isn't on a bus route, so jumping on a bus and travelling the 20 miles or so into Stranraer or Newton Stewart, our nearest shopping towns, isn't a quick option, either. For starters, it's a mile walk to the main road to flag down the bus - hoping that it sees you and stops.But we frugaling types from small communities do have a feather in our caps when it comes to gift buying and shopping locally... We have craft fayres and exhibitions, plus an abundance of very talented people! So, my frugal gift from southwest Scotland to southwest England is not only a Secret Santa gift that I think Frugal Queen will absolutely adore, it is also what I consider to be a true represetation of the spirit of Galloway, and Scotland on the whole. (Minus the whisky made by our local distillery at Bladnoch, sorry.) The gift represents friendship and wanting to share the best of what we have to offer. This is a very user-friendly, non-alcoholic (sorry, again), luxury gift that will last all year round. It will be absolutely unique, in that it's not something you can buy in any mainstream store, and it will be absolutely frugal, in that there should be no waste - even the packaging is reuseable.We all like to be able to keep warm through winter and cool through summer. When they talk about '50 Shades of Grey', I see life as fairly black and white, just like right and wrong, rich and poor or, even, trial and error. We all like to feel good about something and indulge ourselves now and again with a little luxury, we need a bit of fun in life to keep us smiling and, I guess most importantly, we need to be able to appreciate what we see, even if we sometimes forget to look for the littler things. As one frugal blogging lady (you know who you are) once said, \"Every time I look out of this window and see the trees, the park and the houses on the hillside, I spend just a moment being very grateful for what I have.\"To 'Froogs',I hope I have managed to find something to make you feel good and that you'll love your Secret Santa parcel as much as I loved putting it all together. Many thanks for being such a great partnering blogger in all of this and I hope you have a very Merry Christmas early, when this parcel arrives on your doorstep.Best wishes from the other 'Froogs'And finally, many thanks to moneysupermarket.com for putting this fabulous challenge together and inviting me to become a part of it.Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},

(Make sure the edges are smooth.) Any little round, shallow tins make really great, frugal cooky cutters!If baking as a single, large round, you can fork round the edges for that wavy effect and pierce the surface in a dot-to-dot pattern on each triangle. I just stab a few holes in them with the fork.Your shortbread should stay pale in colour. Sprinkle with sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven - leave to cool for 10 minutes and then transfer it to a baking rack to cool properly. I've done mine double thickness for a bit of added luxury. :)FRUGAL TIPAlways keep a stock of flour, margarine, oil, sugar, salt and yeast in your cupboards.

{"title": "Micro McGonks? How Much Cuter can it Get?", "date": "Wednesday 5 December 2012", "text": "When Recycling Develops into an Obsession!Good evening readers and followers of all things frugal. As you will know, my obsession with challenge setting has continued to flourish over the years, each Hogmanay (31st December) bringing a whole list of new challenges to be faced during the following year. 2013 will be no different, except that we launched the Frugaleur (frugal entrepreneur) Challenge in late November, in order to allow ourselves adequate preparation time without being hampered (pardon the pun) by the annual festive celebrations. 2013 is going to be my biggest push towards zero waste, combining it with my eco-arts project to recycle as much as possible into something worthy of developing into a micro-business. I'm not looking to stock superstores, I'm just looking to make the most of whatever I can in the hope of earning a few pennies extra towards the upkeep of Frugaldom. Clan McGonk went 'live' at the weekend, which is when I made my first ever sample of the furry little critturs available to view online. I like to refer to these as my frugal pets and I'm sure you can see why it is so easy to become attached to them. But they have many secrets to divulge over the coming year. They have places to go, people to see and the whole wide world is their playpark, assuming anyone wants to get involved. Feel free to browse the Frugaldom Store at http://frugaldom.ebid.net and I will happily sell you a McGonk that's been handmade here in Thrift Cottage, Frugaldom. For those of you who prefer to make your own, I'll put together a simple to follow 'how to' post very soon. This evening, I found myself forced to play my next hand early, after someone mentioned keychain McGonks. So that is what you are looking at in the top photograph... but I call them micro-McGonks. This one has a keyring attached, so he can always be seen hanging around the place, looking cute and looking towsled. These are much smaller than the McGonks, as you can see by the first photo and, once again, I used shredded paper as stuffing, a button for a nose, scrap of fabric for his hat and then added the luxury of wobbly eyes and a tiny pompom. So there you have it - Frugaldom is not only the home to Clan McGonk, we have also developed our very own micro-Mcgonk. As many of you know, microholding is one of the other things that we are attempting here - everything 'smallholding' but on a much tinier scale. Once again, I would like to thanks all of those friends and associates who are kind enough to donate me their offcuts. I do have to make one not so frugal admission, though. I invested another £6.44 into my 2013 Frugaleur Challenge after I spotted some fabulous off cuts of furry fabric listed on eBid. I guess I should really give you a run down of how my participation in the Frugaleur Challenge is going, so here it is, as briefly as possible. 2013 Frugaleur Challenge - to set up a frugal enterprise that will help pay some bills or, at worst, convert a home-based hobby into a self-funding passtime (so it doesn't drain any of your much-needed financial resources). Starting 'investment' limit = £50 maximum Spends to date = £30.22 including .com and .co.uk domain names Sales to date = £21.77 after deduction of PayPal fees The above means that of my original £50, I currently have a balance of £41.55 and I am hoping to be able to recoup the full £50 before the 1st January. At that point, the hobby of recycling one thing into another will need to sustain itself. Fortunately, the act of writing the little stories for the series doesn't cost anything more than my time and the brain-ache of trying to keep everything interesting and entertaining while thinking 'recycling'! Hoping a few of you will join me for the McGonk-making workshop soon and I'll look forward to sharing my frugal fun. Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com  PS: Don't forget you can join us in the Frugaldom forums at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org or on the McGonk Facebook page www.facebook.com/ClanMcGonk and also on Twitter, where you can follow @Frugaldom"},

Even at that, it's youngest member of the extended Frugaldom family's second birthday on Hogmanay (31st of December), so the celebrations will easily take us clear into the new year.Festive shopping is always a bit different for frugal ruralites like us. For starters, we have no shops nearby, so it's always wise to plan ahead. This year, my plans have gone askew, as we now have no car to take us into town. It's very much a case of even more creative thinking and thanks, once again, to the glorious world of online shopping. I've been trying to think what Frugal Queen would really like as her Secret Santa gift and am hoping that we have been so well matched in the competition that my thoughts may be similar to her's. This has given me free rein to shop like I'm in frugal cyber paradise, like the proverbial king (pardon the pun if you know me) selecting a gift fit for a frugal queen! As for the wrapping and packaging, well, that's another thing completely because I think I surpussed myself with the ingenuity of this! :)Aside from this, I've been working hard at preparing the McGonks for their 2013 adventures, even managing to get as far as setting up the Frugaldom shop online at http://frugaldom.ebid.net  where the various little characters will be offered for sale. I completed 5 furry frugal pets and listed 4 of them yesterday, as a trial to opening the shop. I was delighted (and shocked) to discover three of the four had sold within 24 hours! Lucky for me, friends and fellow bloggers have pulled together and supplied me with a selection of bits and pieces to be recycled into more McGonks. I am honoured to associate with such a lovely bunch of people!This morning, amongst the buttons, bows, ribbons and offcuts that have arrived trough my mailbox, I have set aside a lovely piece of  checked fabric that will be perfect for making miniature \"Tam O'Shanters\". (Scottish hats.) For those of you without the benefit of colour screen, the fabric is a combination of jade, wine, navy and yellow - I love it! Among the other goodies, a length of white trim from which I can salvage pompoms for adding to the hats. Crafting is such fun, even when trying to develop it into work! I have been so busy 'playing' at working, that time slipped completely from my hands until well into the afternoon.Food! Why do we always have to stop to eat? I sometimes feel like it's one mealtime after another with nothing in between! Speedy, hot food is a blessing in this house. Today we had wholemeal pitta sliced through and served with melted cheese and a spoonful of delicious chilli jam. Warming, filling, frugal and tasty! If you don't have pitta breads, use the outside slices from your loaves, tortilla wraps or ordinary bread rolls. The only reason we had pitta breads is because they are on offer at the moment, 3 packs for £1, and the spare packs got popped into the freezer. Frugal is as frugal does, we didn't even switch on the oven or grill, the filled pittas got wrapped in a bit of kitchen paper and popped into the microwave for a quick blast!But back to the recycling and what's been dubbed my 'reco-arts' project. One tiny problem I thought I may have with recycling an assortment of 'stuff' into frugal pets (my clan of McGonks) is what I would do when mistakes get made. The solution to this, I am hoping to find out very soon, as just such a mistake got made.Being a bit out of practice with the glue gun, as you already are aware, I inadvertently managed to glue my thumb nail to a pompom that I had just finished sticking onto a McGonk as a nose! (I can see the eyes rolling and hear the sniggering already!) Anyhow, it made a little bit of a mess trying to peel off the glue, resulting in the pompom growing, somewhat, as the wool was being teazed. Cue a hair-cut for the pompom to try and remove it and replace it... but that didn't go well, either!I now have a pink McGonk with a shaved pompom for a nose! 'Wee Hughie' seems to have taken rather a shine to the missfit, leading me to believe that perhaps I should let her accompany him to his new home, a bit like a buy one, get another one free. I mean, LOOK AT THEM! I spotted the pair out in the garden just before dusk, snuggled up to one another by the heather that grows between the blueberry patch and the pond. And look closer... wee Hughie seems to have presented her with a beautiful bunch of flowers!If anyone can think of a name for this little mop-capped misfit, please get in touch soon so I can get her 'birth certificate' completed, enabling her to accompany Hughie on his big adventure. I can't split them up, they're now inseparable!Until next time,Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Pink 'Champagne' Style Fizz of a VERY Frugal Variety.", "date": "Monday 3 December 2012", "text": "Champagne, Perry or Bubbly - Frugal Pink for Me! With such a busy start to the month, I thought it best to get the frugal 'champers' on the go so we had some ready in time for Christmas.  I've no rhubarb left (other than frozen, pre-stewed for pies), so I'm using a mixture of fruits, meaning my 'pink champagne' may turn out to be a slightly darker shade of pink, verging on something resembling sparkling 'Ribena'. Never mind, as long as it goes with a pop, fizzes and tastes nice, that is all that matters. I know there'll be Vitamin C in it, but not too much by way of alcohol. It's being started off as we speak! CHRISTMAS 2012 LAST MINUTE 'CHAMPERS'About half a kilo of mixed fruit (Free)About half a kilo of sugar (50p)1 sliced lemon (20p)Splash of cider vinegar (1p)3 litres water I tipped three cartons of frozen fruit into my bucket - one each of blueberries, raspberries and blackcurrants - but didn't bother weighing the quantities. To this, I added about half a bag of sugar, then a sliced lemon. I'm not a stickler for waxed or unwaxed as it seems to make no difference at all, from my limited understanding. In fact, a recent report actually suggested that the standard waxed lemons provide better flavour, so no point wasting money trying to source unwaxed varieties. Hopefully the lemon tree will grow and begin producing fruit over the next year or two, that would be handy! Next was the water. I boiled the first litre and poured that over the top of the fruit and sugar, then added the next two litres, unboiled. It's warm enough to dissolve the sugar quite quickly. About a tablespoonful of vinegar was added and I used what I had available - cider vinegar. (The hens like it in their water.) Job done! It's all been covered and is now sitting in the livingroom in its little bucket, infusing with flavour and alreay turning a pretty shade of pink. It will be left to soak until the weekend, but I'll give it a stir each day between now and then. Come the weekend, the liquid will be strained, fruit set aside for some sort of pie filling or sponge topping and the resulting juice filtered off into my clip top bottles. I have three of those, recycled, of course, plus there are a couple of screw cap glass bottles that can be used. If my estimates are correct, I reckon it will cost 15p per bottle, including the electricity needed to boil the kettle. I realise that this won't be particularly strong in the alcohol stakes, but a fortnight is sufficient time for the sugars to start fermenting and it does seem to work with almost every type of berry, edible flower or fruit I have tried. Have fun if you try this at home, but don't forget to check the bottles for any signs of over-fizz, s pink isn't the easiest colour to get out of anything that happens to be in the way. Until later, Frugaldom.\"I want to garden, grow veg and take in the view!\" Frugal living, for me, is a lifestyle choice that was made many years ago (during the last century) in order to pursue other things in life, like enjoyment, relaxation and, most importantly, freedom from debt. I wanted to relax and enjoy more of the little things in life, so frugal living encapsulated every aspect of my life and became more about having affordable FUN. At this time of the year, that means frugal, festive fun!Christmas needn't be a financial headache, just do your best to make the most of whatever is available and HAVE SOME FUN! Guess what? Recently, someone came along and set ME a frugal challenge! How exciting is that? I was invited to take part in an online 'Secret Santa' competition, on the condition that I didn't reveal any of the details before Monday 3rd December. I was jumping for frugal joy because, believe it or not, I'm a 'Secret Santa' virgin! Relishing the thought of Frugaldom representing our little corner of Scotland, I accepted the challenge with glee! After what seems like an absolute age of secrecy, I am now allowed to reveal the details. (Or, at least, most of them!)www.Moneysupermarket.com are our sponsors and it is they who allocated us our Secret Santa 'partners'. I am very proud to be partnered with Frugal Queen, who is based in Cornwall. Indeed, it was she who uttered those immortal words in November 2009, \"I want to garden, grow veg and take in the view.\" I'm hoping she is still pursuing the same dream, a dream that includes all the good things in life. I know she loves things like crafts and crafting, fine dining, gourmet food and home cooking, quilting, keeping warm in winter, rural life and, err, chocolate! :) The Secret Santa campaign is for frugal bloggers all over the web and we've each been give £25 with which to do our frugal utmost to get the best possible gifts for our fellow bloggers. (Not only that, the bloggers who send the most creative gifts could win a brand new mini ipad or some high street vouchers - I wonder who I'd give them to, if we managed to secure a win for this corner of frugal blog land?)What happens next?Well, I am now allowed to blog about what I'm putting together as a fantastic Secret Santa gift and why I think Frugal Queen will think it is fabulous. Unfortunately, I have to do this without giving away the secret of what the gift actually is! I'm usually rubbish at secrets but am very proud of mysef for having managed to keep this one, so far! (Thank goodness it's now Monday and I can spill the beans!)Over the coming week, I'll be doing my best to tell you about what's going down in Frugaldom by way of the Secret Santa gift that's being put together here. Meanwhile, frugal bloggers all over the web will be doing likewise, so tune in regularly for updates. I'll be linking this blog via my Facebook page at www.facebook.com/NYKMedia and on Twitter, where you can follow ALL the competitors' updates by using the dedicated hashtag #MSMSecretSantaOnce the Secret Santa gifts have been exchanged, we'll be blogging about the gifts we have received, so 'Frugal Queen' will be saying what she thinks of the gift that will have winged its way from chilly Dumfries and Galloway all the way down to Cornwall. I am so excited about this and hope she LOVES it! :)Anticipating loads of fun,Until later,Frugaldom!"},
{"title": "Frugal Entrepreneurs, Remnants and McGonks", "date": "Sunday 2 December 2012", "text": "So much to do, so much to blog!As you know, the brand new Frugaleur Challenge has already been launched and there's now less than a month to go before 2013. December is such a busy month for frugalers, making, mending, baking, wrapping, steaming, brewing, mixing and concocting, but we can't lose focus on money-saving or earning that little bit extra wherever possible. 'Clan McGonk' will now progress steadily towards the new year with a little bit of help from several online friends, to whom I am truly grateful! The first handful of McGonks will need to be sold in order to kickstart the enterprise, so here's a final rundown on how things are going. I have sufficient furry remnants to make eight individual McGonks. The main 'bodies' were machine-sewn by sis, the rest will be done by hand. There are plenty of bits and pieces rounded up and donated by friends, both at home and online, to make each furry little character unique. The first to arrive was Rory McGonk, unleashed on the world last night while opening the Clan McGonk Facebook page (www.facebook.com/ClanMcgonk). Tonight, a little more progress has been made with the help of my trusty paper shredder!  McGonks are not toys, they are novelty characters for decorative purposes only. I'd like to call them eco-friendly, but a friend came up with the even better term of, \"reco-friendly\", much more befitting the recycling process involved in making the little critturs. As I was saying, the paper shredder has been hard at work in Thrift Cottage, shredding scrap paper to use as stuffing for the gonks. Old newspapers passed on from friends (I never buy newspapers or magazines) usually get made into kindling sticks for the fire, but some paper simply isn't the right type for doing this job. Things like catalogues, brochures and old telephone directories are pretty useless as fire fodder, so these are now being recycled into McGonk stuffing! I guess this means the McGonks are a bit like certain other furry creatures that shouldn't get wet! Having completed Rory McGonk last night, I proceeded to stuff and stitch the remaining seven little gonks, giving me a total of eight. There are two each of red, orange, pink and pale blue, but no two are the same. Owing to the nature of the eco-arts (economical) project, there will never be two identical creations, each will be unique in its own right, depending on what was salvaged and recycled or upcycled to produce it.  Tonight, I completed Hamish. He and Rory are such cute little chappies that it's going to be challenging to part with any of them! Nonetheless, parting with them needs to be part of this frugal challenge. Now I need to price my little characters so they're frugally affordable to anyone who would like to own one. This is proving to be just as challenging.Do we count time? How does one price surplus materials donated by friends?Factoring in electricity for heat & light while working at home during the day is a considerationPurchasing glue, thread and any other extra bits and pieces needed, albeit sourced as cheaply as possible, has to be factored into the equationProduct pricing for a new business is difficult! Business budgeting is a complicated process, as there are so many hidden costs to be rooted out and included. Bank fees, card transaction fees, PayPal fees, to name but a few. I'm fortunate in that I am already self-employed and work from home, meaning I already have a business bank account, a reference number from HMRC and my National Insurance contributions being paid, but for newcomers to business, frugal or otherwise, it can all become a bit daunting. Don't let this put you off trying - the people at HMRC are actually very patient and very helpful, in my experience. If in doubt, give them a call or check their website at www.hmrc.gov.uk Back to pricing - If I add everything up and factor in the time, in case this new project 'takes off' and I need to pay someone to help (remember this is a frugal entrepreneurial challenge), then we're looking at about £3.50 per item plus postage and packaging. With current pricing structures coupled to the fact that we cannot cram a McGonk through a large letter postal slot, 1st Class postage amounts to £2.70, but then there's still the cost of the packaging, getting to and from post office (my nearest one is several miles away) and it all adds up to quite an amount. Would anyone be prepared to pay over £6 for the priviledge of owning one of these wee gonks, I wonder? That remains to be seen.Please feel free to comment on how you handle your pricing structure for homemade or hand crafted goods. I love making things but it's a whole different kettle of fish when it comes to making something pay, even on a semi-commercial level. Onwards and upwards, let's get into the festive spirit! I've got some fabby-dabby news coming your way tomorrow, so watch out for a rather fun and frugal announcement - it's something really exciting! Until tomorrow,Frugaldom.Having Furry Fun in FrugaldomRuaidhri (Rory) McGonkWelcome to December! A little bit of the festive spirit has struck Thrift Cottage this week after making a positive start on the next frugal challenge, the 2013 Frugaleur Challenge. As you may have read previously, my plan is to design and make a family of recycled furry friends. Clan McGonk is my new frugal project.A busy day was had by all, here in Frugaldom, as today saw the official opening of my daughter's new business! With no car and town 20 miles away, my friend 'Woo' collected me and we made a bit of a day of it, visiting both the charity shops, the supermarkets and the local shoe store, which had a sale on certain items. We had a fabulous time, stocking up on things like UHT milk, pasta, porridge oats and rice - 40p per kilo (long grain) from Aldi, so my 5kg tub has been filled! In the shoe shop, I found a couple of pairs of shooting gloves at £2.99 per pair. (They're like fingerless gloves but have a flap attached that turns them into big mittens to keep your trigger finger warm.) Nobody here shoots, but we do get cold hands! Next up were the hats! Oh my! What fantastic furry hats they had, complete with ear flaps and all greatly reduced to such a tempting price that I had to have one! I opted for the full (mock) fur and 'Woo' went the whole hog and got the one with fluffy ears attached! Honestly, a couple of middle-aged ruralites set loose in a small market town can still get up to mischief and have plenty of fun! Poor daughter didn't know what to do or where to look when we popped back in to show off our new furry headgear! Having left home around 10am, we didn't get back until after 2pm and, even at that time, the roads were still frozen!THANK YOU! (You know who you are.)﻿Postman had been by the time I got home and I had a super surprise awaiting me - a lovely selection of crafting items. I'm still over-awed by the generosity of others and cannot thank them enough, but rest assured I'll be spreading the love whenever I can, perpetuating the chain of giving and receiving. It's the aftershock of a love-bomb explosion, methinks! But this one kicked me into action!Ruaidhri McGonk has arrived! I made him this evening from an off-cut of red fur fabric, stuffed with shredded remnants and his 'Tam 'o Shanter' hat is made from a scrap of tartan material received in today's box of goodies, along with the pom poms! (I love those!) Eyes, I bought as part of my initial investment for the challenge, feet are made from cardboard and we all had gooey, fluffy fun practicing with the glue gun, which has been stashed away in its box for the past 4 years! I'll need a bit more practice to get back up to speed with that, or else someone to pick googly eyes off my fingernails! :)Ruaidhri ('Rory' in English) is the Gaelic word for 'Red King', which I feel is a very apt name for my first sample gonk. He's about 10cm tall and will be the first in a long line of Scottish frugal gonks, possibly with a few more little characters along the way. These McGonks aren't toys, oh no, these are very special little characters, each with their own story to tell. They even have their own Facebook page! Stage one of this challengeHas truly begun,We're out for adventure,We want to have fun!Do you 'like' the Clan McGonk page? It can be found at www.facebook.com/ClanMcgonk Clan McGonk is my entry into the 2013 Frugaleur Challenge, where we attept to create a small business from a minimum capital outlay, the object of the game being that we earn our initial investment back as soon as possible and, hopefully, turn a profit by the end of the annual challenge.Have furry fun, frugaling!Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Eco-Renovations and Gruesome Discoveries", "date": "Friday 30 November 2012", "text": "Frugal Progress, but Eeeeeeugh! It's getting colder by the day and we really need to get the potbelly stove fitted in as soon as possible! To this end, Thrift Cottage is in chaos! I called said chmney man last night and he was available for a visit this morning! Eek! We hadn't even cleared out the room, let alone removed the boards from the old fireplace. The moment of reckoning had arrived - had the chimney been blocked or capped? The prospect of having 'Wilbur' installed in the sittingroom/office/dining room is an extremely exciting one. Wilbur is my pot belly (pig) stove. We installed one at our previous house. (It was named 'George', by a frugal friend who had been reading Peppa Pig stories to her little nephew. George is, I think, Peppa's baby brother?) Anyhow, I loved the tiny stove so much that I wanted to bring it with me when we moved house so, when the new tenant offered to buy 'George', I replaced it with an identical model for here, while they were still available for under £100! (Wilbur, as many may remember, was the little pig in Charlotte's Web.) These are fabulous stoves for the price, although you do need to chop logs smaller to fit through the tiny door. They're multi-fuel, they burn hot, have a cleaning hatch and are blessed with a stove top plate that can be used for cooking or boiling the kettle; handy during power cuts! The following is NOT for the squeamish, so if the word 'gruesome' didn't alert you to the contents of this post, let this be your final warning to look away now, or else think of science in school. Chimney man was hard at work for well over an hour but I was delighted to hear that the old chimney has not been blocked up or capped - which explains the dampness. It was, however, blocked solid with years' worth of damp soot, birds' nests and, you've got it, the remains of some previously feathered tenants! Quite disgusting seeing the eggs and body parts tumbling from the 200 year-old chimney, but fascinating, all the same. Some looked positively preserved!  You know me, I felt compelled to take a photograph for posterity and have decided to sare it with you all right here, now! It's like the frugal version of a visit to the natural science museum! The worst of the mess is over for now, with bag upon bag of soot, rubble and the last remnants of the creatures that once inhabited our other chimney. At least we had a lovely, crisp day during which doors could be left open and heaters switched off to help save electricity. IT was a case of seeing your breath in almost every room in the house today, that's how chilly it's getting.Amidst this, the postman delivered me a lovely stash of oddments, buttons, ribbons and other beads, my frugal food order from ROSSPA got delivered, friends arrived with 25kg of spuds that I'd ordered and another pal arrived for a quick trip down to the village this afternoon. A busy day, by anyone's standards.Trip to post office got the November work stuff out of the way but I do wish I had taken my camera to capture the glorious pink sunset.  The view over Luce Bay was stunning! Never mind, here's one I took previously - it's the one I'm using to colour match the decor for the new kitchen, once we reach that stage. Finally, I'd like to wish everyone a HAPPY ST. ANDREW'S NIGHT and thank you all, once again, for being such fabulous, frugal friends and taking the time to read my frugal witterings. NYK Media, Frugaldom"},
{"title": "It's Beginning to Look a lot Like Winter", "date": "Thursday 29 November 2012", "text": "﻿As Temperatures Plummet...As the icy grip of winter tightens, so, too, do the purse strings, in a bid to stem the flow of cash needed to heat out homes. How are you managing to stay warm and how is that affecting your budget? For me, it's (ice) crystal clear that we need to take stock of everything from home insulation to pipe-lagging, draught-proofing and just basically keeping warm. All of this needs doing 'within budget', so this could explain why folks like me show renewed enthusiasm in crafting and an increasing interest in producing a vast array of culinary delights. At best, it helps absorb extra spending by way of the DIY gift production, at worst, we'll not starve or freeze, because we can eat or wear our own creations. It's a fabulous time of year! For our feathered friends and fruit-bearing trees, it's a bit of a sad time, I would think. What with the frosted ground, bare, dormant trees and frozen ponds, there's not much cheer to be seen, and even fewer eggs being laid (if any). For the ducks, it's time for extra layers of straw, warm mash suppers and extra players in the ice-breaking games. (I wonder if ducks would like winter woolies and fur-lined wellies, or is that just quackers?)Indoors, staying warm is just as difficult if you're mid-renovation, but the sub-zero temperatures are stark reminders to last winter, when we had no proper kitchen roof, therefore no proper kitchen. Now I have more than half a kitchen and work well underway towards completing the bathroom and the hall, with it's salvaged stone-flagged floor. I love my 'new' hall floor and know for sure that few will have similar, unless they also recovered their 1805 original, dug it up, cleaned it up and then re-used it. Earlier this week, we had two wooden steps replaced - it was a necessary job, owing to the discovery of a bit of wood rot at floor level that had obviously been temporarily mended at some stage over the years. To our amusement, our lower step had been partially constructed from what resembled part of a wooden, Aberdeen fish crate! You can just make out the word 'Aberdeen' stamped to the right of the old box handle, but I can't quite decipher the company name, as this was all that remained of said box. Later, of course, this got used to kindle the fire. Onwards and upwards, the weather is staying a little kinder to us, despite the -8 Deg C on the thermometer this morning. There's been no more rain! Indeed, we have even had a little more sunshine, further prompting me to investigate alternative transportation and pick up a few extra tips along the way. First tip was call the garage and ask for the car battery to be removed before they scrap the car! I'd never have thought of this, but am now convinced by fellow-frugaler's suggestion to utilise this in my quest for quail-house lighting. The car battery should easily power an LED light. But back to the car costs... Cheap cars aren't always as economical as we might think. £1,000 to buy, then there's insurance, road tax, MOT, servicing, general wear and tear, savings needed set aside for a replacement and, lest we forget, the astronomical cost of the fuel to power the blasted thing in the first pace. It all mounts up and, in this case, it amounted to a massive 65p per mile driven. In steps frugal-friend, once again trying to convince us of the merits of cycling. So d'you know what? We've agreed to have bikes! The carbon footprint of Frugaldom has been slashed. All I need to do now is try to cut down on the number of electric heaters I have plugged in, in an effort to reduce the costs of trying to heat the house. And now for some fluffy stuff, because I love being part of this little global family of frugalers, bloggers and forum posters. Some kind person has given me these colourful goodies to help me on my way to starting the previously mentioned 2013 Frugaleur Challenge, which will see Clan McGonk come alive for the new year. It's all very exciting and I can't wait to get started, especially as the pink wool almost matches the original pink gonk. I can just picture it now... Granny McGonk with her pretty shawl, keeping her extended brood in order over the coming year. I'm itching to get started on this project and wouldn't surprise myself in the least if I cast on a few huge loopy stitches this evening, while sat in front of the fire. I wonder how long it will be before someone pops up and suggests a rocking chair! (It's not like I have my eye on one of those for when the eco-renovation is completed.) :) Stay safe, stay warm and stay dry, everyone, and let's keep up the good work of making life fun and affordable for all. Best wishes to all, from a happy Frugaldom."},
{"title": "The Wonders of Wormeries", "date": "Wednesday 28 November 2012", "text": "Wiggly Worms and the Tale of the Coir! A second blog post, but this time a little more light-hearted. Like I said, frugal living is about taking the good with the bad and seeking out the silver lining in any passing clouds. Besides, it's actually rather fun contemplating all the 2013 challenges I can set mysef that involve getting from A to B without a car while living a mile from the nearest bus route and several more to the nearest post office, especially when my income relies heavily on having access to a post office. I have Internet, I will survive!  So, what's with the wormery? Well, as I said previously, Dumfries and Galloway Council currently offers subsidised compost bins and wormeries and I'm all for composting and recyling. So, when the opportunity arose to purchase such an object, I leapt at it - almost! Kick into frugal gear, start looking for a better deal, post a few questios and see what happens. What happened was Wormcity! They responded to my 'tweet' by offering to price match the subsidised product, which was £48.49 Not only that, they kindly offered to drop the 49p and provided me with the 'frugal' code to purchase their Wormery 50. (This special code is valid until 30th, if anyone else would like to apply, and includes delivery.)  As you'll realise, this is a huge amount of money to a frugaler, hence my stalling from leaping straight in and buying the council chosen option. So I duly counted out the annual coin collection and opted for the Wormcity Wormery 50, a far better deal, in my opinion. Box duly arrived and I skimmed the instructions. It al looked robust and easily assembled. Indeed, it was, even for a bungling Calamity Jane like me! But I did create one tiny problem for myself, entirely my own doing, I might add... Instructions clearly say, \"Place the coir block into a large bucket or bowl. Pour 3 litres of warm water onto the coir and leave for approximately 30 minutes.\" Excellent! Time to make a cuppa and catch up in the Frugaldom forum! So off I went, leaving the coir brick-sized block in my old baking bowl with its 3 litres of tepid water... About 20 minutes later, I heard a shout from the kitchen, so ran through to be met with heaps of coir crumbling and flowing over the top of the bowl, across the worktop and onto the floor. Arg! Had I read the next sentence in the instructions, I would have been seen, \"The coir will expand to 3 times it size...\"!  The wormery is now set up and has been sited inside the plastic greenhouse, in a spot that doesn't receive direct sunlight. It isn't exactly warm in there but I'm hoping it's enogh to prevent the wrigglers from freezing through winter. At the moment, I'm still shredding old paper to top up their 'house' and hoping they save me a small fortune on compost and plant food next year. That's another money-saving plan put into action that should also go a long way towards my zero-waste plans. :) Now for some other good news. The old oil-filled radiators that I traded for through LETS had been stashed out in the shed after they both gave up the ghost. Last week, a neighbour offered to take one of them away to footer with in his 'man shed' and joy, of joys! Message received saying they'll pop over this afternoon to return one fully working radiator! (Along with a mink trap.) While here, they are collecting the second oil-filled radiator and my thought-to-be defunct dehumidifier. Now if that could be resuscitated, it would be a massive boost.  Did I mention that my old 'whirly gig' clothes drier had broken? I need to get out there and assault the renovated outbuilding with a hook, so I can string my washing line between it and the garden gate. For indoor drying, I rely on my wooden upright airer, hence my hoping that the dehumidifier is repairable. Today the sun is shining, there's a beautiful blue sky and almost all of the frost has melted. The pond is still frozen, but the sun should reach it soon, then the ducks can have a splash around and dry out before teatime. Meanwhile, I've warmed myself with a bowl of homemade soup and am about to resume paper shredding to top up the wormery.

Taking the good with bad, I am happy to say that there normally is some form of silver lining to the passing clouds, even if it takes an exploration team a lengthy time to find it. Getting the week's 'bad' stuff out of the way first, as this is only Wednesday and there's plenty of time for more to arrive. (Sigh).  On Monday, some marauding animal invaded the garden and killed little 'Bunty', the runty duck. The murderous 'whatever' was neither seen nor heard, so we aren't ruling out a return visit from the mink. Nothing was seen or heard until the gruesome discovery of a decapitated pile of feathers was made, when going to see why all the ducks had run for shelter. (Hoping to borrow a mink trap this afternoon!)  It was last October, the day before my dad's funeral, that the horrid mink paid its first visit and massacred 7 of the hens, including cute little 'Dumbledorf', the miniature Silkie.  Earlier this year, we lost a couple of ducks. Worse still, earlier this year we also lost dear Floppity, my big, lop-eared rabbit.  This morning, Scruffy cat, our frugal mouser, point blank refused to go outside the door. Mind you, that could have been because ofthe thick frost. Even the big duck pond is frozen today. So enough is enough - the varmint HAS to be trapped and disposed of as quickly (and humanely) as possible. With this in mind, I have 'tweeted' a friend who is visiting this afternoon, asking that they brng their mink trap for a (hopefully short) vacation. Yesterday, after delivering the frugmobile to the garage for it's winter check, MOT and investigation of more clunks and squeaks, we received the bad news - as well as all the 'little things needing done, the back axle's 'gone' (I'm assuming they mean it's broken and not, literally vanished!?) and major motor surgery is just too uneconomical. So, absolute, frugal resolution, I have taken the decision to have the car put to sleep.  Working from home means no commuting, but the nearest village store and post office is over 3 miles from here. We aren't on a bus route and there are no taxis. However, a friend had loaned me her bike and this will now give me the impetus to attempt to cycle. It will also give me the kickstart I need to pursue a car-sharing project for our tiny street, although it manly comprises of semi-vacant holiday homes. But nevertheless, I am finding it rather exciting thinking of all the preparations that need to be in place before winter proper reaches our corner of Scotland. The re-payment meter will definitely need to go, as there's no sure-fire way of reaching the post office in a hurry in the event of another 'key' failure. Perhaps the recent one was sent as a pre-warning, reminding me that it's sometimes better to release the stubbornness handbrake and pay to go with the flow. (But I'm still loath to pay Scottish POwer £60 to remove a meter I never asked for in the first place!) OK, less of the doom and gloom, let's get on to the good stuff.  Without having a car, I'll save on road tax, insurance, garage bills, fuel bills and further reduce the carbon footprint of the Frugaldom household. That is excellent! It will free up and estimated £150 every month, which soon mounts up towards renovation work. It will also encourage me to get out there and walk more, perhaps even affording me the luxury of real walking boots! On the subject of boots, and carbon footpints, our local council is showing signs of edging closer to recycling, planning the introduction of 5 new bins in 2014 (but still no green waste bin). Instead, we will gain individual, smaller bins for:cardboard paper food waste (outdoor bin) glass, plastics and metals food waste (indoor caddy)  In addition to the above, they already offer subsidised compost bins, of which I have two, and a brand new entry this year is their introduction of subsidised wormeries. (Info can be found at www.getcomposting.co.uk) Being of a frugal extremist nature, I had to do a price comparison and ask about for other suppliers and recommendation... and that brought results! I'll need to write a second post today, again, because the exploits of what happened next are rather fun but a little long to include here. Back soon, Frugaldom PS: Second post of the day is a much happier state of affairs, I promise! :)"},
{"title": "A Look Back Over the Frugal Years", "date": "Tuesday 27 November 2012", "text": "2013 is LOOMING LARGE! I can't believe how quickly time is marching on and that we're a mere four days from December 2012! Preparing for 2013 seems a bit 'pie in the sky', yet here we are... pies, shortbread, clootie dumplings and anything else you can think of begging to be baked or boiled!Everyone's talking in Christmas-speak, Yule-speak and winter festivities-speak, so it's high time that I got to work on the new Frugaldom moneymaking challenge, before drifting off into fluffy-cloud-land to dream of Santa, roaring log fires, hot chocolate and marshmallows.As most people know, a frugal lifestyle allows little in the budget for anything outside the cost of living, especially while trying to renovate an 1805 cottage that sucks every breath of warmth from you as soon as you walk in the door. 'Sausage dog' draught excluders, fleece curtain linings, winter woolies and extra quilts are all at the ready, having been rudely awakened from their summer slumbers. But that won't halt the ever-increasing cost of living. No way.Beating inflation is about staying ahead of the game and, for those of us who are self-employed, that means one of two things... increasing the income or reducing the overheads. Well my overheads are as close to zero as I can possibly bring them without imposing hypothermia or malnutrition on anyone who ventures near, so that leaves income. Frugal living means frugal working, so another new challenge has been launched for 2013. We've been doing these for years. Nobody has ever got rich yet, but they are such immense fun that it would be sad to stop trying now.The premise is that you 'invest' a fixed amount, say £10, and then work towards growing your money to show profit. This year, I invested in some egg cartons and began selling frugal gourmet quail eggs. A fellow frugaler developed her skills in making jewellery items, while another bought fabric and sold cushion-sized squares. It's amazing how much fun you can have with £10 but, for 2013, we are upping the stakes to a whopping £50! The challenge launched recently during Gobal Entrepreneurship Week with one frugaler setting up a secondhand clothes business, catering for larger ladies, while another is looking into room rental. Me? I have set up 'Clan McGonk' as part of my long-standing eco-arts project.Eco-art is about creating one thing from another using, wherever possibe, what would otherwise be treated as surplus to requirement. With this in mind, I thought it would be rather fun to recap on some of the past challenges, products and ideas. For a start, it may tempt a few of you to consider joining our 2013 challengeMy garden logman bird feeder was built from off cuts left by the treefeller when a neighbour had a conifer felled in her garden last year.  'Cash cow', along with several other characters, was made from papier mache. We simply recycled old newspapers and turned them into banks - and all other forms of sealed pots - for yet another savings challenge.The pebble and shell 'pets', as you can easily see, were made from pebbles and shells. (I think that was the 2005/6 challenge - we've been doing this for some time.) With investment made into tiny 'googly eyes', they, in turn, began finding their way onto everything! We sold some really, really crazy items via eBid.Does anyone remember any of the other recycled items that Frugaldom produced over the years? What about the famous 'willitfit'? The wooden postal measuring slots were made from offcuts salvaged from a local picture framer. I got all manner of offcuts, mostly thin hardboard of the type used to back prints for framing. Those were great days! The smaller pieces of wood were turned into wooden savings 'bricks' and the bits sliced from the postal slots were made into keyrings. A small investment was made into the rings and hoops for creating the keychains. And then, along came the offcuts from plywood - how fantastic was that? Free plywood and a friend with a fancy shmancy cutting tool that meant we could draw shapes, then he could cut them accordingly.All manner of creatures appeared on the doorstep, as we turned them into hand-painted planters.Perhaps the days of larger free offcuts will return, but the recession is surely here to stay - nobody wants to part with free wood nowadays, not when it can go on a stove to help fend off the cold and boil a kettle for a cuppa. So, it's time to move on and attempt to make something from whatever people are finding themselves getting rid of to the bin man. Pity I can't recycle plastics. Hmm...To hand, I have old clothing, household textiles and shredded paper! With this in mind, plus the fact that sis had the job of creating furry toys for tombola stall prizes, she gave me the idea of how I could adapt a previous project (1999, so few if any of you will remember it!) to bring it online and into production.My 2013 Frugaleur Challenge is to make recycled furry friends, otherwise known as my clan of McGonks! The initial start-up capital will be invested in such things as website creation, felt, fur, ribbon, little pompoms, big googly eyes and any variety of sewing and replenishing the sewing box with toymaking related items. (I love homemade Christmas presents, don't you?) At the moment, I am unravelling an old jumper to free up some wool for knitting little scarves and crocheting mini-blankets, but I still need to source chunky knitting needles and a crochet hook - soon it will be gonks galore! During a previous challenge - shell & pebble pets - I managed to grow my investment enough to invest in a lovely new glue gun, so that will help somewhere along the way. During the wood craze, I afforded to invest in a pyrography iron and I already have an office shredder, so that will help make the stuffing! Eco-arts, eco-gonks, eco-fun, who needs a Furby?!I'm really excited about getting my new frugaleur project off the ground, having already invested in domain names for the new website and dusted down many of the files containing the photos and exploits of my previous character.Not only will Clan McGonk exist, it will also have its own series of mini ebooks and a selection of collectable furry friends from which to choose. You'll can follow the stories online, take part and generally have some frugal fun. There's even a McGonks page ready to be developed on Facebook - how cool (and free) is that? Now that I come to think about it, perhaps I shouldn't have give away the sewing machine, afterall! I'm going to have to stitch up these furry little critturs by hand.If you would like to take part in the 2013 challenge, check out the site at www.frugaleur.com and let's get making, baking, creating and crafting for the new year. It's frugal fun all round and we are always interested in trading with like-minded others.Frugaldom."},
{"title": "Frugal, Festive 'Champers'", "date": "Saturday 24 November 2012", "text": "Frugal, Festive Fruit or Flower 'Champagne' A special blog post about cheap plonk, for 'THEO THE RANDY' and 'TEAM PUGH'. It's not too late to make some for Christmas, if you have surplus fruit available. Elderflower fizz & clootie dumplingHow to make the frugaldom 'champagne' is something I learned while spending time on a tiny island called Shapinsay, which is off the coast of mainland Orkney. It was some time ago, back in the 20th Century, so I can't remember when, only how. This friend (thank you, Emma) taught me the secrets of frugal gourmet wines, from red clover to rhubarb. So easy and so cheap to make. For this, I will always be grateful. For the clootie dumping recipe, that's thanks to my Gt, Gt Granny Kerr, the recipe for that can be found HERE and can also be found in the Frugaldom forum. SPARKLING RHUBARB 'CHAMPAGNE'  You can substitute rhubarb with whatever surplus non-citrus fruit/edible flowers you have: brambles, red clover, honeysuckle, elderflowers, but don't add a full kilo of flower heads. (I wonder if nasturtiums would work?) INGREDIENTS1kg chopped fruit 1kg white sugar - reduce according to how sweet the fruit is, I've used half this in past.1/2 cup vinegar (I used cider vinegar) 1 sliced lemon 5 litres boiling water Thoroughly clean and sterilise your bucket. Pour in the boiling water, lemons and sugar, stir to dissolve. Add the chopped rhubarb. (I just top it, tail it and wash it, I don't peel it, as the red skins make pink champagne.)  Stir the contents of the bucket, cover and leave to stand in a cool, dark place. I give the contents a stir every day for about 5 days, then strain off all the fruit through muslin, cotton or fine net before bottling in glass bottles with secure caps. When straining the fruit from the liquid, I cut the centre out of the lid of the bucket and used that to clip the cotton in place. The buckets with lids are easy to come by - just ask anyone who's bodybuilding and they'll have plenty of whey shake buckets to rehome. Whatever colour fruit or flowers you use will dictate the colour of the resulting liquid. This batch was a result of a mixture of green and red stem rhubarb, but it paled to pink when done. Clip top bottles are great if you can salvage any, but ordinary glass bottles with sloping sides and screw caps work equally well.  Now, I'll also admit to baking the strained rhubarb into crumbles after straining it from the liquid! Zero waste! From the ingredients stated, I can bottle 5 litres of liquid. ﻿﻿This wine (it's naturally fermenting as time passes) does get a champagne-like fizz fairly quickly, so it's best to check the bottles and caps frequently.  The end result, as seen here, is ready for drinking within a couple of weeks of bottling, so there's still time to get a Christmas 2012 batch made. CHEERS!Storage-wise, I have managed to successfully keep this from one year to the next... other than the year it froze solid and burst the bottles.  Oh! And there was also the jet-propelled pink champagne rocket episode, which included a small explosion as a result of my testing out 2 litre fizzy drinks bottles.  If storing it for longer (or in plastic bottles, as suggested elsewhere), don't forget to check the bottles & caps every so often. They WILL explode, just like my 4 bottles of blackberry 'champagne' fizz, they took off like rockets!   Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},

And today, it's shame on you Bank of Scotland!We all accept that the days of free banking are all but gone, interest rates are at an all time low here in UK (unless you have debt, in which case the lenders seem to be coining it in!) and the country is having to bail out financial institutions left, right and centre. Who knows where it will all end? It certainly won't be anywhere pretty!So, what's annoying this frugaler? That's simple! I can't believe the bank is distributing separate invoices for monthly charges! No doubt, it will have somethng to do with Government legislatio sonewhere along the line but come on, get a grip on the economics of this folly!I operate a business account, I get charged transaction fees. There's usually only one or two per month - transferring my pittance to cover the cost of living and National Insurance etc. This month was no different - 35p in charges. (The frugal way is to have as few transactions as possible, merge them if you can.) As expected, the 35p showed on my monthly statement. At this point, it should be noted that I had always opted for paper free, hoping to help save a tree and the bank, but they seem to have withdrawn this option! Statements have been arriving the old-fashioned way, in printed format through the mail. There's an envelope, a couple of sheets of printed paper (and we all know how much ink or toner costs nowadays), the time taken to process the mail and the price of 1st Class postage  - 60p? They mail out thousands, so it's business post, which is slightly cheaper, but still... even at half that plus cost of everything else, my 35p bank charge just won't cover their costs. I am costing them money that they cannot afford to lose!But hold on, what's this that's just arrived? Another envelope, another sheet of printed paper and another postal payment... telling me about the exact same 35p by way of an \"Invoice\".Dumbfounded!Is it just me, or does this strike anyone else as being downright stupid, especially during times of alleged austerity, quantitative easing and financial melt-downs?Frugaldom"},
{"title": "It's Almost a Frugal Kitchen", "date": "Saturday 17 November 2012", "text": "Units of Measure Well, that was an experience and a half!  After measuring absolutely every available millimetre to ensure the view from the new kitchen sink would be through the middle of the window, things seemed to be going well - adequate space either side, nice view of the garden... Disconnecting the old sink had been relatively straightforward, barring the drips and accidental spills, and removing the worktop out onto the patio was painless. Building the unit - not that I did that myself - was simple enough, then all we'd to do was slot in the sink, connect the taps and attach the waste pipe. And that, my frugal friends, is where the fun really begins! Aside from that, spacial perception just isn't my 'thing'. Having a kitchen that appears to have been built more for housing livestock than for cooking family meals means that the floor is concrete and slightly sloping. When these houses were originally built in c1805, there were no water mains - there were wells in a couple of the gardens. Laying in water pipes would have meant digging through the stone or concrete floors and then feeding that water from the point of entry to the newly introduced taps and indoor toilets via exposed pipes, because they couldn't sink them into solid stone walls. So, you get the basic idea - solid walls, slightly sloping floors to compensate for no drainage systems and pipes that run along the edges of kitchens and bathrooms. Having opted for DIY flat pack kitchen units, we had overlooked one important point - adjustable legs! These units have solid panels from top to bottom, probably designed for building onto perfectly level, modern floors surrounded by even walls that hide pipework behind them. Solution? A sharp saw remedied the pipes problem, we just cut holes in the wood and sat the units over the pipework. Fitting the pipework so there's water runs through the taps and waste runs out to the drains, this was trickier. In fact, at one point I ended up trapped inside the sink unit! Having climbed in to reach the pipes behind it, I'd forgotten that the hinges for the doors had already been fitted (but not the doors). How might this trap an individual beneath a sink, you might ask? Well, those pesky hinge attachments love nothing more than to grab your hair in the passing and hang on in there, knowing fine well there's insufficient space for the unsuspecting frugaler to turn and stretch to free one's self! It was very lucky that I wasn't home alone and that help was at hand... once they'd overcome a bout of hee hawing and laughing! All five units have now been constructed and it's amazing how good they look, despite not being fitted and not being safe to sit an egg on and leave it unattended. I am, however, finding it a little difficult to site stuff exactly where I want it, owing to something else I didn't full think through... electrical socket placement! I opted to have several extra sockets included during the wiring, but I never did specify exactly where. Now I see why I should have paid much more attention to such a seemingly trivial detail! We live and we learn. Hopefully, the frugaldom exploits will serve to remind others of the importance of getting even the simplest sounding jobs right from the start. It really does matter exactly where you place things like sockets, light switches, cooker cables and pipes. It also helps if you know where the wooden straps behind the new plasterboard are, for the purposes of hanging stuff securely in future. I haven't even risked hanging the clock back up on the wall, yet! Now, on a completely different topic, I need to prepare for the 2013 Frugaleur Challenge and get ready to try to earn some extra income. If you haven't already heard or read about it, the challenge details can be found at www.frugaleur.com It's another money challenge, based on the premise that we can start a frugal buiness with no more than £50. It's the continuing attempts at becoming a frugal entrepreneur! Frugaldomwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "Twice in One Day!", "date": "Friday 16 November 2012", "text": "That's Right! Another Blog Post! Chaos in the Frugaldom kitchen continues. It isn't an easy job for two individuals with little or no previous DIY skills to rip out a kitchen sink and replace it. For a start, we have minimal tools with which to work and barely an ounce of strength between us - despite my affection for cakes, biscuits and almost all things carbohydrate.You may mock, you may laugh, you may point at the puddles on the floor and the drips running down the pipes, but the old sink is now out and the new bendy attachment things screwed onto the water pipes, which we did remember to switch off before dismantling the sink. See? I now have a lovely sink unit on my patio! Looking at it from this angle, the old sink and worktop isn't in all that bad a condition. In fact, despite the rusted clips, bumps and bashes and leaky tap,  I'm going to find it a nice, frugal, new home. I have just the place for it - or will have in the future!  So far, I haven't dared to voice my thoughts on where the old sink might be going, because I haven't divulged my secret wish to renovate the old chicken house into a garden room, complete with bird hide! Yes... I can see a few eyebrows raising at that announcement. :) So here we are, mid afternoon on a Friday with no sink in the kitchen, but the new sink unit built and awaiting fitting once we've had a coffee. (If you do decide to DIY on the whole kitchen front, don't forget to fill the kettle before switching off and draining the water pipes.) The next part should be fun... attempting to cut spaces in the back of the unit so it sits flush against the wall and allows all the pipework to be hidden.  But while doing the above, or rather observing it being done, I shall be immersed in thoughts of small miracles aiding and abeiting garden fairies to magically transfor the ancient chicken house into a pretty, frugaler-friendly garden room of joy, complete with sink for rinsing the home grown produce before bringing it indoors for prepping and storing. Why do I just know that few others are going to appreciate my vision or share my enthusiasm for operation shed-rescue among the trees, by the stream at the bottom of our garden? FrugaldomHow to Create a Frugal Kitchen It wasn't a pretty site, that's for sure! But this was the kitchen in Thrift Cottage when work began last year.  It's been 17 months since we moved into the house - 17 long months with a mixture of a delapidated kitchen, a building site when the roof, floors and walls were being replaced, a chaotic dusty mess while the plasterboard was joint-filled and then sanded down, and then the fun and excitement at the arrival of some units!  All semblance of frugal cooking had fallen by the wayside and the initial 2012 budget of £1,000 for all food and groceries was recently blown. I'd to juggle the funds - again - and allocate another £100, deducting it from the fuel/utilities or some other such extravagance. Despite having one less mouth to feed and having notched up the budget by another £100, it's still fading fast! But do I care? Not a jot! We have running water, electricity and a dry roof over our heads. We also have porridge, soup and pudding... what more could a body ask? The sheepswool insulation in the kitchen ceiling and walls is working well; no more sub-zero temperatures in the kitchen when it's freezing outside. Indeed, I splashed out almost £20 on a 425w mini oil-filled radiator and that is the extent of the heating in the 'new' kitchen! I bought one for there and one for upstairs, figuring out that even if the pair of these and the existing 800w heater ended up on full pelt during winter at any point, 22p per hour of luxurious extra heat wouldn't break the bank.  On the subject of electricity, we've all been informed of the next price increase being forced upon us by the energy companies. I'm already paying what I consider to be over the odds on accounts of there being a pre-payment meter here, but it's down to principles! I refuse to pay out £60 for an engineer to remove and replace said meter when we didn't request it in the first place.I refuse to pay £150 deposit for installation of a new meter on the grounds that I've been a customer for many, many years and don't owe them a penny.I dislike bills, so can't really grumble about being charged a few pennies extra for the priviledge of not receiving one!When the new Smart Meters get introduced, as per Government legislation, they'll need to remove this old meter anyway, so I'm not paying through the nose twice!Oops! But I digress... get back into the kitchen! Fitted kitchens look fab! I have looked through so many brochures and websites, drooling at the graphic images of contoured units, colour co-ordinated 'white' goods, a rainbow of amazing tones and shades of wood, laminate and high gloss worktops... you get the picture! And all for \"only\" x thousands of pounds, payable with 0% interest over x number of months or years... Hmm! I think not. Only one thing sprang to mind! FLATPACKS! Online to the wonderful world of Argos and I find some cabinets complete with doors, handles, hinges, shelves and worktops... so I ordered three to begin with: 1 x 500mm, 2 x 1000mm. It also meant I didn't need to pay delivery for the mini-radiators, which I ordered at the same time. Two packages duly arrived - the two radiators, I assumed. But I opened these up and the two turned out to be FOUR! Could I get through on the phoneline or find an easy way of emailing for help? No! Best wait and query it with the driver when he returns to deliver the kitchen cabinets. In the mean time, I ordered the sink unit, a smaller side unit and a stainless steel sink, complete with taps and fittings. Invoice stated delivery would be the following. Kitchen cabinets duly arrive... 6 boxes all at once! Curiouser and curouser! I picked the delivery driver's brains but signed for the goods anyway - he couldn't take returns and his answer to any duplication was keep an eye on my bank account just in case I was double-charged! The kitchen cabinets are fab! But they had sent double!  I checked PayPal, which I'd used to pay, but nothing untoward there. I tried to call the helpline again - it told me that \"owing to unforeseen circumstances, my call could not be taken\" and then disconnected me! In despair, I signed into my Twitter account and was pleased to find the company on there! I'll tell you, it is utterly AMAZING how quickly they call you if you dare to suggest any wrong doings on a public forum!  This saga is still on-going and, worse still, they charged me a second time for the unordered goods! But I digress again.... get back into the kitchen! The sink unit arrived after the first 3 units had been constructed. By this time, Argos had been and collected the extra radiators and units, but there's no signs of any refund on my card, yet! (I still cannot work out how they accessed my credit card when I paid via PayPal!)  Anyhow, back in the kitchem where I rightfully belong at the moment! My old cooker will suffice (for now) and I'm still loath to part with the salvaged units, so they are still here. Once again, they have been moved into the kitchen and partially hidden by their flowery curtains.  Today, we are going to attempt to fit the new sink without flooding the house and, all going well, I may have a basic kitchen for this weekend. Plastering of walls and ceilings has been by-passed by way of taping, filling and sanding the plasterboard joints. Decorating, for now, has been by-passed by way of the leftover white and magnolia emulsion paint we had from freshening up the last house before leaving it. Flooring has yet to be considered, although there are a couple of carpet off-cuts in place, so we aren't walking on the bare wood. Shelving or wall units can wait for now, as I still have my assorted trolleys and stands. In total, I think I have spent around 10% of the cheapest quote received from kitchen companies. There is much still to do so, for now, Im going to help chop off the makeshift wooden legs that are holding up the old kitchen sink. I'm sure there'll be a tale to tell about the fitting of the new one but, hopefully, it won't be a watery one! (I'll use the old wooden legs/props as fire kindling.) Frugaldom!"},
{"title": "Frugal Living, Inflation and Recycling", "date": "Tuesday 13 November 2012", "text": "Can Frugal Living Beat Inflation? As reported by the BBC (and many others) today, \"The UK's inflation rate rose sharply last month following an increase in tuition fees and food prices.\"  The current rate of inflation is said to be 2.7%, with the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which includes housing costs - rising to 3.2% But I am not even going to pretent that I understand these convoluted figures. Complicated calculations may be something I do occasionally enjoy but I can't equate certain items as being essential when working out my own basic cost of living. I did, however, take the time to ask if shrinking pack sizes were taken into consideration in the Government numbercrunching and, you'll be pleased to know, THEY ARE! Of course, based on individual item costs versus diminishing quantities, the rate of inflation on some goods is many, many times that stated. I mean, look at the price of cheap minced beef. The pack sizes have not only reduced to 400g but the prices have increased by as much as 25% in some cases. Even tins of corned beef might be beyond the most frugal of grocery budgets nowadays!Another thing that really bugs me about all these shrinking pack sizes is that we are being driven headlong into a waste not, want not spiral that's going the completely wrong way! Rather than companies reducing their packaging, which they do appear to be trying to do, they are now forcing us into buying twice as much, because one single pack no longer feeds the household! This matters not a jot if you are buying your fruit, veg and fresh produce loose, but onthe whole, disposal of packaging remains a major problem - unless we simply pass the problem on to the Government by binning everything and then wonder why services need cut to cope with the increased costs.We now need to get even more creative with our grocery buying, batch cooking and recycling. What can we do with all these extra plastic cartons while, at the same time, trying to shop for bargains and buy sufficient quantities to feed the family? Well, one thing I am now doing is keeping each carton I buy - why should I have to pay for something that's discarded straight into the bin?As soon as the contents have been prepared, it's a simple case of refilling the original container for storing the food in the freezer. (Additional point of interest - keep mushrooms dry and wipe or brush them clean, rather than peel them or wash them. You get more out of the pack.)These containers work well for most things except onions, as they aren't strong enough to seal and prevent the smell leaching through into your freezer.A word of caution on storing food in recycled cartonss - always, always, always wash and sterilise the empty containers before refilling them and don't pour hot food into them, as most are so flimsy that they'd probably melt.By reducing our food waste, reusing anything we can and recycling everything that can possibly be recyclyed, we can, in actual fact, get creative enough to beat our own household inflation.www.frugaldom.comwww.frugaleur.com"},
{"title": "Moneymaking Challenges", "date": "Saturday 10 November 2012", "text": "2013 Frugaleur Challenge12th - 18th November is Global Entrepreneurship Week so this is a good week to launch our new challenge.With just over 7 weeks remaining of 2012 I decided it was time to start planning ahead and setting some new challenges for 2013. Times are getting hard, income is at an all time low and spending at an all time high, so I need to look especially hard at redressing this balance before things get out of hand. OK, I've no rent or mortgage to pay now but the truth is, there wouldn't be enough income to cover rent if it had to be paid! Something, somewhere, just isn't adding up correctly. Prices are escalating on everything while the Government has allowed an extra £75 BILLION of new money to be pumped into the system, diluting the value of the pound as it goes. They don't seem to reflect this devaluation when they spout off inflation figures, so we're left wondering how much our pound is going to be worth by the time we reach retirement age, especially if we fail to generate sufficient income to make up all these shortfalls. It's scary stuff! Fired up with enthusiasm, I set to work dusting down old projects that had to be shelved in the past for a variety of reasons, mainly personal circumstances and finances. I began the relaunch of www.scottishwebdirectory.com and hope to gradually fill the pages with everything Scottish and I'm equally hopeful of incorporating a few affiliate links that may cover the costs of running the project, plus earn a bit extra. We're talking pennies here, not pounds... even if the site only generates 35p profit each day, that's enough to cover the cost of annual Class 2 National Insurance Contributions. Of course, it doesn't help when so few people actually want to be linked to a free directory - this part has me baffled! I don't understand why people wouldn't want even a tiny bit of extra promotion for their own businesses, especially when it is offered free. (Comments regarding this peculiar state of affairs are very welcome.) Next up, I need to plan ahead for the frugal living and frugal working challenges that are conducted through the Frugaldom forums. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it? Nobody actually needs the forum, few read it and even fewer post on it. It's a bit like blogging - there's no real purpose to it other than sharing parts of your daily routine and lifestyle with a handful of strangers in the hope that it entertans, amuses, enlightens or even helps them in some small way. Money isn't the be all and end all of this life. Which brings me back to income. Love or loath money, we all need it, but it isn't always easy to find the enthusiasm, determination or even the confidence to launch yourself headlong into a new business venture or land yourself a well-paid job that you love doing. That's why the frugal working challenges are kept low budget, in an attempt to make them affordable to all.  Just as we have frugal living challenges, so, too, we have frugal working challenges, based on the pricipal that anyone can be a entrepreneurs, even when following a frugal lifestyle. Anyone can set themselves up a frugal micro-business with very little cash outlay. Indeed, the 2012 challenge had a maximum start-up budget of just £10. Succeeding in turning a profit and generating a significant income seems to be down to some sort of single-mindedness that tells you to keep going, against all odds. To this end, I'd like to remind you that Sir Richard Branson began his enterprising rise to fame and fortune off the back of, I think, £3 he borrowed from his mum back around 1966. This, he used to pay for the printing of his first 'magazine'. Opportunities to become a frugal entrepreneur, or fugaleur, as I now call them, are all around us, we simply need to grasp the opportunities as soon as we spot them. Had someone set aside £3 back in 1966, their money would now be worth just under £50 (plus whatever interest accrued) so that's the starting figure for the all new 2013 Frugaleur Challenge. If you would like to 'play along', you'll find details at www.frugaleur.com along with a link to the relevant section of the Frugaldom forums. Could 2013 be YOUR year?"},
{"title": "The Alpha and Omega of Consumerism", "date": "Tuesday 6 November 2012", "text": "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, but I NEED a Kitchen! Sometimes, no matter how hard we try, we just have to buy something new. If nobody ever did, the world would be a very, very sad place, indeed. For a start, there would be no jobs for anyone because we were all making do, mending and producing/growing our own. I applaude those who have the wherewithal to oil the wheels of industry on a daily basis, but they are the opposite extreme from us frugalers. One might go as far as suggest that we can't live without one another - it's like the alpha and omega of consumerism. We help reduce their carbon footprints and lower the national averages across many spectrums, and I certainly don't mean intelligence! The spending habits of some simply beggar belief! For many, buying new isn't an option. This may not necessarily be down to a lack of finances, it is possible that it's entirely down to a lifestyle choice. Given the freedom of choice and limitless cash reserves, I'd have a completely eco-friendly, warm, self-sustainable home with the capability to generate its own renewable energy , a permacultured garden that produced sufficient food to sustain the household and a readily available source of good firewood, coppiced annually from my own woodland. This, however, is not the real world of frugal living, or at least not as far as Frugaldom is concerned. Indeed, few I know can afford such luxuries. Back in the real word, differentiating between needs and wants has never been so focused! I need a basic kitchen for food storage, meal preparation and cleaning up (dishes, laundry etc).I want a spacious, well-laid out, solid wood, cosy, all singing, all dancing, farmhouse style kitchen complete with solid-fuel range, separate utility room and laundry etc, etc, etc... you get the dream scenario picture. Kitchen Creation Goes Into Full Swing! It's been 17 months since we moved into Thrift Cottage and our second Christmas here is looming on the horizon. This Christmas, however, we'll be watertight and have properly fitting windows, and hopefully a kitchen... The relevant room is about 8' x 15' and now contains the two salvaged kitchen units ( single and a double, both without doors), a piece of salvaged worktop and the basic essential white goods and appliances. No amount of asking has resulted in being offered any old kitchen units, although a frugaler friend offered a selection of wooden doors. (Thanks, JB.) There were hopes for saving the old kitchen sink here, but close inspection dictates otherwise - it's badly rusted on the underside, the clips have corroded, the wrong mixer tap has been fitted and it doesn't have correctly fitting waste pipes, so it all needs replacing. With this in mind, when you see a bargain, you need to act fast. He who hesistates is lost in the bargain buying stakes, that's for sure! Having spotted my prey - a herd of unsuspecting flatpack kitchen cabinets, complete with doors, handles and worktops - I pounced. Success! There's even a new kitchen sink among my recent catches and the first of the cabinets have arrived - from Argos! Flatpacks are now being put together and, instead of costing an estimated £4,000 to have a new kitchen delivered and fitted, I should be able to complete this entire project for about one fifth of that amount and be happy with the end result. A kitchen is a basic necessity and it's one that is needed on a daily basis, practically every day of our lives. I feel it was the frugal thing to do in purchasing some fresh, clean new units. The salvaged units without doors have the curtains from previous kitchen hanging across them and I do have the missing knob off the cooker - it was simply removed to remind me of which ring doesn't work. I spied my 'ideal' cooker, in lieu of the solid-fuel range that I'd have loved, but, at around £899, it's price tag is less than tempting. Besides, I've still the flooring, window dressings, tiling and painting to do! For now, we have the last of the magnolia trade paint on the walls and 3 boxes of rehomed tiles waiting to go along the back wall to provide a splashback. Believe it or not, the above is all very exciting in the world of frugaldom. There's a deep sense of satisfaction comes from each challenge successfully met, regardless of how small that challenge might be to others. To find out more about any of the associated frugal living or working challenges being planned for 2013, join us online at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org where you can take part in the conversations, share your own hints and tips or just enjoy being with like-minded individuals who think striving for debt and mortgage free living while reducing, reusing and recycling are the right things to do. It isn't self-imposed poverty, it's a means to an end and a lifestyle most of us grow to love, regardless of bank balances."},
{"title": "What's Cooking in the Frugaldom Kitchen?", "date": "Thursday 1 November 2012", "text": "It's Frugal Soup and Pudding Weather. This week's fresh chicken got split into roast dinner, sweet and sour, stir fry and then stock for soup. The chicken cost just under £5, (they were reduced to only £2.48 per kilo) and provided us with six individual meals plus enough meat left over for adding on top of pizza. (We love spicy chicken pizza.) The catering facilities at Thrift Clottage are still slightly restricted (to say the least) and the plumber was working in the hall today, refitting the radiator, so it was very much a case of minimal food preparation space. As I had cooked the chicken on a wire rack in a roasting pan, there was very little fat left on it by the time the remains went into the slow cooker with about 3 litres of water. I didn't add the chicken skin, resulting in very little grease in the resulting stock. I simmered it for about 4 hours before straining off the liquid and returning it to the slow cooker. To the stock, I added a teaspoonful of salt, a good pinch of herbs and 2 small onions from the garden, finely diced. This was kept simmering for a further half hour then I added in about 100g of dried spaghetti, broken into small pieces.  Calculating the cost of making the soup, the chicken carcase is classed as free - we've already had 6 individual meals from it. Electricity is averaged at 15p per kilowat hour (it's slightly less than that, but prices are increasing soon, so this should cover those changes) and my slow cooker is rated as 300w on low setting, which works out at about 4.5p per hour. In total, the soup took 5 hours to make from scratch and produced just over 2 litres, which is equivalent to about 5 tins of shop bought soup. Cost to cook - 22.5p maximumCost of ingredients:Teaspoonful of salt - 0.5pA good pinch of mixed herbs - 1p100g spaghetti (Asda Smartprice) - 8p maximum2 small onions (mine were from garden) - 10p (at a guess)Total cost of soup to make it from scratch = 42p to produce enough for close to 10 servings. At less than 5p per serving, homemade soup is one of the most frugal foods you can possibly make. Loading it up with vegetables, grains and/or pulses makes it thoroughly nutritious and, even if it doubles the cost, it's still a very cheap meal at 10p per person.  I love soup and pudding meals during the winter months, they sit well with the porridge breakfasts. Today's chosen pudding was semolina served with a spoonful of homemade bramble jelly. We're real pigs in this household, so a pint of milk makes enough for only two servings. I use UHT skimmed for cooking - it's available for 49p per litre according to online store prices, but it's 55p per litre in my nearest store. I don't need to remind anyone who reads this forum that we've just had our wild berry picking season here in Scotland, so jam stocks should be high. I haven't been able to make any at all this year but still have plenty of jars left over from previous jam and jelly-making sessions, plus plenty of berries in the freezer awaiting the completion of the new kitchen. (Not too long now!) Don't forget that we have daily updates on all the frugal challenges on the free forum site at http://www.frugaldom.myfreeforum.org where you are welcome to join us at any time."},
{"title": "Frugal Fun, Freebies, Frugaleurs and Friends", "date": "Friday 26 October 2012", "text": "Frugal Fun, Freebies, Frugaleurs and FriendsThis past week has been interesting, as it has brought several visitors, freebies and frugal fun to the fore. As some of you may know, social media is one of my passtimes, participating in various chats, discussions, challenges and promotions. It's frugal fun, mainly because its free! It's also where we're gathering togetger all the frugaleurs that we can, in an effort to show others that starting a small business needn't mean running it indefinitely as such. A Frugal entrepreneur loves their work and, although money isn't the first thing on their minds, it's an added benefit if it all comes together and reaps rich rewards. Anyhow, my first lovely freebie of the week has been a copy of A Book About Innocent: Our Story and Some Things We've Learned. Along with this, I received £12 worth of Innocent Drinks vouchers, so I shall, at long last, be able to try the drinks for myself (assuming the local stores accept the vouchers).  Having been awarded the free copy, I asked that the founders of this very successful, multi-million pound empire each sign the book. It took a bit of time to get all three signatures but these guys obliged! How much more of a recommendation do you need for a company when its founders will take the time to show such a courtesy to little old me? I'll let you know what I think of the book (and the drinks) soon.Meanwhile, I have received a sachet of freshly ground coffee from CafeDirect and am eager to try this out, just as soon as I can get at the box where the new coffee maker (a half price bargain from Aldi) is stored.I've had a lovely week of catching up with friends, neighbours, fellow frugalers and local entrepreneurs, sampling their fine produce and enjoying the chit chat. Trading potential for 2013 is looking good, with more and more of these small businesses springing up in the area. Sarah at Creeside Charcuterie is eagerly awaiting the launch of her new website to further promote all her lovely homemade artisan foods. I sampled the 'Rustic Pork Terrine' and was suitably impressed. It was a rare luxury teat for us here in Thrift Cottage, I can tell you! Feel free to follow @CreesideLife if you have a Twitter account, then you'll know what's available, where and when Sarah's website goes live.Not content with snacking on luxury pork terrine, I am now snacking on chilli jam... with everything! A fellow frugaleur who lives nearby has a passion for growing chilli peppers and is starting her own homebased enterprise making chilli jam - something I had never previously tried. I've now discovered that the chilli jam tastes great on hot toasted Aberdeen Butteries! And with oatcakes, cheese, pizza, chips, stir fry, fajitas... you get the picture. I think I have just found a frugal substitute for chutney, sweet chilli sauce, salsa and relish!Now that the colder weather has arrived (having seen photos of the snow falling in Aberdeenshire) it is time to take a serious look at the cost of winter and what plans we are putting in place to combat the cold and beat the budget. Keeping warm has to be a priority and, with the price of gas and eletricity climbing again, the whole 'heating or eating' debate rears its ugly head for those of us trying to live on a tight budget while saving for rainy days and future security. What is your top priority? I think mine is currently to keep the log store full and the home fires burning, while hoping to have some sort of a kitchen in time to batch cook and bake the festive goodies. The one good thing about all these years of frugal living is that it has finally afforded to put a secure roof over our heads, we just need to keep warm, dry and fed now. (Beats having a bad landlord anyday!) NYK Media (Frugaldom) has been running costcutting and moneysaving challenges since 1998, which means 2013 is the 15th anniversary! That has to mean something special... so let's start preparing for a great year of frugal living, frugal enterprise and the beginnings of bigger and better challenges.  Don't bin it, burn it or bury it if you can reduce, reuse or recycle it. Self-sustainability at home and in the workplace isn't just a pipedream, so lets make 2013 our best year ever. Join Frugaldom to share your highs and lows, hints, tips, news, views and reviews of frugal living, frugal working and life on a shoestring budget. See you in the Frugaldom forums. Before ending, I'd like to pass on my congratulations to a fellow frugaler and blogger who has been part of our challenges for several years - here's to freedom from the mortgage, that gorgeous cottage is yours forever! CONGRATULATIONS AND WELL DONE TO MR & MRS SFT!"},
{"title": "Autumnal Updates", "date": "Thursday 25 October 2012", "text": "Autumn Update from FrugaldomIt may be late October but the garden isn't 'done' for the year, not yet. IN fact, it's far from it - I still have a profusion of flowers - nasturtiums, begonias, heather and alliums, to name but a few. The days are shortening, night's are lengthening, temperature's dropping and leaves are falling, but there's still some sunshine about the place. I've been amazed at how warm it still gets in the little plastic greenhouse, so rather enjoyed doing the bit of tidying and weeding when I went to clear out all the tomatoes last weekend. But then I changed my mind! They simply weren't ready for clearing.We all know what we're meant to do with tomato plants - keep the side and top shoots nipped out to promote growth into the half dozen (maximum) vines of flowers/fruits while keeping them fed and watered. I set out to nip buds faithfully as soon as I spotted them on my plants, but then things went awry again, with family crises that took me away from home. The plants went a bit wild and have received no extra feeding at all. But guess what? This year has produced the best crop of tomatoes I have ever grown! Kilos and kilos of the things have been picked over the past couple of months and I am still picking them. There are side shoots and new vines replacing the old ones as I strip them of tomatoes. Even my fancy 'black' tomatoes are doing exceptionally well.All of these photographs were taken today, 25th October 2012, and show the condition my tomato vines are in after stripping them of all their dead or dying leaves at the weekend. Each time I pick the tomatoes, another shoot appears, more flowers grow and that, of course, is followed by more tomatoes! It's amazing. One plant in particular - a cherry tomato - ended up looking like a weeping willow decorated in little red baubles. I have picked dozens and dozens of small tomatoes from this 'tree' and still it continues to grow and produce. The 'black' tomatoes are also still doing well, although the revived grape vine managed to climb up through and it is now needing some attention. These dark , cherry tomatoes are a sweet variety, so very nice, although a little strange looking, with salad. Regardless of how late it is in the year, the vines are still producing more flowers and we still have some bees buzzing about the place. It's all very unusual, but not as unusual as the tadpoles that were spotted recently, swimming about in the pond at the nearby Logan Botanic Gardens! Elsewhere in the Frugaldom garden, the herbs are still doing amazingly well, with bundles of mint being picked for pots indoors and all the begonias adding an extra splash of colour outdoors. In the ericaceous bed, where I planted the new blueberry bushes, heather is still in full bloom, adding a good dash of purple to the reds and oranges of autumn. I also have lavender still flowering in pots along the top of the 'bug hotel'.  It's been a strange year for gardening, what with the early months of hot sunshine followed by prolonged damp periods, to sudden deluges that have seen our little stream erupt in torrents, rising higher than the foot bridge and completely cutting off the hen run from the main garden. Thankfully, we opted to incorporate drainage from the duck pond, so there have been no flood problems there, so far. Spots of colour are still visible around the entire garden. The temperature reached an astounding 21C through the week in the direct sunshine, so the hanging baskets are holding out a little longer. I'm not giving up hope of growing something through the winter, even if it's just salad leaves. On the subject of growing over winter - has anyone else noticed FLOWERS on their strawberry plants? I have runners sprouting out all ways, waiting to be potted, but I've also spotted flowers on some of the plants. Most peculiar! Indoors is progressing slowly but surely and I'm hopeful of having a frugal kitchen (of sorts) within the next week or two. No preserves got made this year at all, but I do have a lovely stock of raspberries, blackcurrants, rhubarb and gooseberries in the freezer and should be OK for lemon curd making, if I continue freezing any surplus eggs. (Egg-laying has diminished to no more than a couple of eggs every other day.) Sadly, there has been no fruit from the mini orchard, but we weren't expecting much after transplanting all the young trees during the move here last year. I may take a trip to a friend's orchard this weekend and see if they have any to spare.I hope you are all doing well with whatever frugal challenges you opted for this year and I sincerely hope that some of you will continue by joining for 2013.

{"title": "More Cookie Dough", "date": "Sunday 7 October 2012", "text": "A BISCUIT BAKING DAYNot to be completey scuppered whilst living without a kitchen, I do still have access to my old cooker and the sink, so cooking hasn't been completely stopped - only batch cooking and baking, preserving and pastry or pasta making have had to temporarily cease. But we can't possibly do without biscuits! Being a firm fan of websites like Approved Food and Food Bargains, I have always got a good stock of tinned butter and an assortment of flours, but my last order comprised of almost 25kg of sunflower and sesame seed bread flour, as I simply couldn't resist the bulk offer. I had assumed this to be bread mix, but it turned out to be gluten free flour with seeds, no yeast added. Surprisingly, it has been a bit of a bonus, despite my initial disappointment. \"Why?\" I hear some ask... It's flour! And the basic ingredients needed for frugal biscuit making are flour and butter or margarine, mixed with whatever else you have available. Today I tried using this gluten free bread flour to bake some cookies and they turned out just fine - and frugal. With the tinned butter costing only 33p per 400g tin, I have no qualms about experimenting with baking - nothing has been wasted. So, I melted some of the butter, added the last of an old jar of honey, ladeled in some of the sesame and sunflower seed flour and then added in a scoop of oats, extra sesame seeds and some wheatgerm for good measure. To this, I blended in an egg. Would you believe... it turned into cookie dough! *Please note that for the purposes of keeping this recipe completely gluten free, omit the wheatgerm and porridge oats, substituting with sultanas, raisins or whatever else you like.  Within half an hour of starting, I had two trays of biscuits and the spare cookie dough wrapped and put into the fridge for baking next time the oven's hot.  The fantastic thing about baking frugal biscuits is that you can add absolutely anything to them - nuts, dried fruit, chocolate, syrup or treacle, peanut butter... the list goes on and is governed only by your imagination. Almost any flour available will bake you biscuits of some description and you have full control of what gets added.  For biscuit and shortbread making, you can find some of our frugal recipes in the forum at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org plus you can follow @Frugaldom on Twitter so you can share the news from other frugalers and from some of the artists, writers, makers and crafters who are joining us in the Scottish Web Directory project (free advertising for Scottish based homeworkers and small businesses) for 2013. If you are on Facebook, check out the Scottish Web Directory page and hit 'like' if you like. Until next time,Frugaldom.WINTER PREPARATIONSWith the approach of winter and the long, dark nights, anyone who keeps hens, ducks or quail will be all too aware of the fact that the egg laying diminishes to a virtual standstill, so it's time to make the most of whatever is available before we have no daily supply.Normally, I'd have access to a proper kitchen to enable me to bake plenty of quiche, make lemon & lime curd and have a stock of meringues, assorted cakes and biscuits in store. However, Thrift Cottage doesn't, yet, have a kitchen, so some alternative storage methods have had to be employed for winter food supplies.Egg storage is all quite new to me, as where we previously lived enabled me to sell any surplus, but making them last all year round was never given a thought - we simply did without them and made the most of whatever had been cooked up and popped into the freezer beforehand. Now,having read up on it, there seems to be no reason why we shouldn't freeze the eggs for defrosting and cooking when required. So that's what I'm in the process of doing.Using a silicone muffin tray, I am cracking one duck egg into each section and then open freezing them. It's still at experimentation level for me, as I don't know how these will cook once defrosted, but the freezing seems to be working alright, allowing me to pop out each egg once it's done. They are curious looking 'cakes', that's for sure!These frozen duck eggs are being bagged up and sealed, so they can be easily accessed individually, depending on how many are called for at any given time. Biscuit baking calls for only one at a time, so this seemed like the obvious solution to a winter egg shortage problem - we can at least have biscuits, cakes, pasta and quiche. That's the plan - I'll update you once I've got to the stage of needing to use any of them. I reckon the sections in the muffin tray will hold either one duck egg, 2 hen eggs or at least 4 quail eggs each. If anyone else already does this, please get in contact and let me know if there's anything special I should know before defrosting and cooking these. In the meantime, wish me luck in my endeavours to keep a supply of garden dwelling poultry produced eggs going until spring, when the birds will, hopefully, all start laying again. Join us in the Frugaldom Forums at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org if you are interested in participating in any of our 2013 moneysaving challenges. Frugal living and frugal working can work and it needn't mean doing without anything, assuming you concentrate on becoming debt free as your first priority. It's also a great way of finding new hints and tip about cost-cutting and reducing your spending, none more so than at home. You can also follow @Frugaldom on Twitter. Gve me a shout out if you spot Frugaldom anywhere else and have fun preparing for winter and the start of 2013."},
{"title": "Autumn 2012", "date": "Friday 5 October 2012", "text": "Autumn 2012 Has ArrivedI'm not sure where all the time goes but I am sure that it goes somewhere! Frugaldom has been rather quiet, barring all the renovation works that are slowly, but surely, going on around us.  Now that October has arrived, we've had a sharp reminder to prepare for winter. The above photo was taken at sunset, looking out across Luce Bay towards the Rhins of Galloway. This is the inspiration for the colour scheme in the kitchen, just as soon as we get around to creating one. The option to buy a brand new, fitted kitchen has been removed and, instead, I'll be makng do with whatever I have available and adding a few units as and when possible. A lovely frugal friend has kindly offered us some solid wood doors, so these will be collected soon. The arrival of the first frosts was duly marked and a renewed attempt made to get the garden under control. This year certainly hasn't been the best for growing much of anything, apart from herbs and, surprisingly, tomatoes! But the time has come to begin serious preparations for winter, so that's what life is going to be all about in this frugal household - in the hope that we can get the heating sorted out before the onset of winter. The little pot-belly stove is still sitting boxed, ony slightly closer to being installed than it was the day I bought it. And there's still no kitchen, so frugal grocery shopping has been severely hampered by lack of choice in these rural parts. Proper cooking has been off the cards for many months now, so the grocery budget has taken the brunt of that. Food, electricity, telephone line rental, fuel, logs, coal and anything else you like to mention seems to be increasing in price at an alarming rate, but still we plough on with the challenge of living on £4,000 or less for the year. I'm guessing that as soon as the kitchen is done, I'll be hoping that batch cooked meals can incorporate all these herbs that are taking over the garden. I even have bunches of herbs indoors in vases, as per the photo at the top of this post! Have to say that this is proving to be far superior to any room freshener, costs nothing to replenish and has the added bonus that some of the herbs root whilst sitting in the water. I fear I may find myself living within a field of mint by Spring 2013! So, indoors is chaos, but what of the frugal microholding? Well, the delapidated outbuilding has now been transformed into a suitable workspace for 2013, providing a bright and airy 'studio' for all the eco-art projects we have planned.  One part of the old building simply wasn't worth saving, so it has been cleared away to make space for the log store and an area specifically for chopping wood. In the shed, we now have a lovely sawbench, donated by a frugal friend. It has been put to excellent use, sawing and chopping all the old wood that was removed from the outbuilding and from indoors during the strip-out of the rear of the house. This is proving to be ideal for burning on the open fire and soon warms the radiators and heats a tank of hot water. Luxury!Back on the eco-renovation front, we're trying hard to reuse whatever we can. Can anyone remember the lovely tiles I found when clearing out the rotten hall floor? Well, you'll be pleased to know that the original hall paving remained intact after we lifted out all that old flooring. It lay hidden beneath the layers of plastic, wood, cement, vinyl and carpet.  Over the past couple of weeks, the entire hallway has been lifted, dug down, raised, backfilled, damproofed and those ancient tiles are in the process of being relaid. I know this may seem a little extreme to some and that it may have been cheaper to simply have covered over the whole lot with new wood, but have you seen the price of decent hall carpet? Added to the fact that the restored 1800s floor will become a main feature, there's the fact that I'm saving a small fortune on not having to carpet it! The ducks, hens and quail are all still laying well, so eggs are still commonplace meals in the Frugaldom household. Souffle omlettes are cooked up at every opportunity and there's been lemon drizzle cake aplenty throughout the summer. In fact, I think it's time to make another batch while I still have the use of the old cooker. (It's misbehaving more and more, so the current 'big' savings challenge is to invest in a shiny new one, by way of compensation for not installing a brand new kitchen. But I'll still be waiting for the very best deal and making sure I get cashback!)  My latest frugal-craft project is the unravelling of two old cardigans in the hope that I can knit up some wooly cushion covers, but the recent temperature drop is making me think more along the lines of knitting a wee blanket for over my knees while sitting at the computer! I'm also planning on knitting some nice deep pockets for my favourite cardigan and doing a repair job on it, as I am loath to throw it out - it's so long and so warm, jst what I need during the cold winter months. Preparations for winter are now fully underway: Summer clothes folded and packed away, winter attire now at the ready. Kindling sticks being chopped and stockpiled daily. Big bag of candle wax sat nearby to aid in kindling. Saw bench and axe in daily use.Insulation being added wherever possible in the house.Matches, candles, firelighters, rechargeable torch at the readyCoal bunker filledGarden produce prepped and into the freezer whenever possible.Enough preserves in store to last until next yearAll that remains now is to kit out a kitchen, get the bathroom and cloakroom completed, finish restoring the paving in the hall, plasterboard the hall and stairway, build a cupboard and install the logburner. Hmm... I somehow cannot see all that being done before the end of 2012, certainly not on a frugal budget. But never mind - this winter we have a solid, insulated roof over the back of the house, that's progress! That's it for now, but don't forget you can follow @frugaldom on Twitter and join us in the free forums at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org anytime.  If you are Scottish based, work from home or have a small business and a genuine interest in keeping costs down, join us in the new Scottish Web Directory (www.scottishwebdirectory.com) for some free advertising and promotion.

{"title": "Frugal Living - A Means to an End", "date": "Monday 20 August 2012", "text": "WHY DO WE DO IT?﻿ BECAUSE WE CAN!﻿ Eco-renovation - it's a titanic task﻿﻿Almost a month has passed since my last post, what with one thing and another happening within the family (RIP 'Wee Jean' 08/08/1918 - 29/07/2012) and various other circumstances beyond my control.It's now time to get back on the frugal path to put this place in order, even if that path does appear very long and winding at times. I freely admit to occasionally stopping and wondering if it will all be worthwhile, but I also freely admit to saying a positive 'YES', it will be worth it!My cousin volunteered to pose for this photo during one of our recent adventures and I thought it very apt for this post. :)Work has restarted, once again. Once completed, the outbuilding will provide the much-needed space to allow work indoors to resume. I may even have a kitchen by the end of this year!﻿ The (soon to be) studio.﻿ The 'studio' is beginning to look good now that all the old wood and blocks have been replaced. We salvaged the old back door that was removed from the house plus half a dozen of the windows that were lying about the garden when we arrived here. There are still two more windows to be completed but the frames are in and all that's needed is for the glass to be fitted - this we have had to buy. (We got a really good deal from a local double glazing company who had spares lying in their yard.) One day soon, we'll have a studio workshop right on our back doorstep and working from home will become even more enjoyable. As the year progresses, we're having our fair share of sunshine, even managing to don the shorts and visit the beach a few times to enjoy a splash about with the grand children. This, however, reminds me of how unfit and over weight I havew become, so it is time to address this problem in a much more serious way. Afterall, we have the best gym in the world right outside our doors and anyone is free to use it at any time! The great outdoors can offer anything you want from a short walk to the post box to some high-powered aerobics, assuming you have the enthusiasm to just do it! Frugal living should never leave you needing, even if you have to create your own imaginery outdoor gym.An eco-renovation doesn't come cheap if we're looking at eco-friendly building products but a frugal eco-renovation is about making things affordable. Whether it means cutting back on unneccessary expense so you can afford the right materials or recycling what is already available to you, it is still good! Ensuring you are fit enough to enjoy and appreciate all the years of scrimping, saving and hard work that goes into a renovation project has to feature strongly in your plans if you expect to reap the long term benefits. So I am making a new start RIGHT NOW!GET FITTER, NOT FATTER (Pedometer cost 99p inc P&P via eBay.) I often hear or read of people trying their best to get fit and lose weight by spending ridiculous amounts of money on low fat and/or high protein foods, joining local gyms and/or 'investing' in fitness equipment. I have to admit to having thought about these things myself in the past, especially as my son is a fitness fanatic and into all sorts of weight training. I have now cast aside those thoughts and am lookingg at the whole picture - the old joints have taken some serious punishment over the years, what with various falls, bumps, sprains, strains and fractures (mainly horse-related) and it has been quarter of a century since I weighed what I would like to weigh. That's 25 years of careless living that has slowly increased my weight and decreased my fitness. I certainly don't plan on taking another 25 years to redress this balance, but I do understand that it will be a long and arduous task, one that cannot be supplemented by unneccessary spending, dieting fads and paying to be told how to do it. The process needs to fit in time-wise and weather-wise with frugal living, earning an income and renovating a home!I hope nobody minds if I post about my exploits during this frugal 'Get Fitter, Not Fatter' challenge, but I set it up online so long ago that even I am beginning to think of it as a bit of a joke. The following items are what some people see as essentials to their fitness regimes: rowing machinetreadmillexercise bikelocal swimming poolweightsThe following are what I have right here, right now:This is my Rowing Machine. OK, so my rowing machine comes in the form of a small rowing boat moored at the edge of the nearby loch, but look at the spectacular views it offers and look at the space for sharing with friends, taking a healthy lunch and, if we so desired, trying our hands at fly-fishing. I haven't done the fishing bit, as that entails purchasing a permit that allows us to fish - not frugal - but rowing around Elrig loch is a brilliant way to get some easy exercise whilst communing with nature.This is my Treadmill. The frugal treadmill will keep going for miles and miles, as the roads, lanes and tracks criss-cross the countryside. The whole point of spending years scrimping and saving is to afford to live debtfree somewhere we want to be, a place of our own that we can call home. If you can't see the possibilities of doing something like this on your own, then consider finding someone with shared ambitions. You'd be amazed at how many people jump at the chance to quit the rat race and follow their dreams as crafters, writers, artists or even for the simple choice of working their own hours in order to make the most of everything else life has to offer. Chaos is acceptable, no matter what others may think, if it is en route to realising your dreams.The Exercise Bike (cycling) Almost everyone knows someone with a bicycle tucked away in a shed, forgotten, unused or surplus to requirement. Well, I borrowed one from a friend this summer. What with one thing and another, I haven't even managed out on it once, but there are no real excuses. They say that you never forget how to ride a bike... I'll put that theory to the test just as soon as my knees have agreed to bend and straighten in one smooth rotational action while synchronising with upper body balance and an ability to steer.The Poolside - Living in a rural location means there's not really much call for such things as gyms or leisure centres with indoor heated swimming pools. Living within walking distance of the coast, however, offers all sorts of possibilities. Wild swimming can be done pretty much anywhere you find that's safe and clean enough for you to take the plunge. A friend has invested in a wet suit so she isn't completely restricted to only the hottest days of the year, swimming in several of the lochs that can be found within the region - her particular favourites are all within the Galloway Forest Park. I prefer the sea, as the thought of pike swimming below me puts me off even dipping a toe into any of our nearby lochs. As yet, I have not swum in the sea, only paddled.Weights - Who needs dumbells when there are millions of rocks lying around the place? One local here power walks while carrying a rock in each hand, raising them and lowering them in step with his pace of walking. I'm sure this must provide an extra element of aerobic exercise and will be setting him well on his way to achieving his optimum heart rate.My first challenge is to gather enough rocks to equate to the amount of excess weight I am already carrying. Granted, it won't come close to Stonehenge, but I'm sure it will amount to a tiny cairn, at least. That's the tale of Frugaldom thus far - the indoor renovation works ground to a halt months ago, the weeds always seem to be winning the war in the garden, the greenhouse is still standing and producing some lovely tomatoes, I'm cooking courgettes in almost everything - bread and cakes alike - the derelict outbuilding should have a new lease of life as a studio within the next couple of weeks and I'm about to embark on a much healthier lifestyle, even if it takes me forever.How could anyone not want to live this life? It's certainly never boring! This post is also dedicated to all friends, family and other residents of Garlieston in the wake of recent events, the facts of which have been twisted out of recognition by certain newspapers that chose to feed the general public with outright lies! I would appeal to anyone who has read such garbage to cast it aside and never sink to the depths of allowing it to cloud their judgement on our wonderful area!Regular updates relating to frugal living can be found in our forums at http://frugaldom.myfreeforum.org Feel free to join us online anytime and invite your friends to do similar."},
{"title": "Some Summer Updates from Frugaldom", "date": "Monday 23 July 2012", "text": "Life in FrugaldomThere has been so much happening in the garden that work indoors has ended up on the backburner again! End result is, we still don't have a kitchen but we have a whole host of critturs, beasties and birds visiting the wildlife garden and, in return, not an awful lot by way of homegrown vegetables.The strawberries did incredibly well and we're now onto blackcurrants and raspberries. I think I've picked a sufficient quantity of blackcurrants to make enough jam to last us until next year, but have had to freeze the berries pending further work on what will, eventually, be reinstated as my kitchen.Last week, I picked the first cabbage, but there are few surviving the constant slug attacks. The slugs are out of control at the moment, so I really need better defences and a clear division made between the vegetable plots and the rest of the garden. This permaculture lark is all fine and good, communing with nature and encouraging wildlife, but it's very time consuming and slow to cultivate.The herb spiral, on the other hand, has come on in leaps and bounds, producing a profusion of herbs, strawberries and water cress in the tiny 'pondlet' at the bottom of it. Since building this one, I have now completed a second, circular bed adjacent to it, which has been planted with more herbs and flowers. The herb spiral is a garden feature that I can highly recommend, I'm really impressed by how well everything grows in it.My next project was 'the logman'. Late last year, a neighbour had a conifer felled and gave us all the wood, so it had been stacked at the bottom of the garden for some time. To be honest, it isn't the best type of wood for burning on an open fire, so this led me to thinking up a novel idea of what to do with the logs - I built a raised bed shaped roughly like a boat and have planted blueberry bushes and heather in it. At the 'helm', I used the final log to make a bird table and named him 'the logman'. He's very popular with the birds, I have to admit, and his lantern can be lit on summer nights, so he's become quite a feature in the Frugaldom garden. His face is made from bottle tops and a twig, with some more twigs secured around the edge of the slice of log that serves as the bird table. Again, I am really pleased at how this turned out and even more impressed by the number and variety of birds that frequent 'him' on a daily basis.The good weather continued here despite tales of flash floods and high tides elsewhere, so it seemed like a good idea to make a start on creating the long awaited 'bug hotel'. Some readers may remember I was able to get a wrought iron hanging rail from someone on Freecycle a few years back and this was originally converted into a vegetable growing rack. This year, however, it became the basis for the new bug hotel. I was inspired to begin this project after reading about 'Bugingham Palace', so set about creating my own, frugal version. The Frugaldom bug hotel was completed last week and even includes a homemade bee house, which was made using the hollow stems pruned from the Himalayan Honeysuckle at the bottom of the garden. Again, I am quite proud of the end result, finishing it all off with a butterfly house that I found for half price in Aldi. £3.49 seemed like a small price to pay when everything else used was free. I have now made a start on the bottle garden, but it's only in the early stages, so nothing much worth discussing just yet. But what about the whole homeworking/microholding/self-sustainability 'thing'?, I hear you ask. Well, while the weather has been good, we have taken the opportunity to invest some of the savings into renovating the old outbuilding, which will then provide us with safe, dry storage space and work-space by way of a garden room, otherwise known as our eco-arts studio.This is what the building looked like when we first bought the property. It was a derelict disaster zone, to say the least. It took us months to clear away all the rubbish that completely filled it and surrounded it, then there were all those broken windows to sort out before they fell on anyone.The serious work began on this project about three weeks ago, but it has proven to be a far bigger job than first anticipated. For a start, the roof and two full walls - those not shown in the photos - have had to be removed and replaced to make the building safe. In order to do this, we had to disconnect the electrics, (I could hardly believe there were live wires in there in the first place!)which will need to be fully replaced at some point. We are now at the stage of needing to find a door and new windows to replace the old ones, so I've been busy scouring the area for anything that might fit. Hopefully, one of the glazing companies from the nearest town may have some old ones available at a cheap enough price to warrant moving them and making them fit the gaps. In the meantime, the old concrete blocks have had a coat of whitewash to brighten them up a bit and there's someone out there right now sorting out the floor and replacing all the wood. Exciting times ahead and everyones' fingers are crossed that the sunshine will return soon so we can complete the renovation. Only then will we tackle the completion of the kitchen.For anyone interested in life in and around our area, I have set up a Facebook page that is now home to all the photographs of the surrounding area, along with progress photos taken of the wildlife garden, so please feel free to visit and 'like' the page, that way you can be kept bang up to date with garden progress in our tiny corner of southwest Scotland.The Frugaldom forums are also still fairly busy for anyone who would like to take part in any of the frugal living challenges.Hoping not to leave if for so long next time and looking forward to making the most of this summer's staycation. There's so much to see and do when you're trying not to spend, so wildlife, nature and the 'make do and mend' activities are all being well served, as are free events being attended.www.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "Frugaldom Updates", "date": "Tuesday 26 June 2012", "text": "﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ APOLOGIES FIRST AND FOREMOSTI must apologise profusely for an absense of posts recently and will resort to the excuse that we've had a few ups and downs here in Frugaldom. Fortunately, they haven't been enough to halt proceedings in the garden, but I've been doing extra hours creating a new Facebook page for the future microholding and eco-arts project, so that has taken up a fair bit of time.Kitchen work stopped almost 6 weeks ago and we haven't seen the joiner since, so no further progress in that department. It now means that the renovation of the outbuilding has started before the kitchen is finished - something I had certainly not wanted happening, as I just knew it was going to cause a few problems.Lady luck hasn't been shining on me recently, although nothing tragic has occured in comparison to the woes of others. Firstly, the joiner going AWOL hasn't helped, as it means we are still without a kitchen. Fortunately, he fitted a door to the bathroom before disappearing! Then, within the space of 48 hours, I fell all my length, I dropped my new (bought with Buddy Points) camera into a rock pool, my beloved 'Floppity' rabbit suddenly died (she's now buried at the bottom of the garden) and our out-building work is proving to be far more than first expected.The outbuilding refurbishment was primarily to make the building safe and then go from there - transforming it into a working space in the garden with a nice new logstore attached. But it has almost turned into a complete rebuild, owing to how rotten the timbers, main wall, windows and roof are, so costs could run into the thousands. Work is progressing well in that area, it's just a bit untidy out on the patio, we've lost all use of the building while work progresses and costs are escalating by the day. This, in turn, could start eating into the house repair funds.I guess it's only money... it's much better spent making the place safe than on anything else. We have a wind and watertight roof over our heads in the house, we have electricity and we have water, so I am grateful for all of that. ﻿ My log man bird table﻿ We have made some good progress in the garden, what with all the dry weather we've had here in our tiny corner of southwest Scotland. Unlike elsewhere in the UK, we have missed out on continial winds and rain, so there has been no flooding or storm damage. Indeed, the worst damage suffered here was when all the tomato seedlings got scorched to death in the blazing sun last month.﻿﻿ Remember the neighbour's conifer tree that had to be felled? I have used the logs from that to build an ericaceous bed that is now home to irises, heather, my log man bird table (see picture above) and I have been rash and treated myself to 3 blueberry bushes and a small magnolia, courtesy of the fantastic Thompson & Morgan special offers. EXCELLENT!In addition to this, Frugaldom now has a recycled greenhouse, made from the plastic from a friend's old greenhouse, wood stripped from pallets and my one concession - some extra timber to make the structure secure. It now has a slab path, potting bench and tools, tomatoes, cucumbers, my grape vine and an assortment of seedlings in it, plus it's set close to the new bird table, so the feathered visitors are now quite comfortable about feeding there while I'm in the greenhouse.That's about it for now - so much to tell you all but have run out of time again - just been called for coffee on the patio so we can discuss the on-going plans for this outbuilding. Have to admit that I'm a little bit excited about the prosepcts of it being done for the summer but my heart sinks every time I look at the catastrophe that was just beginning to look like a partio until last week. I promise to return soon and update with more photos - back to using the old camera but it's the same memory card, so no photos lost. I'd have been mader, still, at that.Frugaldom"},
{"title": "How to create a spiral garden, part 2", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2012", "text": "Frugaldom's Herb SpiralIn part 1, we'd got as far as creating a pretty, spiral looking garden that, other than the general shape, didn't really resemble anything shown in permaculture books or on the websites, so we had to improvise and frugalise our herb spiral, enabling us to complete it on a budget of zero.The following is the pictorial guide to how we got the project off the ground, so to speak.STEP 1 - CHEAT!As you can see, our herb garden has suddenly grown upwards in the centre and the spiral now has a fairly steep incline, hopefully making it entirely suitable for the purpose of drainage. This feat was achieved by raking all the soil from the centre back out to the edges and then piling logs and rocks into the middle, to create a platform for the top of the spiral. You could use straw, rubble or anything else, I guess.The rocks are the essential ingredient here, as it is those that will store the heat from the sun and bring added warmth to your soil.STEP 2Once again, from the top... Fill the spiral path with soil and pile up whatever rocks you can find to create that much higher looking wall of heat absorbers. We had to dig a couple of barrows of soil from elsewhere in the garden just to achieve this much but all the extra rocks that came with it helped fill in gaps, which then get packed on both sides with the soil.STEP 3This spiral path means you have an 'empty' gap at the bottom of your horticultural helter skelter, which is where we are supposed to focus on collecting the run off water from heavy rain. I have seen some very pretty, artistically designed mini ponds built here, as displayed on many of the permaculture websites. But this is Frugaldom, we need frugal alternatives that won't cost us our hard-earned cash. STEP 4 - CHEAT!I simply rounded off the end of my spiral with more rocks and then dug a hole approximately 30cm in diameter and about 10cm deep. This worked perfectly for the base cut from a 5kg / 5L plastic bucket. Any type bucket will do, as long as it's cleaned properly to free it from any traces of paint, for example. I filled my 'pond liner' with a layer of gravel, soil and then a little compost, then began planting my herbs.STEP 5There is a natural way of planting out your herb spiral. As it has planting space facing in all directions and graduating from fairly dry (at the top) to almost a pond at the bottom, you have plenty of choices. Rosemary is my top of the hill plant, then they graduate down the slope with thyme, basil, parsley, chives, coriander/cilantro and then the assorted mints, which like a fair bit of moisture. In between these, I have planted the surplus strawberry plants from last year's runners, along with a few marigolds. In the mini-pond at the bottom of my spiral, I am going to sow water cress seeds, something I have never tried before now. My herb spiral is far from full, with plenty of space for cuttings and any 'reduced' potted herbs I might find. I would love some lemon thyme, but can't seem to find any at the moment, but I have seeds sown for more coriander, chives, basil and parsley. It's quite exciting waiting for everything to grow and spread, as I think this is a lovely feature in the Frugaldom garden, even if it does look like a cairn when viewed from my kitchen window! :) Many years ago, these spirals were often refered to as medicine gardens, where healers (some would call them witches) grew all types of herbs and spices for their medicinal lotions and potions. Usually found near the back door for quick access during cooking, to ensure only the freshest of ingredients get used, I am sure there is much still to be learned from what can be grown within a specific space, especially when attention is paid to companion planting and which direction each plant faces. It's amazing how nature will soon dictate how well, or how badly, I have positioned the first of my plants.Have fun creating your own spiral gardens. They needn't necessarily be used for herbs, they would make beautiful fruit gardens, vegetable gardens or flower gardens. Plenty of scope, too, as the loose formation of the basic building blocks means gaps could be filled with heathers, alpines, mosses or grasses, depending on what you have chosen to grow. For me, it will be herbs galore, as soon as I grow some more.Frugaldom"},
{"title": "How to create a spiral garden, part 1", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2012", "text": "Frugaldom's Herb SpiralThe idea of having a spiral herb garden was introduced when reading about permaculture and, more recently, discussing the garden with a friend who had done the permaculture course.Microholding fits nicely with the theories of permaculture, as we want low maintenance and high productivity, but with plenty of nooks and crannies for encouraging wildlife to visit our garden. It also lends itself quite well to frugal living and a level of self-sufficiency.The following is a step-by-step pictorial guide to how we created our first herb spiral. It isn't quite 2 metres in diameter, as the stick I used to mark it out was only 3' long.STEP 1Armed with two sticks, one measuring about 3' (or a metre) in length and then find yourself a fairly level patch of ground. Keep the 3'/1m stick for measuring and push the other one into the ground to mark the centre point of your circle. It is then a simple process to lean the second stick across the ground perpendicular to the upright one and gradually work your way around, marking the outer edge of your circle as you go. I scraped out the outer edge and wedged stones into the groove.STEP 2As soon as you have your circle, you can do one of two things, depending on where you have sited your new garden: you can either cover the whole area in thick cardboard and then fill it with soil or you can dig out the weeds, gravel and grass to get at the earth underneath, which is what I chose to do. This choice was mainly on accounts of not having a budget for such things as top soil.STEP 3Our ground is very rocky, so digging up the surface of my circle uncovered plenty more stones, all of which were being set aside for later use.The main reason I was happy to dig to the earth rather than use cardboard was that it would instantly give me a little more depth, rather than the metre height these spirals are supposed to be.STEP 4After a couple of hours of scraping, weeding, digging and raking out more stones, I was left with a fairly accurate circle. At this point, I was looking at a template on a permaculture site, one which made it look really simple. Let me tell you, it is not simple trying to create a metre high, geometrically correct, artistic spiral while working with practically no soil and only stones and rocks found lying around the garden. Some slight changes had to be introduced to compensate for not buying nice, uniform blocks or an extra ton of fresh top soil!STEP 5Raking what soil I had from the edges into the centre of the circle, it was a case of replacing the smaller stones with larger rocks, gradually creating and following a contour upwards, while raking more and more of the earth up the spiral path until it was heaped in the centre.As you can plainly see, the centre of this is about one third of the height it is meant to be, according to the recommendations of the 'proper' permaculture gurus.STEP 6The whole idea of the spiral is that it starts at its highest point and winds downwards, creating a natural flow for excess surface water and excellent drainage.No amount of raking this was going to raise it to a metre high, that was for sure! Meanwhile, H was busy digging elsewhere, trying to salvage some extra soil to pile in, but it certainly wasn't looking anything like the one in the diagram. Still, it looked quite pretty.By this point, it was beginning to get dark and I had forgotten about making any dinner. The chickens and ducks had got fed up waiting and had all put themselves to bed! Moral of this story is that if you want your spiral created quickly, then starting it late afternoon probably isn't the best of ideas. We had to down tools and leave it for another day.Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Solving the problem of holes in concrete", "date": "Wednesday 16 May 2012", "text": "A FRUGAL PATIO GARDENThe area we have designated as our patio had one glaring problem - a massive, hideous gap in the concrete that flooded during heavy rain. Solving the flooding problem was a must, but digging up the concrete to install a new drain of some description wasn't an option I was prepared to even consider incorporating into the frugal budget, so here's what I did.﻿ The day we moved into the cottage﻿ This is what I refer to, very loosely, as our patio. It's a concreted area outside the back door that stretches for about 10 metres. It's ideal for parking planters, junk, log store, bins and coal bunkers, but it had the problem of a huge gap in the middle, which I quickly filled with gravel in an effort to make it less hideous.It didn't take too long to clear out all the junk, most of which was recycleable in some way, shape or form, so we have had the use of this patio area for sitting out during dry weather. On numerous occasions, we've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner out there, as it's often warmer outside than in, especially during the sunny winter and spring days. It's an absolute suntrap, so all the tubs and fishboxes got moved along the south facing wall and used for sowing seeds. But the problem remained - a muckle great hole that was both unsightly and a bit of a 'tripping-up' point when carrying stuff about the place.This is the ghastly 'hole' filled with gravel raked from elsewhere to prevent anyone falling into it. At its widest and longest points, it's about a metre wide and about 3 metres long. Last month, I began raking out the stones in the hope of finding concrete beneath it but, instead, found rocky soil! Instant appeal, as I'd just found myself another little patch of potentially productive growing space! Cue hand tools - a spade was useless as it was too rocky.The soil I found underneath wasn't too bad, it certainly wasn't worth ignoring or covering in concrete - we can't eat concrete and no comments, please, about my rock buns! :)Raking about in the ever-increasing heap of junk that was being piled high in the garden, I found a length of plastic, possibly off an old waterpipe. That fitted nicely around the far end of the 'hole' and gave me a template from which to work. I'd to wedge it with rocks to stop it springing back out but it eventually stayed in place and allowed me to follow the line with my incessant digging. There were some pretty big rocks got dug out from here, I can tell you. Some were more like boulders, fit to be built into the dry stone wall that borders our garden.It took a full day of raking and digging to empty concrete canyon, but I saved the best of the soil for later use. Next stage was a simple progression, as I couldn't see any of the bird tables from the kitchen window. I movedone and placed in the middle ofthis new 'patio garden, separating my hole in the ground into two holes in the ground.Among all the rubbish that was here, we had salvaged several lengths of drain pipe, so a piece of that was incorporated along the edge in the hope that surplus surface water would be channeled off further from the seating area. The other reason, of course, was to provide some sheltered hiding place for the lizards, toads and frogs that frequent the back garden - this might tempt them out of the woodpile, for a start! We got plenty of rain for the next few days, so the pipe theory of sending the water away proved to be very effective. Keeping everything in place was a simple matter of strategically positioning the rocks that had been dug out of there.Next was what to plant. I had been reading about herb spirals on some of the permaculture newsletters and these sounded very interesting, although completely impractical, being 2 metres across when I had only a 1 metre near-circle, but I couldn't see any reason why I couldn't adapt the design to use up more of the rocks. So, my first spiral, or circulal, garden was born. I built it up in the middle by making a smaller circle with log slices, filled it with the recently removed soil then began transplanting some of last year's strawberry cuttings, along with some thyme and some lupins that needed splitting. I even treated the new garden to a sprinkling of compost! This is at the far end of the patio, so any surplus rain water shouldn't lie, it should, hopefully, keep these strawberries watered.Now for what to do with the other side, which flooded. It seemed simple to me... dig out a mini-pond! It would need to be ultra-frugal, as I had no pond liner and only what was lying about the place as materials, so more digging got done. I then laid some old fleece (previously used as curtain linings) along the bottom, taking the rough edges off the remaining rocks and stones.On top of the fleece, I laid several feed bags, from the poultry grain. Over the top of that, I laid a layer of bubblewrap (we NEVER through out bubblewrap) and then a large polythene bag that had been saved from the sheepwool insulation... this seemed to do the trick and looked water tight, so now it was time to try filling it up with water.I laid the drainpipe right to the edge of the mini-pond, so the rain water that pooled in that area could easily overflow the pond and run down into the circle garden. It took a variety of materials to hold down the plastic and I had the straight edge stepped up a little using a length of discarded wood. The ledge would hopefully help any critturs to safety if they inadvertently landed in the water.The little patio garden was coming along nicely, multi-tasking as a wildlife 'playpark', bird feeding station and some extra growing space.I kept adding bits and pieces that I found around the garden, surrounding it all in rocks, which we have plenty of here. I even transplanted several weeds from the side of the stream and sat the pots into the water on rocks. A square of plastic mesh got placed along the shallow end, allowing anything that climbs in the ability to climb back out again. Finally, a length of log, a baton of wood and two old steel hoops, possibly from a long forgotten cloche, were secured in place to hold the makeshift pondliner.The final result looks very effective, considering it had cost absolutely nothing to construct. However, the first time Floppity rabbit saw it, she spent most of her time munching on the strawberry plants, so a remedy had to be found for that! A quick search for 'companion planting' brought me to the conclusion that I needed something leafy, hardy and bunny friendly, so I have sown perpetual spinach around the outer edge of my circle. The area is currently out of bounds to rabbits until the spinach grows big enough to distract her from the strawberries! I hope it works!Since building this, I have now spent a hefty £8.29 on a solar fountain and we have been lucky enough to have had plenty of sun to keep it flowing.Within the space of a couple of weeks, the strawberries are flowering and the spinach has begun to sprout. There are now also radish seeds sown and I raked up some old pine needles and moss to mulch the plants to try to protect them from the frosts we are still getting.NYK MediaFrugaldomSpring has, hopefully, sprung!It's been a while since I last posted on here, so please accept my apologies. Over the past few weeks, work on the Frugaldom household kind of ground to a standstill for one reason or another but we are now back on track, joiners on site and we have also made a little more progress in the garden. Sadly, we lost one of our young ducks during the really cold weather but everything else seems to be thriving. We're now getting an egg a day from the remaining 4 ducks. My plan of having two trios didn't quite work out to plan, as Joey, our old drake, has adopted both Custard Cream and Oreo to his hareem, leaving poor Runty and Dunty as the odd-couple. Dunty, despite her slight defect, is laying us an egg every day and managing to keep up with the others.To be fair to our Scottish weather, we haven't had it too bad over the past couple of months. That is adequaetly reflected in my lack of posting here, as the garden has been taking over much of my time, lately. Seeds had to be sown, potatoes planted, veg patches dug, raised beds filled and I've even created a tiny pond and planting area on the patio. It saved having to go to the expense of filling in the big hole in the middle of the concrete and working out how to drain surface water when it rained heavily. The pond now has a solar powered fountain added to help aerate the water for whatever critturs might decide to take up residence. I've incorporated a length of plastic pipe and plenty of bark and boulders so there's cover for lizards, frogs and toads. Whether or not they will ever visit is another matter, as is making it childproof for any visitors bringing little ones - still to be done.I'm rather pleased with my mini-pond and adjoining crittur habitat. I used an old piece of plastic to shape the end then built it up into a tiered circular bed using rocks and logs. It is now home to some of last year's cuttings of strawberries, thyme and lupins, with the outside edge sown with perpetual spinach and radishes. The spinach, once it grows, should deter the rabbit from eating the strawberries, as she'll be too busy eating spinach - I hope!Seeds aplenty have been sown into pots and fish crates then covered over with panes of glass or polythene. Everything seems to be coming on alright but it's still far too cold here, despite last months occasional heatwave-like days, to transplant anything into the garden. This photo was taken last month, the strawberry plants are now all flowering and the fruit beginning to appear already.The icing on the cake, to date, has to be the completion of my herb spiral, as described by many articles on the subject of permaculture. Although we aren't following their 'rule book' too closely, a permanent, micro-agricultural garden is what we are aiming for by way of our microholding, so the theories fit well with what we are trying to do. I have already planted it up with herbs, marigolds and more strawberry plants, with only the basil having succumbed to the frost when I forgot to cover it with its bubblewrap hat.Further down the garden, the cane frames are being reconstructed for beans and peas, then there's new 'edging' going around the fruit beds. Empty wine bottles are being collected by all for the purposes of these new edgings, so no expense spared. Of course, it could take some time to collect enough bottles when we don't buy any! :)Indoors, work began last week to get the back of the house renovated fully, restoring it to a kitchen, cloakroom and shower room. We're back to the original stone walls what we think used to be stables and the joiners are hard at work fitting it all out for new ceilings, floors and stud walls, each section damp proofed, insulated using the sheeps wool and then lined with insulated/foil backed plasterboard. The concrete floors have been leveled (as best I could get them), a vapour barrier laid then insulated underlay with extra vapour barrier laid on top of that. Now the flooring is being fitted and should, hopefully, be completed by this weekend.In eager anticipation of starting on actual living space, I now have, in my possession, a brand new replacement for 'George', our pot belly stove in the previous house. He was such a handy little pig to have around the place, eating his way through any scraps of wood, sticks, logs or the ocassional shovel of coal for an extra blast of heat.  The new arrival has been named 'Wilbur'!We had a lengthy, in-depth conversation with frugal friends. They live off grid in their 'fixy up' and their recommendation was that we keep the open fire with the existing back boiler, radiators and hot water system, as it's all void during an electrical failure or power cut, which has happened several times since we moved here. Having a free-standing logburner as an extra source of heat and for occasional cooking will cost literally thousands of pounds less than replacing the entire open fire with a new solid fuel stove and boiler system connected to radiators, so we'll remove the crumbling old fireplace and replace it with something a little more secure and leave the existing back boiler to warm the radiators and hot water.I am awaiting the arrival of a 'knotty pine' door for the bathroom and hoping it arrives soon. It's all been a bit \"open plan\" during this phase of the work. Then again, the joiner still needs to make the wall and door surround that will hold said door in position, so that's probably what's to be done between now and the weekend.Plenty of phots have been uploaded, including step by step on creating the herb spiral in our frugal living forums. Feel free to visit."},
{"title": "Cheap Meals on £1 per Person per Day", "date": "Friday 2 March 2012", "text": "February Food Trial Triumph!﻿ Frugal Lasagne﻿It was decided that we had to analyse a few of the meal costs in order to ascertain if it is still possible to cover the costs of groceries on the sum total of £1 per person per day. Having stuck to this challenge for so long, I suspected that it had to be true, otherwise I'd have been failing in my challenge and, as you all know by now, failure cannot be an option. Spurred on by the ridiculous claims made by some recent television shows quoting families spending over £9,000 per year on food alone, it was easy to prove that my methods were sound. I had been invited to participate in one such show, but swiftly declined. I am most certainly NOT the type to go on TV, as anyone who knows me will agree.The unfortunate part of having chosen February to fully explain how this can be done was that my kitchen was being ripped out, so that took its toll on the final results. I was hoping for a result of less than 95p per person per day but, instead, got landed with 96.8p per person per day. The full breakdown of all meals and costs can be found HERE.The porridge post is a few pages back on this blog, so you can try making your own frugal breakfast for 9p per serving. Likewise, all of the soup recipes are included on here, so they will explain the 4p per portion, and the bread recipes will explain how I accounted for the cost of breadmaking.﻿ Ginger sponge﻿ Restricted access to the kitchen made things very difficult, juggling cooking, baking and food preparation with interupted power supplies, no worktops and, in the latter stages, no ready access to the food supplies, so it was very much a case of using what could be reached and/or prepared and heatd or cooked on the day. The slow cooker, microwave, breadmaker and electric steamer are certainly the most important items I have as far as the (non)kitchen is concerned, but I did manage to get some baking done so we weren't without cakes, sponge and biscuits.Not living near a supermarket can increase the pressure on a limited budget, which is why I'm trying to grow as much fruit and veg as possible. Moving here in June 2011 to a house with a patch of land that hadn't been touched in years meant lack of planting and growing time before autumn arrived. Home produce was limited but, all things considered, I think we did OK. We were a little short on eggs after the mink got in and killed some of the hens, but we still had quail eggs until the quail stopped laying. Now, what's left of the hens are back laying and pretty soon the ducks will be, too.﻿ Spring bulbs flowering﻿ Spring 2012 will soon be here, so preparations are underway to get the microholding project up and running. This, of course, still has to fit in with the full renovation of the house, which includs the completion of the kitchen. That's my primary goal, but if the sun happens to shine, priorities must lie outdoors, in an effort to produce as much basic foodstuffs as possible. ﻿ Herb garden﻿ In the meantime, I have crates and boxes piled throughout the house with enough bread flour, custard powder, semolina, hot chocolate, blancmange and cous cous to last us all year. The freezer is full with an assortment of stews, soups, vegetables and berries, plus the last of the garden onions hanging in the outbuilding. And to top all of that, the herb garden survived the winter, as did all the cuttings from the rosemary and thyme.Top tips for keeping the cost of meals down:Bulk buy your favourites whenever they're on offer.Make the most of long shelf life products bearing 'best before' dates, which can pretty much be ignored, because the the food contained within can last for years. I don't think sugar even carries a best before date. eg: Approved Food offers some great bulk bargains.Get stocked up on sugar before the jam making season is upon us once more.Cook everything from scratch in big batches.Grow some herbs, fruit and vegetables, even if it's nothing more than salad leaves in a tub.Learn to love porridge, soup and milk puddings.Waste nothing.So, the moral of this story is that in 2012, thirteen years after my very first grocery budget challenge, it IS still possible to feed a family based on a budget of £1 per person per day. Your 5-a-day may be a little erratic durig the mid-winter months but you more than make up for it during summer. Oh, and cranberry sauce makes a lovely topping for semolina once all the Christmas turkey has gone - no point wasting that! If anyone would like to sponsor this project, I'll happily continue to write up a daily meal plan along with the frugalised recipes, moneysaving methods and sneaky tips.http://www.frugaldom.com/"},
{"title": "New Options for Solar Panels", "date": "Friday 17 February 2012", "text": "As the Frugaldom eco-renovation proceeds, the prospect of increasing utilities bills needs to be met head-on, especially as we are intending refurbishing the out-building into more suitable workspace. This building has a south facing roof, so that conjours up thoughts of solar power.(Photo courtesy of 'RattyandSquirrel' from the Frugaldom forums.)The following is a guest post explaining a little more about solar panels, something that several of our forum members already have fitted to their homes.==============These days everyone is concerned with the impact their energy consumption has on the world around them. Along with the rising cost of electricity, solar panels are quickly becoming a popular choice for home-owners looking to get their energy from different sources.Contrary to popular belief, solar panels don’t actually require direct sunlight as the photovoltaic cells inside them react to natural light. This means that even on a cloudy day the panels can generate electricity, at least 40% of their potential energy yield. Solar panels use photovoltaic (PV) cells the sun’s power and convert it into energy, which can then be used to power the home, workplace or even farms and industrial sites. Any excess electricity is fed back into the national grid, for which the owner of the solar panels is then reimbursed. The Government introduced the Feed-in Tariff (FiT), which gives home-owners more options when installing their solar panel system. For anyone able to buy their system upfront, they could see large returns on their investment, with an estimated profit of over £15000 over 25 years for some. This is through the FiT scheme as well as the savings on electricity bills – between £70 and £130 a year.For those less fortunate, they can have their solar panel system installed for free and hand over the rights to the FiT on that system to the installer, who maintains the system throughout its lifetime after installation. Meanwhile the home-owner saves on their electricity bill safe in the knowledge that they are doing their bit for the environment.In spite of these benefits, many are still put off by visions of the old solar panels, large aluminium framed panels. Solar panels have come a long way in the last few years and new options have become available that are more aesthetically pleasing than the older styles.Solar PV panels are now produced in an array of roof tiles that can be incorporated with a low visual impact and blend in seamlessly with their surroundings. Home-owners now have more choice over the colour and size of the solar panels, with all black or red roof tile style panels available in all sizes.Panels can be installed on existing roofs, without the need to perform a full re-roof, as solar panel installers can replace existing tiles with solar ones, blending them into the rest of the roof.With increasing electricity bills and government incentive schemes like the Feed-in Tariff, there has never been a better time to switch to solar energy. Converting sunlight into green energy reduces your carbon footprint, makes savings on utilities bills and should mean guaranteed payments on electricity for life.   ===============   Although we are much less likely to find companies prepared to fit solar panels of any description free of charge to our Scottish homes, it isn't completely impossible. In this economic climate, striking a deal somewhere should be possible. Give it a go, speak to the relevant company and glean all the information you can before seriously considering your options for a future safeguarded from escalating electricity bills.   If any of our members can provide me with a photograph of their solar panels so I can include it in this post, please send me it via the Frugaldom forums. It would be a great help, as many people still haven't seen these up close and installed. I know at least one of you is having them fitted right now. (Hope work is going well.)   NYK Media Frugaldom"},
{"title": "Working from Your Shed", "date": "Thursday 16 February 2012", "text": "Many people on their way to self-sufficiency will find themselves looking for teleworking opportunities. Working from home, however, is harder than many people realise – but can these problems be solved with the humble garden shed?It can be really difficult to become fully self-sufficient, you are always going to have at least some bills to pay, and making the money for these selling your own produce is not easy. If you’re living somewhere remote it can be a real challenge to find jobs that will both pay your bills and give you the flexibility to provide for yourself independently. Luckily, in this day and age, more and more industries deal in information and a huge number of jobs can be done from anywhere with just a laptop and an Internet connection. Teleworking is a great way to help you make the transition to self-sufficiency, but anyone who has tried teleworking will tell you it’s not as easy as you first think.Sure, you’re commute becomes as simple as rolling out of bed and technology means you can keep in touch with everyone you need to with a Skye call, but you’re home feels very different from your office and your office very different from your home. It can quickly become all too easy to get distracted by other things going on and other jobs that need doing. This becomes even worse if you’re meant to be working when your family is not. At the same time, for most of us, our homes have always been an escape from work, somewhere to get away from the stress and deadlines. It can be really hard to get out of the working frame of mind if you’re both living and working in the same environment. For some people it’s enough to convert a room in there house to a home office, but not everyone has the room to spare - even if they do, if the family is up to other things within ear shot, it can be quite hard to settle into work. So what’s the solution? Well, this is a guest post from The Tiger Shed blog, where we believe that few problems in life can’t be solved by pottering about in the garden shed and this particular problem is no exception. Why not set up a home office in your garden shed?With a little luck you’re still reading and haven’t dismissed the idea as crazy already. If your garden shed is filled with tools, dark, damp and a little bit smelly, you might not be that enthused, but with a little DIY to an existing shed or building a new purpose built shed we think it could really be the perfect home office. Imagine your shed insulated, set up for electricity, within range of Wi-Fi connection, replace the tools and flower pots with a desk and comfy office chair and all of a sudden you’ve got a great working space. The distractions of home are far away and you’re now working in all the natural beauty of your garden. What could be more inspiring than that?Not convinced? Well we’re not the first to come up with the idea, did you know that Roald Dahl actually wrote almost all of his books from the bottom of his garden in a shed? In 1954, after setting up home in Great Missenden, Roald Dahl had a custom shed built in the garden as his own private sanctuary where he could retreat to write his books. Few children fail to fall in love with the creative stories that were spawned in that shed and we’re in little doubt that the joy of the outdoor surroundings must have inspired Dahl.Hopefully by now you’re as excited as we would be about the idea of relocating the office to the garden and you’ll be pleased to know it’s quite a frugal under taking. Converting an existing shed or outbuilding will cost you very little and most people will be able to do these conversions themselves. Even if you need to build a new shed it’s quite a manageable building project and the Internet is filled with free plans that you can use. For those of you who want somewhere a little more substantial the Internet is filled with prebuilt sheds you can have delivered and some of them are virtually separate buildings. Check out the Tiger Shed Log Cabin shop to see what we mean.So, good luck building your shed/home office. For more ideas be sure to check out the Tiger Shed blog and if you give it a go, be sure to send us some pictures.==========================Here in Frugaldom, our first big outdoor project of 2012 is to renovate the garden outbuilding and fit out the garden shed, turning them into suitable work space and a functional studio. The project is at an advanced stage of planning, but I'll be logging the progress reports on here as soon as we begin work in April. Hoping to complete within a six-week timeframe."},
{"title": "Potential for More Doom and Gloom?", "date": "Monday 13 February 2012", "text": "Quantitative Easing and the Frugal HouseholdSo once again, the Bank of England (and British Government) saw fit to churn out another £50 BILLION in cash, apparently bringing the total up to £375 BILLION of new money that's recently been (or is currently being) pumped into our failing, some may say spendthrift, economy. Elsewhere, the US can do similar by way of the Federal Reserve, but what is happening in the Euro Zone, when the likes of Greece needs to impose further austerity measures in order to secure more 'bale-out' funding? Am I to assume that someone, somewhere, simply prints out more Euros?Austerity measures were apparently imposed on Britain, but I don't know what they were or what they currently are, having witnessed absolutely no improvement in my personal financial circumstances, although the price of fuel (domestic heating and motor) seriously curtails any thoughts of living in a warm home or travelling without a specific need to travel.Isn't our traditional British method of \"QUANTITATIVE EASING\" just a posh term for a BALE OUT? I'm no politician, nor am I an economist, but surely if the Bank of England is literally printing new money, we would expect to see some English notes pass through our own hands eventually, here in Scotland? Northern Ireland have their own bank notes, too, so come on guys, let's hear it from you across the water - how many Bank of England notes have passed through your hands over the past couple of years? Or have I completely misunderstood the concept of how this 'easing' works? Isn't the presumption that it filters down through all the different levels until there's extra money (real money) circulating at consumer level?What does QE do to the value of the pound? Surely, if the nation's pot of money is being topped up then there has to be a dilution occuring, a trickle of devaluation, meaning that more is, in actual fact, leading to less, over time? As far as I'm aware, devaluation of the GB pound - that's how I see it - occured in 1931, 1967, 1976, 2008 and I've kind of lost track, other than my understanding that it's been watered down by a further £375 BILLION since then. Do we know the percentage dilution?Tread cautiously, frugal lifers, because somewhere along the line, this has to have a greater impact. Near worthless money in banks is earning close to nothing yet our 'anywhere els' investmets are being watered down continually. What is the real answer for those of us who have little or no savings and who practically live hand to mouth each week, albeit debt free? Into what should we be investing our time, energy and meagre excesses?NYK MediaFrugaldom"},

Shame on me!

{"title": "February's Frugal Grocery Challenge", "date": "Wednesday 1 February 2012", "text": "Cheap Meals for £1 or Less per Person per DayWith a grocery budget of £1 per person per day, it is getting more and more difficult to afford too much meat in the diets, but it isn't impossible, so long as you aren't expecting steak or roast beef too often.I've been carrying out my own version of frugal grocery shopping for more years than I care to mention. Originally, during the 80's, it began with keeping hens for eggs, baking bread by hand and cooking whatever I could from scratch, making the most of a slow cooker.Times have changed slightly, with the emergence of the huge supermarkets. By the late 90s, we had the bread wars, where it was possible to buy a cheap loaf for as little as 4p, rendering it a complete waste of time and energy even contemplating self-baking it. But again the times have changed and the cheapest loaf (of questionable quality) is now approaching 50p. So how does a household manage to survive on a tiny food budget?From today, 1st February, I am going to cost up each of the meals we eat in a day. I'll try to do this for the full month - time permitting - and see how far off the £1 per person per day we really are.Breakfast is usually porridge during the colder months and let's face it, that's most likely to be about seven months out of the twelve if you live in Scotland. (There's a section of the Frugaldom Forum dedicated to cheap meals and how to help keep the cost of grocery shopping within a tight budget.)19p PORRIDGE FOR BREAKFASTPorridge oats currently cost me £1 per kilo and one kilo makes approximately 20 to 22 portions.1 x small cup (45-50g) of porridge oats2.5 x small cups of water Good pinch of salt I cook mine in the microwave, it takes about 6 to 8 minutes, depending on how powerful the microwave is. Don't forget to stir it halfway through and let it stand for a minute before serving. Serve with milk and a sprinkle of sugar (if prefered). Allowing 8p for the salt, milk and sugar, this costs approximately 18p per serving in grocery costs. My microwave is 700w, so a 5 minute blast with this costs approx 1p, making the REAL cost of a bowl of porridge each morning 19p per serving. If you have a handful of dried fruit with your porridge, you can easily add on another 10p, so maybe best save the fruit for mid-morning snacks. (The recommended amount of porridge oats per serving is 45g.)24p PIZZAS FOR LUNCHI very rarely buy pizzas, nor do I specially bake pizza bases. I find that using homemade bread works equally well and is a great way of using up the end slices. These taste more like French Bread Pizzas.My breadmaker does 2 x 450g loaves at a time, so they cost around 35p for wholegrain by the time I factor in the electricity. Assuming each loaf slices into 8-10 slices, I allow 4p per slice.Getting your minimum 5-a-day fruit and vegetable servings each and every day can sem expensive, so it's a case of making the most of what's available at the right price. Tinned tomatoes, whenever you can bulk buy them on offer, will always be your friend. They don't really go out of date or go off as long as the cans aren't dented, so no need to pay too much attention to the BBE dates stamped on the end.Today's pizza lunch included 2 of our 5-a-day by way of chopped red pepper, onions and tomatoes. I keep bags of chopped peppers in the freezer after buying them whenever I see them cheap. At the moment, I am buying peppers with my ROSSPA orders, at a cost of 80p for 3.Ingredients80g diced onions (5p)40g chopped peppers (7.5p)Tin of tomatoes (33p)Salt, pepper, pinch of mixed herbs (1p)Bread - 12p 20g finely grated cheese (11.5p) Total cost = 70p, that's less than 24p per pizza, plus leftovers for the freezer.While the grill is heating, I give the veggies a couple of minutes cooking on full power in the microwave to soften them up, then I add the tin of tomatoes and seasoning. This all then gets microwaved on full power for a further couple of minutes to make sure it is all properly heated. This is your basic pizza sauce mix. Lay your bread out on the grill tray and slightly toast one side before turning it over and covering each slice with the sauce, followed by a sprinkling of your grated cheese.﻿ 20g of mature cheddar﻿ Grate the cheese as finely as you can, using the smallest side of the grater. This enables you to stretch the 20g cube of cheese much further. I use mature cheddar cheese, as we all prefer the flavour, but I'm sure there are cheaper options. To give you an idea of quantity, here is what 20g of cheddar looks like. It is a tiny amount, but that's the price of cheese nowadays, it's extortionate! We need to be economical in that department!﻿﻿ Freeze any extra sauce Surprisingly, the above sauce is enough for 4 pizzas. I made only 3, so the extra tomato, pepper and onion topping has gone into a margarine tub for freezing. If you don't use it for a quick pizza, it's fine for adding to bolognese or chilli con carne. Is also nice with a little chilli added and served with fajitas in place of shop bought salsa. If all your ingredients are costed now, it's like having free ingredients when the time comes to use them in your next meal. NYK MediaFrugaldom"},
{"title": "Aurora Borealis - In Search of the Northern Lights of Frugaldom", "date": "Friday 27 January 2012", "text": "Frugal Living and Wet Weather BluesSince the weekend, I have been trying to watch the night skies in the hope of catching my first ever glimpse of the Northern Lights - Aurora Borealis, to give it its proper name. It's the first time in several years that the solar activity has reached sufficient levels to allow us, here in the southern sector of Scotland, to witness this splendid, somewhat terrifying, atmospheric phenomenon. I believe there have even been sightings as far south as northern England!All week long it has been cloudy and wet! We have had rain, hail, sleat and snow. Finally, yesterday looked like it had 'snowed out', with several areas of Scotland particularly badly hit. However, the aftermath of this was plummeting temperatures and a black velvet, star spangled sky that was lit up by a new moon and the bright light of 'nearby' Venus. I had to ask twice about this bright light, as I was convinced it was a satellite. There's never as much as a flicker of twinkle from it that I have noticed. But then the telescope is still packed away in a box from housemoving and my eyesight isn't what it used to be.With great expectations, I kept one eye on the aurora activity level map for the northern hemisphere and the other on the night sky... was hoping to see the activity level beat 7. Then the clouds moved back in again and the heavens opened! It's still raining now! Don't get me wrong, I am no astronomer. Nor am I a regular star gazer (although we do have that telescope lurking somewhere) but the prospect of seeing Aurora Borealis completely free of charge (no pun intended) from our own garden, when people can pay thousands of pounds holidaying in far off, northern countries, paying for guided expeditions as part of a lifetime dream, it's very, very moneysaving and would be most satisfying to be able to make that 'claim to fame'.Being unable to see beyond the rain clouds here, I chose to watch events unfold in Norway, by way of the Aurora Sky Station live camera - absolutely awesome! Spectacular footage and all for free, from the comfort of home. If you do check out the site, remember you can't see the lights during the day, you'll need to tune in at night.Apologies for the lack of posts here of recent times, procrastination has been lurking dangerously close to chronic level. I promise to try and update more often and, for now, would like to extend a special thanks to those of you who have chosen to have this humble, frugal little blog delivered to your Kindles.Edited in:According to the Met Office, our local forecast is for a freezing night with clear skies.

The reason I chose it was simple - lack of income, no entitlement to benefits, no possibility of a mortgage and I love the lifestyle. Saving to buy a house outright was the only sensible option, in my opinion.Buying a cheap fixy up property as a renovation project can also be fun, but we need to live and work here, earning enough to sustain the household and carry out essential refurbishment. The most important element of this longterm project is affordability - the house has to be made into a warm, dry, comfortable home and the garden laid out in such a way that it can help sustain the household. This is what I refer to as microholding. It's a very small, self sustaining unit, providing all that's needed to generate enough income to keep the house and household running efficiently, while also providing us with a source of food and, hopefully one day, energy.Reducing overheads is a must - it doesn't make economical sense to have to spend £50 per week in winter heating a small house, so insulation is the number one priority. The kitchen is the heart of the frugal  microholding lifestyle. It is where all the food is prepared, it is the gateway to the garden and it is also the most energy hungry part of the house, as far as electricity is concerned. This room is a conversion that appears to join an old stable, wash house or pig sty to the main house, so the later walls are block built while the original ones are stone.So far, we have fixed all the electrical and water supplies and renewed the entire kitchen roof. The roof, hopefully, has been the single most expensive part of the project so far. Insulation began with 100mm of Black Mountain Sheep Wool insulation, followed by foil-backed plasterboard. This new ceiling still has to be plastered, but that job can't be done until the window and walls have been completed. Sheep wool is not the cheapest option but it does fit in with our best efforts at eco-renovation.Last week, we managed to get the old window and frame stripped out and replaced, making a further change to the temperature difference between outside and in the kitchen, which has no current source of heating. During these chilly, winter mornings, when the outside thermometer is reading 0C, the kitchen is holding 10C without heating. Once the fire is lit, the heat spreads and raises this another couple of degrees, so things are looking up in that department. Once the walls are replaced and we have a proper floor, rather than just bare concrete, things should improve dramatically.Today sees the start of 'project kitchen walls'. The next batch of 50mm sheep wool insulation has just been delivered and this is what will insulate the new walls. Phase one is removing the old plasterboard, then the walls need to be damp proofed before fitting the sheep wool between the wooden framework that will then be clad in foil-backed plasterboard. Again, these will need to be plastered, but that's for another phase of the frugaldom renovation project.Now, I'm off to clear the space along the back wall of the kitchen and start making a big mess. I'll update with a photo as soon as the first wall is visible.1st Update: This is the first corner to be revealed after stripping it back to the bare block. Only the wood at ground level is rotten, with the usual tell tale signs of woodworm. The actual blockwork feels dry, other than one tiny damp patch at ground level, which would have been below the level at which the kitchen was previously saturated by burst pipes and the old, leaky roof. I'm optimistic... I think this looks like a DIY job once I've read up a bit more about the best methods of damp proofing. The rotten wood will need to come out and be replaced but I still have about 10 litres of the Cuprinol 5 Star wood treatment, so that means I can treat all the wood before it gets covered over by new plasterboard. I'll continue removing the old plasterboard, all of which seems to be perfectly dry and, possibly, reuseable for something, even if it is only the outbuilding. with luck, the temperature won't plummet too low, as there's going to be absolutely nothing to stop what little heat we do have in the kitchen from escaping straight out through the wall. Perhaps I'll drag out the huge sheet of polythene that accompanied the last delivery of sheep wool - anything is better than nothing. :)2nd Update - There were no hidden surprises awaiting me behind the old plasterboard. Indeed, it was amazingly dry and still no signs of any rising damp. This is an external wall, so I'd have expected any dampness to have shown itself by now.  Frugalpuss thought it was a great game of hind and seek and is still sat in the midst of the dusty mess. The framework on the wall is far too narrow, so this will all be brought out to extend the gap to allow for 50mm of sheep wool to be used to insulate it. It isn't particularly draughty with the boards down, so I'm hoping that means the new roof is doing its full and proper job. The walls and concrete floor all need to be damp proofed but I'm still awaiting word about what the most economical and environmentally friendly way of doing this really is. All suggestions welcome.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "A Frugally Productive Day", "date": "Tuesday 10 January 2012", "text": "GARDEN PRODUCE IN WINTERI've been waiting for quite some time to get a dry enough day to get out into the garden to see how things are growing. The ground is saturated - far too wet to even think about planting anything - but it was alright for picking some fresh produce.Today's haul got me a tub of brussels sprouts, some curly kale and 15 leeks. The ducks got their share of leafy greens to nibble on, when I pulled up a couple of rows of the old broccoli plus some kale, then it was indoors to start preparing the day's pickings. Before that, I pulled out the dead sunflowers, so their thick, woody stalks were soon blazing on the fire, helping to heat the water.Breadbaking was on the agenda, so two small loaves got baked in the replacement breadmaker. It bakes faster than my old one, probably owing to the fact that it does two small loaves instead of one large one. I like this feature, as it allows me to bake a white loaf and a wholemeal loaf at the same time. That's very handy when the household is divided on what each likes best.Then there was the 'Nile' mince to cook. I named it this, as mince is such a versatile meat product that can be bulked out and made into so many different dishes - it simply stretches for miles, just like the River Nile. Bog standard mince and potatoes is tasty at the best of times but with a slow cooker, you can simply add everything into the one pot and have a 'casserole' style meal that could easily feed a large family without a problem.Today, the mince is cooking along with potatoes, carrrots, onions, leeks and brussel sprouts. I add plenty of stock and seasoning, then  dumplings  get added about half an hour before serving the meal in big bowls, along with freshly baked bread, if required. It's tasty, nutritious and very filling!(Dumplings are a mix of plain flour, suet and water mixed into dough, divided into dough balls and can be cooked in mince, stew or soup.)Whatever mince doesn't get used today will be transformed by the addition of tomatoes, herbs and garlic to make a bolognese style sauce for serving with pasta and then the remains of that topped up with chilli peppers and kidney beans to serve at a later date with boiled rice. My slow cooker is one of the most used items I have in my kitchen and I can highly recommend them to anyone. I use a 6.5L Morphy Richards.Each of these dishes can be frozen in meal sized portions for future use, so we can get three meals for three of us out of the one pack of mince, which started out weighing a mere 400g for a cost of £1.20  The potatoes, onions, brussel sprouts and leeks are all from the garden. I'm ashamed to say, I had to buy the carrots!Sadly, we've lost our second crop of carrots, which were well and truly wrecked when the rabbit decided it would be fun to play in that particular bed after finding her way in through the netting! She had it dug into nothing by the time we found her. And judging by the huge holes I found among the stalks of last year's broccoli and the brussels sprouts this afternoon, she's been making a habit of frequenting that spot, too.Note to rabbit-keeping vegetable growers - your rabbit will love freeranging in your garden but it will also find its way into anything, showing you where you have failed to 'crittur-proof' your precious veggies. The Frugaldom bunny doesn't seem to touch turnips, kale, broccoli, cauliflower or sprouts, but she loves carrots, pea shoots, strawberries and raspberry leaves. I've even seen her nibbling on the mint!Hoping to be able to get some seeds started soon, so I'll probably start with my salad leaves in their tub, as these are easily covered in plastic as a makeshift cloche. I would normally start some other seeds off in trays and keep them on the kitchen windowsill but being in our 'fixy-up' means I don't actually have a windowsill to use until the old window gets replaced. Weather permitting, I'm hoping it could maybe get fitted this weekend, which would then help cut down more of the draughts at the back of the house.Here's to the 2012 growing season. If the mild weather continues, we might even get back out into the garden soon - if only the high winds and rain would stay away for a bit!The duck pond is mucky but, thanks to the drainage, we have avoided any floods or mud pits... so far. We lost one of our young ducks to the severe weather during the storms but everything else seems to be fairing well. Roll on the start of egg laying, as we're only getting a few bantam eggs at the moment - hardly conducive to cost-effective egg production!Work has now begun on the website in preparation for the new year. All the links will be added to the http://www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk/ site, which will become the centre of this frugal little kingdom, updated to reflect progress in the development of our first microholding.

{"title": "Another Frugal Soup Recipe for 2012", "date": "Monday 2 January 2012", "text": "It's all over for another year - Christmas has been and gone, Hogmanay has been and gone, New Year has been and gone. We're now marching boldly into 2012, ready to do battle with whatever life throws at us and hopeful of grabbing any new opportunities that may present themselves along the way.There was no winter snow over the festive week, instead, we had wind and rain with the odd smattering of sleat and hailstones. Occasionally, a glimmer of sunhine managed to sneak through the clouds. Sadly, we lost a 'runty duckling' that prefered to stay in the pond than seek shelted from the torrential dowpours, but the rest of the Frugaldom menagerie seems happy enough. The cat loves her new toys and the rabbit has been out for a run about the garden to work off all the extra carrot peelings she managed to consume over Christmas.The breadmaker had been playing up for quite some time; it had lost all the little washers from between it's baking pan and the mixing blade which, itself, was almost worn out. Everything was crossed that it would see us through Christmas. As (good) luck would have it, mum had passed her's on to one of my sisters who had ended up putting it into her attic, so a quick phone call of pleasantries and pleading - OK, I simply asked her - meant she had time to fish the breadmaker from the attic and bring it on her trip to the family get together. Despite it being a few years old, this machine is in almost new condition, as neither of its previous owners seemed to enjoy (or have time for) breadmaking. I think I won out on this, as it's now safely ensconced in my kitchen, replacing my old one. The old one, however, hasn't been thrown out, as it does still work! It might come in useful sometime in the future, or may even find itself with a shiny new baking pan and mixing blade.Two loaves are better than one, apparently, as the 'new' machine makes two tiny loaves simultaneously. The settings allow for different types of mix to be used in each pan, so we can have white and wholemeal or cake and bread baking at the same time. Right now, I have a couple of bananas needing used up, so I'll probably do a wholemeal loaf alongside banana bread tomorrow morning.The post-festive period is a great time for using up leftovers. Let's face it, most of us have them around this time of year, whether it's turkey from Christmas or steak pie, gammon or roast beef from New Year. I used half the stuffed turkey breast for Christmas day, so the other half went into the freezer, cooked. I had pheasants in the freezer, so one of them got cooked up with all the trimmings and served with puff pastry in suitable pie-like passion on New Year's Day. The cat is happy, as she has had all the extra meat chopped into catfood-sized nuggets and then everything else that remained of the fine bird went into my slow cooker.Cue another one of those rather 'interesting' Frugaldom soup tales...GAME AND TOMATO BROTHEverything remaining from the pheasant went into the big crock pot in the slow cooker, along with a couple of onions and the leftover potatoes. This was set on the timer to simmer for a few hours overnight. At the same time, I rinsed off a 500g pack of broth mix and a cupful of butter beans, then left them soaking in cold water overnight.In the morning, the stock was strained and then returned to the slow cooker, along with the broth mix, butter beans and half a carton of passata that I had lurking in the fridge. (I buy store's own 'basic' passata, as it's cheaper than tins of chopped tomatoes and works well as a base for turning the end slices of homemade bread into frugal, speedy pizzas.) Season the soup with salt & pepper, then leave to simmer until all the beans, peas, lentils and barley are tender.That's it, that's the frugal game soup of the day and it works equally well using a shin of beef, although this would add to your costs by around 65p.The pheasant cost me nothing, as I had traded for a brace through our LETS group, so stock from leftovers is an extra bonus, as we'd already had the bird for New Year's dinner. The broth mix and butter beans had been on special offer last year, when I made a bulk purchase, so I reckon they cost me no more than 50p in total. If I recall correctly, the cheap passata costs 23p and I'd already used half of it for lunchtime pizzas. The onions and  potatoes were leftovers from New Year's dinner and they were all homegrown, so I don't bother counting them. At a rough estimate, I got 4.5 litres of soup for no more than 73p plus the cooking time (20p). I'd say 20 portions of soup for 93p was a fairly frugal meal, wouldn't you?Looking forward to getting back into the frugaling spirit this year, with plenty of new projects and challenges.

{"title": "Traditional Scottish Clootie Dumpling and Easy Shortbread Biscuits", "date": "Saturday 24 December 2011", "text": "MERRY CHRISTMAS 2011 TO ONE AND ALL!It's that time of year again, time for spending what we can afford on gifts for friends, family and loved ones. Homemade gifts abound, as do decorations, rhubarb and elderberry fizz, ginger beer, cakes, shortbread and, for us here in Scotland, the traditional 'clootie dumpling'. For anyone who missed last year's copy, here are the basic recipes I use.Having moved house, I still haven't unpacked my cookie cutters, so this year's shortbread had to be cut into rounds using a tumbler. I used a very simple 2, 4, 6 recipe, as follows:Scottish Shortbread Biscuits2oz / 50g sugar4oz / 100g butter (or margarine)6oz / 150g plain flour (I used 5 plain flour and 1 cornflour)Mix the butter, sugar and flour.Place the resulting dough in the fridge for half an hour before rolling and cuttingBake on a floured tray for approximately 25 minutes at 170CRemove from oven, sprinkle with sugar and cool on a wire rack.I used the old measurements (ounces) and got 24 shortbread biscuits from this.Next up was the clootie dumpling, so my old, trusty cloot (cloth) got boil washed beforehand.Great Granny Kerr's Traditional Scottish Clootie DumplingGet a large stockpot of water on to boil before you start, so the water is ready for the dumpling. Place a plate on the bottom of the pan, so the dumpling can bounce off that, rather than the bottom of the pan.INGREDIENTS12oz plain flour4oz shredded suet3 tablespoons of sugar3 large handfuls of raisins (or sultanas or dried fruit)1 teaspoon cinnamon1 teaspoon all spice1 teaspoon gingerMix all of the above dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then add1 large tablespoon of treacle1 large dessertspoon of syrupEnough milk to bind the mix together into a soft consistency without it going mushy.Lay out the wet cloot / cloth and sprinkle plain flour liberally across the middle part, where the mix will be poured. (I use a round cloot/cloth cut from an old cotton tablecover, but a piece of muslin or even a cotton tea towel would do.)Pour all of the mix into the centre of the cloth.Gather up the edges and tie them all with string or a piece of cloth, leaving enough room for the mix to expand as it cooks.Gently lower the dumpling into the pan of boiling water.This now needs to be kept on the boil for three to three and a half hours, always ensuring that the water level doesn't drop. It's also wise to check that you have left enough room for the mix to expand in the cloth. We don't want any episodes of dumpling bursting oot its cloot!Traditionally, coins or lucky charms would be cooked in the dumpling, as gifts for whoever found them in their serving. This practice has slowly fallen by the wayside for health and safety, food hygiene and dentistry reasons, but some stalwarts still follow tradition! Best to ask your host before biting into a big mouthful of clootie dumpling, especially if your host happens to be a wacky, Scottish traditionalist. Removing the dumpling from the cloth can be a bit hazardous, so use tongs to lift it from the boiling water and take great care not to drop it. I find it easiest to place the whole thing into the mixing bowl until the cloth is untied - a tricky process that's easier done if you have long nails, rather than burn your fingers. The prongs of a fork work quite well, too. Turn the dumpling out onto a large plate - at this stage it will look very pale and pasty or, as we say here, 'peely wally'. Sprinkle with some sugar and place into a hot oven for approximately 15 minutes, keep checking it doesn't burn. During its time in the oven, your dumpling should develop a lovely, brown, leathery-looking skin. At this point, it is ready for eating hot, served with cream, custard or even some milk. You can decorate it with a small sprig of holly and a dusting of icing sugar if you really want it to look 'posh'.If it's not needed at this time, allow your dumpling to cool, wrap it in tinfoil and keep it until it is needed. Dumpling freezes well, whole or sliced.Once thawed, dumpling can be reheated in the microwave, oven, grill or steamer.If reheating dumpling in the oven, wrap it in tinfoil to prevent it from drying out, you can uncover it for the final few minutes.If grilling, it's probably best to slice the dumpling first.If reheating in the microwave, plate up the servings and cover them with an upturned bowl or microwave safe cling film.Dumpling is very versatile. It's a fruit pudding that can be eaten hot with a topping of your choice, or it is a fruit cake that can be sliced and served cold, in similar fashion to fruit loaf. But better still, it can be sliced and pan fried as part of a traditional breakfast fry-up.Have you had your dumpling this year? ENJOY!NYK Mediahttp://www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "The (Surprising) Cost of Electricity and Fuel", "date": "Wednesday 14 December 2011", "text": "A Four Year Cost ComparisonFirst of all, the electrician has been and completed the wiring, so we have lights in the kitchen, bathroom and back hallway. Secondly, I've managed to plug a few more holes to cut down on the draughts, so it is steadily becoming less of a trial trying to heat Frugaldom.Out of interest, I searched out my past accounts to compare electricity costs. I've only looked back as far as 2008, as the other files are backed up on a different system, but what I did find reminds me sharply of the costs incurred when you have no fixed abode and need to rely on private rentals!In 2008, we lived in a 4 room, 3-storey, terraced house that relied solely on electricity for heating. This was supplied via storage heaters on an Economy 7 electricity meter and that house was very cold in winter!  During 2008, the household budget had to cough up £1,311.40 in total for fuel and energy - a fair whack when working on a budget of just £4,000 for the year. £1,218.90 of this was electricity.In 2009, we lived in a 3 room, semi-detached bungalow that relied on storage heaters on Economy 7 style electricity meter and had an open coal fire in the living room. That house was equally cold in winter! During 2009, the household budget had to cough up £1,336.82 in total for electricity, coal and logs out of a challenge budget of £4,000 for the year. £1,030.00 of this was electricity.In 2010, we were still in the same house, under the impression that we had a long lease. We eventually got permission to install a log burner in the kitchen, which previously had no heating in it at all. It was an extremely long and freezing winter. Excluding the purchase price and fitting of the stove, I spent £1,533.00 in total of my £4,000 budget on electricity, coal and logs. £1,190 of this was on electricity.In 2011, we bought our 4 room, fixy-up, end terraced cottage with an open fire and back boiler - no other heating. I stuck with my challenging £4,000 per year household budget and have now spent everything that needs to be spent on fuel and energy. Despite the latest price increases, the overall cost of electricity, coal and logs has amounted to £1,305.87 and that includes two months when we were running two houses. £877.67 of this was electricity.There is still a great deal of work to be done in our new home but every step of the way includes investigating how we can best cut our energy and fuel costs, while trying to create a warm living environment - something that can be very difficult to achieve if you are living in someone else's house, paying them rent.The first steps have been taken, getting the place watertight, dried out and aired. We have begun the long task of draughtproofing and insulating, along with planning on how best to improve on the heating. It may take another few of years of scrimping, saving and creative DIY, but it's all progress along the way.In 2012, my challenge is to keep with my £4,000 household budget (excluding council tax) and try to get the cost of fuel and energy below £1,200.00  It's a tall order when living in a fairly rural part of Scotland with no access to mains gas and no conventional central heating system, but I feel that it is within reach and, as we invest in improving the house, I'm sure savings will be easier made as each improvement project is completed. £780.00 of this is allocated to electricityFor now, I'm happy to be heading in the right direction and hope to cut down on coal use in favour of burning logs, which are reported to be carbon neutral. But we need a dry log store before that will happen. How much has electricity increased in price since 2008?I raked out an old electricity bill from 2008 just to see how things had changed and was rather surprised by what I found.In November 2008, we were paying 21.9p per day standing charge and 13.52p per kWhIn December 2011, we are paying 25p per day standing charge and 12.24p per kWhIf we estimate costs over a year at 5000 units or kWh ...2008 costs = £755.942011 costs = £703.25In money terms, our electricity has reduced in price since 2008, unlike the price of coal, which has increased by around 40%. Talk about needing a naths degree to work out how best to save and spend?Frugal living combined with a curious interest in numbers certainly has its advantages! :)NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "How to Make Your Own Fake Snow for Windows", "date": "Tuesday 13 December 2011", "text": "Frugal Festive Window Decorations... that didn’t make it into the Hillary’s Blinds blog.Over on the Hillary’s window blinds blog we’ve been getting quite excited about Christmas. In fact, it’s been the theme for most of our recent posts and this week will be no exception. We’ve once more given up on discussing the various varieties of wooden blinds and, instead, are suggesting you find something more festive to cover your window. As pleased as we are with our Christmas window dressing guide, I must admit that not all our ideas have been the most frugal. To me, this is a little sad as, since I was small, my favourite Christmas decorations have always been the home made ones that make Christmas feel really personal.So whilst the Hillary’s blog is a great place to go for inspiration of ways to Christmas-a-tise your window if you’re in a hurry, here I’m going to share three of my favourite window decorating techniques that you can make yourself at home from things you probably already have.Frosty windowsPainting snow on the edges of your window or stencilling on other Christmassy designs when done with care can actually look really effective; depending on exactly where you are living it’s been a while since there was a proper white Christmas so if you’ve missed them it can be a great way to pretend. However, cans of aerosol snow are not really the most frugal way to do it and one has to wonder what their impact on the environment might be.Instead, why not try this recipe for making your own fake snow?Mix about half a can of lager with three or four table spoons of Epsom salts - that's how simple it is! You’ll be left with a snowy looking paste that is safe paint on you windows.Although it’s not as quick as spraying, in many ways I prefer it, using a brush to paint allows you to produce a lot more accurate details, and if you prefer to stencil you can still do this using a sponge.When twelfth night comes the snow should come off easily with vinegar and water.The paper snow flakeIf you’re looking for a different way to add snow to your windows, making snowflakes from paper is one of those great children’s Christmas crafts that adults all seem to have forgotten about. Although you can buy these ready made in the shops now, I think the real fun of these is the process of making them and discovering how they turn out.So, in case you’ve forgotten your primary school art lessons and need a reminder about how to create these, here are step by step instructions.1. Cut squares of paper to the size you want your snow flake to be2. Fold diagonally in half making a triangle3. Fold again to make a smaller triangle4. Fold in the corners of the triangle making an arrow head shape5. Use scissors to cut a triangle from the tip of your arrow head6. Cut a pattern into the sides of your arrow with scissorsIf everything went well you should then be able to unfold your arrow revealing a beautiful snowflake; make a few of these and they’ll be great to stick in your window.Recycle Christmas cardsConsider keeping your Christmas cards from year to year, as a far more fun way to recycle them than just throwing them in the recycling bin is to use them to make brand new Christmas decorations. There are lots of creative ways you can use old Christmas cards, gift tags, paper models or even using them as the base for the paper snowflakes mentioned above are just a few of the options, but my personal favourite is to make a collage by cutting out any characters or particularly exciting pictures. One great place you can then display this collage is, of course, in the window. If you have window blinds this is particularly easy, just roll your blind about a quarter of the way down and attach the collage to the blind itself.These are just a few of the more frugal Christmas window decorating ideas, you no doubt have many of your own. That’s why homemade Christmas decorations are so great, they are so personal and give everyone a chance to show off some creativity. If you find the time this Christmas, I hope you enjoy making some of your own decorations. Merry Christmas!   A guest blog for the followers of Frugaldom   NYK Media www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk New Roof, New Door, More Rewiring, Insulation and a New CeilingAmidst our current trials (and errors) of calculating the costs involved in heating an old cottage in a rural Scottish village, we have reached the next step of our renovation journey. As can be expected, the good old Scottish weather has dictated the order of things, so it was with some dismay that we had to endure the full blast of last week's 'hurricane' with the wind whistling through the old back door at the same time as having no ceiling in the kitchen. Any attempt to heat the place was pointless.But the insulation had arrived - six rolls of Black Mountain sheep wool. We opted to purchase this from a company called Natural Insulations and I have to say, their service was faultless. The half pallet of insulation arrived at the door within a couple of days and the delivery company kept us informed as to exactly when they would arrive. I even kept the pallet as extra firewood.This has been one of my 'luxury buys' for the Frugaldom household, as the budget wouldn't normally stretch that far. Attempting to be environmentally friendly, however, is something that we want to do here, despite all odds associated with frugal living. There is little (or no) incetive for households on a tight budget to incorporate enviromentally friendly, carbon neutral products into any renovation or improvement projects, so some financial jiggery pokery had to be done, along with a money making challenge to help increase the income last month. Fortunately, that goal was achieved and I wasn't forced to settle for cheap, nasty, subsidised glass fibre insulation.Being in the unfortunate situation that our roof had to be replaced without removing it in its entirety (owing to adverse weather conditions) the joiners were faced with the task of then renewing the ceiling while incorporating insulation from the uderside, rather than being able to simply lay it between rafters. To be fair, they had expected me to opt for insulation boards such as Celotex or Kingspan, so this was a first encounter with sheep wool for them.Work began this morning with the arrival of the electrician to rewire the kitchen, followed shortly by the joiners, complete with the foil backed plasterboard and other necessary bits and pieces. The insulation was at the ready and I have now been informed that it is excellent to work with, when comparing it to standard glass fibre. Aside from the fact that the joiner currently looks a bit like a yeti, where his fleece has attracted the other fleece, he has suffered no irritation from the product whatsoever.The Black Mountain sheep wool insulation at 100mm thickness offers a thermal conductivity of 0.039 W/m².K. It is 95% natural wool fibre, created from the fleeces of Swaledales and Welsh Black Face sheep. It is a truly sustainable product, easy to handle, cut and shape, has an ozone depletion potential of zero, locks away carbon and even feels warm to the touch. It can absorb up to 35% moisture without its insulating properties being affected, so that's a definite bonus in a well used kitchen. (Technical data can be found here.) And the cat loves it! The kitchen is progressing well, with most of the rewiring completed and the new ceiling now being fitted to incorporate all this lovely insulation. I've double checked to ensure cables are double-insulated and they've all been tested to ensure there's no possibility of any heat radiating that could create any fire hazard and the plasterboard is now going up, adding an extra barrier by way of the foil-backing. You can already feel the difference in the temperature of the kitchen, despite it blowing a gale outside at the moment, and that's just the first half of the ceiling done.My initial comparison had been done on the chance that we would have had to use Celotex or Kingspan type insulation board, but further research proved that this board would have cost around 20% more than us having had the sheep wool delivered to Scotland from Wales, so there has been some small saving, enough to cover the cost of the foil-backed plasterboard! There has not been a great deal of extra expense incurred by 'going green' on this issue.All in all, I'm very optimistic about the quality and capabilities of this product and very pleased that the decision was made to go the most environmentally friendly route available to us.The electrician has to return and finish wiring in the lights, the ceiling needs fitted in the back hallway, where sheep wool has also been added, and then there's plenty more to do after that. But we have the long-awaited, insulated kitchen ceiling, just in time for winter setting in properly.There's money saving and then there' money saving - the sheep wool won't need to be topped up or replaced every 10 years, for a start, and I have the rest of the winter to calculate what savings can be made in keeping at least one room of the house warm until we've saved enough to start on the next one. In addition to the above, we also had the back door and framework replaced, so no more wind whistling through that!On completion of the kitchen, this will be the first part of the house to be insulated, so the challenge is on to save enough to invest in more sheep wool for the rest of the house, both upstairs and down.The frugal renovation project continues with the replacement of the kitchen window, which was held up by it not being made in time for the joiner's visit this week. The joys of Listed buildings and their 'like for like' modernisation policies, everything new needs to be made the same size and shape as the old, but I guess that's what I like about old buildings - they have traditional character.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Temporary Interlude in the Log Burning Experiment", "date": "Friday 9 December 2011", "text": "Part 3Well, after the past couple of days of rain, hail, sleat, snow, gale force winds and flickering power, I'm hoping I can get back to normality.Relying on log burning as our only source of heat and hot water is a non-starter for now, primarily because we simply don't have the facilities needed to make this realistic.Winter weather has put paid to our having sufficient dry logs to burn but I was able to estimate a cost of £2.50 per day when combining that with £1.84 of coal plus the usual £2.14 of electricity. Total cost for that combination is £6.48 per day or £45.36 per week.To my dismay, the more carbon neutral option of burning logs looks even more expensive than buring coal so, once again, trying to do anything remotely like following the 'green' way is proving to be uneconomical without first laying out a small fortune on a suitably large, dry, log store and paying to keep it filled with well seasoned timber.I have seen 'kiln dried' logs available (at premium prices, for those who can afford them), but have to ask myself the question, what is fueling the kilns that are drying these logs and how much fossil fuel is used to cut and process them in the first place? Is there really any economical, environmentally friendly, pollutant free way of generating heat and power and, if so, what is it?What ever happened to Hydrogen Fuel Cells that run on water?Is there a non-mains powered pump suitable for maintaining a solid fuel heating system so it doesn't need shut down when there's a power cut? (Likewise with solar PV, ground source heat pumps, oil or gas central heating, boilers etc, etc, etc.) Does everything regarded as 'normal' to everyday living rely on mains power?Questions, questions, questions... we can't all simply go into a forest and handsaw a couple of trees to split and dry logs for firewood each year, so what's the solution? I wonder who will win the LENR race to finally produce sufficient scientific evidence to support mainstream manufacture of energy catalysers?NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "The Cost of Heating a Rural Home in Scotland - Part 2", "date": "Wednesday 7 December 2011", "text": "Burning LogsToday is log day, so it won't be the easiest thing to try and calculate. The photo shows what was left of the trailer-load of logs bought exactly 4 weeks ago - enough there for another week, I would reckon. We had another load delivered yesterday, which should last us through the festive season. Until we get around to building a proper, walk-in log store, we don't have suitable space for storing much more than a trailer-load at a time. (The photo isn't blurry, it was snowing quite heavily yesterday and we've had another flurry today.)I realise that many people advise against burning a combination of fuels, even although it has been done for centuries but, for the purposes of lighting the fire, I use one firelighter (7p) and kindling sticks. This morning, about a kilo of coal (23p) was added to get the fire blazing, then logs added. By this point, the water in the backboiler could be heard beginning to boil, so the pump was switched on to feed it through to the hot water tank and radiators.During cold, wet, winter months, we need the coal in order to get enough heat generated to quickly dry off any dampness from the logs. We aren't yet equipped with a large, undercover log store and it didn't help that the latest load was delivered during a heavy downpour. Surplus logs are stacked (off the ground) and covered in a loose tarpaulin. (The frogs, toads and lizards love it in there!)It takes 8 large wheelbarrow loads to shift a £40 load of logs, so I'm estimating £5 per barrowload. At a complete guess, I would think half a barrowload would last us a full day, but I'll start my trial today using what's already stacked by the fire and then continue tomorrow with a full barrowload.I've had to hang a curtain over the doorway between kitchen and main hallway to try and cut down the through draught. Right now, owing to the horrible weather - high winds, rain and snow - the curtains are billowing, but this side of the house does feel warm.Great excitement! An articulated lorry pulled up outside just minutes ago and my extravagant, environmentally friendly, Black Mountain sheep wool insulation has been delivered! 1) It arrived on a pallet, so that will provide more free kindling for the fire! 2) It was all wrapped up inside a massive, heavy-duty, polythene bag. This will be ideal for securing over the huge hole in the kitchen wall when they come to replace the kitchen window. In fact, I may pin it over the entire window, to help cut down on heat loss until then! I care not what it looks like when it's at the back of the house and only us to see it!All we need now is to hear news of when the new window has been made and when the new back door and frame can be fitted, then we can plan on getting the new ceiling put up in the kitchen, along with the sheep wool insulation.Back later with an update on log consumption by my hungry fire.Edit: This experiment was temporarily halted as I'd to damp the fire right down when we had a power cut. This is the downside to relying on an electric pump to circulate all that hot water that's generated in the back boiler - it has no place to go other than to spurt out the overflow. Estimating now continues, but with the addition of another kilo (23p) of coal to get the fire back up and running sufficiently to reheat the radiators; these cool down much more quickly than I'd like! In this sense, storage-type heaters are superior in their ability to retain their heat during power cuts. (Assuming they were fully charged prior to the outage, of course.)This is the second power cut we've had over the past month, so a stand alone log burning stove, in addition to the heating system, is looking more and more of a possibility. One similar to what we installed in the previous house would serve us well, as that allowed us to cook on it, too. But that involves getting in the builders to fully check the second chimney. I feel another savings challenge coming along soon.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "The Cost of Heating a Rural Home in Scotland - Part 1", "date": "Tuesday 6 December 2011", "text": "Burning CoalFollowing on from previous post, I have been trying to assess the cost of 'fire fuel' and electricity in order to budget more wisely for these things in the future.Our new home is a stone-built, 3-bedroom, end terraced cottage, located in a fairly rural area of Scotland. The cottages in our block are over two hundred years old, single-glazed with slate roofs. There are no options for things like cavity wall insulation or loft insulation, as we have no cavities and no lofts.We hope to remedy the problems as we progress with the renovation, but I suspect the property may take quite some time to dry out completely after lying empty for a couple of years. Leaking roof and burst pipes can't have helped, especially after the past two winters endured.The only form of heating is by way of an open fire in the livingroom, with a backboiler that now heats water and three radiators. Until we can upgrade this to a more efficient stove system, we are probably losing more heat straight up the old chimney than gets into the room!Coal is now £12.80 per 50kg bag when buying the cheapest available. In June, when we first moved into the house, I bought 4 bags at £11.80 per bag. In September, I stocked up with half a tonne for the special price of £108.00 and then added a further 250kg to this at a cost of £60.00The total spend on coal since arriving here has been £215.20, equating to 22.65 pence per kilo delivered. For ease of calculation, we'll call it 23p per kilo. (In 2012, the cheapest coal will be 25.6p per kilo, assuming no further price increases.)The first 'experiment', carried out yesterday, was to light the fire at 6.30am and keep it burning all day to calculate coal costs. Before filling it with coal, I weighed the scuttle - it holds 8kg of coal, so costs £1.84 to fill. I used two of these between 7am and 11pm , so the open fire is consuming 1 kg (23p) of coal per hour. If I factor in the need for a firelighter and the sticks used for kindling, then add on a log last thing at night, it creeps up to approximately £4 per day. For that, we have hot water and 3 rooms with a source of heat.Then there's electricity, with the first 25p per day being taken up on standing charges. We are getting through approximately 15 units of electricity per day, mainly because the house is occupied all day, every day, the shower is electric and we now have a convector heater set on low, running 24/7. A single kWh of electricity costs 12.24p, so that's another £1.84 per day. In this, the first of a series of cost comparisons, the overall total for heat, light, hot water and power in our rural, frugal household is costing £6.09 per day or £42.63 per week.(The above cannot be said to 'warm' the house, as most of the heat is being lost through the kitchen roof at the moment.)NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Can You Afford NOT to Control Your Own Household Budget?", "date": "Monday 5 December 2011", "text": "It's Not Rocket Science!I hate the above term! For me, it is on a par with phrases such as \"it ticks all the right boxes\" and \"it's a blank canvas\", the types of things people say on TV and radio, in everyday conversation and in the workplace. I had a boss who used to use the rocket science phrase to the point of infuriation! (Apologies, Robert, you probably weren't even aware of this nasty habit, but we were working for the MoD at the time and, for all we know, it may well have been related to rocket science, but not when you were talking to me about data analysis.) But I digress. This post is about some homebased experimentation, research and analysis into what's the most cost-effective and efficient way of living on a tight budget, especially while trying to heat a rural property in cold, wet, windy Scotland.IT'S A SET OF NON-SCIENTIFIC ENERGY EXPERIMENTSToday is Monday, first day of the working week for most. Yesterday, we had the first snow of the year and last night/early hours of this morning, we had a torrential hail storm driven by high winds. Winter has arrived!Here in Frugaldom, we are continually faced with the conundrum of how best to heat the house (and water) within a very strict, very challenging budget. This budget is based on several years of research and analysis, based on various households and their differing financial situations. It has never been about rocket science, it has always been about simple arithmetic and home economics. The interesting part is that my calculation results were always curiously similar, regardless of the level of income to any participating household. Indeed, it would appear that the higher the income, the more chance there was of a higher ratio of debt. Fortunately, many people have started to 'wise up' to this and are now taking cotrol of their own finances.£4,000 FOR A FULL YEAR - IS IT POSSIBLE?Basically, it has to be possible, as there are no other options for some people. If you are interested in how I arrived at the figure, the following is from 2001 and was republished, every bit as relevant, in 2008:LIFESTYLE 1Couple with 2 of a family, husband is a professional who works full time on a salary of £30,000 and wife is a full time mother/homemaker (not sure what the politically correct term for this category is any more!) Total income approx £452 per week including Child Benefit. Mortgage & Buildings insurance - £740 per month = £170 per weekCouncil Tax/Water - £125 per month = £24 per week2 cars, both on HP - £300 per month = £70 week2 x road tax, insurance, servicing, petrol/diesel etc = £270 per month = £62 weekCredit cards - £100 per month = £23 weekBank loan - £100 per month = £23 weekTotal expenditure before actual living expenses - £372 per week Remaining Balance - £80/week for everything elseLIFESTYLE 2Couple with 2 of a family, husband works full time, wife part time, joint salary of £18,000 plus Child Benefit, total income approx £300 per weekMortgage & Buildings insurance - £303 per month = £70 weekCouncil Tax/Water - £100 per month = £23 weekHome Improvement loan - £266 per month = £61 weekCredit/HP - £100 per month = £23 weekOther debts - £100 per month = £23 weekCar - road tax, insurance, servicing, fuel etc - £100 per month = £23 weekTotal expenditure before actual living expenses - £223Remaining Balance - £77.00 for everything else(There is a slight difference in today's figures in that the above would now qualify for Working Tax and Child Tax Credits, fuel prices and car costs have escalated and mortgage rates have fallen dramatically. Nothing much else has changed over the past 10 years, despite everything. Is it any wonder the country is going to the dogs?)Having analysed many household budgets, it didn't really seem to matter what the annual income was, there always seemed to be a significant difference in the way that income was spent. As an example, a single professional person earning £52,000 a year may well have only £4,000 to actually live off after paying the upkeep of a rather spectacular house, complete with tennis court, swimming pool, fast car, regular entertaining, foreign holidays and paying for a gardener and housekeeper.In 2011, a single young person working fulltime on national minimum wage with rent to pay, keeping in mind they are excluded from Working Tax Credit on accounts of age, may well have far less than £4,000 on which to live. (I'd suggest housesharing or getting a lodger!)TRY TO GET YOURSELF DEBT FREENo matter what your income bracket, we could all be in the same boat. Fortunately, we have the freedom to choose how we stay afloat. No matter what you do or how you do it, you are always going to have to pay the cost of living. If you can reduce the cost of living and clear off ALL debts, then think of the fun you can have from thereon in. Budget to within an inch of your life and see just how much it costs you to live. You can see by the above how I arrived at the £4,000 and hopefully this will make things a little clearer for our newest followers, rather than having to search through at least 5 years' worth of information.NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGED OVER THE PAST 10 YEARSNothing much has changed over those years. Whether we like it or not, £4,000 is the sum total of disposable income that many households have available each year, whether they realise it or not, and this £4,000 needs to cover all the basic costs of running a household, including energy costs. This is where it gets very interesting!HOW MUCH DOES ENERGY COST?This is the beginning of a series of posts analysing the true costs of running a household in the 21st Century. Fuel or energy costs are what divide many of our individial budgets, whether it's a simple case of heating, lighting and power or incorporating the cost of commuting. It all revolves around fuel and energy - every penny we spend may be affected by these prices and I hope to relay the results of several simple, home based, non-scientific experiments in an attempt to help solve their cost-associated problems.WATCH THIS SPACE.NYK Media ~ Frugaldomwww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "The Price of Fuel", "date": "Sunday 4 December 2011", "text": "When it Comes to Heating Versus EatingWinter is almost upon us here in Scotland, with the higher ground already having snow. This is good for the visiting ski enthusiasts but, for us mere frugalers, it means digging deep to ensure we can afford to eat while heating our homes.WHAT ARE OUR CHOICES?The cost of fuel is escalating beyond the reaches of some low paid, rural folks who have few options for finding extra work or securing a cheap, online utilities deal. With no mains gas and roads that are notorious for closing during the harshest winter weather, it leaves few options for the likes of oil tankers getting through to farms and outlying locations if their oil or liquid gas runs out quicker than expected. We are left with one basic option for heat, light and cooking - electricity. There are those who opted to supplement with cylinders of gas, but I'm told these have almost doubled in price recently, leaving many having to look for cheaper alternatives. Indeed, one local supplier is giving up stocking it completely.In the current economic climate, electricity prices have risen to such a level that things like heating, cooking and hot water are becoming luxuries. Many are returning to solid fuel. But even here, prices are dictating the level to which one can afford to heat their home. (It would be fantastic to even consider that the ECAT could be a potential contender for frugalers within the next couple of years!)PRICE OF COAL, LOGS AND ELECTRICITYIn our area, the very cheapest, lowest quality coal is now £12.80 per 50kg bag. A trailer load of logs will cost around £50. Electricity prices work out about 14p to 16p per kWh, unless you have E7 that allows for cheap rate during the night - an option I may, once again, need to consider, despite my loathing of storage heaters.Here in Frugaldom, we live in a small, terraced cottage. We have key-metered mains electricity that now costs £1.75 per week in standing charges and 12.25p per unit. The budget was set for an average 100 units per week, but this has already been breached. £15 per week seems to be seeing us through OK, for now! It covers cooking, lighting, showers and running the computers that enable us to work from home. But temperatures are dropping steadily and we've hardly had a dry day in months - laundry mountain needs to be scaled soon!COST OF HEATING AND HOT WATERThe only form of heating we have is from an open fire with back-boiler, which can heat the water and 3 radiators. Keeping that fire going long enough to do both for a sufficient length of time is costing us around £25 per week between coal and logs, so that's now £40 per week on power/fuel!HEATING V EATINGOverall, I have allocated £1,345 of my £4,000 budget in 2012 to electricity, coal and logs. That's 33.62% of the entire frugal living challenge budget! The grocery budget, on the other hand, is less than £25 per week, at £1,250 including toiletries, laundry and cleaning products! SAVING ON COAL AND LOGSIn true frugal fashion, I rescued a couple of bricks from inside an old storage heater and have placed these at either side of the fire grate, reducing the overall size of the burning area and, thus, lessening the amount of coal or wood needed at any given time. By doing this, I have managed to keep within this £40 per week limit, but the unheated kitchen is becoming colder and colder! The new roof hasn't yet been insulated, there's no ceiling and the back door and windows still need to be replaced. For this reason, I now also have an electric convector heater plugged in, set on 'frost', so it switches on for just long enough to keep the temperature from dropping to zero degrees.INSULATION OPTIONSInsulation is paramount i the quest to retain heat, so a great deal of time and effort has been put into deciding what type to fit into the flat kitchen roof. Don't expect help in covering the costs of insulation, as all the wonderful 'free' offers are for specific groups within society - none of which are us! If you choose to support yourself by working from home, have no young children, illnesses, disabilities or pensioners in your household and aren't in receipt of specific state benefits, you can forget financial help from the Government subsidised agencies. Likewise, if your home is of an older, stone built type, there are limitations in how and where you can insulate - again exempting many from help. My best advice is go it alone and, in the event you ever receive any grants or freebies, accept the bonus and bank the savings for the next rainy day disaster that is sure to come along sooner or later.GOING GREEN, SHEEPS WOOL INSULATIONFrugal living does not lend itself to pursuing a green or eco-friendly lifestyle, that's for sure! While the big, commercial DIY stores offer subsidised glass fibre insulation at £2 per roll, there are few alternatives for the more consciencious house renovators. It's a similar story with things like installing a living roof, solar panels, a wind turbine or a water wheel.Insulation - I priced Celotex and Kingspan type boards, which many suggest are the best available, then I compared these to environmentally friendly sheeps wool. The insulation qualities between these boards and natural sheeps wool were very similar, but both cost a fortune and both would still need to be boarded over with the new ceiling... so I've gone green on this issue and am supporting the British wool market - I've placed my order for Black Mountain Sheeps Wool. Better still, it actually worked out over 25% cheaper than the builders' merchant delivered prices for Celotex. It even beat eBay prices for surplus to requirement stock! I am happy paying my £45 + VAT delivery charge from Wales, I'd have stayed local had there been a reputable, affordable supplier, but there isn't!What else has happened during by prolonged absence, for which I apologise. Sudden deaths are never something we are fully prepared for, regardless of how hard we try to prepare ourselves and protect ourselves against every eventuality. But that's a whole different story that warrants a blog post of its own, with a frank and honest look at what devastation, financial or otherwise, can occur in its wake.THE COST OF RENOVATING A RURAL COTTAGEThe new back door and window have both been ordered, the joiner instructed to start three weeks ago (and he still hasn't returned!) and I'm now contemplating what type of woodburning stove to invest in for next winter. Everything takes time, especially when you live in the country. None of the local tradesmen seem to be in any particular hurry to secure extra work. Let's face it - they can cover a huge area, travel time eats into working hours and there's always someone closer to home needs work doing. Then there's always the bad weather, affecting work outdoors. I'm hoping our latest joiner won't fail us, but he is almost 3 weeks late for starting the door. In fairness, it's hardly stopped raining in all that time, so he's probably doing warmer, drier work inside someone else's fixy-up house.CUTTING COSTSOur initial survey estimated £15,000 for the essential remedial works, excluding interior fixtures, fittings and decor etc, but we hope to complete for less than £10,000 by salvaging and reusing whatever we can, while making the most of local freecycle and exchange trading groups. Even these things are difficult when you choose to follow the Frugaldom route, because the local population is spread so thinly across such a wide area that it's seldom you spot a 'bargain' that won't actually cost you more in petrol or diesel to go and collect it! Few and far between rings true on this count. Thank goodness for the Internet and home deliveries, that's all I can say!DON'T FORGET TO FACTOR IN CAR COSTS!I often get asked why we don't simply collect our own firewood or shop in the larger supermarkets, but making such obvious choices aren't economically viable. It could take the best part of a day to make the 100+ mile round trip to the nearest Asda Walmart or Tesco superstore. And when driving a smaller, more economical car, it makes it impossible to hitch up a trailer and lug a tonne of freshly cut timber home to try and chop it then store it for 12 to 18 months before it's seasoned and ready for use. These are the types of things that many townsfolk forget to consider before selling up and shipping out into the country to live their perceived good life of near self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency simply does not exist. We all need money. Setting up a new lifestyle costs money. Pursuing that lifestyle costs money. It is a very expensive mistake to make if you don't find this out until after you've relocated and all your savings have gone. Thankfully, I've never done the city-dwelling, high-flying career lifestyle, so budgeting, for me, is par for my chosen course. I have, however, experienced how quickly it can all go very wrong.LUXURY IN FRUGALDOMNonetheless, I set myself another challenge to earn a little extra from my writing and have now afforded myself the luxury of splashing out on my expensive, environmentally-friendly, sheeps wool insulation. Renovation work in the kitchen should resume soon, without Christmas shopping causing any adverse effect on the spending. Frugaldom should have a snug kitchen before this winter ends, but I'd like to think we could achieve this even before this increasingly late winter begins!Edited in - I spoke too soon! The snow has begun falling in Frugaldom!NYK MediaFrugal Living Challenge"},

Bearing in mind the average age of the veterans is 90 plus, it’s hardly surprising. Regrettably, failing health is taking its toll. This will probably be the last such visit for this group of people, so John wants to make absolutely sure that every Far East veteran out there is aware of this tour. Subject to Big Lottery terms and conditions, the trip will be covered by lottery funding, to the value of £1800.00. An equal amount could be given for an accompanying relative and/or carer.

With the veterans' average age being around 90, we were conscious of the fact that the chances of these fine, esteemed gentlemen returning here again were quite slim. Our pre tour efforts involved spending weeks on extensive and exhaustive letter writing and PR, as well as pleas for cooperation from sympathetic ex-pats. We managed to put together a special, genuinely unique tour, which we can say with total modesty would be hard to emulate by any other tour planner anywhere, not to mention keeping it within a tight budget. Our tour price came to £1800.00. The only similar tour we could find, without all the add-ons we provided, amounted to £2500.00 The result of our really hard work bore fruit by way of locating the “Wanderers” Rugby Club in Singapore, to which we are eternally grateful. Made up of tough ex-pats working in Singapore, they provided a 42 seater luxury coach (solely at our disposal) and, as a surprise, arranged a special trip for us to “Raffles” with all expenses covered, including the best champagne. To their credit and our appreciation, the “Wanderers” also arranged an afternoon for us at the world famous Singapore “British Club”, which often receives heads of state including our own Royal Family. The rooftop lounge was opened specially and the entire afternoon was devoted exclusively to the veterans and their accompanying families. ﻿﻿We communicated with the British Embassy and were present at their memorial service alongside the Gurkha contingent.

James, who is an an ex-pat, and his charming wife looked after the vets throughout. James and Noi gave up their time voluntarily to cater and organise all the localised trips and absolutely everything was laid on by this wonderful couple. I am eternally grateful to them, as well as to Mathew in Singapore, for taking some of the strain off me.

With the price of a tin of baked beans in tomato sauce creeping up and up, I decided it was time to get to grips with making my own. I already bake all the bread for the household, so why not make what goes over the top of it when it's toasted? Cheap baked beans are becoming tasteless, bland and uninteresting!This was a bit of an experiment, as I was too lazy to search out a recipe for the sauce, but it worked. In fact, it worked so well that we had eaten our tasty lunch before I even remembered that I should have taken a photograph for the recipe blog! I'll try to remember next time.Dried Cannellini beans had been on offer at 49p per 500g pack, so, when the opportuity arose, I 'invested' in 4 packs. As dried foods go, this type of foodstuff lasts a long, long time, so 'sell by' and 'best before' dates can pretty much be ignored.I soaked a cupful of the dried beans overnight in cold water, then rinsed them off in the morning before setting them to boil rapidly in a pan of water for about 10 minutes. (Do not salt the water, as this is said to toughen the bean skins as they cook.)After boiling them, reduce the heat and simmer for around an hour and a half. Had I been making a larger quantity, I would probably transfer them into the slow cooker and simmer them that way, but I find there's little or no difference in price of electricity used when comparing cooker-top simmering to slow cooking, especially when using small quantites.Once cooked, drain and rinse the beans then set them aside while you make the sauce.For the sauce, I cheated. I had jars of cheap pasta sauce in stock (cheaper than tinned chopped tomatoes), so I used the following to make the sauce:100g of cannellini beans (9.8p)1/2 jar Sainsbury's Basic pasta sauce (9p)tablespoon of tomato puree (4.5p)teaspoon of sugar (4.4p)1/2 teaspoon salt (0.2p)Total cost - 27.9pAll of the above were mixed together - sample the sauce so you can make any adjustments to flavour, then add the beans.The above was left to cool then refrigerated overnight, as we didn't need them on the day. This, afterall, was just an experiment on a small scale.Today we had toast with the beans topped with grated cheese (50g cheddar cheese - 28.4p) and thoroughly enjoyed them. I do realise that for many it is easy to just nip to the nearest supermarket and pay around the same price for store's own basic brand of baked beans, but when you live 20 miles from the nearest supermarket and follow the code of frugal living, popping to the shop isn't an option. To be honest, I think the homemade variety tasted much nicer than any shop-bought baked beans I've ever bought.I can recommend Frugaldom beans to anyone. The herbs from the jar of pasta sauce added that extra flavour and, I'm guessing, also added a couple more vitamins to the mix. It's probably what turned the Frugaldom version of beans on toast into a frugal gourmet lunch for two.

In stock. Dispatched from and sold by Amazon.co.uk The above most definitely says 1.25kg (Pack of 3), doesn't it? And at £7.17 (£0.64/ kg) then there should be a total of approx 11.2kg or 3 x (3 x 1.25kg) right?Here in Frugaldom, everything gets done on a budget - it's part of our frugal living attempts, so the way we spend our money means everything when trying to live within our means, make some savings and cut costs.I normally buy store's own basic cat biscuits, currently costing around 99p per kilo. When checking on Amazon, I was delighted to find value cat biscuits quoted at 64p per kilo! My cat isn't fussy, she eats mice, for goodness' sake, she's hardly going to grumble at a downshift from Aldi to a value 'brand'.I ALMOST fell for the above offer! (Or could this be a regular con, I now wonder?)The product was in my basket and en route to the checkout before I noticed my potential mistake! 1.25kg x 3 = 3.75kg. At a total cost of £7.17, wouldn't that make the product £1.91 per kilo and NOT, as advertised, £0.64 per kilo? In order for the product to be 64p per kilo, the overall weight would need to be 11.2kg, which is almost three times the stated amount, but I can't find anywhere saying that you are buying 3 x (3 x 1.25kg) and don't see anywhere to query this. Can anyone tell me exactly what I would be buying if I bought the above product?Have I completely missed something important? I emailed Amazon to ask, as it clearly states £0.64 per kilo on the Amazon.co.uk listing and soon received this response:Hello xxxx,Thank you for contacting Amazon.co.uk with your enquiry.I understand that you would like to know how many pack you would receive on purchasing \"Country Value Complete Dry Cat Food\". After looking into your enquiry I found that you will receiving 3 X 1.25 kg only and not 3 X (3 X 1.25 kg). If you have any other questions please contact us using the link below. (link removed)Thank you for your interest in Amazon.co.ukDid I solve your problem?As you can guess, this did NOT solve my problem - my problem is that the details on their website is clearly WRONG! So back I go again, to repeat what I have already explained quite clearly to them the first time and await a satisfactory response! The following has been sent:***Further to your response... no, your answer did not solve my problem. I have included your response at the end of this email.My problem is, I want to buy value cat food at £0.64p per kg, as described on your website at http://www.amazon.co.uk/Country-Value-Complete-Food-1-25/dp/B004H1LYEY/ but either the item description or pricing is WRONG! If I order this product, it is going to cost me £1.91 per kilo, which is NOT value. Once again, I ask you to confirm the number of packs and this time the total weight of the product as sold, as the description clearly states £0.64p per kilo, which means there must be 3 x (3 x 1.25kg)***Once again, I await their response and can only hope that they have, indeed, made a mistake and that there isn't an underlying trend of misselling such products on what I had come to rely on as a reputable, reliable, trustworthy company!Edited in: It's now 6th December. Cat food was duly delivered (and grossly overcharged) and a apology with refund of £4.50 given. That's fine for me, but I just checked their website and see that they have left the mistake on there. I wonder how many people will notice it. I feel a 'customer review' coming on...NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Teaching Money Matters in School - WHY?", "date": "Saturday 19 November 2011", "text": "Home Economics + Basic Arithmetic = Good Kousekeeping!Shona Prophett gets into her stride on the state of the nation.I've been watching the recent news and developments with regards to the petitions that are floating around the place. They are plying us with reasons to pledge our support to their cause, asking us to help bring money matters into schools as part of our basic education system. To be frank, I just don't get it!School is a place for children learning the basics needed for their future adult lives, isn't it? These lessons are simple, they establish an elementary understanding of subjects that are important to everyone during future careers, regardless of what that career may or may not be. We can choose to listen and learn or we can tolerate these 'lessons' up until the point we have the freedom of choice to leave school and learn in another capacity - through life itself.Some may see school simply as a place where children get sent during the day so they aren't wandering the streets with nothing better to do, biding their time until they are old enough to earn. School, like nursery, could even be seen as a place where children go so their parents can carry out activities other than childcare, like earning an income or anything else they see fit to do in the absence of their offspring.Whatever any of us thinks of school, it is our right to have a basic education and our duty to provide similar for future generations. But it is not our duty to accept responsibility for the bad spending habits of others. We each receive a basic understanding of reading, writing and arithmetic, along with the simple concept of economics, be they home or otherwise, so common sense should prevail. But it doesn't!Those who should know more than us have burdened this society with false beliefs that we should all be classed as equals, that we should all be able to partake of a decent meal, own designer labels, buy the most up to date gadgetry and possess all manner of luxury items. We should all be able to afford hobbies, pastimes and holidays, convenience and luxury should be readily available, en masse.They led us to believe that we could all own our own homes and have the basic skills necessary to turn us into entrepreneurs or even just start our own businesses. But they overlooked one fundamental flaw in the plan - the fact that money is not a living entity. It cannot grow naturally, it cannot adapt to its surroundings and it cannot learn right from wrong. It is nothing more than paper, plastic and metal developed, manufactured and controlled by the chosen few who, to their disgrace, have been unable to balance the nations' books. The concept is simple - take one pile of money, divide it be any number to whom you see fit to lend, then sit back and watch them pay dividends, by way of interest. If those payments fail, charge even more, add on penalties and drive the borrowers further into debt. Offer an array of incentives and promises of a better future, more security, better choices and the potential to feel good and then sit back, watch the borrowers borrow more and spend more, lining the pockets of the chosen few or those who chose to become one of them by sheer grit and determination. They all seem to have one thing in common - a total disregard for others when things, not surprisigly, go wrong. But there are always the 'get out' clauses of insolvency and bankruptcy!This continual building of debt has now escalated to such a height that even they cannot fathom out an agreeable method to stopping it, let alone putting it right. Their solutions are to print more money, cut back on what they think is 'unneccessary' spending and make it even more difficult for 'normal' people to build real, reputable businesses that can grow to prosper and employ others.They price ordinary people out of the market with legislation governing maternity pay, paternity pay, pension schemes, insurances, restricted working hours and minimum wage thresholds, then sit back and await the next emergency move. But where do they go when all the previous options fail? They need to cast blame further and wider, so now we see the blame being laid on the children... If the youth of today and the common people had learned more, this may never have happened. Well that is bullshit! Those who dragged this nation to its proverbial knees were the very people who allegedly benefited from extra education. All their accumulated wealth of wisdom and expertise led us to where we are now, watching and waiting for the next global catastrophe that can quickly be assigned a few billion that adds to the amassed debt. They need huge tragedies, wars and disasters, so future generations can look back on history and point the finger of blame in any direction except that which is true. Nobody appears to have shoulders broad enough to support the burden of controlling what really cannot be controlled, so let's start again - educate the young.To whom should we look for this teaching?How and why are the current teaching methods allegedly failing us so badly? Controlling a company, household or personal budget is nothing more than a combination of basic arithmetic and home economics, so why are so many people so bad at it? Why isn't a closer look being taken at the education system itself? Why are teachers failing to teach the basic principles of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division?Why are parents failing to teach their children the basic skills necessary for survival in a capitalist society?Is it not possible that some form of brainwashing has swept through our entire Western civilisation, engulfing an entire generation, and that generation is not the youth of today! Nor even is it their parents' nor their grand parents' generations.There has always been poverty, unrest, unfair division and class differences. YES! I dare to suggest that we still live within a 'Class' system and I dare to deny the existence of this so-called 'classless society' or equality that was dreamt up by some 'numpty' who thought the only way to cast off blame from those who should have known better, would be to invite society's minions into their lifestyle of wanton greed and waste - offer them more credit, hold them down by debt, if they come out fighting, let them take the blame when it all goes wrong.So, I guess what I am trying to say here is that, in my humble opinion, people won't learn lessons that they don't want to learn, even if it is taught in schools. Brainwashing is everywhere - it's called advertising! Unless we ignore all of that and accept that debt is caused by spending more than we have, then what gets taught in our schools matters not one jot. It is up to us, as individuals, to challenge ourselves to live within our means and if speculative investments need to be made, have a back up plan in the event you don't quite pull it off in time.Shona Prophettwww.shonaprophett.co.uk"},
{"title": "When Running Frugal Forums and Blogs...", "date": "Thursday 17 November 2011", "text": "Who Reads What, When and Why?Specially posted for 'someone'.I couldn't decide whether this post should be included here or in the likes of the Paranoid Times blog. The topic is a rather curious one but I am sure it's a familiar one to some of you reading this.Blogs are normally more likened to diarie, but I disagree strongly with this comparison.  Diaries always conjure up images of secrets contained within private writings, innermost thoughts set down in print for the benefit of the writer, little thought ever being given to any other eventual readers. Not so with blogs - they are for all the world to find and explore, should anyone be at all interested in searching. Here is where things begin to get a little more different. Recently, a discussion sprang up about lack of followers, comments and/or sales, despite the invisible number-crunching programmes churning out figures that suggested thousands of visitors.With blogs, forums and websites, you can invite any number of people to visit, join or contribute but the truth of the matter is, few will! Regardless of whether they be a friend, relative or, even, spouse, few of these people will actively support your 'cause' for the simple fact that your 'cause' may not necessarily be theirs.So let's look at how the figures pan out, as I do happen to have a websites, some forums and several blogs. Most are used purely as free space for writing about things I would like to keep for future reference, or for the purposes of checking back to see what progress has been made on certain projects, when and where. Some are relevant to what's being discussed elsewhere but, owing to their nature, such diverse topics cannot be mixed together. None of these things is aimed at generating traffic by way of the general public. Should they choose to read, they are welcome to do so. This blog is for all, it's where I give away the secrets of my money saving, frugal lifestyle, but it is not about footfall through a virtual business gateway.Back to the numbers - I recently opened up the Frugaldom forums to the public, so we now have a slowly growing 'membership'. It's free, so anyone can join at anytime. But of those who choose to join, how many are brave enough to step up to the mark and declare their interest in money saving and frugal living? How many are brave enough to post on the forums, comment in the blogs or physically interact with others, most of whom are there for the exact same reasons?To date, 436 usernames have been registered on the newest frugal living forums. Of these, I deleted 176 (40.3%) because they failed to complete the joining process . This leads me to believe they are spammers or electronic, automated 'visitors' sent to infest the forum with links to websites that I wouldn't want there in the first place. Of the 260 'active' users, only 97 (37.3%) of them have ever posted to acknowledge their presence.Of the 97 who posted, only 28 (28.9%) of them return to post regularly. This is what I refer to as the true conversion rate - 28 posters out of a possible 97.THIS IS A FANTASTIC RESULT!BUT... how many of these 28 people are longstanding family friends or relatives? Not a single one!This post has been thrown together to demonstrate how the numbers game really works - I have nothing to hide, nothing to sell and I don't track visitors to my forums, so there could be a million readers and I would never know they were there unless they took the time to register or participate in the discussions. If you are in the business of generating yourself some income, you need to spread the word far and wide then monitor every real visitor. You need to analyse what percetage of these visitors are spending their hard earned cash while visiting your site or business. As a general rule of thumb, many marketing, advertising and sales professionals would accept 0.5% as an average result for something like a leaflet drop, while others spend a little more time preparing their leaflets - normally paying extra for sales copywriting - and look towards around 2.5%, assuming they have done their homework and targetted their advertising. It doesn't take a genius to work out that in order to have thousands flocking to buy your product or service, you need to remember that your chances of turning a casual passer-by into a visitor (or reader) can be around 1 in 200 and then you still need to convert your visitors into paying customers or clients. Agai, this can be as low as 1 in 200. That's like one sale from every 40,000 website visitors!What has this all got to do with Frugaldom or the frugal living and working brigade? Most of us are self-employed and/or working from home. We all need to earn a living and the depressing fact is that it's not always easy. The hours can be long, the hourly rate once calculated over each year can be a joke and the prospect of fame and riches isn't somthing often considered; those things don't drop into your lap purely with a stroke of luck.The Frugaldom blog is about showing, by example, that fame and riches aren't always the best rewards. The sense of achievement and the freedom to pursue our own goals within our own budgets are what matters most to us. The integration of the concept of frugaleurs - entrepreneurs who have little or no debt/financial backing - is something completely new to many. It is my hope that dreams can be realised, even fortunes made, but without being indebted to a system that seems to prefer keeping the majority of people trapped by debt.Be all you can be, set yourself free from the constraits of escalating credit or debt, speculate within your means if you have to, but be prepared to do whatever it takes (within the eyes of the law) to succeed and live a happy life, because we get only one shot at it...That shot is now.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Spiced Sesame Seed and Sultana Cookies", "date": "Friday 11 November 2011", "text": "It's Time to Make Further Savings, So Let's Get Baking.Having decided that November should be a 'use it up' month, rather than a 'main grocery shop' month, I have been busy using up whatever I can in an effort to reduce the stockpile of food in our house.The main reason for doing this is to ensure that I stay within my £4,000 annual budget, as per the annual Frugaldom Challenge but in trying to do that, we always run out of something. Milk is the main thing needed, along with the occasional chicken, but I have plenty of bacon and at least 3 pheasants in the freezer, so we won't starve. We're slowly working our way through the garden vegetables, rhubarb and apples that had all been blanched or stewed and then frozen and I have plenty of dried goods, like pasta, rice and pulses.The loss of the hens has been a bit of a blow, as we'd become accustomed to always having eggs to fall back on when a quick meal was required. Today's meagre offerings amounted to one solitary egg, laid by one of the bantams that survived the mink attack! This is the first egg that has been laid since that day - 15th October - so I'm hoping it's a sign of more to come. If only the ducks would start laying soon. But I digress.Having friends visit for coffee most weeks means it can get a little embarrassing with no biscuits to offer, so today's household challenge was to rake about in the cupboards and see what could be turned into cookies in time for this weekend's visitations.The following is my basic cookie recipe:8 rounded tablespoons flour4 tablespoons margarine (melted)2 tablespoons sugar1.5 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon salt1 eggHaving that solitary egg was a blessing, I can tell you!To the above, I added:6 tablespoons of sultanas 2 heaped tablespoons sesame seedsQuarter teaspoon mixed spiceQuarter teaspoon cinnamonExtra sprinkle of sugarMix everything together until it forms a soft dough that can be easily split and rolled into ballsThis should be enough for 36 cookies. Roll each into a ball, flatten them between palms and then place them on a floured tray. I prefer to have the trays sprinkled with flour rather than greasing them - they're easier cleaned if you haven't any hot water.Bake at 200C for around 15-18 minutes, depending on how thick you made them. At this point, I switch off the oven and leave the biscuits in there for about 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer onto wire cooling trays, where the biscuits will dry and crisp up a bit. (Always best to taste them while they're still hot, though, lest they all get scoffed before you get the chance to sit down with a cuppa.)Cookies are so easy to make. You can add just about anything you like into the basic mix - chocolate chips (add a tablespoon of chocolate powder as well, if you want to make them double choc chip), dried fruit, nuts, porridge oats, berries, seeds, coconut, sweets, toffee chips, muesli, ginger, spice, cinnamon, fudge pieces, Smarties, M&Ms ... If you want extra luxury, you can coat the cookies in chocolate. If you want chunky cookies, roll larger pieces of the mix and just flatten them down a little.If you want many, many frugal cookies, roll them thin and bake them for a shorter time, or else slow bake them at a lower temperature if you want wafer thin, crispy biscuits.Right, that's the cookie baking taken care of for this weekend and it has saved me from spending any money buying biscuits from the shop. Result!Let me know if you try these and what you added to yours.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Insulating a Flat Roof...", "date": "Tuesday 8 November 2011", "text": "... From the Inside!Having replaced the flat roof above our kitchen, we've now ripped down the internal ceiling - sounds a bit of a weird way of doing things, but the weather wasn't in our favour when the roof was being done and we couldn't do without the kitchen at the time, nor could we risk water into the electrics. Now, however, we are left with a dilemma - what type of insulation should we use?The insulation will need to be fitted from the inside before the new ceiling goes up, so this does make things a little bit more complicated: the insulation needs to be held in place until the new plasterboard gets fixed and, just to complicate things more, these jobs may not be possible to do on the same day.Insulation is really important in as far as holding in the heat during our freezing Scottish winters and the recent weather has done nothing to help things along. Now that the frost has arrived, we need to work quickly to beat the big freeze that is bound to arrive soon.Insulation, insulation, insulation... slabs, butts, rolls, Celotex, Kingspan, Rockwool, Thermafleece, EcoTherm, Space Blanket... ? I don't really want glass fibre or cheap and nasty, but costs for anything else are ridiculous for such an essential component of our renovation project! And what's worse is the fact that this is just the first room! We have no insulation at all at the moment.Keep in mind that this is for a kitchen, so there will be extra heat generated from cooking that I'd prefer not to lose straight up through a flat roof. There will also be steam, which could cause condensation if we don't do the job right.Whatever I choose, it will probably be fitted above foil-backed plasterboard and then decorated. We probably won't plaster the ceiling, prefering to employ a more frugal, Scottish process known as 'Ames Taping', then simply decorating over the top. I haven't decided on any interior decor, yet. That's way down the list of priorities. The immediate problem is settling on what type of insulation to use, when I would prefer NOT to use the cheap and nasty glass fibre variety.This blog post is now open for debate and comment... what type of insulation do you think would be the best to suit our purpose? From an ecological point of view, I would love to use the environmentally friendly sheep wool, like Thermafleece.For ease of fitting, thermal boards such as Kingspan or Celotex would be an obvious choice. All of the above are expensive in comparison to the 'cheap and nasty' subsidised rolls of insulation that are currently available at 'buy one, get 3 free', IF you live anywhere near a stockist. We don't! That would be a huge saving, but would I be happy knowing that's what's up there when we're planning on being here for the longterm with the kitchen being the busiest room in the house? From a financial point of view, I can have insulation board delivered, probably free, from our local(ish) builders' merchants, whereas the sheep wool variety is being quoted at £60+ JUST FOR DELIVERY!The boards are far easier to work with in our situation, what with them being installed on the underside of the ceiling, cut to fit and they should stay in place while fitting the plasterboard. It makes me wonder if 100mm polystyrene would be simpler to use.Why is sheep wool so expensive when farmers are constantly complaining that they're only getting about 50p per fleece at shearing time?Are the terms 'green' and 'eco-friendly' just new-age speak for 'expensive'?Why is it so impossible to be green AND frugal?Your recommendations or feedback on this matter would be greatly appreciated. The job has to be done soon, the kitchen renovation 'savings pot' is about to be emptied and I don't really want to regret my choice a few winters down the line.If any insulation supplier would like to sponsor the Frugaldom kitchen roof project, I'll happily dedicate this post to your company and ensure that all SEO tactics are employed to your full advantage! :)NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "A Little Bit More Progress", "date": "Monday 7 November 2011", "text": "Frugaldom House to Home Project ProgressIt's now been five months since we moved into our 'fixy-up' and we've reached a point where a little bit more work can be done in order to make the place completely wind and watertight. We were also blessed with a pleasant surprise, when we discovered that the kitchen ceiling was nowhere near as bad as we had been expecting to find it.Today, after getting the bathroom window properly sealed in, work began on stripping out the old kitchen and back hallway ceiling. For whatever reason, this part of the house, which we think is a conversion from old stables, had been sheeted out in thick chip board and then covered in polystyrene tiles.Owing to the fire hazard that is polystyrene, all the tiles were ripped from throughout the entire house before even moving in, but the chipboard had to remain in place. To be honest, I was dreading it all coming down in case it revealed rotten timbers!By lunchtime today, all the old wood had been pulled down to reveal the sarking, which is in surprisingly good condition. Only one part where most of the water had been running in over the previous couple of years, when the property was empty, looks like needing replaced. Savings, savings, savings! I love savings!This is what got ripped out today.Imagine if any of that lot had come down on someone's head? Eek! It's almost completely dried out so, assuming we have no rain overnight, this will get chopped up as firewood and stored for using over winter. It should have been done this afternoon, but someone stole all the daylight hours from beneath our very noses!Our street is a very quiet street. It's normal for it to be quiet, except for the minute we decide to start moving anything out there! As luck would have it, the freight lorry arrived to collect several boxes of books that were being shipped out, at the exact same time as the log delivery arrived. And this was just as 'Ratty' was trying to get all his tools packed into the back of his car after finishing the kitchen work. We had a queue of vehicles lining the tiny street waiting to get to our door!Tools all packed and away, boxes all shunted out into the lorry and then it was straight to work unloading the logs by hand from friend's trailer, along with a load of wood chips for the duck runs. It didn't take too long, but then there was the barrowing of it all around to the back of the house before stacking it. It took only about an hour to shift everything to where it is supposed to be but, suffice to say, lunch turned out to be a very, very late affair. Thank goodness for homemade pea and ham soup and some freshly baked bread.The contents of the kitchen were returned to their rightful places and then the joiner phoned - to say he would be here tomorrow to measure up the kitchen window and back door. Keep in mind that we haven't even managed to get around to having a letter box installed in the new front door or manage to get around to glossing it, let alone have thought of ordering the window that the joiner is going to be fitting! Never mind, at least we are quite cosy with the fire blazing, the water heating and the radiators all being warmed by the same logs. I can't wait to get the new log burner, but that's a whole different challenge for 2012.Our log store has now been refilled and there's a spare pile by the back door, as well as those now stacked either side of the fireplace, so this should keep us going for the remainder of the year - I hope!The 2011 Frugaldom Challenge budget of £4,000 has now been reduced to £687.36The 'Everything Else Kitty' is in deficit by £609.71 with no prospect of egg sales since the 'wee minky bandit' incident. (Not bad considering that includes the house move and emergency repairs.)There's enough vouchers, points and spare change in the Christmas kitty to cover gift buying this year.The fixy-up (bought and paid for) is well on its way to becoming our 'forever' home. The next challenge is to cover the costs of insulating and replacing the kitchen & back hallway ceilings, upgrading the electrics in that part of the house, replacing the door and window 'like for like' (which involves having a wooden door made to measure) and then making the most of all that until next year. That's when the real work will begin - doing repairs that others will actually be able to see, like new log burner heating system, interior plasterboard walls, ceilings and proper floors.Now I need to find the best deal on sheeps' wool insulation, a letter box and a matching set of door handles.

The first frost arrived here two nights ago with the plummeting temperatures, but clear skies also mean sunshine, so that's an added bonus. If only it could reach the washing line by the back door for long enough to dry the laundry!As we tumble through the final quarter of 2011, my mind has been wandering mora and more to the 2012 frugal living and moneysaving challenges that lie ahead of us. With so many price increases, the budget is being stretched beyond all recognition.In 2007, running a household on £4,000 really was a dawdle, thinking back on it. Over the following five years, I pulled the purse strings tighter and tighter, cramming more and more ito that same budget, squirreling away every available penny that could be saved. It paid handsomely. By 2008, I was debt free and piling all those extra pennies, that soon became pounds, into savings pots for all manner of items and events. Daughter's 21st birthday brought a joint-celebration by way of her engagement. We catered for over 100 friends and relatives, bringing two families into one and spreading the costs to make it a party night to remember. There was also a housemove for us, after the sudden death of our thirty-something year old landlord.The following year, there was the big wedding. Again, everyone pulled together and bride and groom had a wonderful day spent with all their friends and family, before a good old shindig in the evening.The year after that was son's 21st, but he opted for money towards his car, which was probably for the best, as he really needs that for travelling to and from work. (Country living has its drawbacks, especially when it comes to employment and proximity to towns, with regards to fuel costs.)That brought us up to 2010, when we really thought we were getting on top of things with the savings. By then, there was a grandchild scheduled for arrival. She duly arrived on Hogmanay, in good time to herald in the New Year.So far in 2011 - what can I say?We had a few problems over Christmas and New Year involving neighbours,  landlords and their out of control dogs. Anyone who has been following Frugaldom will know the stories, anyone else will need to trace back the blogs to find out more. In summary, H lost his income, the car packed in completely, meaning it had to be scrapped, and we were served an eviction notice that involved all sorts of to-ing and fro-ing between lawyers. The positive outcome of all that was that we had the freedom to say 's*d the lot of you', cash in the savings and buy this house.We moved in here at the start of June 2011. As you'll have seen by previous posts, the house was more of a wet shell, but it was affordable, it has a spectacular garden space and there's huge potential for development both outside and in, so we fell for the dream and leapt at the opportunity without as much as a sideways glance.In the beginning, we had no plumbing - all the pipes had burst over the two winters the place had lain empty. But we have a stream running through the bottom of our garden, so we had the pleasure of making frequent trips to and from that stream collecting buckets of water to enable us to 'flush' the toilet. It was fun while the sun was shining, when it rained we needed the buckets to catch the water that was running through the back roof.It's now November and we have been in here for 5 months. We now have safe electricity, all the plumbing we require and a serviceable backboiler behind the open fire that heats the water and three radiators. We also have a window in our bathroom, a front door and a solid roof over the kitchen. Life is grand: We simply need a ceiling and a back door to complete the elementary repair works. Tomorrow sees the start of the next phase - pulling down the old kitchen ceiling.With savings depleted, the £4,000 per year challenge will need to continue but I am making one small concession - an extra £1,000 in 2012 so I can incorporate the Council Tax. If anyone else would like to join me in the next year, challenging your household to some frugal living and moneysaving, you'll find all the details in the frugal living forums via http://www.frugaldom.com/ There are challenges for almost everything moneysaving you can conceive, from saving loose change to homemade ifts and growing your own vegetables. We have challenges about how to earn more money as well as how to cut costs on most things we need in life. It promises to be a very interesting year ahead and I would love it if a few more would join our merry band of frugal heroes. Make the most of your money, get rid of your debts and start saving for the future you really want. Don't put off starting or risk missing an opportunity, be prepared to take life as you find it and make it into something good. Life is too short for stalling the start of your dreams.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},

{"title": "Pursuing Frugal Goals", "date": "Sunday 30 October 2011", "text": "The Quest for Good Living ContinuesIt's been a very hectic and sad past couple of weeks, especially since the sudden death of my dad. He, too, was a forum and blog fan, although his feathered friends were racing pigeons, rather than hens, ducks and quail. Dad had a great send off last Friday, supported by literally hundreds of friends, colleagues and fellow pigeon enthusiasts who turned out alongside the family. I know for a fact that he'll be sadly missed by many.Life continues, we all pick up the pieces and soldier on towards our own destinies. We can do no more than our best to ensure we enjoy life to the fullest during our brief time as mortals on this earth. But in true frugal spirit, it is always best to be prepared.The clocks have changed, we have now officially left British Summer Time behind and are approaching the most expensive time of the year here - winter! Temperatures are already plunging in Scotland, with the first frosts and snow of the year having touched down in the northern parts. Energy prices have risen, once again, forcing many to cut back on heating - never a good idea, in my opinion. I'm still ever hopeful that the E-Cat will eventually prove to be a commericial success and help us all reduce energy costs.Having only an open fire to heat the Frugaldom household, I'm pleased to say that the new pump, mended pipes and replacement valves are all doing a great job of powering three radiators and heating our water. Coal is costly, as are seasoned logs, but these things shouldn't need to be looked upon as luxury items. It is our right to be able to afford some comfort in our own homes, even if it does mean following a slightly less than 'gourmet' diet.Nearby, building has resumed on a couple of new houses, so I'm keeping a keen eye on all the pallets of blocks that are being delivered. We love free pallets, so one point of call this coming week is to the building site to ask nicely if they would like us to relieve them of their cast offs. They can only say no. With luck, however, they may let us have them free to chop for firewood - fingers crossed.The log store is emptying fast, so another load of logs will need to be ordered to see out the remainder of this year. At that point, the new 2012 budget will kick in and we'll be off on our merry way, following the next big frugal living challenge.Renovations were temporarily halted this month but, thanks to our local LETS group, I have someone coming to see what work they can help do. I'm expecting them tomorrow morning. The first thing needing done is the new bathroom window to be finished off, sealing out the draughts. Next up will be getting some insulation so we can get a new ceiling fitted in the kitchen. If we can possibly squeeze in a new back door, these three jobs would be sufficient to see us through the winter in a wind and watertight house. (I'd better remember to phone the joiner to let him know what the hold up has been!)I still need to organise a letter box for the front door, but am now loath to allow the joiner to cut a hole in it. Rather than do this, I think I'll invest in a tradition cast iron locking mail box and install it outside. I'm sure there must be some on offer somewhere that are available for home delivery.Tuesday 1st November sees the beginning of Will Aid month. This is an annual event where solicitors volunteer their time and services for the purposes of Will making and then donate the representative fees to one of several participating charities. I'm not sure how much a basic Will normally costs but the suggested donation is £85 for a single Will, so I am going to take the opportunity to get this essential task done. I haven't much to leave family but sharing a jointly owned house could slightly complicates things. Better to be prepared than continually worry about what would happen if...The next bit of preparation will be using up all the bits and pieces I have lurking in the fridge and cupboards in order to make way for new stock. I don't know if it's down to previous work involving the wholesale & retail industries, but stock rotation is important, even in the freezer. Plenty of soup making, baking, pie and stew-making, I should think. These things are all great as winter warmers and save on overall electricity costs when batch cooked.The electric blankets are on the beds and I now need to look out my fleeces for lining the curtains that hang over our single-glazed windows. Draught excluders need replacing and the winter woolies all need airing, so there's plenty to keep me busy.Outside, the garden is looking a little sad and soggy. H has weeded out the Saffron Crocus bed and we still need to lift some potatoes, cut down the sunflowers for drying (if they even got around to seeding) and turn over the makeshift beds before the frost gets here. I have some garlic cloves ready for planting and I'll get the strawberry plants all bedded down in straw. The trees at the bottom of the garden are beginning to look slightly naked - I can now see the cows in the back field! But all those leaves are falling into the hen run, so what's left of our hens have a fun time scratching in them. I'm planning on making a mesh composting cage after reading a simple 'how-to' guide in the Microholding Daily.Since the mink attack, the hens haven't been laying. Nor have they been allowed to freerange. Instead, they can only be allowed out their runs while someone is there to keep an eye on them. This doesn't sit well with my overall plan, so some serious redesign work needs to be done in order to keep them all secure. Unfortunately, this is not a financial priority at the moment, so I'll need to set myself yet another challenge for 2012 - raising enough extra cash to improve the entire chicken run, ensuring nothing can climb or burrow into it. It's quite a big hen run, so it could be a very costly job!If anyone is in need of a blogger, article writer or columnist, get in contact with me and we'll negotiate a frugal rate. My hens need protecting and my surplus savings are only enough to cover the cost of a cheap .22 as part of the Frugaldom vermin control/fur slippers for Christmas plan.Don't forget you can keep up to date with NYK and Frugaldom news via the RSS Feed, where all the blog posts are listed.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "What Have the Romans (Towns) Ever Done for Us?", "date": "Thursday 27 October 2011", "text": "Countryside Living or Town Living?Hi people in Internet Land (T’web and Tinternet for our northern surfers). Good old (not old) Frugaldom, very kindly asked me to write a guest blog. I am incredibly honoured:“Ta, Very much”. Any road, I am the author of a book about baling string: Archie Sparrows Book of Useful Tips to Beat the Recession ....with Baling String. It’s supposed to make you laugh and forget your troubles for a while. The book is also a parody about living on a smallholding with very little money and lots of baling string. Eh? Me telling you that it’s a parody? I am defeating the whole idea that it’s a parody! Aren’t I? You will have to get the book instead of me insulting your intelligence! It’s true though, all fiction is based on fact.Frugaldom asked me to write about my experiences and thoughts of moving from a town to rural life. Hoping that you all might share your thoughts?There’s a scene in one of my favourite films: The Life of Brian. It goes something like this:“All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the freshwater system and public health. What have the Romans ever done for us?”I would replace the word ‘Romans’ with ‘Towns’. Ten years ago I moved from the edge of a city to live in a beautiful rural place next to the sea in Southern Ireland. We live on a smallholding and it’s incredibly peaceful and it’s like living in an oil painting. “Can somebody move that Hay-Wain from out of the water please?”I had never heard of Rural Isolation before I came here. We have no pub, no jobs, no public transport, shops or even milk - although we live near lots of dairy farms. I know I am incredibly lucky to live in the countryside. I can grow my own vegetables and ‘try’ to farm our 16 acres of a few cattle, sheep, pigs, hens, ducks, Jack Russell and a few rats and mice (can I claim for the rodents on my Single Payment form?) and spiders..! Saying that, Frugaldom readers, it would be great to see a band or have a community centre, kebab house, allotments, bar, car boot sale or even watch a football match...? I have heard (Googled) that eighty percent of people in the UK live in urban areas. Also forty percent of the people who move to the countryside return to the towns. Is the countryside really worth living in? Do you have to be a commuter or ‘weekender’, or just be rich to have any quality of life, living in the countryside? Will the small farm have to encourage tourism instead of farming?Why is there no infrastructure in rural areas? Do you think there should be street lights, ‘model' green villages or ‘affordable’ and social housing....? I look forward to your comments.Thanks Frugaldom!   Guest blog by Dave Dealy   NYK Media www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk How Much is 'a Living'?The RavenBy Edgar Allan PoeOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore —While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\"'Tis some visiter,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door —Only this and nothing more.\"The question of earning a living sprang to mind while discussing the differences between town and country life, mainly in the context of earnings and self-employed income. Being a follower of frugal living, I seldom dwell on the prospect of counting my millions, or any other such trivialities for that matter, it is simply a case of survival in a manner found to be acceptable to the society in which we live.The latter may seem irrelevant but, on closer investigation, it is indeed very relevant. The United Kingdom is made up of four countries, each consisting of four completely different social dynamics. Seldom are these differences highlighted when we listen to the idle chit chat and false promises of politicians based in London; what they say can become fairly meaningless to some of us. Some of these people have never been into the countryside, other than for their own political gain or pleasure, protected from what's around them by cash, blinkers and spin. So, without further ado, let us take a closer look at what we all call 'earning a living'.Edgar Allan Poe, in my opinion a fairly dubious character, is said to have been the first 'well-known' American writer to try to earn a living through only writing. This resulted in many financial difficulties, most of which I can fully understand. But cast aside any notion that I should ever compare my own scribblings to those of such famous names. (I have never relied on alcohol, nor have I ever married my 13 year-old cousin, so the comparisons are null and void from the start.) Still, I do wonder how much he needed to earn and what sort of life he was able to afford to lead on his meagre earnings?Living a frugal lifestyle is perfectly normal for me - I know how much I need each month, therefore I need to live within those means to avoid debt, malnutrition and destitution. It's perfectly simple to me, one of the most obvious 'things' to grasp. But we are all different. The villages, towns, cities, counties and countries are all different.\"One man's loss is another man's gain. One man's pleasure is another man's pain.\"In order to earn a living, I need to afford a roof over my head. After years of saving, that roof is bought and paid for, so there's no need to worry about rent or a mortgage. But there's always the council tax. It's compulsory! Let's call it £1,000.00We need heat and light. I live in a fairly chilly part of the UK (Scotland), albeit probably the warmest part of Scotland (deep southwest), but it still rains and it still freezes or gets frosty for at least six months of the year.Let's call it £1,000.00Without food, water and clothing, we would perish. All these things cost money, even if we are tending the garden, microholding or smallholding to grow our own 'edibles'. Preparation and storage costs money. All the extras cost money.Let's call it £1,000.00Living in a rural location with no shops, post office, bank, entertainment/recreational facilities or public transport, we need to take all of that into account and keep a car on the road. Let's call it £1,000.00We do have TV (£145 for a licence), telephone (£120 line rental) and unlimited Broadband (£240) but all of these cost money. Let's call it £500.00We have a fairly large garden that's home to several hens, ducks, quail and the rabbit. These all cost money to feed and house.Let's call it £500.00As you can see, the cost of living soon mounts up before we even factor in the more luxurious items. It is our understanding of the differences between our needs and our wants that determines how happy we are with what we earn. Bowing under peer pressure isn't really anything to worry about when there are no nearby Jones families with which to 'keep up' and the local school has less than 30 pupils.We ruralites can often be stuck for choice. As far as grocery shopping is concerned, our biggest choice in the local corner store is take it or leave it, or we could travel to the nearest town to see what the supermarket has to offer. But now we have the Internet, in many cases we have Broadband, albeit slow, and we have delivery companies trekking miles off the main roads to reach us. We have access to the world of commerce, department stores, online banking, shares trading, cashback, savings and investments and all of these things can be fun! Why would someone like me opt to travel 200 miles each week for the sake of attending a dead-end job that paid minimum wage of £6.08 per hour when I need only £100 each week to 'live' my current, happy-go-lucky lifestyle?A trip into the 'big town' is a full day's event for us, whereas those who care not for reviewing their spending habits (then moan that they are skint) fail to see the domino effect caused by continually fuelling up the car to make a 150-mile round trip for the sake of saving a few pounds on a pair of shoes. Travel costs, including car running costs, amount to around £25. Postage & packaging costs online are around £5. It's a no-brainer!Downsizing isn't always the easy option. Selling up your 3-bed town or city dwelling for a packet to pack up and relocate to a cheap, cash purchased fixy-up cottage in the country may not be what you are expecting. Self sufficiency is an urban myth, 'The Good Life' was nothing more than a hit comedy on BBC and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall still has a job to earn him the kind of income he needs to live his fairly affluent, possibly extravagant, lifestyle.No, frugal living is certainly not for everyone. It's either a way of life you have grown accustomed to through a weak financial situation or it is a learning curve forced upon you by circumstances beyond your control. It may be a lifestyle choice you choose in pursuit of your 'dream', but that's where money helps initially. It may cost you more money than you'll save trying to launch yourself into this because of some quaint, fairytale notion that country living without the security of guaranteed income looks fun and stress-free. Some of the people who have, in the past, been part of the Frugaldom forums have become classic examples of how not to do it and it is a simple fact that they just didn't understand the concept of earning a living while isolated from old friends and family, then living within their means after their security blanket incomes had gone.Then again, given the choice, I'd buy as close to my dream 'forever' home and do whatever was needed to keep it, safe in the knowledge that I'd worked for it and, therefor, deserved it. The bottom line will forever be the bottom line. £100 per week could be seven days of gardening, scraping out chicken poop, attending LETS meetings, sharing bulk bargains with friends and typing frantically in the hope of being paid by someone who will publish your words, but if it all goes to pot, it's still only 16 hours per week for one person earning minimum UK wage. There's truth in my madness and it's only mad if you can't see the bigger picture. Happy living with everything you need does not cost a fortune. It's those rogue 'wants' that mess up that system. :)Comments appreciated.NYK Mediahttp://www.scottishmultimedia.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Are You Facing the 'Right' Way?", "date": "Tuesday 25 October 2011", "text": "Solar PV for Frugal Energy:After my week of absence, I'm delighted to be able to incorporate a guest blog by Evo Energy for our frugaldom readers. I hope some of you will find this both interesting and informative.Conventional energy costs seem to be on the rise once again with 5 out of the UK's 6 biggest energy suppliers raising their energy costs within the last three months. If, in your frugal household, you think you’ve already gone as far as you can with limiting your energy consumption and your bills are still coming in too high, it might be time to start looking at free energy sources. In this article I’ll be talking about how solar power has, within the last few years, become a realistic way to save on your energy bill and the various options to consider when switching to solar.Up until relatively recently, Scotland’s slightly dreary climate meant that when it came to considering renewable energy for any household item more demanding than a calculator, solar power would not be one that leapt to mind. Technology, however, is ever improving, and the latest solar panels no longer need direct sunlight. In fact, on the cloudiest of Scottish days, many new solar panels will work at 40% efficiency. These technological improvements combined with a national need to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we consume has lead to a government scheme designed to encourage the uptake of solar power, the feed in scheme.What’s the feed in scheme?If you installed solar panels, during day light hours you will constantly be generating electricity, however, for a lot of this time you may not be using it. Unless you have rechargeable batteries installed this excess energy would normally just be going to waste but with the feed in scheme your spare energy would be bought from you by the government and sent into the national grid, where it can be sold to energy companies and used by other households. Any energy that is sold like this you will be paid for, meaning you can actually make money from your solar panels. The government has guaranteed to maintain this scheme for at least 25 years and buy energy from you at a rate that matches inflation.Is it affordable?Solar panels should be viewed as an investment, not only will you be saving money on your energy bills but, as mentioned above, you could actually be making money from your solar panels. Solar panels aren’t going to make you rich, but you can expect to make all your initial set up costs back within ten years (sooner, if energy prices continue to rise). After this you’re in profit, which, as an investment, is certainly a better deal than most savings accounts your bank will offer you. If this is still out of your price range, there is another option for readers in England; you can still save money on your bills with free solar energy. Many companies that offer solar panels are actually prepared to cover the cost of the panels and installation in return for any profits made from feeding in your excess energy. You still save all the money you normally would on your energy bills by using free energy, you just don’t get paid for feeding energy back in. This means anyone who meets the land requirements can afford to switch to solar power. The success of this scheme means it is likely to be available in Scotland in the future.What are the land requirements?Different companies will have different requirements; if you're in England, to get free solar panels from Evo Energy, you need a minimum roof size of 23m² with an orientation from south-east to south-west. Other companies are likely to want something similar. Evo Energy does not currently operate in Scotland, unfortunately.And when it’s not sunny?As we’ve covered, as long as it’s light outside, modern panels still run at about 40% efficiency, but at times when your energy requirements are particularly high this won’t be enough. For this reason most people choose to stay connected to the national grid, this way when they need extra energy they simply top up from their normal electricity supplier. This also means you can run all your electrical appliances at night.For those wishing to become totally self-sufficient it is also possible to install rechargeable batteries that can store energy for use when there is no sun; however, these batteries are costly and only really appropriate for households that have particularly low energy consumption.If you think you might be interested in switching to solar energy there are a number of companies to choose from, some native to Scotland, all of which are worth taking a look at. For readers further South, Evo Energy has been voted renewable energy supplier of 2011 by The Renewable Energy Association and the Renewable Road show. It was also recently selected as the best provider by Martin Lewis’s Money Saving Expert and offers free solar panels.Guest blog for NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Wee Minky Bandits! You'll be Fur Slippers by Christmas!", "date": "Sunday 23 October 2011", "text": "How Much for a New .22?﻿﻿ Wild Mink. (Photo by Hugo.arg)﻿﻿ I hope that things will soon return to normal here in Frugaldom, after the recent spate of sadness, family tragedies and then this recent invasion by what I am now calling the 'wee minky bandits'. Feel free to substitute your own phrase as you see fit.Mid Thursday morning saw H out tending to the ducks while I was getting organised indoors, preparing to travel back up 'home' for my dad's funeral. There was a sudden commotion in the hen run, so H went running down to find out what the heck was happening. As you already know, we have a stream running through Frugaldom, with a bridge leading from the main garden & orchard across to the hen runs, so it's several metres between the two.DumbledorfOn entering the hen shed, H was confronted by a large mink in the process of killing the chickens. In the space of the few minutes it had taken him to get from the duck run to the hen run, the wee minky bandit had killed 4 hens and our blue cuckoo Silkie cockerel. The saddest losses were those of poor little 'Dumbledorf', our white miniature Silkie, and 'JayJay', our big blue hen. But the minky bandit was still in the hen shed! With nothing better to launch at it, H threw a bucket of water to chase it off, but had been a bit taken aback by the size of the creature. Incredibly, Inky, Whites and Silkie-chic survived the attack with nothing more than a few ruffled feathers, so they were quickly relocated into the Pekins' run for safe keeping. A total rethink is now on the cards, as we need to ensure the safety of the remaining poultry. The leaner months are approaching and the young mink will be spreading out, seeking their own territories, so a plan of action to minimise the problem is essential.Mink are fairly large creatures (some more than 80cm in length) in comparison to the smaller ferrets, weasles and stoats, so you would think that they would be easier to keep out of the place. However, this is going to be rather difficult, what with their exploring any burrows they find and us having the burn flowing through our garden. Trapping them is said to be relatively easy, as they are so inquisitive, but they must be quickly and humanely killed. In true frugal fashion, if any get killed on this property, they'll be despatched in an appropriate way and then it could be new fur slippers for Christmas! (Perhaps a slight exaggeration, but this type of thing makes anyone mad.)Thankfully, Floppity bunny was well secured in her hutch and the ducks were much further up the garden. Not being indigenous species, mink are like any other pests in this country - trapping is fine, but it's illegal to release them. As far as I am aware, their numbers have escalated in Scotland, starting from the time the animal rights' activists broke into the farms and released many commercially-bred animals into the wild. To this day, I cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone can think it is the right thing to do. Granted, we should be grateful that it's mink in the garden and not big cats, but someone else always pays for mistakes of ill-thought out plans where others think they're helping a good cause.There have been plenty of reports of big cats in our area over the past years, most probably sightings of captive animals that had been released, illegally, into the Galloway Forest. Unlike Alladale Estate, we don't have wild boar or moose, thankfully! But our immediate problem, which needs to be minimised for the purposes of damage control, are the wee minky bandits that I'd prefer not to have.'Dumbledorf' was a bit of a star, so she'll be remembered by many.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},

{"title": "In Response to a Question About my Previous Post", "date": "Saturday 15 October 2011", "text": "My Way of Thinking About the Price of RiceNowadays, the west is consuming more and more of the stuff, what with all our 'healthy' eating, takeaways, penchant for foreign foods and, lest we forget, shelf-life of dried products that can be stored for lengthy periods of time in a bid to beat inflation and save us all some money. Then we still have the pet trade, which has been (still is) diversifying at an alarming rate, choosing to include rice in many more pet food products under assorted headings, such as 'hypo-allergenic' or 'as recommended by the veterinary profession'.Add to that the apparent increase in medical conditions such as gluten intolerance etc, etc, etc...Rice, when we look at the overall picture and allow for things like exchange rate fluctuations, is one of the things that has been increasing in price over the past 4 years.Increased demand might be what's pushing up the price, but all the other factors involved in the growing, harvesting, shipping, packaging and general production costs add up to a fair whack.This time in 2007, the metric tonne price on the commodities market was sitting at around £165, but then it suddenly soared to over £500 within about 6 months of that. Since then, despite various fluctuations, it hasn't, to my knowledge, reduced price in the supermarkets. It's now steadily climbing back up, which means the profit margins will be squeezed: shareholders don't like losing out on dividends, so the only thing left for the big supermarkets (dictators of grocery prices, in my opinion) to do will be to increase the retail prices accordingly.At the moment, I think the import price of rice is around £390 per tonne, but it is still climbing. If things get tough in the grocery shopping stakes, we can do many more things with rice and homegrown veg than we can with peanut butter.NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk Nuts to all, I'll Take the Rice!Being a fan of frugal living, fast news, price checking and social media, I easily spotted a 'tweet' that said, \"If you love peanut butter, stock up now before peanut prices soar. It’ll drive you nuts if you don’t!\"I was compelled to respond, as their attached link led to an article stating The Wall Street Journal had reported a potential 40% price rise in peanut butter. It was like screaming in blind panic, BUY, BUY, BUY... BUY PEANUT BUTTER NOW!Nobody can deny that, at this time, Wall Street may well be filled with nuts, but this, to me, is getting ridiculous. The above piece of sensationalised, so-called 'news' is very old hat and I'm not afraid to back up my strong words of condemnation of such scaremongering, be it nuts, bolts or milk prices.In 1990, I happened to be working in the livestock industry. (Surprise, not!) We traded in bulk feeds - straights, mixes and, you got it, GROUNDNUTS! As many may know, groundnuts are what most people call 'peanuts'. They grow under ground, hence their name, and they are not, for all we are led to believe, a tasty snack naturally devoured by our native badgers, squirrels, wild birds, cage birds nor, for that matter, parrots. But I digress.At the start of 1990, 'peanuts' were costing around 86p per kilo, but by the end of that year they were about £1.75 per kilo, pushing retail prices within the pet trade to over £2 per kilo (£1 per lb, I think we charged.) We were buying and shipping by the tonne, so the price fluctuations were felt, I can assure you of that. By January 1991, the price had slipped by around 25% then, after a brief spike, prices really began crashing. However, the all time high retail prices remained unchanged! By mid 1992, peanuts were less than 70p per kilo ($778/tonne on the International commodities market), but price fluctuations were as regular as clockwork, bouncing around all over the place, sometimes dropping below 60p per kilo, other times, like January 2008, spiking to highs of £1.70Now explain to me... why should we be showing any real concern in stockpiling peanut butter simply because the current price of groundnuts is trading within 2p of the prices we were trading in 1990?Get a grip! The manufacturers and retailers do not fluctuate their prices to reflect current market trends - they simply bump up the prices when their own profit margins are being adversely affected. Compared to other commodities, the groundnut prices have looked relatively stable and I'd be more likely to stack my cupboards full of rice than peanut butter. In fact, I already have! Rice, in all its forms, is the way to go in the land of Frugaldom.NB: My prices are approximate, based on UK metric tonnes between wholesalers and retailers within the pet trade. We also need to remember that the US$ to GB£ exchange rate has fluctuated immensely, which also reflects in the current prices, as does transportation. Let's face it, anything travelling here from South America is going to be increasing in price, we just need to look at the escalation in prices of tinned corned beef from places such as Brazil and Argentina to see how this all pans out for the consumer. The old saying that things cost 'peanuts' is no more!NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Supermarket Wars, Deals and Dilemmas", "date": "Friday 14 October 2011", "text": "What Happened to the Basics?Since beginning my quest in search of the perfect frugal housekeeping budget, I have seen stores come and go, takeovers, buy-outs, price fluctuations and all manner of marketing techniques employed to encourage us (the general public) to give them (the big supermarkets) our hard-earned cash.Loyalty is not something often seen in frugalers, there's simply no space in the budget. Nowadays, however, there seems to be little space in anyones' budgets for store, let alone brand loyalty. All manner of means has been tried in order to bend us into thinking one way or the other - Airmiles, Nectar Points, Tesco Clubcard Points, Co-operative Dividends (or whatever tag they carry now), cashback, multi-deals... an endless chain of reactions to our lack of true loyalty.Regularly, we see words and phrases like 'downsize', 'drop a brand' or 'ditch and switch', but do any of them really save us money? Is one company honestly cheaper than any other? I doubt it very much. We are simply conned into a false belief that we can benefit slightly more by choosing to use X, Y or Z, depending on whose advertising campaign catches our eye and succeeds in captivating our heart. It's OK to change your mind, in fact, it seems to be actively encouraged!Now we are being presented with the illusion that prices are, once again, falling. Tesco is slicing and dicing, cutting and chopping, promoting it's 'big price drop', while Asda is still 'rolling back the prices' and guaranteeing that it's 'saving you money every day'. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's 'Live Well for Less' campaign includes their new 'brand match', which cross references their prices with those of Tesco and Asda and so the merry-go-round goes. I can't see one iota of difference in what one spends when living in a rural location with no big brand supermarkets nearby and no home delivery services, so why do I even bother reading about their offers? In conclusion, this whole dilemma began when I went to stock up on some basic jars of curry sauce - 4p per reuseable jar with accompaying screw-top lid was always a bargain, even if you don't like curry sauce! Now, however, after it leaping to 9p per jar, I've discovered that it has, once again, more than doubled in price and is currently costing 19p per jar! Inflation for frugalers is far, far more than the Government's screwed up figure of 5.2% What's worse, my current ISA rate is less than half of that, so why the hell is anyone saving money in any bank or building society when it is costing us more to bail out said financial institutions with our taxes?Saying NO to saving, now spending to invest in my own future!You can discuss this and other simiar topics in the Frugaldom ForumsPS: Anyone know what the odds are for Morrisons or Asda in the Iceland 'stakes'?NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "When Money is like Water, is it time to build an Ark?", "date": "Thursday 13 October 2011", "text": "Rain, Rain, Rain... and the burn keeps rising!Philosophically speaking, this is the society in which we live!Here in Scotland, it isn't unusual to get wet weather. It isn't unusual for the ground to show signs of frost from October all the way through to June and I've seen snow on the ground in late May, so I'm not unduly worried by the recent wet spell we've had, despite the burn being about a metre deeper that it was a fortnight ago. The waters may be deep and troubled, but our own simple bridge, thankfully, remains intact - for now!It would be a lie to say I'm not a little jealous of the mini-heatwave experienced by our English counterparts, but that is only because it was plastered all over the news on TV, radio and Internet practically every day, otherwise, I wouldn't have known. (I do wish the BBC would realise that the UK consists of several different countries and that it isn't all a poorly built extension of London and the south of England.)There is an easy solution - switch off the TV/Radio/Internet and, for added entertainment, imagine what would happen if they continually broadcast our weather to the much softer southerners every day. That highly amuses me but I've come to depend on the Internet for my communications with the outside world, so cutting that off isn't something I could happily live without - can you even begin to imagine that?But all this continual wet weather is making me think, again, about Noah's Ark and how that old fellow went about preparing for what he believed was about to happen. Yes, it may well be a Bible story, it may well be read and understood in its literal sense or it may well be nothing more than a symbolic representation of a general set of circumstances, the understanding of which we are all free to interpret in whichever way we see fit. But, even as a fable, the moral of that story surely has to be that we pay heed to warnings, try our best and be prepared to take whichever actions are required to steer us from ruin.The current economic climate is slowly grinding many of us down. We all need to make the choice to either sink or swim. With every day that passes, some new 'con' emerges to try and manipulate us into spending our money in ways that we don't really need, so we should be prepared to fight back. For some, these peaks and troughs symbolise the potential for financial ruin, so we try to prepare ourselves and share whatever little knowledge we have with others, in the hope that they, too, can ride out the impending storm. But what of those who ignore all the warnings? Will they simply be swept away in a tide of debt, whilst others battle to stay afloat in a rickety old boat filled with home produce, foraged fruit and whatever milk, meat and eggs are available from what's breeding on that boat? Will we be cast adrift on a sea of other people's debt, drifting uncontrollably until the tide turns and we can find a safe haven for our money and our possessions? Should we even worry about it? We could, afterall, sit back and let others bale us out of our sinking ships. (Many do!) The trouble with this, however, is that the Governments and big financial institutions themselves look to be aboard sinking ships and we are baling them out!The good ship Frugaldom has sailed, we are too late to turn back in the hope of finding a sunny, warm new land of full employment and financial stability for all. This world is not an equal world, it is dominated by a minority whose only claim to fame is their ability to earn millions or else shout loudly enough to be heard over the waves, declaring to all exactly how those millions should be spent. Worse still, if we don't like it, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. The simple fact is, money talks and we of the frugal brigade have almost no voice.NOBODY needs vast amounts of money simply to survive. But we are human, we are of a competitive nature, we have dominant males within our species who will continue to fight for power over lands and people, or even homes and families. (I'm a sexist, ok? Deal with it!)Regardless of how low down the pecking order anyone may feel, there will ALWAYS be someone or something lower, just as there will ALWAYS be someone or something who is above and beyond their reach, regardless of how much they try, how hard they work or how much they earn. It's the very nature of life itself and we need to learn to embrace that in a way that we can enjoy the challenge. Money is not everything. Look at our simple little bridge, with its tumultous flood waters crashing between those strong and reliable banks. Cash values, like the water, can rise and fall.  Just as easily as that stream could dry up during any drought, so too could those banks completely collapse, sending the water in all directions; there's simply too much off it to handle. It's a bit like carrying all your eggs in one basket, then dropping your basket.Society is as precarious as the very water that falls from the sky - each molecule is based on nothing more than a single oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. We can make it and we can break it, but we can never stop it raining of its own accord. I still can't decide what's for the best.Do we hope the banks, which are already being shored up by our cash, hold indefinitely to ensure a safe flow of our own cash? Do we somehow stem the flow or our own cash in a way that ensures it need not rely on the support of the banks?What do we do? Whichever way we look at it, whether the water represents surplus cash or rising debts, the more there is of it, the easier it is for those banks to collapse under the extra pressure.Anyone care to comment?NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},
{"title": "Slow Cooking, Rice Pudding and Electricity Costs", "date": "Monday 10 October 2011", "text": "A Winter Warmer and a Winter Warning!I'll start with the frugal winter warmer, as it's more comforting than the winter warning.Rice pudding is a firm favourite of our household but, despite this, it seldom seems to be on the menu during summertime. For this reason, I have come to the conclusion that it must be a frugal winter warmer.Being a big fan of the slow cooker, as opposed to switching on the main electric oven, I tipped in the following ingredients, in no particular order:INGREDIENTS1.5 litres UHT milkHalf a can of evaporated milk (left over from semolina pudding the previous night)300g rice (I had to use long grain, as nothing else in store)3 rounded tablespoonsful of sugar3 handfuls of raisins or sultanasa good sprinkling of nutmegI cooked this on high then reduced it to low after about an hour and a half. It was then left slow cooking until teatime. Give it a stir every half hour or so, just to ensure it isn't burning (caramelising is the more frugal terminology used for this browning process) and add a little more milk if you don't like it too thick.The above should provide you with around 6 to 10 servings, depending on how hungry/greedy you are. Obviously, if you follow guidelines, then the portion prices are minimal. I'm finding now that I need to cook as much as possible at any given time, mainly because the cost of electricity is creeping up to a level that's getting out of control!\"Ditch and switch\", I keep hearing people say, only these people obviously aren't thinking on behalf of the entire nation! Get cashback to ditch and switch - that might help! Only problem I have found is that each time I feed my household's electricity requirements into one of these comparison sites, they all seem to come back saying the same thing: Amount of savings = ZERO!I'm not one for brand loyalty but, when it comes to electricity and telephony, there can't really be a cheaper way of doing things, can there? Living in a rural community, our only service provider for telephone lines is BT. There may be other companies out there but, at the end of the day, if the BT network goes down, the phone connection and Internet access is lost, regardless of who is billing you. I feel the same way about the National Grid. If your electricity is coming to you on mains wiring, it has to be connected to this self-same grid, regardless of who is supplying it. I double checked my figures using the E.ON site, thinking I could possibly take advantage of their Tesco Clubcard points offer, but found that, in order to 'benefit', I would need to pay even MORE than I'm currently paying Scottish Power. I guess what I'm trying to say is, no matter who your supplier is, they're always going to get your money somehow. As they say, \"better the devil you know than the devil you don't\", so I'm sticking with what I've got and hoping that the original is always best.Of course, if all this talk of the miraculous *E-Cat proves to be true, I'll want to make sure I have enough in my savings account to cover the cost of purchasing my very own energy catalyser. Guessing I'll need to be quick, too, before 'they that be' clamp down and the miracle device mysteriously disappears, all traces of the thing dissolving into the ether.My one piece of extra good news over the weekend was that my £35 cashback has finally been confirmed for last year's contents insurance. If I remember correctly, the policy cost me around £40 for my minimal contents and if I 'cash-in' for an Amazon voucher, I'll get an extra 0.5% bonus.Topcashback and my eBid Buddy Points are paying for Christmas 2011 in the Frugaldom household.* On the subject of the e-cat, my research is beginning to look more like an article for the Paranoid Times!NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},

If the cat hadn't woken me at dawn, I'd have missed the glorious sunrise which, in turn, would have meant that I'd have missed the camouflage coloured helicopters that whirled and droned as they flew over our roof at very low altitude. I almost wished I had been in one of the attic rooms at the time of the 'Frugaldom fly past', so I could have waved at the pilots through the Velux window! But I digress. Once again, my frugal research has lead me into previously uncharted waters. Or rather, more free forums!Having only recently learned about Ted Cachart and his mission to rally the veteran troops to make one final assault on the Heroes Return 2 lottery funding before it ends, I seem to have ended up researching more than just wartime living and lottery funded tours for the WW2 veterans.I soon found myself wandering into a site called 'World War II Talk' and ended up in their forums. That's right, my cherished handful of readers, I joined more forums!All this frugal living and vegetable growing had led me into wartime-themed discussions about the 'Dig for Victory' schemes and all the money-saving ways adopted by our relatives during those bleak times. I blame my gran for my frugalist attitude; she is a great one for saving every penny, having lived through those war years.So, what did I find on the WW2 talk forum that interested me so much?Well, first of all, I found more of those real, live veterans, the guys (and, lest we forget, the gals) who donned the uniforms and went to war so that we could all be here, in relative safety, admiring the sunrises and sunsets at our leisure. The Internet truly is an awesome place for learning new stuff!But that's not all I found - I discovered a link to a copy of the Ministry of Agriculture's Dig for Victory leaflet on yet another site, called 'Earthly Pursuits'. I find all of this very interesting and the above leaflet may well become the focus of my attention for future developments in the new Frugaldom gardens - otherwise known as my microholding. As for my soup kitchen, well, I've been known as the 'soup dragon' since 1985, so that's never going to go away anytime soon. In fact, I'll bookmark it as the title for my 'Soup eBook'. (There you go, Dave - I do listen sometimes!)So you really do still find this a bit boring?

{"title": "Stocks and Shares of the Frugal Variety.", "date": "Thursday 6 October 2011", "text": "These Pay Dividends of a Different Type!No, I'm not talking the London Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or Wall Street, I'm talking home made stock and the freshly picked produce that my garden shares with me on a regular basis.But it still pays dividends!Having roast chicken for dinner is always the precursor of Frugaldom stock trading. I trade the stripped chicken carcass for a lovely pot of stock! Obviously, you may choose to take (or make) this with a pinch of salt, but I prefer mine seasoned with the addition of pepper, as well. It's a pretty hot commodity, in my honest opinion.Stockmaking all looks rather messy at the start, but boiling the bones is the only way to get all that lovely flavour into the water that will later become your soup. Strain off the juices and, for a lower fat version, allow the stock to cool, chill it and then skim off any fat.I tend to make my stock over the period of few hours in the slow cooker - frugal and almost impossible for it to boil over when left unattended. If you have cheap rate overnight electricity, this is the best time for slow cookers, just use a timer switch.This time of year is brilliant for thick soups, stews and broths and I always serve them with wedges of freshly baked bread or dumplings. I usually set aside a small carton of the extra meat that is always left over, then this also gets added into the final dish.From the garden, earlier in the week, I had gathered sprouting broccoli, patty pan squash, beans, turnips, carrots, 5 courgettes and onions, plus I also had a mugful of stewed tomatoes to use up, from making pizza for yesterday's lunch. Everything except the runner beans has gone into the soup pan and is simmering gently along with a decent helping of red, split lentils and a heaped teaspoonful of turmeric, for added autumn kick.Despite this all sounding like a very strange concoction, the only ingredients that were paid for in cash were the lentils and seasoning, so this really is a frugal meal.The pan used holds 6.5L of liquid, so I usually make 5L of soup, meaning that there is always plenty stored in the freezer for winter warmer snacks, lunches or suppers.Never be afraid of experimenting with stocks or soup-making. If you are vegan or vegetarian, use your scrubbed peelings, stalks, tops and tails to make a vegetable stock. Season it with whatever herbs or spices you prefer and then freeze the surplus for later use. Simmering some spaghetti in the stock makes for frugal noodle soup, while using this same stock for cooking such things as rice, pasta or cous cous always gives that extra bit of flavour and a few extra vitamins and minerals.Within the realms of frugal living and housekeeping, there is probably no cheaper option than homemade soup. It is also one of the most nourishing foods for sipping when feeling under the weather or otherwise off your food.We love soup, especially because you can make it from almost anything.I'll upload a photo of this latest soup as soon as it is ready. Until then, I can't tell you how it looks or tastes, as this truly is a use-it-up recipe.Edit: This soup tastes delicious! It is much more colourful than I had expected it to be, but looks very appetising.Lunch for the next few days and enough left over for several servings to go into the freezer.The tomatoes give it an interesting look, much less bland than ordinary green pea soup and much more interesting than chicken with rice.We now have the big debate - to blend or not to blend?NYK Mediawww.scottishmultimedia.co.uk"},

The area has almost been completely cleared, revealing a fantastic 8m x 3m of new space.As energy supply is of key importance to us frugalers, all sorts of suggestions have been discussed, from a new wood store to a small poly tunnel, a bird aviary (I know!) to a bunker. Yes, I really did say a bunker!Now, I know that when thinking of bunkers we may automatically think nuclear fall out shelters rather than cellars for storage or shelter from tornadoes, but I was thinking of neither.Tomorrow, according to some reports, there might be a very important scientific experiment carried out at the University of Bologna in Italy! If this proves to be true and one Professor Rossi really can prove his theory works, any remote possibility of success could herald a new dawn in energy production.I'm no scientist, least of all a nuclear physicist, but I am aware of the terms 'Cold Fusion' and 'LENR' (Low Energy Nuclear Reactions).  I watch 'The Big Bang Theory' and have a Scottish Higher in Biology, if that counts? I've even heard of the E-Cat. (No it isn't like a Tamagotchi, I don't think?)Anyhow, tomorrow is meant to be the start of this latest great test, where they're going to bombard a metal medicine ball with computerised electronic impulses at such a rate as to compress the entire contents to produce new energy. At least that's how I like to think of it.My coal I bought a fortnight ago cost me £108.00 for half a tonne.I spend approximately £15 per week on electricityLogs are £50 per trailer load deliveredI get through £25 worth of petrol each month despite working from homeWhat this all adds up to is the fact that over the period of a single year, our average energy and fuel costs amount to at least £125 every month! That is ridiculous when we are such a frugal household of waste not, want not people.But back to my new space cleared in the back garden - IF Prof. Rossi's invention, known as the E-Cat (Energy Catalyser) really does work, proven without a shadow of a doubt, the future of clean energy will dawn by this weekend and it will herald a new beginning, the greatest invention ever that could solve the global warming problem while stopping the melt of the polar icecaps mid-flow. Let's say it could be some kind of miracleNever mind the Mayan calander, the 2012/2013 predictions, the age of aquarius or the New World Order, the cold fusion war may be about to erupt!Clean energy, cheap energy, renewable energy with supposedly little or no carbon footprint - could I fit a frugal e-cat or LEN reactor into the space we've just cleared in our back garden? I mean, how difficult can they be to build? They sound like big batteries with the power to squeeze out enough power to fuel the whole of Frugaldom indefinitely. What a thought that is! Too good to be true? Who knows!I wonder if there would be enough space next to my frugal e-cat for a heated greenhouse? That would really help the veggies along during the cold, Scottish winter months!I'm not holding my breath awaiting results from the October 6th tests - it may all be nothing more than an elaborate hoax. But then again, there are those who questioned the 1969 moon landings and just as many believe in the Loch Ness monster, aliens at Roswell and human cloning - we choose our own truths, sometimes carelessly. I'll keep an open mind on this and hope there's just a bit of a news blackout on the e-cat discovery. That would explain all the claok and dagger stuff and the lack of global awareness. As I love to say, he who controls the media, controls the general public.

{"title": "Please Help Spread the Word Before this Money is Gone", "date": "Thursday 29 September 2011", "text": "Well Earned Travel, a Fitting Tribute and Funding to Make it all Possible.Frugal living is something that many of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents have been familiar with for years. This lifestyle is nothing new to them and they can certainly teach us a thing or two about household budgeting after what they have been through during The War.Making the most of whatever was available, adopting a waste not, want not attitude and trying their best to eke out every penny was all part of a normal day. This has never been more apparent than during wartime.Vegetable growing, sewing, dressmaking, batch cooking for their hungry families and keeping the home fires burning may have been essential to survival. Meanwhile, husbands, fathers and sons would be in far off places, facing the challenges and dangers of war. Back then, there were no such luxuries as computers, globally networked mobile phones or public telephony - communications were whatever brief notes could be scribbled and sent to comfort loved ones and offer a tiny fragment of reassurance to those back home. It really is amazing just how much we take for granted nowadays when we get down to thiking about it all.The Dig for Victory scheme was introduced as soon as World War II began, meaning that every available space back home had to be turned over to food production. Stores would never last the entire nation  for six months, let alone years, so allotments began springing up everywhere.Looking back, it is difficult to imagine how people coped living with the stresses of a war-torn nation while trying to carry on with life in the absense of many of the able-bodied men. The fight was as much here as anywhere else, only here it was a fight for survival in a slightly different way. Life was a struggle. All of those survivors deserve recognition and all deserve to be able to afford to visit those far-flung places where they once fought or where loved ones lost their lives. Hopefully, the following will be of help to some. All that I ask is that you spread the word to all concerned before this funding is gone.Heroes Return 2 is a £17 million scheme providing funding to WWII veterans, their wives or husbands, widows or widowers and, where needed, accompanying carers to visit the overseas areas where World War II veterans saw active service.Launched in 2004 as part of the Big Lottery Fund's Veterans Reunited programme, the scheme has already helped thousands of UK veterans to revisit battlefields where they once fought and for widows, spouses and carers to witness where it all happened.Many fought and died to defend our nation in order that we might enjoy freedom and safety. We have what we have because of our wartime heroes. It is only natural that we should make every effort to ensure all those affected can afford to make the trip to pay a final and fitting tribute to their loved ones who lost their lives in the name of this country.Grants of up to *£5,500 are available to veterans resident in the UK and Republic of Ireland who fought with or alongside British forces in WWII.

{"title": "Frugal Renovations in Full Swing...", "date": "Wednesday 28 September 2011", "text": "We Have a New Front Door!This being a Listed Building of almost 200 years old, we need planning permission before we can change anything, so the frugal way of getting around this is to replace like with like and reuse wherever possible.You can imagine the joiner's bemused expression when I asked him to make us a brand new, wooden door after removing all the salvageable pieces from the old one to keep costs down. Thankfully, he agreed! (Thank you, Mr. R.)A trip into the nearby village resulted in my returning to see the joiner's van parked in the street, his workbench and a gaping hole at the front of the house where the old door had been. Everything was ripped out back to bare stone walls.Nearby, stood a brand new door, awaiting it's frugal fate. Not only had this new door to be transformed into one identical to the old one, I had even asked the joiner to salvage the glass from the middle and from the top fan lights.The glass was carefully removed and then my friend the brillo pad helped me scrub all the old paint stains and putty until the panes were cleaned up and looking as close to new as old, frosted glass can look. While this was being done, the joiner was busy attacking the new solid door with his saw, removing enough of it to fit in the old panel of glass. Meanwhile, he had made up the new door frame to fit - an odd size, as one might expect for our quirky little cottage.The sun shone all day and before long, the new frame and door were in place, exact same handles, same lock and same glass as the old one. The new wood has received a coat of sealer and the letterbox didn't arrive in time to be fitted, so literally no bills can come through the door this week!I invested in a small tin of undercoat and the same in non-drip gloss. Kindly gentleman at the store gave me a discount and threw in some free sandpaper to help with the frugal budget - people in rural communities are so helpful and supportive of one another, constantly demonstrating a mutual respect that I know I would miss if I had ever to venture into the big city.Tomorrow, I'm half expecting the local plumber to arrive and attempt to resuscitate the old double radiator in the hall. I say 'half expect', as that's the way these things work about here. It's very much a 'take me as you find me, I'll be there when I arrive' kind of a place. Anyhow, all going well, this radiator will be heating  the main hall this winter, powered by a new pump on the hot water system attached to the backboiler behind the coal fire. Hoping against all odds that this can be saved and fixed, as it could prove sufficient to heat up the stairs, too. I'll let you know how it all goes.To conclude tonight's blog post, I would like to add a few lines in memory of the miner who lost his life in yesterday's tragic accident at Kellingley Colliery in Yorkshire. People seldom think much about how our fuel is generated, from where it originates or how it is produced. It simply arrives for our convenience, whether it be electricity, fossil fuel or even logs. But for this family, burning coal will forever remind us.Yesterday, Tuesday 27th September, 2011, my children lost an uncle. More tragically, their cousins lost their father. My heart goes out to Brenda and all the family involved. Be strong, support one another and may Gerry rest in peace. He will never be forgotten."},
{"title": "Saving Money in the Kitchen with Frugal Meals", "date": "Tuesday 27 September 2011", "text": "Another Frugal and Filling Meal - Pea and Ham SoupHaving bought a large, smoked ham hough (known elsewhere as a ham hock) for £2.00, it seemed frugally fitting to make sure I got my money's worth out of it - so I did!After about 3 hours in the slow cooker, the ham was removed, stripped from the bone and used to make ham and cheese pasta. By using all the ham plus a whole 500g pack of pasta, there was enough for at least two meals for us, so we're off to a good start.The water used to cook the ham was then topped up and the slow cooker set in motion to make 5 litres of lovely stock for soup-making.Once strained and returned to the pan, I added carrots, onions and a full kilo of split green peas, plus the usual salt and pepper to season. That's it! Let this lot simmer away slowly for a few hours and give it a stir now and again to make sure the peas are all cooking evenly.My slow cooker is a 6.5 litre, 300w model. By the time the soup was ready, I had 5 litres of the most delicious, thick and very filling pea and ham soup. Protein from all those pulses and some vitamins from the vegetables - nourishing, warming and frugally filling. Thick Pea and Ham SoupIngredients5 litres of ham stock (homemade)500g chopped carrots (homegrown)1 large onion, chopped (homegrown)1kg of split green peasSalt and pepper to seasonIf the soup gets too thick for your liking, simply add a little bit more water. I like to keep mine topped up to the 5 Litres, then serve it thick with a slice of home-baked bread.You could, of course, use lentils or yellow split peas, but I fancied some nice green pea and ham soup, which freezes just as well as any other type. This recipe can also be used with homegrown peas.Considering one tin of shop bought soup serves two people, then 5 litres of homemade soup should provide you with up to 25 portions for a total cost of around £1.30, including the electricity you used for cooking. It's quite a luxury at 5p per serving! Mine cost a bit less than this, as I had bought my split peas in bulk while they were on offer at 49p per kilo. Estimated costs will be slightly increased if you need to buy stock cubes, carrots and onions. We grow most of our own and plan on growing all our ow veg as soo as the new garden is fully up and running.Dried pulses may have 'best before' dates on the packaging but they should last for years if kept in air tight storage containers. The same applies to dried pasta, flours, sugar and, lest we forget, chocolate. I never miss a chance to stock up on any of these items when they are cheap. As always, the rule of this game is only ever bulk buy foodstuffs that you know you will use. Food waste means automatic disqualification from the game, otherwise."},
{"title": "Cutting the Grocery Budget with Frugal Food", "date": "Sunday 25 September 2011", "text": "Spicy Courgette Soup - a Frugal Recipe at 4p per portion.Every year, I set myself a target budget for grocery shopping. I've done this for so long that it has become more of a game - some might even call it a standing joke. For the past few years, I have set my challenge at £1 per person, per day. And I have stuck to it!The truth of the matter is, with finances being stretched to the limit, food waste is something that we cannot afford, nor should we tolerate it! Elsewhere on this planet, there are people starving to death while many of us here, in this wonderful, 'developed' part of the world, take up ridiculous, faddy diets in an attempt to shift surplus fat. Sadly, at the same time, many also buy so much food that a percentage of it inevitably ends in the bin. Weird!Frugaldom cannot afford the luxury of binning food, although it can honestly be said that I could afford to shed surplus fat! (But that's a whole other challenge.) In exchange for our happy-go-lucky lifestyle of simple living, splitting time between building up a home, earning a meagre living and developing a productive garden, we have given up on big luxuries like dining out, holidays, new cars and designer wear. All savings made, for now, are being ploughed into the house.Without further ado, here is how I am currently coping with the glut of courgettes that are being harvested from the garden. I have only two plants, but I have lost count of the number of courgettes I have picked from each - certainly many more than I would ever have afforded to buy as part of the regular grocery shopping.If you have read any of my posts about cooking chicken, you'll know that I can get at least three main meals from one (shop bought) bird and I always make stock from whatever is left. This time, with only two of us here, I have enough chicken for 4 main meals, the cat got fed and the stock got made. So what's next?SPICY COURGETTE SOUPINGREDIENTS3 litres chicken stock (homemade)1 large onion, chopped (homegrown)Approx 500g chopped carrots (homegrown)5 large courgettes, chopped (homegrown)Coriander (None growing, I had to use ground variety from the spice rack)Teaspoon saltTeaspoon ground pepperTeaspoon turmericI had been boiling rice for having with our chicken curry and like to add some turmeric or a touch of curry powder along with salt, to give the rice that lovely yellow colour and a bit of added flavour. Worrying that the soup may end up looking a weird colour once the courgettes had all cooked down, I reckoned the turmeric could also add a bit of colour and a bit of a kick, into the bargain. Next year, with luck, my new crocuses will provide us with saffron for such uses - frugal gourmet needn't cost the earth, it simply needs the earth in order for us to grow such fine delicacies.The soup was simmered in the slow cooker for several hours then left overnight to cool. I then blended it (using a stick blender I bought several years ago for under £5) before splitting it into lunchtime sized portions. I got 10 adult portions from the above, but can't really cost it up exactly when the sums are so small. All the veg came from the garden, the stock was a by-product of the chicken, which cost me £4.99 locally, and the herbs & spices are all things I have on my shelf. The electricity used was minimal, having opted to use my 300w slow cooker. At a guess, I would say the electricity used would amount to a maximum of 3 kWh, including making the stock. On our current electricity rates, this would work out at just under 37pLooking good for around 4p per portion. Even if you had to buy stock cubes and vegetables, soup remains one of the cheapest meals to make if you are prepared to mix and match with your ingredients.This started out as a bowlful, except H had already eaten half of it with a slice of homemade bread by the time I remembered I was meant to be photographing it for this blog post. He was slightly amused when asked to set down his spoon and step away from the soup while I pointed a camera at it!This courgette soup is nourishing, very warming on a chilly day, handy for serving in a mug as a tasty snack and, most of all, you get a lovely hot kick from it, depending on how much of the spices you use. Try it for yourself, adapt the recipe to suit your own tastebuds, thicken it with lentils if you prefer, and make the most of what you've got in stock. This is a seasonal soup and it freezes well. Frugadom highly recommends it and will be making another batch next week, as there are another 4 courgettes almost ready plus a couple of patty pan squash, which will also get added.WE LOVE SOUP!"},
{"title": "Frugal Photographic Fun - Picture in Picture", "date": "Saturday 24 September 2011", "text": "September Sunshine and Fun in the Frugaldom GardenPart 2Following on from my earlier post, I have now had a closer look at the original photographs and found many more contained within them. I spotted several things that I hadn't even noticed while taking them, so quite a few frugal bonuses and rather fun searching the photos for hidden 'clues' to what's really going on in the garden.The initial view of the garden, on closer inspection, revealed several runner beans that are ready for picking. I'm amazed that the rabbit hadn't already helped herself to these.This fly was one of a few that were on the sunflowers. I'm not a great fan of creepy crawlies or flying beasties, but I was really impressed by how the bright yellow of the sunflower petals highlighted the lace pattern of the wings.If you look closely, you can even see this fly's hairy little knees and feet!What do you think of this sunflower yellow? It's fabulous!Sunflowers are really quite amazing. The closer you look at them, the more fascinating they become - this brown mosaic swirl is the very centre of the flower. Each one of these will become a sunflower seed one day soon.For some strange reason, this reminds me of an armadillo!Moving further out from the centre of the sunflower, I spotted this strange array of what looks more like they should be swaying on the bottom of the sea bed!I can highly recommend playing this fun and frugal game. Out of a few digital photographs, I have managed to highlight several aspects of the garden that would, otherwise, have been overlooked. (Family like to see the photo diaries, as they aren't close enough to visit in person on a regular basis.)Hello MUM! :)Along the dry stone wall, beyond the pumpkins and kale then past the sweet peas, there are still hundreds of rosehips of all colours. Despite the autumnal weather that seems to be fast approaching, there are still quite a fe wild roses blooming.It was while inspecting the photo for all these rosehips and sweetpea blossomgs that I spotted an anomaly. Can you spot it?Almost in the centre of this clump of colourful swet peas, I can see a single yellow flower - some sort of rogue dandelion or daisy - a weed that has clambered up through the sweet peas to emerge among the blooms.I love the smell of sweet peas and am really glad that there are so many flowers. They just keep on growing, as if coming through in wave after wave of colour. Did anyone spot the snowball turnips growing below the kale? I will need to get out and lift a few more of these, as I hadn't spotted them on my round of the garden. Oops!I love this photo in a photo of Floppity rabbit finding Scruffy cat beneath the brussel sprouts. It really is the cat's whiskers.Floppity soon took off, so a closer inspection of the next photograph provided evidence of her escape route... this is her big furry feet and tail about to disappear further into the sprout patch.All of these images are part of the photographs published in part 1 of today's blog.If anyone decides to play the frugal photo game, don't forget to upload your findings to your own blog or site then let us all know where we can see them.The sun shone all day, so the patio was the favoured spot for coffee drinking and chatting, especially when visitors arrived. Floppity got confined to barracks, as she can be such a pest, but Scruffy insisted she oined in and got all the attention.In between baking, biscuit making and soup making, I did get around to planting all the spring bulbs. Frugaldom now has a selection of daffodils, tulips, irises, snowdrops and crocuses crammed into the planters that sit around the front of the house. A bit more compost needed to top these up but then it's all down to nature to do her good deed and make my bulbs grow.Don't forget you can join us for regular updates from all the frugalers, with day to day results of the various money-making and money-saving challenges by visiting the Frugaldom Forums.September Sunshine and Fun in the Frugaldom GardenPart 1This is part 1 of a 2 part post for today. I hope nobody minds, but it's a bit of a frugaldom experimental game.Better late than never - the sunflowers are all beginning to open now, bringing some added colour to the garden. What I love about these is their immense size, towering above everything else out there. They seem to lift their faces to the sun, then bow their heads to the birds and insects that descend upon them. They make ideal models for some frugal camera fun.I love taking a photograph and then finding out that it has so much more detail than you had ever imagined. It's like discovering extra photos in a box, ones you didn't know you had taken. This morning's offerings provided many more than the handful I snapped, making this an excellent photographic game, worthy of competitive status.The garden is a great place for playing this frugal game, but you can organise your frugal shoot absolutely anywhere you choose. These are the handful of photographs that I took this morning. Once they were opened up on computer screen, they revealed much more than first expected.The garden looks lovely and sunny, you can just make out one of the ducks in the background.The rabbit is out and about, scurrying around beneath the veggies and getting up to her usual nonsense.Somewhere in the midst of all of this, Scruffy cat is lurking, but I couldn't see her at the moment.The wall is, once more, a blaze of colour from yet another flush of sweet peas, so I'll be cutting more of them this afternoon to refill the vases indoors - much nicer and far more frugal than air fresheners, in my opinion.Even the dog roses are still finding the will to flower, despite there being so many rosehips around. This particular part of the wall is a mass of ivy, roses and sweet peas, all fighting for space.In the vegetable plots, the greenery is now reaching almost a metre high in places, as the brussel sprouts, kale and sprouting broccoli take over their allocated patches.None of these were covered this year, so they have been open to the abuse of hundreds of white butterflies that are forever fluttering around the place. Fortunately, their numbers seem to be in gradual decline, being replaced by many more tortoiseshells.Floppity has a whale of a time in the garden. She just pleases herself where she goes, what she does and when she eats - not always a good thing, I might add. There are numerous digging patches around the garden where she has been attempting to burrow.Eventually, however, she usually locates the cat for us, then has a game of chase around the garden. The cat always wins the race but that's probably owing to the fact that the rabbit is bigger than her.This morning, Floppity eventually found said cat sleeping beneath the sprouting broccoli. Scruffy cat was not overly amused by her rude awakening!It has take me until now to realise that my purple curly kale isn't all purple! There seems to be two varieties, or else colour is dependent on some other factor. I don't suppose the chickens will bother, they seem to enjoy pecking at it whatever type they are given.Further down the wall are my late sunflowers. These have all decided to flower, although I'm not sure how many finches will remain in the garden by the time these turn to seed.All going well, I'll save some heads off these glorious flowers and store the seeds for future use, probably for feeding the wild birds that frequent the bird tables and our wildbird corner at the bottom of the orchard.These really are flowers that look like the sun! I love them and will certainly be planting more for next year.The packs of seeds I received have both sunflowers and sweet peas, so next year's display should be very colourful if I adopt a sowing strategy to make the most of their majestic height.If you grow no other flowers, I can recommend that you do, at least, plant a couple of these beauties, even if they are in big pots or recycled buckets. Well worth it!For part 2 of this post, I'll be taking a closer look at what the above photographs actually revealed. Isn't technology a fantastic achievement? We look, we see what we think we see and then, suddenly, we find out that there's a whole other world out there, just waiting to be discovered. We just need to look for it. And the best part is, it's all FREE."},
{"title": "Minimum Wage Need Not Apply...", "date": "Friday 23 September 2011", "text": "How Much Money is Enough?﻿ Fresh quail egg omlette with organic tomatoesNo matter where you live, there is a simple way to follow a frugal lifestyle and help beat the blues - if you have them.Frugal living is not about sacrificing the good things in life, it is about living in a way that makes them affordable to you. And only you can decide what those good things really are.What may be a luxury to someone in the town or city may be commonplace to someone from a more rural community. Think fishing, sailing, equestrian sports or even just wide open spaces, deserted beaches, bluebell woods in spring, snow-clad slopes in winter and few people around to care how you look or what you do. (Within reason, of course.) As a prime example of the 'luxury' perception, my own children were practically reared on quail eggs. For much of their early lives (and my own, before that), they had poultry and game birds, a large garden, goats or lambs and the usual horses, ponies, dogs, cats and other assorted furry or feathered creatures. This was, and still is, our version of normal. I have things like pheasant and scallops in the freezer, prefer venison to lamb, will hopefully have a wild goose for Christmas dinner and quail eggs can be eaten like sweets. Handmade cookies, preserves and assorted confectionery, organic herbs, saffron, asparagus, freshly harvested globe artichoke... gourmet foods that stores like Harrods pride themselves in having on their shelves. Organic produce, freerange eggs and handmade or individually designed anything can pretty much be taken for granted if you live in the country and run your suburban garden like a smallholding (or microholding), growing fruit, vegetables and herbs while keeping a few chickens. But a high-flying city career doesn't allow time for endless hours in the garden while also looking after livestock, running a household like a business, spending hours in the kitchen cooking, baking and preserving or earning a living  from home. Living and working in the city means paying a premium for such 'luxuries'.On the flip side, city or town dwellers may take other things for granted, things that those of us living in a more rural location might look upon as absolute luxuries - mobile phones (no network coverage), fast and affordable broadband, supermarkets, night clubs, clothes shops, a local gym, buses and taxis, train stations, shopping centres... even things like mains gas, water and sewerage cannot be taken for granted. The lists are endless. But we still all pay the same taxes & National Insurance, road tax, TV licence fees, petrol, diesel, oil and unit rates on utilities bills.Annual Council Tax in rural Scotland (and many other areas) is about double what it costs in Westminster but, lest we forget, here in rural Scotland, we can buy a 3-bed house outright for under £60,000.00In Westminster, £60,000.00 could rent you a 3-bed flat for less than 2 years. (Quite a nice flat, in Sufflok Street, a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square!)Let's look at the financial differences between both sets of lifestyles. At the moment, the UK Government sets the national minimum hourly rate of pay that an employer needs to pay an employee. Note the bold type - here in ruralite land, there is a relatively low percentage of employees being paid by regular employers. In fact, I'm hard pushed to think of anyone I know who is employed fulltime, most are self-employed and/or working part-time jobs in order to earn their living.The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has announced the national minimum wage rates from 1 October 2011:•the adult rate will increase by 15p to £6.08 an hour•the rate for 18-20 year olds will increase by 6p to £4.98 an hour•the rate for 16-17 year olds will increase by 4p to £3.68 an hour•the rate for apprentices will increase by 10p to £2.60 an hourConsider this:   If a frugal household can live on £5,000 for a year with no rent or mortgage to pay, how well off would that household be if all occupants earned £6.08 for every hour they worked?   With 3 adults sharing, how many hours would each need to work on minimum wage to earn the £96 in total per week to live in Frugaldom?   With 3 adults sharing, what rate of pay would each need to earn the £696 in total per week to live in the 3-bed, Suffolk Street flat in Westminster?   Interesting number-crunching result, isn't it?"},
{"title": "Just a little extra with a few photos.", "date": "Tuesday 20 September 2011", "text": "A Stroll Along the Badger Walk Today's roof-repair works went well. The rain stayed away, the sun shone and the man on the roof said it's now strong enough to jump up and down on - although he didn't recommend doing it too often. I'm happy with that, it means there's scope, once the work is completed, for some growing space. Not quite a green roof, but certainly a micro-roof garden of some description. This evening, after the workmen had gone, we went out for our frugal walk to make the most of the dry weather. We didn't wander far, only down to the old mill ruins at the bottom of the road, then along what I like to call the 'badger walk'. 'Badger Walk' is so-named (not in any official capacity) for good reason. Part of this particular track has been concreted, presumably for the benefit of farm vehicles, but there in the middle of it, for all to see, is a perfect set of badger footprints. You can follow them right along the middle of the road for a short distance. This always makes me laugh, as I can imagine the lost badger trundling along, paws sinking and sticking to the soggy concrete, wondering where he had gone wrong to end up on such a road. (It had to be a he, a she would have stopped and asked the way!) Then, of course, there would have been the problem of him explaining the concrete in his nails to the wife, as he sat chewing out the gravel from between his toes. What can I say? I have a vivid imagination, I'm easily amused, it costs nothing and it entertains me.The return journey was around sunset. The sea looked dark and cold in the distance, with no island to be seen. There was a brisk breeze blowing up from the shore, whirling the wind turbines at ever-increasing speeds. Have you ever noticed how loud these can be? They sound like shredded bin bags caught in a hawthorn hedge, being thrashed by the wind. Even H thought that's what it was and he's meant to be the sensible one in this frugal household.Overhead, the sky was a pale shade of blue with white clouds swirling one way and pink clouds crossing the other way - they looked as thought they were moving in opposite directions! I can't decide if this is good or bad, as there's a definite nip in the air. It wasn't your typical pink sky, these were more like the beginnings of rain clouds tinged by the setting sun and, like the silly badger, they just didn't know which way to go.As we got nearer home, it was looking clearer and really quite promising for tomorrow's stint of roof work. But then again, who knows what the good old Scottish weather has in store for us? If the Met Office can't say for sure, then who are we to play ill-educated guessing games? We need to take what nature has to give, that's the one thing that is certain.That's all I have to say tonight - not much. I hope nobody minds my sharing some of the sites that surround us here in Frugaldom.My Shoelaces aren't Leather, they're Baler Twine!(Title created in honour of Archie Sparrow) Frugaldom is about frugal living. It's the kingdom of a frugal entrepreneur, or 'frugaleur'.A 'frugaleur' will judge their successes on freedom from debt and fulfilment of a simple lifestyle dream. If it happens to lead to a fortune in the bank, then so be it.  It's simply a by-product of that frugal lifestyle of making do, mending, bartering, recycling, reducing, reusing, sharing and helping others reach their goals. You can always give the cash away if you don't want it.The original challenge was set several years ago and was based on a minimum wage income for a household of 3. There are no social security benefits, no rent rebates, council tax rebates, bus passes, pensions or grants of any description incorporated - we work from home and save every extra penny we can.After deducting 12 months' of rent (or mortgage payments) and annual council tax, the household budget was set at £4,000.00 for the entire year. Anything over this amount gets transferred into savings for a good life. It's now fast approaching the end of 2011 and that same £4,000 household budget has remained in force for 5 years, despite all odds. I should add that if you have debts, then all debt payments should be deducted and any excess set towards overpaying those, as it helps to speed up the process of becoming debt-free.In April 2011, those years of scrimping and saving finally reaped some rewards - we pooled our resources and bought this relatively cheap, 3-bedroom fixy-up with about quarter of an acre of badly neglected garden land. No more rent to pay, no wacko landlords, no mortgage, no more housemoves.We're based in Scotland, where it can get rather cold, wet and windy. We live in a rural area, where mobile telephone signals haven't yet reached us, where broadband is not yet broad enough, where no bus travels this route and no gas main will probably ever come. It's 3 miles to the village store and 17 miles to the nearest supermarket. It isn't remote, we're terraced and live in a street of about 25 houses. We love it!As Government-imposed austerity measures take effect and inflation hits 9 times the Bank of England base rate, frugal living provides a cushion to the worst of these blows. It's simply a case of having already adapted to living on a tight budget. It's never too late to start, so why not start now, with a 2012 pledge to follow a more frugal lifestyle and give debt a final kick into oblivion? It's a rollercoaster ride but it can be fun!Frugaldom is about stretching every penny to ensure life is worth leading. It's about an entire lifestyle revolving around make do and mend, batch cooking, gardening, poultry keeping, bargain hunting, foraging and any other thrifty, moneysaving pastimes you can imagine. Ultimately, it is about debt free living with no reliance on the 'State', while fighting to earn your own income from home. In a nut shell (some call it a nut house!), it's about self-sustainability with an element of self-sufficiency thrown in for good measure.This past week has seen Defra release the new 'Guidance on the application of date labels to food' (.pdf document) in an effort to cut down on the amount of food being thrown out, but that could hit some money saavy grocery shoppers hard. For anyone who actually enjoys the thrill of bagging themselves grocery bargains when stores start slashing prices to shift their stock quickly, this may mean the end of an era!I can't see it making one blind bit of difference to wasteful households. In my opinion, those who bin perfectly good food will continue to do so, only this time it will be based on the 'best before' dates. Where will it all lead, I wonder? Will some future committee sit debating the pros and cons of 'best before' dates and decide that they need to meet the same fate? I hope not!Then there's the power struggle. Utilities companies continue to fleece huge profits for their shareholders, forcing thousands of people into what's being brandished about as 'fuel poverty', but let's get realistic about this; how many people truly afford themselves the luxury of maintaining a temperature in their living room of 21C and 18C in their other rooms? This has to be city mentality, as it certainly isn't something that anyone I can think of would attempt to do. For most of us, 16C is almost attainable without breaking the bank, but it's also dependent on burning fossil fuels - coal, if you haven't the luxury of a central heating system run off oil or non-mains gas. Logs are great, if you have a reliable supply and space to store them, but what other methods are available to anyone on a tight budget?Insulate your home! The Government was hell bent on pushing their insulation policies. Many companies jumped on the bandwagon with subsidised offers and freebies, but no thought was given to people living in old, traditionally built, stone houses. These old houses need to breathe. We can't suffocate them or wrap them in fibreglass wool, nor can we insulate walls that have no cavities. What alternatives were made available to us mere country-dwellers who stretch our budgets to afford to turn old houses into affordable homes? And to top all of that, let us never forget our national heritage. Many of these old buildings, which can make perfectly good homes, are Listed. This can pose a serious problem for the uninitiated or unsuspecting buyer, it can mean extra costs involved in any alterations to your otherwise frugal home.On 20 January 2011, Parliament passed the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2011 and it received Royal Assent on 23rd February 2011. Among other things, this act has the power to, \"raise the level of fines to £50,000 on summary conviction for unauthorised works to a scheduled monument or listed building.\"Don't let this put you off buying an old property here in Scotland. There are hundreds of them, crying out to be rescued and renovated. We can make changes to these houses, but at a cost. For a start, we need planning permission before we can even contemplate something as simple as double glazing or replacing a front door. But frugal living embraces recycling, so let's recycle. It embraces local trading, so let's trade locally. Following the planning permission route to double glazing and all mod cons is not an option for us, nor would we even want to transform a traditional stone cottage into ultra-modern living accommodation. Our leaking roof will soon be repaired, but it won't ever change its overall appearance. Our old slates will always be slates, our wooden, single-glazed, sash windows will, no doubt, always be wooden sash and single glazed. Our front door, which is literally hanging in there, needs to be replaced, but there's no 'off the shelf' or uPVC options for us, oh no. We eventually found a local joiner who is prepared to make a brand new door, identical to the existing one, reusing the old glass and reinstating the same skylight. The council planning department is happy with this, it has saved us the hassle of applying for planning permission and, to all intents and purposes, there will be no physical change or visible difference to the appearance of the building.I guess what I am trying to say is, if you are prepared to keep your own house in order, follow a frugal lifestyle and say good riddance to our money-driven, debt-ridden society, then anything is possible. We all need to earn a living, pay our taxes and contribute to society in some way, so why not plan for a future where you are contributing to a society you want to be part of in the first place? Even if it's a gradual process, each step of the way taken penny by penny, pound by pound, wouldn't you prefer freedom from debt and freedom to enjoy life?In 2012, NYK Media will, once again, renew the challenge to follow a frugal lifestyle on a tight budget. As yet, a final calculation has not been done to establish whether or not the Frugaldom household can afford to run on £4,000 (excluding council tax, as this is non-negotiable), but I sincerely hope that it proves possible. This being the case, then Frugaldom will continue to beat inflation and that's something that not many investments can achieve in this economic climate.Beat inflation, invest in your own frugal lifestyle.Making the Frugal House WatertightYesterday dawned fine and bright. The workmen arrived at 8.30am, the rain  arrived at 8.45am!We're in Scotland, we expect these things. Besides, it didn't exactly pour down, it was more of a steady drizzle that kept the inquisitive cat indoors while work continued in making the frugal house watertight for winter.By lunchtime, most of the foam-filled tin sandwich that had been our flat roof was piling up in the back garden awaiting its next adventure. Who knows how long it has been sitting up there, above our kitchen!This roofing should be able to get recycled into a new roof for the outbuilding or some other such project.Around lunchtime, the drizzling rain decided to stop and the day brightened up a bit, thankfully! This allowed the pitch of the 'flat' roof to be altered slightly, then the new wood decking was fitted before felting began. The rain was threatening to return by 5pm, but the roof was 99% watertight with a layer of felt and the edges torched down at the joins. Temperatures aren't too low at nights yet, so the 6\" gaps around the overhang wouldn't cause much of a problem. Luckily, the swallows have long, since, finished nesting, otherwise they would have been straight into the kitchen, the way they did every time the door was left open during summer! Had it been any earlier in the year, I'd have been hiding from wasps and bees! That was yesterday. Thankfully, today dawned bright and sunny, so we are hoping for progress in leaps and bounds.The leaves on the trees at the bottom of the garden are gradually turning to russet and falling to the ground. There are a few evergreens, so we won't lose all colour or shelter down by the hen run, but it is going to look quite bare soon. For now, I'll make the most of what is still growing and prepare for 2012.While work progresses on the back roof, Floppity bunny is confined to her hutch. It was too wet for her to venture out last night, so I'm sure she'll be desperate for a run around tonight. I really must organise more stockproofing for next year's veggies, though, as I can't begin to imagine how any of the newly planted carrot seeds will germinate after the number of times she has dug up the bed. I'll say that I'm hopeful of seeing some carrots grow, but won't go as far as saying that I'm confident.The strawberry runners are rooting nicely in their pots, but some have already been snipped from their mother plants, compliments of... yes, you guessed it.... Floppity! The only things she doesn't seem to be  interested in at the moment are the pumpkins! My guess is that even she couldn't manage a whole one on her own!I need to bake a loaf of bread today, but the kitchen is kind of off limits on account of the men on the roof. If anyone is visiting this afternoon, expect a breadmaker to be set up in the livingroom."},
{"title": "Typical Scottish Weather - We had a Mini Heatwave Today!", "date": "Sunday 18 September 2011", "text": "\"The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.\" John F. KennedyThis evening, I noticed the above great quote flagged up by Wiegert, a Dutch guy in San Fransisco, who goes by the name 'MarketYrSuccess' on Twitter. It was so apt that it prompted me to post this short update with some wonderful news from Frugaldom...The weather forecast in southwest Scotland is for sunshine with only the occasional showers over the next few days! Isn't that brilliant? Yeah!No, no, no... I don't simply mean that it's brilliant for Scotland to be expecting some dry weather, I mean that it's the window of opportunity we have been waiting for, the dry spell  needed for work to begin on our flat roof! The telephone call this afternoon confirmed that work has been scheduled, at short notice, to begin at 8am tomorrow morning.Frugaldom is a 'fixy-up' project. When we bought the place a few months ago, we bought an overgrown garden with a small house attached! Working in the garden takes very little money, but turning this house into a frugal home could take a while on such a frugal budget. We reckon the bathroom used to be either a stable or a pig sty, with a larger lean-to built on at some later date to represent a kitchen. If we added a stable door, the tin roofed, concrete floored kitchen would make a great home for a couple of goats! But I digress... this 200-year-old terraced cottage will become a proper home one day. It is, afterall, the 'forever' house.So, as tomorrow dawns, we'll be up bright and early, preparing for the next stage of our renovation journey - to remove the old leaky flat roof, which will then be replaced with a nice, new, non-leaking one. It's a job that simply has to be done, otherwise the main fabric of this old cottage would be under further attack from who knows what in the future. It is taking us months to dry the place out and I'm forever tripping over the assortment of ice cream tubs and margarine cartons that litter the concrete kitchen floor every time it rains. Scruffy cat will miss the leaks, as she likes to drink the drips as they fall., but I know she'll forgive us once she's snuggled up in a warm corner indoors when outdoor temperatures have fallen below zero.Never let it be said that frugality left our thoughts while spending thousands of pounds on making the Frugaldom household wind and watertight. The old roof that's being removed tomorrow will, hopefully, be fully recycled to make a new roof for the outbuilding.JFK said,\"The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.\"NYK said \"Hope the sun keeps shining so we can fix our roof.\""},
{"title": "The Rain Fell, the Ducklings Looked up in Amazement!", "date": "Saturday 17 September 2011", "text": "It's Never Too Wet for Ducks, it Seems.We really haven't had anything to complain about, weatherwise, here in Frugaldom, but yesterday's downpour came as a bit of a shock, even to the ducklings.One minute it was slightly breezy and overcast, the next we were hit by a torrential downpour - it was probaby the first serious rain that we've had since the ducklings went outside. This was quite a site to behold! Did the ducklings all run for cover and shelter from the deluge? No! They came running up to the gate, 9 heads tilted sideways, staring skywards and quacking at the falling rain!QUAIL: One of the projects we are working on here in Frugaldom is that of establishing a small egg production unit with the quail. Have you ever tried to photograph a quail? They are not the easiest birds to get to sit still and smile for the camera! After much to-ing and fro-ing, I managed to get one half-decent shot out of my dozens of failed attempts, so we now have the face of 'Frugal Gourmet'. She is a 2010, homebred, Italian quail hen. This colour variation of the Japanese coturnix quail is sometimes referred to as a Phoenix Golden quail, a far prettier name, in my opinion. Despite it being very pale, the colour is dominant when breeding in mixed colonies, so I'm expecting to end up with the majority of my homebred hens looking similar to this.Yesterday, while outdoor work was seriously curtailed by the rain and kitchen work seriously curtailed by the array of tubs scattered across the floor catching the drips from the leaking roof, I finally got around to designing the labels for the quail egg boxes. Aample labels have now been printed and we are getting ready to begin sales proper. (I've omitted part of the labelling for obvious reasons, but the new web page has been uploaded and we're almost good to go.)At £1.95 per dozen, I see no problems in selling, trading or even exchanging these eggs for other things that we need. I'll probably make a couple of small improvements to the final labels but, for now, we have the face of 'Frugal Gourmet'.The latest quail chicks are nearly four weeks old and are about ready for transferring outside to their new quarters. The hens among them should be laying before the end of October! Last time around, I separated the white males from the females prior to collecting eggs. This will ensure we have sufficient unrelated stock for next year's breeding programme. With luck, we should be able to have at least a dozen hens laying each day to see us through winter, then we'll set to work on improving the set-up to enable a larger flock to be maintained on a self-financing basis from 2012. We aren't here to make our fortune, we are here to sustain our own lifestyle. If the birds can pay for themselves and supply us with eggs, I'll be delighted. Anything extra is a bonus that will be swept into savings for the next step of our Frugaldom journey. Quail eggs for breakfast, anyone?"},
{"title": "Riddle of the Mystery Plant solved!", "date": "Thursday 15 September 2011", "text": "Blue Sky, Sunshine, Gardening and a Mystery SolvedNot so long ago, I posted about my mystery plant in the hope of finding out what it was. It had seeded itself in one of the hanging baskets that are attached around the bird table, so my guess was that it was produced from seed out the wild bird mix. Thankfully, it wasn't hemp! Several suggestions were made as to its identity, with the most likely being some type of red stemmed buckwheat. This, indeed, is what the mystery plant has turned out to be. Now that the flowers are beginning to die back, you can clearly see the buckwheat forming. I've never seen this plant before now, so still haven't a clue where it came from or how it got here: there doesn't seem to be any buckwheat in the wild bird mix I'm using. I'll save the seed and replant it all next year, as the plant looks rather pretty with its tall, slender red stems and clusters of pale pink and white flowers.After the windy, wet weather that resulted from the tail end of Hurricane Katia, it was great to see the sun shining and the temperature soaring today. By lunchtime, it had reached a balmy 24C here in Frugaldom, so it was definite T-shirt weather and perfect for getting out into the garden.Weed, weed, wedding again - cobbled front yard done and then I set about tidying up the strawberries. Plenty of runners have appeared, so I potted up over twenty of them for transplanting next year. While weeding between the plants, however, I noticed a new set of flowers coming, which surprised me! As I was cutting away the old growth where previous strawberries had been harvested, I kept finding more and more new shoots. As usual, I never kept any of the names of the varieties of strawberries we have, so if anyone can let me know what I should do with them, I'd be really grateful. Do I leave these flowers in the hope that they'll bear fruit this late in the year or should they be nipped out to allow the plants to strengthen before over-wintering them?More broccoli was harvested, along with the last of the peas and some tomatoes. While picking the tomatoes I noticed how much fruit was coming on the cape gooseberries. Who'd have believed these would grow so well outdoors in Scotland?In preparation for winter, I built a mini glasshouse around the tiny grape vine to see if it survives until spring. There's no space to take it indoors, so here's hoping we get a mild winter. Failing that, it will get moved into the outbuilding and can sit by the window.The pond got topped up today, to the great excitement of all the ducks! It wasn't long before they were all in there, splashing and diving around like the crazy feathered marauders that they are. It was great fun for Scruffy cat, too, as she was pawing the water and trying to catch the splashes. Daft cat! One of these days she is going to fall right in and Joey, our drake, will take great pleasure in chasing her.By early evening, it was still bright and dry, so we headed out for a walk to see if we could spot any badgers. We have seen them, but not close to the house.A neighbour a few doors along from us has one coming into his garden at nights, so we're hopeful of catching a glimpse of our resident Mr Brock sometime soon. Unfortunately, it wasn't tonight.Our walk took us along the lane by the woods, which is where we normally see deer and badgers. We did see a fox, but it disappeared before camera was at the ready. I'm amazed at how many flowers are still in bloom and the heather is still a rich purple along the bank of the stream.The calves in the adacent field were having a great time, chasing one another around, tails straight up in the air and hooves flying all ways. They all came to an abrupt stop when we passed, some being more inquisitive than others. This one was very brave and ust kept following us. Thankfully, there was a fence between us and them, as heap big daddy bull was out there, too!By the time we were returning home, the sun was setting over the hill and it was getting quite dusky. Probably, this would be a great time for badger spotting, but the hens and ducks still had to be put to bed and Scruffy cat found to ensure she didn't try to sleep in the chicken hut again!What a lovely day it has been - we need a full week of this so we can get the kitchen roof replaced but, sadly, the weatherman reckons otherwise."},
{"title": "Curiously Pink... But Very Frugal!", "date": "Wednesday 14 September 2011", "text": "Dinner From The GardenNothing beats good, fresh, homegrown produce.After a slow start to the day, the clouds cleared to reveal bright blue sky and the sun shone, so being outdoors was preferable to being sat at the computer all day.Here in Frugaldom, there are no end of surprises awaiting us in the garden, so today's find wasn't so much shocking, as rather exciting.Having been househunting, moving, transplanting a garden and trying to make the new place habitable for the first half of 2012, potato planting was somewhat shambolic, to say the least. I had no seed potatoes ready, so anything that sprouted was put into tubs or into the ground pretty much as soon as we got here - but I definitely didn't plant any pink potatoes!Tonight, I went to lift some potatoes for dinner and chose to empty one of my tubs. I knew there wouldn't be many potatoes in it, but enough for a meal is enough for a meal. Imagine my surprise when I found these lovely pink tatties! I had wondered about their colour, as the foliage had red veins, but I still didn't plant anything looking remotely like these. A frugal bonus!Dinner was chicken, (not one of our own, as they all have names!) so I needed some veg to go with it. Plenty of carrots this year, so it goes without mention that it's carrots with most things here in Frugaldom, at the moment. But the sprouting broccoli is erupting everywhere now, too, so it's a must have, as we love it.Frugal cooking means making the most of everything, so I don't peel the carrots, these are simply scrubbed, topped and tailed.To cut down on electricity, I steam veggies over the top of the potatoes - fewer pots to wash doing it this way, too!Please note - the rabbit was NOT part of dinner!﻿Frugaldom's Big Bad BunnyRooting about in the garden for dinner is great fun on a sunny day like today, never really knowing what you'll find. One thing you will find, however, is our big, bad bunny!Floppity loves hiding beneath the kale and broccoli, then leaps out when anyone (or anything) walks past. The poor cat has been caught out several times and, being smaller than our rabbit, said Scruffy cat needs to be quick!This afternoon, bunny decided it would be fun to wriggle her way beneath the netting and was only discovered by the dirt that was flying from beneath the brussel sprouts! This was a great game for her, as she could sprint between the veg beds, stopping only to eat whatever else got in her way. The Frugaldom bunny is becoming very cheeky, indeed!Prot€cting ¥our Fruga£ Investment$It's a bit of a 'non-day' here, today. No new work arrived in my email in-box, no interesting post dropped through the letterbox and, so far, there have been no visitors. The coalman did deliver a half tonne of coal early this morning, mind you, and it was the brief chat with him that prompted this post.The topic of discussion was property and assetts, mainly about what happens to them when an elderly person ends up moving out of their home and into residential care. With a family member in this situation right now, I understand the trauma and upheaval it causes. I'm failing in my attempts to convince family members that their life's work of striving for a lovely home with savings in the bank is pointless unless they plan for the entire future.Frugaldom is about frugal living, finding the most cost-effectve ways of creating own little microholding of self-sustainability, working from home to earn what we need to cover the costs of living, while investing anything left over into our future, whatever that might be.Buying the property outright was our only option - no bank would offer a mortgage to the likes of us, we are self-employed and debt free with no fixed, regular income... banks and building societies hate that! It seems that the more debt you take on, the more it becomes available to you, which is great, IF you can service those debts regardless of the outcome of any unforeseen changes. Anyhow, debt free is how I intend to stay, even if it means renovations take many years. Whatever way we look at it, if it all went pear-shaped, we do have a (currently leaking) roof over our heads and a big enough garden to grow food, rear poultry and generally keep us busy. Home can be anything you make it as long as you feel secure. In my book, that means no unreliable landlords.One of today's 'junk' emails arrived announcing that, \"The fine wine market has outperformed oil, gold and international equities for the past two years.\" It went on to invite me, the \"Dear Investor\", to register my details and claim my free copy of their 'Wine Investment Guide'. I didn't, of course, because I have absolutely no intentions of 'investing' in fermented sugar and fruit pulp that I can't drink. Let's face it, a bottle of store's own 'Lambrusco' is about as close to a fine wine as we get these days. Even then, it's only if someone brings a bottle as a gift! The frugal version of longterm investment in fine wine is looking after your rhubarb patch, bulk buying sugar when it's on offer and, if you're really 'up market', tending your grape vines in your makeshift lean-to greenhouse.I should add that if anyone receives the above email, look at the date of the Bloomerg statistics they are using to 'sell' us their brilliant idea... April 2010! I'd check for more recent trends before pursuing anything any further, or else simply hit 'delete'.Bricks and mortar, now that's a sound investment! Nothing beats owning your own house! It can drain you of every penny while trying to keep it wind and watertight, leak money from every corner while trying to heat it during winter and swallow up every bit of your savings in one fell swoop if you buy it for cash. On the other hand, it can equally do all of these things, but cost you three or four times as much if you choose to spread the payments over the duration of a mortgage, accompanied by whatever other insurances they deem necessary.Why do I think bricks and mortar investments are far superior to any other longterm investments? In my humble and frugal opinion, it's more a case of valuing a home and the land upon which it sits. Land should be the longterm investment, for whatever reason you can imagine. Think about it... society can offer us everything we need. We can make our own wines, sew our own clothes, build our own homes, manufacture practically anything, grow our own food, rear our own livestock, create any manner of fantastic, technological device, heal the sick, offer financial support to the needy... but we cannot make more space on this planet! No amount of wheeling and dealing, investing, trading, developing, exploring, researching or data analysis will ever create land. Let the sheiks build their paradise islands, let the 'high heid yins' spend vast fortunes in making fortunes that need fortunes spent on them to avoid paying fortunes in taxes, let the designer-clad city folks pamper and spoil themselves, let the rich property tycoons and landowners lord it over their tenants, but never let it be said that life is their way or no way. We have a choice - to be indebted or not. Frugaldom means freedom.So, frugal readers and those of you who are just being nosey while having nothing better to do, be prepared. Think long and hard about your portfolios, holdings and longterm investments. They're worth nothing if there's no room at the inn."},
{"title": "Moneysaving and Frugal Keep Fit!", "date": "Tuesday 13 September 2011", "text": "Sometimes, I am astounded by my own stupidity!Working from home in a small, rural commuity means that all the work post needs to be ferried to the nearest village post office, which is three miles from here. In true frugal fashion, I try to limit post office visits to four trips each week, so I've been thinking about ways of cutting these associated costs by any means possible.The obvious solution is to walk to the post office, but I can be lazy and I hate to get soaked through when there's nowhere indoors here for drying wet clothes. I might try the walking option next summer, but it's dependent on time of day for traffic, as the narrow lanes aren't all that safe when there are tractors trundling up and down towing all sorts of lethal looking machinery, plus there's no pavement running along the main shore road once I reach it, an 'A' route that's like a free for all as far as speed driving is concerned. I had all but given up hope and couldn't see the obvious choice I should be making!Don't laugh, but I had one of those 'Eureka' moments down in the village earlier this afternoon. My moneysaving solution is so simple that I have astounded myself!Normally, the journey to the post office or local store is a 6 mile round trip in the car. I have a budget of £25 per month for petrol costs, so that doesn't really allow for many trips further afield. I also try to fit in one trip per month to the nearest town, which is almost 20 miles away, so my £25 worth of petrol does't take me far. By making this one incredibly simple change, I should be able to save myself one sixth of my regular weekly petrol costs and get a little bit fitter into the bargain. Have you worked it out yet?If I park the car in the layby half a mile this side of the post office, I can walk the remaining distance, thus shaving a mile off my driving costs each trip and reducing carbon emissions. On top of that, the mile walked while carrying the mail will burn nearly 100 calories extra on each trip. That's only 17.5 (best call it 18) trips to the post office to burn off the equivalent of an extra half pound of fat! Coincidentally, 18 is the approximate number of times I need to visit the post office each month! How ingenously simple is that? Better still, if it's raining, I can simply take my huge golf umbrella, bought free with my eBid buddy points!But there's more! There are other lay-bys, so it needn't be restricted to a one mile walk each trip. There's a much larger parking area on the shore about a mile from the post office. I plan on using this one for dry trips when the mail bag isn't too heavy. Who knows, by next summer I could be a frugal, slender 'green goddess'!Frugal fun, frugal fitness, frugal moneysaving to help make owning the car more affordable."},
{"title": "Living in a Micro-Climate Bubble", "date": "Monday 12 September 2011", "text": "Hurricane Katia Passed Us ByDespite all the preparations, the predicted gales from the tail-end of Hurricane Katia managed to sail on past Frugaldom. Don't get me wrong, the little free-standing bird table that I forgot to secure did get blown over and we could see the tops of the trees bending under the blasts of wind but, other than that, all has been normal in and around Frugaldom today. High tide came and went around noon, causing a bit of spray to be thrown up across the main shore road, but we were fortunate in that no storm hit us here. There are white horses the length and breadth of the bay, reminding us all that the choppy waters are at the beck and call of nature, rather than any person or group within any society. Respect for nature is paramount to the success of frugal living while embracing the whole concept of microholding.Frugal washing was dried safely on the line, the ducks and hens showed no signs of noticing the blustery afternoon and then, this evening, we went out for a stroll to check out the nearby foraging sites. (The ducks and hens stayed home.)The brambles aren't exactly what I'd call abundant, but this is probably more a reflection on the council having trimmed all the hedgerows. The sloes, on the other hand, which are out of reach of the trimmers, are in great supply. They look almost ready for picking, so I'll need to raid the drinks cabinet to rake out the vodka. (OK, I'll try to find the cardboard box and unpack it!) No gin drinkers here, but sloe vodka tastes great, especially during the nippy, winter nights as a delicious, alternative cold 'remedy'. It somehow reminds me of cough syrup from many years ago and gives a warm glow - frugal feelgood factor! (My opinion only, I'm not advocating this as a real remedy.)While out walking this evening, we could see a band of cloud drifting across between us and the Mull of Galloway. It was nearing sunset, so made for quite a spectacular sight. (The camera isn't the best, but it was frugal - as a 'Buddy Points' bargain from eBid.)By the time we got home, sun had set but was delivering a fine spectacle of pinks and blues in the sky overhead, so I'd to nip out the back door and snap a quick photo of that, too.This photo on the right was taken shortly after 8pm this evening.Since moving here, in April, we really cannot fault the weather. Compared to where we were, a mere 16 miles from here, this is a completely different climate. It's almost as though the area has its own micro-climate, which is in excellent keeping with my longterm plans to create a microholding, right here in the back garden. (Microholding, as opposed to smallholding, because our garden, at a push, extends to no more than quarter of an acre.)Anyone can create a microholding. It just takes a little bit of thought and planning to ensure that you are making the absolute most of whatever space you have available - even if it's no more than a balcony or a patio. The variety of plants, fruit and vegetables that can be grown in relatively small spaces is extensive, so start planning ahead for how you could create your very own microholding in 2012. And don't forget that it's never too late to begin planting. Over the past couple of weeks, I have sown some poppy seeds, all year round cauliflower, carrots and my saffron crocus bulbs. Hopefully, I'll can get started planting up the tubs outside the front door before the month is out then, when the frost is liable to start getting into the ground, it will be time to get the garlic going. My late potatoes are still growing at an alarming rate, so I'm not convinced that there will be potatoes under the ground or simply a huge array of foliage towering a metre high already. The potatoes I planted were nothing more than household ones that had sprouted! Waste not, want not and only time will tell.Today's money saving:Laundry - Washing done with homemade laundry detergent then dried outside on the lineKeep fit - a frugal walk in the fresh airForaging foray - free berriesWork - post all sent out Second ClassRecycling - plastic tray packaging from foodstuffs rinsed and kept as seed trays."},

Having 11 ducks is definitely a drain on resources while we're getting only one egg per day from Phoebe, but three of the youngsters will soon be re-homed. In true Frugaldom style, I'm hoping to trade them for straw, which will ensure warm, dry bedding for hens, ducks and rabbit throughout the winter.In the poultry run, the grass and weeds have long since gone, to be replaced by bare land that looks not too far off becoming mud! This has been helped along by the fact that WE HAVE MOLES! I thought we'd seen the last of them when we moved from the previous house, but oh no... here we go again! Worse still, they have the audacity to burrow around the solar-powered mole deterrent! (Note to all - don't waste any money buying one of these so-called wonder devices, they are RUBBISH!)The array of containers littering the kitchen floor has had to be extended to incorporate the latest leak. There's just enough space to fit a margarine tub on the edge of the unit where the breadmaker sits, so let's hope this is enough to stem the flow of rainwater that's now dripping from three separate spots of our higgledy-piggledy roof. The materials needed for the replacement are being ordered by the joiner this week, but having them in stock makes no difference to the immediate outcome - we need a week of dry weather to remove and replace the entire flat roof. Our Scruffy cat, on the other hand, would probably prefer that we keep the drips, as she likes to drink the resulting puddles of water!Floppity bunny isn't too happy at being closed in her hutch, so she has launched her own great escape plan. It looks as though this involves her chewing her way through the already reinforced door! Yesterday, she spent most of her time in the cabbage patch, again, nibbling her way around the outer leaves and munching on the nearby turnip leaves. The way I see it, she does some weeding, turns over some soil when digging, spreads a little fresh manure and ends up too full to eat regular rabbit food, so a kilo of mix lasts us quite a while. Carrot tops are one of her favourite foods, but she is apt to steal peas and beans - not the healthiest option for rabbits, according to many books. On the subject of pruning, Floppity bunny has also trimmed the raspberry canes, strawberries, lettuces, broccoli and an assortment of flowers. She particularly liked the pink campions by the back door!Being the weekend, not a penny has been spent. A couple of friends have visited - first stop to see the ducklings - and I managed to scoot round the floorboards with the vacuum before anyone ventured in for a cuppa. I've given up fighting the dust, there's simply no point in clearing it up when one's walls are stripped back to bare brick. I should probably remove the spider webs from the corners, though! The leggy beasties are finding their way indoors no problem, but it's probably better them than the little brown lizards!Nine out of the nine quail chicks still remain in their brooding box, all are fully feathered and, as I've recently discovered, all can fly! They proved this when three of them took off vertically, like Harrier Jump Jets, and ended up running around the living room. For a moment, while chasing the cat out, I thought we were about to lose two of them straight up the chimney, but I managed to catch them when they landed on the logs! I think I'll name one 'Sooty' and the other, 'Sweep'. (The quail, not the logs!)A strange noise can be heard outside the back door. It's a sort of deep, throaty 'gurp' sound, emanating from the wood pile. Scruffy cat finds it most entertaining and sits for hours staring, in the hope of finding a new playmate. Further investigation revealed a huge toad! Meanwhile, the lizard that lived among the tomato plants in one of the big fish box planters seems to have moved on, so I should be able to move those this week. We need the storage space.Not sure if the same offers apply all over the country, but September is discounted coal month here. It's our one chance to stock up for the winter months, with £1 off per bag when buying five or more. We haven't made space for it yet, but have ten bags arriving on Wednesday, with the hope that it will see us through to the end of the year. I do hope the plumber hurries up in getting the faulty radiator fixed: it will make such a difference when the open fire can heat the water and the other rooms on the ground floor of our humble abode.That's it from Frugaldom for now. Tomorrow is another day, with luck that storm will stay away!"},
{"title": "Moneysaving Ways of Being Prepared for Autumn", "date": "Saturday 10 September 2011", "text": "How Prepared Are You ?September is a month of change, when summer is nearing its end and autumn becomes more apparent by the day. Already, the trees around this part of southwest Scotland are shedding their leaves, blackberries are ripe, the elderberries are beginning to hang in heavy clumps and most new growth is slowing in everything except the weeds.Despite this, the sun still shines and there's still a great deal of colour to be seen from an amazing variety of flowers. Here in Frugaldom, the sunflowers have only just begun to bloom, their heads heavy and drooping, their huge stalks swaying precariously in the increasing winds. Temperatures of 25C in the afternoon can dip below 10C in the evenings and the heavy morning dew can last until noon. Many of the plants are going to seed, so this is a great time to collect what you need for sowing next year. I have already amassed a healthy supply of nasturtium and lupin seeds.Harvesting is in full swing, meaning that we need to be prepared to preserve and store all that we possibly can. Foraging is a great way of topping up the stores, by way of jam and jelly making, but let's not forget about the non-edibles. Sticks, dry leaves, pine cones and pine needles can all be gathered.Pine needles make great mulch for all those plants that appreciate a more acidic soil. Many of the forest fruits, brambles, blueberries and even the strawberries seem to benefit from this and, although not particularly something to promote, my quail seem to love scratching about in a thick bed of pine needles and dried leaves.If you have a stove or open fire, fallen twigs and sticks add to your stash of kindling, as do pine cones. We love pine cones here in Frugaldom, as they are so versatile. Once dried, these can be decorated or used as part of natural ornamentation. We used to spray them silver and gold then hang them on the Christmas tree, but aerosol cans of shiny paint aren't really all that frugal, nor are they particularly environmentally friendly. However, if you save all the ends from your old candles, pine cones dipped in melted wax make fantastic firelighters. Once dried, the cones store well in cardboard boxes and, even without the added benefit of the wax, still make great kindling.Costcutting within the home becomes increasingly difficult during colder months, especially when most of us have become so reliant on electricity. With prices soaring, the already financially challenged households become increasingly aware of the need to cut costs. Monitoring electricity use is a huge help in seeing where money is being spent. There's no need to invest in expensive equipment to monitor every kilowat you use, especially if the money could be better spent elsewhere. A sheet of paper and regular meter reading will suffice, or try setting up a basic spreadsheet on your computer to chart your progress.With the nights growing longer, reduced daylight hours can mean the need for lights being switched on for the greater part of the day. Make sure you have made the most of every opportunity available to you for claiming subsidised or free energy saving lightbulbs, as the savings do mount up over the year.Of course, mains electricity is useless when the autumn or winter storms arrive and bring with them the possibility of power cuts. That's when we are really grateful for our all-important 'emergency supplies' and warm winter wear. Things like candles and matches are must-have items and, if you have an open fire or stove, suitable cooking utensils that enable you to heat food or boil a kettle of water are always useful. It may sound silly, but without the benefit of a logburner or multi-fuel stove, I always find it handy to keep charcoal at the ready for an impromptu BBQ, regardless of the weather.Any prolonged power cut will hamper cooking and it isn't always dry enough to light a BBQ, so other alternatives need to be available. Whether it's a camping gas stove or something to shelter you from the rain while lighting a BBQ, it is always helpful to have frugal 'fast food' at the ready. Love them or hate them, dried snack foods are more than welcome when nothing else is available. As long as you can boil some water, instant soup, noodles, pasta and even custard or hot chocolate are great substitutes, served up with an accompanying tinned food. Instant soup followed by tinned fruit with instant custard is great after a freezing day working outside in wind and rain, especially if you get back inside and end up with a power cut! Batch cooked 'ready to heat and eat' food like soup is a bonus, but nine times out of ten we have it stored in the freezer. Without electricity, it is best notto open your fridge or freezer, in order to preserve the contents for as long as possible.One thing that we have learned to do here is to always keep a flask of boiling water at the ready. This not only saves you having to boil the kettle every time you want a cuppa, it's also a very handy thing to have at the ready if the power goes off suddenly.Now for the weather forecast. Apparently, the tail end of Hurricane Katia is heading our way, due to arrive Monday or Tuesday. There have been a few weather warnings issued by the Met Office and the usual sensationalism is being spread by the media. With luck, the storm will blow itself out before it gets here and causes any real damage, but never let it be said that we didn't heed the warnings. Anything that can be blown over in the garden has been secured, the sunflowers have been tied up with wire mesh attached to the wall and there's an extra bucket of coal, basket of sticks and pile of logs sat by the fire. Let's call it a trial run, 'just in case', but right now, the sun is still shining and the sky is clear. It must be raining somewhere, though, as the stream at the bottom of our garden is almost in spate. There's also a blustering wind that seems to be increasing in strength. I'm still not completely convinced that autumn has arrived, but that might be wishful thinking, as we've still to replace the flat roof over our kitchen before winter. It is secure for now, that is the main thing.Now, I'm off to check the stores and see what items need adding to my list of 'emergency supplies'. I will allocate a budget of £30 for this, equivalent to £10 per person in the household. Most of the items have a long shelf life and can be easily stored, so I'll include my finished list and accompanying costs in a subsequent post.Nature is something we can never control, nor should we expect to control it, but we can take precautions against falling foul of all it can throw at us, so be prepared. Take care of yourselves and be prepared to help out others wherever you can. Let's hope the forthcoming severe weather is nothing more than a storm in a teacup!"},
{"title": "Who Needs a Roof when The Sun Shines?", "date": "Friday 9 September 2011", "text": "September SunshineAfter several dull and rainy days, the sun shone for most of the afternoon yesterday, so blogging fell by the wayside in favour of being out in the garden. It's sunny now, but I've already had my coffee while sitting out watching the rabbit bouncing around the garden, helping herself to whatever she fancies. Not much damage to be done at this time of year and I don't grudge her the bottom leaves from the brussel sprouts or kale, nor do I mind that she nibbles the carrot tops.It costs nothing to sit out and enjoy the afternoon, frugal fresh air, the chance to appreciate nature and, if lucky, a walk about to gather in some of the fruits of your labours. Who needs a kitchen roof when the sun shines? It's a case of making the most of the patio, even although that probably won't be fully cleared before next year. We did get the Saffron crocus bed made (seen on right) and all 60 of the bulbs planted, so I'm happy with that. I've had to lay wire mesh over the top of the bed to keep the cat from going in and digging, though!Despite all its flaws, we bought the house to develop it into a home and, most importantly for us at the time, for the potential we saw in the garden. Compared to how it looked  6 months ago, it's now unrecognisable. I'm really pleased with progress and I'm delighted that everything is growing so well. I do sometimes look in dismay at what still has to be done out there, but the blog and photographs serve to remind me of how much we've achieved so far.Decided to check on the pumpkins, as I'd really like to have one ready for carving in time for Halloween. These are meant to be giant pumpkins, but I had my doubts at the start. That was then... Now, my football-sized pumpkins are approaching medinice ball size and seem to be growing by the day. Not sure what to do for the best, as I have never grown pumpkins before this. Having had to double the size of the bed they are in, I left a few marigolds scattered among them - mainly because I couldn't think where else to move them!Watch this space for pumpkin news.Further down the garden, behind the rhubarb, I had thrown a handful of sunflower seeds. It was rather late for planting them but they have managed to survive. Yesterday morning saw the arrival of the first flower, so I'm quite optimistic that a few others will follow suit, assuming the weather doesn't suddenly deteriorate. Fingers crossed that the garden birds get the chance to enoy the seeds this autumn. The garden is an absolute haven for birds, as long as we can keep an eye on the cat! (She's now onto her third collar with bells, as she keeps losing them while scrapping with the other neighbourhood cats.) One of these days, I'll be lucky enough to snap a photo of all the goldfinches and the bull finches that frequent this part of the garden. Item to be added to the next 'to do' list - tie up the sunflowers, as they have long, since, grown up over the top of their current garden cane supports.The broccoli is now sprouting all ways. Not sure if I like this as much as being able to simply walk out and cut one large head off the plants, but the sprouting variety is certainly productive, so might prove to be more economical.The raised beds are planned for next year, so I'm hoping to get back to some more 'square foot gardening', as I like the variety it produces, all from the one smallish space.In the micro-orchard, the nine home-hatched ducklings are now almost fully grown. At only 9 weeks old, it's getting difficult to tell the white ones apart from Phoebe and Joey, the adults. They all seem happy together and spend much of their time waddling around the pond. Soon, however, a few will be leaving to go to their new homes. Thankfully, 'Custard Cream', the pale coloured one, and 'Orio', the black and white one, both seem to be ducks, so they have secured their longterm home here in Frugaldom. I'm not sure how many of the others will remain but I was intending keeping half a dozen ducks for eggs. We now need to decide which three of the others can stay before rehoming the other four. It's a tough decision to make, as I like them all!Hopefully, my spring bulbs will arrive in the next week or so. This will let me get a bit more done at the front of the house, as I'll can plant up all the tubs. The nasturtiums are still flowering, as are the marigolds. The 'Millions of Bells', given to me by a neighbour, have started to flower and the tiny violas rescued from the cobbled gutter seem to be surviving alongside one tiny begonia. Seed collecting has begun, from both my own flowers and by way of packets traded through the Galloway LETS group, so next year should be a colourful one. It might not be frugal as far as growing edible produce is concerned, but the splash of colour and the extra bird life it encourages is well worth it. Bird corner should take on a life of its own in 2012.That's almost it for today. I did manage to make a huge batch of carrot and lentil soup, which has now been split up and frozen. The last of the heritage 'blue' potatoes got eaten with dinner last night and I still have a bucket of carrots, loads of beas, courgettes and the big tub of broccoli to blanche and freeze but space in the freezer is at a premium, so some creative thinking is required, especially knowing that the kitchen has to be emptied completely for the roof work starting. But tomorrow is another day. For now, I'm off to do a bit more weeding before it's time to make dinner."},
{"title": "Can Frugal Living be Eco-nomical as well as Eco-friendly?", "date": "Thursday 8 September 2011", "text": "A Home Needs a Kitchen... and a Kitchen Needs a Roof!In my book of life, the kitchen is the heart of the home. My dreams of one day owning a house with a roomy, farmhouse kitchen, complete with logburning range and comfortable seating area may not have been realised, but that is not to say that we have failed. On the contrary, it is more a case of looking at what we have and then making the very most of it.I'm not on a farm, I'm not in a farmhouse, I don't have a logburning range and the kitchen, once completed, will never be big enough to house the entire heart of this frugal home, but we need to start somewhere. For Frugaldom, that somewhere is making the 'kitchen' wind and watertight before winter sets in and we all freeze. :)Our little end-terraced cottage is about 200 years old. As such, it would have had no seperate kitchen, as all the cooking would have been done in what we now call our livingroom. But somewhere along the line, someone saw fit to join the house to what we assume must have been the original washhouse, although some neighbours suggest it was the stable and/or pigsty. Yes, our cottage is in an area where huge families crammed into tiny houses, grew & reared much of their own food and most walked to work at the nearby mill. Or else they went by horse & cart down to the village, about three miles away. I suspect previous owners here, at some point in the past, had a donkey, judging by the tiny, rusting shoe I excavated from the garden.Behind the green door lies the basis for my dream kitchen. For all its faults, the door opens and closes, even if the wind does whistle in all around the edges and the rain does run in underneath. It's not like we have carpets in there - we don't even have a proper floor, yet.The space has almost been gutted. All that needs doing now is the panelling removed from the walls, the rotten ceiling pulled down, the leaking roof replaced and then we can begin renovating the place properly. We're trying to find the most economical ways of doing this, but it would also be great if we could keep it as eco-friendly as possible. Did I say that we're also using it as a kitchen? A few units, a piece of worktop, cooker, fridge, freezer and washing machine have all had to go in there, because we still need to live, eat and do the laundry.After four atempts, we have finally managed to find a builder/joiner who is prepared to quote for replacing the tin roof, which is an absolute priority. I really don't want to be messing around on an uneven concrete floor strewn with buckets while trying to cook the breakfast porridge, especially if it's a sub-zero winter's morning. I would LOVE a greenroof, but haven't even broached the subject with the roofer. For now, it's a straightforward off with the old, on with the new and leave off the tin sheeting. There's approximately 30 sq metres of 'L-shaped' flat, felted roof to be replaced, then the new ceiling and insulation to be done, plus associated electrical work. Of this, about two thirds of that space needs insulated, the other third already has a ceiling in place that, with luck, will suffice for now.From an eco-friendly point of view, the suggestion has been made to use sheep wool insulation (thank you for that, 'smallholder Carole', and for the reminder that it's campaign for wool week), so I have been researching the possibilites, comparing costs and working out if it's economically viable for us frugalites to pursue such a luxurious course of action. For this, Google is my friend.A bit of searching online finds sheep wool insulation at £6.71 per sq metre + vat, then carriage on top of that, so a total of around £200 for this option. Insulation boards, such as Kingspan, were what I had originally considered as the expensive option. Surprisingly, they work out about the same price as the sheep wool. On the other hand, we could simply opt for traditional insulation, which costs about one quarter of the above - so, as ardent frugalites, which 'eco' bell should we toll? Economical, or eco-friendly?Hmm... decisions, decisions, decisions... I think I need more information and help before making this one."},
{"title": "Budgeting to Make a House a Home", "date": "Wednesday 7 September 2011", "text": "Moneysaving + Renovation = Not a Good Combination(An Introduction)Many people dream of owning their own home. Thoughts drift towards a comfortable, uncomplicated life of debt free bliss - no mortgage, no rent, no worries. A pretty, country cottage with white picket fence and roses growing around the door... It's all so far removed from reality for most of us that we barely give it a passing thought, lest we sink into the depths of despair at the impossibility of it all. We can't help but think of the dire, economic climate in which we all seem to be living at the moment, probably overlooking the simple fact that it doesn't need to be like that!Here I am, writing and blogging on a daily basis about money saving, frugal living and a variety of attempts to earn a little extra, when I have overlooked one major storyline: the consequences of all this and where to go from here!It has taken 10 years of skrimping and saving, many temporary work contracts and enough house moves to make me think I'd have been better towing a mobile home. Then the opportunity arose to sink everything into buying a property to renovate into something that could be called home - a pretty white cottage with about a quarter acre of garden and room at the front for a picket fence and roses round the front door! OK, so it's an end terrace in a rural village, rather than a detached country property and, to be honest, 'village' isn't quite the correct term. Here, we have one street with nothing more than a phone box and a post box, so it's fairly rural.The roof leaks, none of the doors fit properly, one of the windows was held in place with cobwebs, there are holes in the floors and the garden hadn't been cultivated in years. The fusebox had been burned out, the wiring was old-style and most of the pipes were burst. The toilet cistern had frozen and thawed so often that its internal workings were non-existent, the \"kitchen\" looks like the ceiling may cave in and the outbuildings were so delapidated that storing anything in them wasn't an option. But we threw in our lot and took a chance on making it home.We had only two months to make the place habitable before we had to move in and give up the rental. In that time, we had to strip out the worst of the interior, dig up and transfer an entire garden, move the ducks, hens and quail plus bring the cat and the rabbit, get the plumbing and wiring fixed and gut the 'kitchen' to rid it of the rotten flooring. During that time, the car 'died' and we lost 50% of our income. The budget was well and truly screwed! How bad can things get? But we'd bought a house that could be renovated into a home.Now, the real work begins. Researching the most frugal ways of surviving this dire economic climate while renovating our house into a home. It is proving to be time consuming and, at times, soul-destroying, but every day is worth it and every day takes us one step closer to achieving our longterm goals.Is the good life all that it's cracked up to be? Can people still realise their dreams without being swallowed up by a system that dictates we MUST earn X amount of money? I certainly hope so, because it seems like we have stepped out of the system to find that it's all a bit of a myth. Society cannot function without cash because society has forgotten how to function without it and we all eed to pay taxes. Thanks to this, (and the fact that we couldn't afford a smallholding,) my concept of frugaldom has developed as a lifestyle and any cash earned online from home will, for me, forever be known as cyberdosh.Blah, blah, blah... let's get onto the good part - budgeting to make a house a home. Follow the tales and exploits of Frugaldom, as we continue our quest for financial freedom. For the cyberdosh side of things, I've introduce a second blog HERE.It's best to know right from the outset that frugaldom means adaptability and being prepared to make changes whenever or wherever necessary. I may write one thing one day and then retract it the next. There is no brand loyalty in Frugaldom, nor is there much room for error. It's very much about finding opportunities and making the most of everything because, as sure as I sit here typing this, this type of lifestyle falls through almost every safety net I can imagine.If you find yourself pining for the good life, you need to grasp every opportunity available and sometimes that means leaping before you look, or accepting that gift horse without first inspecting its teeth. It's all about being prepared, but for what, I do not know! Home's home, afterall.Back soon, and don't forget to +1 any posts you like so I know where to focus my attention. Thanks."},

The basic concept has been around since biblical times. But what reminded me of this?The September issue of 'Awake' magazine, handed to me across my frugal threshold by the Jehovah's Witnesses this afternoon, is all about, 'How to Manage Money'.

{"title": "Selling Quail Eggs for Hatching", "date": "Sunday 4 September 2011", "text": "I call my quail chicks fluffy bumble beesJapanese Coturnix Quail chicks are tiny when they first hatch. They really are like fluffy bumble bees, buzzing about at high speed in the incubator before they're even properly dried.Chickwatch, here in Frugaldom, isn't the male-dominated, sexist passtime you might suspect, it's more of an 'everyone wants to see what's happening inside the incubator' type of event. It's understandable! Once you have observed these tiny chicks hatching from their tiny eggs, the whole process becomes both intriguing and fascinating.What with the birth of grandaughter at New Year, followed by two months of feverish househunting, then the sudden decision to buy instead of rent, followed by another two months of trying to get this place habitable while managing a juggling act to move an entire garden, complete with poultry, I haven't had much time for hatching eggs in 2011. But that doesn't stop the ducks, hens, bantams or quail from laying.I did manage to fit a dozen duck eggs into the incubator in June, so I now have 9 almost fully-grown ducklings running around the orchard with my adult birds. Then I decided I needed more quail to bring the numbers up sufficiently to warrant regular egg sales, but I ended up selling most of those chicks to recoup the initial set-up costs for yet another project. So I left the quail hens and cockerels paired up and popped some more eggs into the incubator.I now have another 9 healthy, multi-coloured quail chicks running around in a brooder box, sprouting feathers and starting to try and fly. This latest lot hatched on Tuesday 23rd August and I really, really hope this one on the left is a hen, as it is one of the most unusual colours I have ever seen.The parents of my last chicks are still paired in their breeding cages and the hens are still laying eggs. I'd love to hatch out more chicks but don't want to risk setting up the incubator when major work is scheduled to start on the house this month. (It'll mean the power switched off for longish periods of time, not good for incubating eggs.)  So... what does one do with extra eggs that are possibly fertile? After much debate, I listed them on eBid at 99p per dozen, with no reserve on selling price, that's what. They have a dedicated 'Poultry, Incubation and Hatching Eggs' section that not many people know about, yet.For anyone who does not know about poultry and game, eggs are eggs are eggs. There are no chicks inside fresh eggs. They are deemed fertile ONLY because the hens that lay them are kept in the company of cockerels who may, or may not, be going about their natural business. As eating eggs, they are no different to any other egg that you buy in a supermarket - you cannot tell the difference. However, no amount of care, attention and incubation will result in a chick growing inside a supermarket bought egg, so don't worry about that. I have been asked this question so many times! It is almost as common a question as being asked if hens lay eggs if there are no cockerels. Yes, hens lay eggs regardless, you just can't get chicks out of their eggs, no matter how hard you try.For transit, eggs are always well packed and are sent out through the Royal Mail system by whichever method buyers prefer.If you are in or around the Dumfries & Galloway area, you are welcome to come and collect eggs to save on postage & packaging, which is charged at cost. For hotels, restaurants or retailers, we welcome enquiries for regular supplies of fresh quail eggs. We sell these at £1.95 per dozen, discounts or trading exchanges always an option. (Yes, it is true, I do swap my quail eggs for other things, including chocolate!) Galloway LETS members pay 2 Crees per dozen.If you have any questions about my quail, eggs or trading opportunities, please feel free to get in contact."},
{"title": "Poultry Question - 'SILKIE CHIC' - Is she a Silkie or a Silbar?", "date": "Saturday 3 September 2011", "text": "Is this Silkie hen actually a Silbar?This is an extra blog post I've thrown together after spotting a reference to Silbars on Twitter.In 2009, I bought half a dozen hatching eggs from eBay, from a seller who was advertising said eggs as Silbars. Sadly, the box was delayed and badly damaged in transit.I'm assuming that the delay in the eggs reaching us coupled with the treatment they had endured during transit pretty much ruled out any of them hatching. You can imagine my surprise when one actually did hatch!This is a photo of the adult bird, as provided by the seller in their auction listing. The hen on the left, mother of my 'Silkie-Chic' (This is her name, not a misspelling of chick), was described as, \"Silbar\". However, despite researching at the time, I could find very little mention of this strain and certainly no signs of any local breeders. To be honest, I forgot all about this until noticing the Silbar name crop up on Twitter. So here I am, back on the trail of discovery, trying to ascertain if my hen is just a plain Silkie or if she is, indeed, what's known as a Silbar. Being a lone-hatched chick, she was reared as a family pet and probably spent the best part of her first year wandering in and out my kitchen! We eventually found her another lone chick, a white Silkie hen that we named Dumbledorf. But I digress.On 03 March, 2009, the chick on the right hatched from the one surviving 'Silbar' egg. I probably now have a complete day-to-day photo album of our miracle chick, as she progressed to adulthood. Honestly, it was almost as bad as having a new baby in the house, except this baby grew very quickly.She was soon able to go out into the garden to be introduced to the other hens, but took a very long time before she could become part of the 'gang'. (She now rules the roost!)It took us several weeks to find her a companion (Dumbledorf), so she tended to hang about the kitchen door for most of the day, then come into the porch and sleep in her old brooding box at night!Silkie-Chic did survive and she is still with us, here in Frugaldom, living happily alongside Dumbledorf and my other trio of blue cuckoo and lavender Silkies.In 2010, Silkie-Chic went broody, while in the company of a white Silkie cockerel, so we incubated her eggs and gave her a couple of others to sit on instead. (The lavender chick is an Araucana.) Her eggs produced a mix of blue and partridge chicks, plus a couple identical to her, but I still didn't work out what colour my hen really is.She's a great mum and I'd have loved to have bred from her again this year, but the recent housemove put paid to that. All her last year's chicks were sold and I don't know how many turned out to be cockerels or how many were hens, although I do know the two black-headed partridge coloured chicks were both cockerels. Perhaps I should make a point of finding out if the ones that hatched looking identical to Silkie-Chic turned out to be hens?To anyone with any knowledge of Silkies, Silbars or colour genetics in poultry, what there be any benefit to breeding this hen to my bearded, blue cuckoo Silkie cockerel?Your comments would be very much appreciated, thank you."},
{"title": "Extracting the Pectin... for Plum Jam-making.", "date": "Friday 2 September 2011", "text": "September 2nd, Ahead of the Game Already!Just a quick post here, as I have been splitting up this blog to form a second one HERE, called Cyberdosh. This should make it easier for placing the topics into relevant categories, as Frugaldom is more about moneysaving, where Cyberdosh is about moneymaking. Both focus on cash-related challenges but one is a far cry from the other. So, without further ado, what has been going on with regards to moneysaving today?The sun shone, the thermometer reached 25C and we've been outside for much of the day. I had a visit from a fellow Galloway LETS member, so coffee was taken on the patio and a few trades done - lettuce seedlings, a couple of insulated boxes for student heading off back to Uni and a dozen fresh eggs. For a change, I was getting eggs! My hens are laying sporadically at the moment - if they aren't moulting, they're broody, and a half dozen eggs per day is never enough for this household, not with a bodybuilder in the family!Dry weather means making the most of line drying the washing (I don't have a tumble dryer) but I'd completely run out of laundry detergent. This was soon remedied by cooking up a batch of 'laundry gloop', so I now have a total of 7 litres in store. (Check out previous post HERE for details of how to make your own laundry detergent.Next up was 'making' some pectin. I never, ever buy sugar with pectin, it's simply too expensive. But I do make all our own jam, jellies and preserves, so a quick check online to a friend got me the details of how to make and preserve the precious pectin from surplus apples. InstructionsChop your apples (skins, cores, pips and all)Place into a large saucepanAdd enough water to cover the fruit and bring to the boilSimmer with lid on until the apples turn to soft pulpStrain through a jelly bag or similar (a cotton tea towel or muslin works)Return liquid to pot and, once again, bring to the boilSimmer until the liquid has reduced by up to halfIt's recommended to use around 6 tablespoonsful of this liquid to every half kilo of fruit, plus the usual squirt of lemon juice. (Many thanks for all your help with this, Julie.)My surplus apples have now been course-chopped and boiled, the juices strained through the jelly bag and, as I type this, the resulting liquid is now simmering away nicely. I'll use some of this for making my plum jam. I'm assured that this home extracted pectin can be cooled, poured into ice cube bags and then frozen, making it really easy to use as and when required.Another loaf has been baked - it's cooling on the wire tray now - and I've used up the last of a packet of sesame seeds I had, by adding them into the dough.Picked a few more runner beans and I now have all the carrots that I lifted ready for blanching, plus a batch still to scrub and grate for soup making - carrot & coriander, of course.That about takes care of today. I'm now going outside to sit and have a cuppa, watch the ducklings in the pond and shout at the rabbit, as she keeps hiding in the kale patch. Healthy eating for her but not the easiest place from which to retrieve a huge, German lop-eared bunny.The moneymaking challenge stuff will, from now on, be posted in the relevant section of the forum and in the new Cyberdosh blog."},
{"title": "Sunshine, 26C, Harvesting and my Saffron Crocus Project", "date": "Saturday 27 August 2011", "text": "Another Frugaldom Microholding UpdateThe weatherman said showery, so we weren't expecting sunshine and the temperature soaring to 26C - but that's what we got! This was a great bonus, as my Saffron Crocus bulbs arrived yesterday.With nowhere organised for planting the new bulbs, today's sunshine was an open invite to get out into the garden and get some work done. The first job of the day was clearing a space. We're making this raised bed close to the house so that I can nip out first thing in the morning to collect all the lovely saffron that I'm hoping to grow. This will make a great addition to the 'Frugal Gourmet' range, as it can accompany the quail eggs.I had 7' of space between the patio peas and the start of the herb garden, so that's where the bed has been built. It's 30\" wide and about 12\" deep. After clearing the gravel down to soil level, I lined the bed with weed supressant, added some rubble and then a layer of mixed sand and soil to help provide extra drainage. Meanwhile, H began digging soil from the hill at the foot of the garden, which is gradually being excavated as the future site of a summerhouse. Each barrow load of soil was riddled to ensure all the stones and weeds were removed before it gets tipped into the bed. As you can imagine, this is taking quite some time to do, so the bulbs won't be getting planted tonight; maybe tomorrow, if the dry weather stays with us.Another job that was desperately needing done was that of harvesting the carrots. These have grown exceptionally well here. I'm sure that it's because I sowed the seeds in a 50:50 soil and sand mix. We've been eating carrots for several weeks now, plus there are quite a few already blanched, bagged and frozen. Today, I lifted what was left of them and filled a bucket! These now all need to be washed, blanched and frozen for using through autumn and winter.Once I'd emptid the carrot bed, it was weeded, dug, raked and then resown with an early variety of carrot seed that should grow over the winter. I'll feed this bed with either nettle or comfrey fertiliser, depending on what's available first.Some weeding gets done almost every day here, it has to, otherwise the place would soon be overrun. Today, I weeded around the snowball turnips and french beans, managing to pick a few for dinner while there. There were also another couple more courgettes and patty pan squash, so it made for an excellent day's harvesting. There were even a couple of the outside tomatoes needing picked, so I'll cut more lettuce for sandwiches at lunchtime tomorrow. I might even splash out and make another quail egg salad.A few posts back, I mentioned that I had extended the pumpkin bed by doubling it in size. I'm really glad that I took the time to do this, as the plants are growing at a rate that makes me think of Jack and the giant. The pumpkin foliage has already spread out to the edge of the larger bed and there are several melon-sized fruits hiding beneath the leaves and tendrils. There's also the occasional munching crittur!I read an article that suggested slitting the stalks on the top of the pumpkins to ensure enough water is absorbed, but I have not attempted this. Nor have I cut out any of the extra pumpkins, as recommended, to enable only the best two or three to develop. I'll leave them another couple of weeks to see how they grow, then I'll decide from there. The biggest and best will have tiles sat under them to prevent their sinking into the soil and, hopefully, help prevent them from rotting.Across from the pumpkin bed I have raised beds with brussel sprouts, leeks, cabbage and broccoli. This is the first year that I have grown the sprouting variety, but it seems to be coming along quite well, despite my continual war against the dreaded cabbage white butterflies. The caterpillars have hatched in several places, but I simply didn't get around to sourcing enough netting to cover them all. I'm trying my best to keep on top of the problem and the hens are helping by enjoying pecking their way through all the leaves I keep removing in a bid to rid the plants of their pests. The first lot of quail chicks that hatched out in the incubator are now ust over 3-weeks-old. They are already feathered up, out of their brooder and into a large cage, wher they have fun running in and out of their little wooden 'houses'. It's still very difficult to tell the sexes, as most are colour variations, but the speckles have appeared on one of the normal coloured chicks, so we do know that it's a female. This first lot of hatchlings are due to be sold with the first prospective buyer expected tomorrow.Moving further down the garden, we arrive at the micro-orchard. This is where all the ducklings are now happily out and about with Phoebe and Joey, the adult pair of white ducks. We're still not 100% sure how many ducks and how many drakes hatched, but there is definite quacking coming from at least half of them. These youngsters are now 6-weeks-old, are almost fully feathered and aren't much smaller than the adults. (That's Joey preening himself by the side of the pond.)To the rear of the ducklings photos you can make out the row of late potatoes that I planted. I can hardly believe how quickly these have grown! H has had to earth them up several times already, yet they've been in the ground for less than a month. Here's how they are looking as of this afternoon, their stalks and leaves reaching almost a metre high! Hopefully there'll be some potatoes forming beneath all that foliage, otherwise we're going to be really short of potatoes this year.At the bottom of the micro-orchard is an old Victoria plum tree. This has served us rather well, as I've already had about 5kg of plums from it, most traded out through the local LETS group, plus others eaten or stewed down and made into crumbles. As you can see by the photo, the bulk of the fruit has still to be picked. Many thanks to Nicky for collecting me an extra 6kg of sugar while she was in Stranraer. This means that the next lot of plums can be picked here and made into jam without worrying about having to pay £1.15 per kilo for sugar. The Tesco offer works out at about 57p per kilo, so it's a huge saving for the likes of us, at less than half the price of the local store!Jean, if you happen to read this, I got the new blackcurrant bushes planted this afternoon and also managed to make space for the turnips.Tomorrow, weather permitting, we might be able to get the rest of the crocus bed filled with soil and get the bulbs planted. Can you tell that I'm looking forward to growing these? Let's hope that by planting Crocus Sativas bulbs, they lead to crocus satisfaction here in Frugaldom.  :)"},
{"title": "Foraged Rosehips and Luxury (Frugal) Chocolate Confectionery", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2011", "text": "Rosehip TrufflesThis time of year is great for foraging. Right now, although the blackberries, sloes and elderberries have a bit to go, the place is alive with rosehips of every shade, from pale orange through to deep, blood red. Some are such a deep red that they have passed burgundy. I opted for a russet shade of rosy red for my late summer delicacies. The hips are enormous this year and these all grow along the south facing wall of our garden, so not far to go for foraging.I picked about 500g of hips, gave them a quick rinse and then popped them into the mocrowave in a covered dish with a couple of tablespoons of water. It takes only 10 minutes on high power to reduce the berries to pulp, which is then squeezed through a jelly bag to remove all the skins and seeds. You can, of course, stew the berries down in a pan on the cooker. In this particular case, the resulting liquid came out mango coloured. I did taste it once it had cooled and, even without sugar, it had a lovely flavour to it, so I was happy enough to use this foraged produce as an ingredient in my August entry to 'weshouldcocoa'.My Frugal Recipe for Rosehip Truffles150g of chocolate5 tablespoons of icing sugar3 tablespoons of stewed & strained rosehip 'juice' (or any other flavouring you fancy).A seperate 100g of chocolate1/2 tablespoonful of icing sugar & 1/2 level tablespoonful of cocoa powder combinedBeing a frugal household, I don't usually have any sort of luxury baking items in stock, so this time around, the 'past their sell by date' milk chocolate santas got used. We bought a full case of these when they were on offer from one of the clearance stores, I can't remember which it was, but if you check on the Frugaldom forums, they are all listed in the 'Frugal Food' section.Melt your chocolate in a bowl over over a pan of simmering water. I just use my steamer on the cooker top, as it seems to work as well as anything else I have tried.While your chocolate is melting, you can sift the icing sugar into a seperate bowl and then slowly combine that with your chosen flavouring. In this case, I'm using the juice from stewed, garden-foraged rosehips. It changes from a deep mango colour to a shade more like condensed milk once it's mixed with the icing sugar.As soon as your choclate has melted into a smooth paste, slowly pour the icing sugar mix into the bowl, stirring and blending at the same time. Your mix will lighten a few shades, regardless of whether you have used milk or plain chocolate. You can now set this aside to cool. I cover mine with cling film and put it in the fridge as soon as I can.It doesn't take too long before the truffle mix is set, so it's a good idea to keep your hot water in the pan, ready to melt the next lot of chocolate, which is for covering the truffles.I left this lot to set in the fridge, overnight, then shaped them into 'logs' before pressing them down with a fork. If you love chocolate and don't mind a bit of a chocolatey mess, handmade truffles are the very thing for you to try.The above recipe is exactly the same as before. You can use almost any flavour you choose, be it alcoholic or otherwise.

{"title": "Digging an old garden is like an excavation - one never knows quite what one will find.", "date": "Friday 12 August 2011", "text": "Frugaldom Garden Dig Unearths a Little Donkey ShoeHaving put out an appeal for surplus plants to help us establish some semblance of a garden here in Frugaldom, I was fortunate enough to be able to acquire this little lot yesterday, when I attended the monthly get together of our branch of the LETS group. (Local Exchange Trading System - you can check to see if there's an active group near you via the LETSLinkUK website.)These are all perrenials, apart from the spring onions and, of course, the bucket of carrot tops, which are kept for Frugaldom Floppity, our German Lop-Eared rabbit. Today we decided to try to get them planted - rather sooner than later, come rain, hail or sunshine. As luck would have it, the rain came on, so the soil was heavy, the weeds soaking and the ground soggy. Never mind, saves watering in the plants. Eventually, the bottom corner of the garden will become a wild garden, planted specifically to encourage wild birds and insects, so I'm not being too particular about how well it is weeded or what gets planted in there. The centrepiece of it all is an old plum tree, the bird table and bird bath, so it's already a hive of activity in all weathers.Weeding was a very hit or miss affair, dragging up clumps of dandelions and the usual nettles, but then I happened across something else... what looks like a very old, but very small horse shoe. Having had ponies since early childhood, I remembered the farrier showing us the difference between Shetland pony shoes and donkey shoes, so I am almost certain that this is the remnants of an old donkey shoe. It's very rusty and the iron has perished to such an extet that it's flaking, but it has that near unmistakable straight-edged look of the tiny shoes shown to us by the farrier, about 30 years ago.After scrubbing it as best I could, I can now just make out two of the old clenches (nails) that still remain in the shoe. I can't say that this definitely did come off a working donkey many years ago, it might have come from a Shetland pony. It measures almost 7.5cm across, which makes it smaller than a 3\" shoe, and has near-parallel edges.Planting was temporarily halted when a heavy shower arrived, so I'll update the blog again once planting has been completed. In the meantime, I'm having a nice mug of tea and admiring my lucky find. Pity there is no way of dating it. As far as I am aware the previous owners here did not keep a pony or donkey, only poultry and pigs, so that accounts for the last 55 years.A brief interlude in the rain later (after a cuppa) and the plants are now all in the ground in the hope that they survive to grow for us next year.This is how bird corner now looks. It gets the sun all afternoon, as it's set against the south-facing wall, so we have also introduced yet another seating area right opposite this, but at a distance that the birds don't worrt too much about our being there.I guess the next thing to do will be to fill up all the bird feeders. Cat has a new collar and bell, which she absolutely detests, but at least the birds hear her creeping around before she gets too close.The drainage pipework for the pond overflow is beneath the edge of this border, so that's as far out as it can come. The smaller plants have been put further along, in a slightly raised bed of natural design; it's made from a curved tree trunk along the wall. This is also where the tiny apple and nectarine trees have been put for safekeeping (planted from seed by grandaughter). The iris has been planted near the willow by the side of the pond.The yellow daisy that got moved here a couple of weeks ago from a friend's garden has recovered enough to flower. Once again, I have forgotten what its proper name is. Oops! Told you I was no good with flowers"},

{"title": "Ducklings' Big Day Out and Getting Excited about Weeds!", "date": "Sunday 7 August 2011", "text": "Duckling Fun and Exciting Weeds!It started out bright this morning - good drying for the washing - then clouded over briefly, so we ended up back inside, coffeeing with the friends who had been visiting. They had been hoping to see the ducklings making their first big splash, but the shower that arrived held up proceedings. Not half an hour after friends left, the sun was back splitting the trees... DUCKLING PLAYTIME had arrived!We had to close Joey, our drake, into his night run, as he was less than gentle with the babies on his first encounter, but it didn't deter them from heading straight for the pond. Within 5 minutes, all nine ducklings were swimming, splashing and diving under the water having a fantastic time.We allowed them about 15 minutes playtime in the pond then tried to get them back out again. I say 'tried' because they were equally adamant that they were staying in there for longer. It was a bit like having nine screaming kids refusing to come out of the bath!Eventually, I'd to get the pond net and shepherd them all to the edge and make them get out, otherwise I think they'd have been there all day.Afterwards, they lay preening and sunning themselves dry, with Phoebe duck looking on as if trying to work out which of the unruly mob was her offspring.We had no problems getting them back into their own run, as they're such hungry little horaces that they go anywhere for food. Tonight, they had 'grown up' mixed corn with their crumbs, so I hope all this excitement hasn't been too much for them.After another cuppa on the patio, I potted up some rosemary cuttings, taken from the supermarket 'whoopsie' sprigs I rooted last year. With any luck, all these cuttings will also root successfully and provide me with next year's potted herb garden for the front yard.I now have a total of 20 assorted cuttings potted, but only one of these is the new grapefruit mint, which I snipped from another friend's plant when we were visiting on Wednesday after the show.Then it was weeding time! Every day we try to fit in half an hour's weeding to try and catch up with everything, but several years of neglect while the house lay empty has taken its toll. Along the way, I pulled yet more rhubarb, which still seems as good as the first lot, so that's now peeled and chopped, ready for stewing.Today, weeding became fun! I have been trying to source free cuttings, bulbs, seeds and spare plants by asking everyone I can think of, including our local LETS group. I have an idea for a colourful wild bird garden in the corner behind the old plum tree, which will then be cordoned off to protect it from the  marauding ducks. All that grew there this summer was a giant foxglove. It looked lovely, so it got left in the hope that I can get plenty more like it next year.Back to weeding being fun; how can it possibly be fun? Well, here's a photo diary of today's weeding that turned into a plant foraging expedition. (I also checked out the elder and it is absolutely laden with berries.)A PHOTO DIARY OF TODAY'S WEEDING Down by the stream, I found quite a few plants growing, most are probably wild varieties.This area is also where we first discovered the Himalayan honeysuckle and is where I plan on planting some more willow. At the moment, most of the withies cut last winter are still in pots, but they have rooted and are growing. I'm hoping that a fellow LETS member will soon be able to visit and give me some ideas about how to start implementing permaculture techniques. All of these wild type plants and flowers aren't simply weeds, they are growing where they like to grow for a reason, choosing their own positions in the garden.The photo on right resembles some sort of mint, but doesn't smell of mint. It seems to like growing anywhere, even within the spate line along the bank of the stream.This white one started growing in a hanging basket below one of our bird tables, so I have to assume that it's from seed out of the wildbird mix. I transferred it into a pot on its own and it's now about 60cm high, has red stems, red leaf veins and clusters of very pale pink flowers. The leaves slightly resemble those of bindweed - another plant that I love. I used to have an archway covered in it in a previous garden. (Despite it growing like wildfire, it was fairly easy to maintain and much easier to trim than ivy, which ever puts on a brilliant white floral display.)This next one is growing absolutely everywhere, in the borders, through the lawn, through the gravel, it seems to have no preference to shade or direct sun and it has a very pretty heather-like purple flower. It also resemles some sort of mint, but a quick search suggests it may be Bugle weed of some description. Whatever it is, I have transplanted some into a pot to see how it does. Where this grows, there also seems to be plenty of tiny forget-me-nots, so I have potted up some of those, too.Another of my favourites are the giant daisies. Until this one flowered by the side of the pond, I had no idea what it was. Now that I do know, all those weeds being pulled from between the gravel will br transplanted to the wild garden so I can have loads of daisies. This yellow daisy wasn't growing here, it was given to me by a friend who had pulled it out of her garden. It has taken quite a few weeks to recover but it's now starting to flower. Hoping to move some of the white daisies before they flower, so they can compliment the yellow one.Again, I haven't got a clue what this lovely little purple flower is, but it is growing in abundance, mainly in the cooler, damper area near the stream. It seems to be a spreading, ground level plant, as it looks as thought it's creeping through a lot of the undergrowth at the bottom of the garden. There's a lot of ivy down there, plus an elder and some rhododendron, among other things.Among the ivy, there is a mass of ground cover created by this red stemmed, variagated plant. It's growing in abundance in the shade of the trees, but I have taken a few cuttings and now have them in a jar on the window sill. Each stem nodule has what appears to be a tiny root, so it's definitely some sort of ground level creeper. The leaves resemble those of a geranium crossed with variagated mint. See what I mean? I haven't got a clue about flowers!As for the weeding, well...I got as far as potting up my weeds! Some I haven't photographed yet, as they were a bit sad and droopy after I retrieved them from my weed tub, but photos will be forthcoming as soon as these perk up in their pots.Now I am hoping for good weather tomorrow so I can start transplanting a load of those daisies that are coming up everywhere. This is frugal flower gardening at it's best - why buy wild or cottage garden seeds when I have all of this on my own backdoor step. Plans for my wild garden are looking much, much brighter. In fact, I'm quite excited about the prospect, now that I know it won't cost me a penny.Once I have taken some cuttings from each of the colours of honeysuckle and collected my lupin, sweet pea and foxglove seeds, these will all go towards making the front yard into a container garden and to planting up the wild garden in bird corner. In addition, a LETS member has just emailed me with a list of plants she has for me to collect on Thursday - it's quite a lengthy list! :)Don't forget you can join us in the free Frugaldom forums HERE to see how my weed project progresses and please post a comment if you know what any of my weeds are called."},
{"title": "Quail hatch in progress - STOP watching, GO and pick dinner!", "date": "Thursday 4 August 2011", "text": "Japanese Coturnix Quail Chicks in Assorted Colours.Yes, this really is the second blog post of the day, but I need to keep certain people up to date with the hatching progress.First of all, I find it very difficult not to sit watching proceedings but the eggs were left in the incubator this time, as opposed to being transferred into the hatching box, which has a viewing window. This means I've been unable to peer in, so had to keep myself otherwise amused for most of the afternoon. Bread has been baked, freezer has been repacked to fit in today's order and numerous cups of tea have been enjoyed on the patio. Some weeding got done, the duck pond got topped up, more eggs were collected (and sold to neighbours) and then it got really hot outside, so more sitting about on the patio. By that time, I could make out at least 7 chicks bumbling around inside the incubator, but I daren't open the lid at that stage as the sudden drop in temperature and humidity can affect the rest of the hatch.Outside, I cleared and swept a small space under the kitchen window, repotted some plants, planted the first of the strawberry runners into individual pots, sowed another row of peas (can but try) and then potted up all my herb cuttings.From left to right, I don't know what the first plant is, the second one grew from wildbird seed, the third is Thai Basil, next it's the parsley seedlings and then the rosemary, which I rooted from sprigs I bought reduced to 10p in the supermarket. The herb cuttings are an assortment of three types of mint - common, lemon balm and grapefruit - two types of thyme and several cuttings from my hardy curry plant that survived the -10C winter last year.If I can get all of the above to develop into healthy plants, these will go into planters and get sat out on the little cobbled yard at the front of the house.Dinner time arrived, so I did the frugal act of pulling some carrots and picking some peas. I also brought in some lettuce, a couple of courgettes and an onion, as I was desperate to see how these were doing.As you can see by the photos, the onions are doing really well and are quite huge, considering how late the sets went in and the fact that the person who gave me them thought they'd be past their sell by date. Not in the least! These are growing great guns! I can hardly wait to pull them up and get them dried for winter use. This one will be going into tomorrow's spicy stir fry along with the courgette and some homegrown chilli peppers.So, has anyone tried to count the quail chicks in the photograph? I can see 12, so am really happy that we've managed to achieve over 40%  Even I am surprised at how many of these eggs are hatching, as they were neither stored correctly, nor turned daily prior to being incubated. These were simply surplus to requirement eggs that I decided to set in the off chance that a couple of them might be fertile. :)Nice result, so far.Even Frugalites Have Day TripsYesterday, 3rd August, was Wigtown Show. It's an annual event that has been running for the past 200 years and one that we try not to miss. Son was home to hold the fort, so we had a frugal day out. £15 for 2 adults and car parking isn't that much, in the grand scheme of things, is it?This year was the bicentenary and, to mark the occasion, HRH Princess Anne attended. It's the agricultural community's biggest event of the year, so it is always very well attended. We are normally treated to a shower of rain but this year the sun shone throughout the day and a great tme was had by all.HRH took the time to wander around the showground, chatting to many of the locals and stallholders. Things about here are usually of an informal nature and yesterday's event was no different. It's seldom you find many false airs and graces around these parts, most refreshing, albeit a little disconcerting for some of the visitors.This year's poultry show was every bit as well supported as last year's, if not more so. There were hundreds of hens, ducks, geese and turkeys, several I hadn't even heard of, let alone seen. However, for sheer 'aaaaw' appeal, this little bantam with her chicks stole the show for me.Judging the 'Champion of Champions must be a huge burden on the shoulders of whoever has that unenviable task because I really don't know how anyone can compare a horse to a cow to a goat to a sheep to a donkey to a goose!I had picked out my favourite, a Black Galloway bull with the rather undeserving name of Nancy Boy. He was rather docile, I have to admit, but I'm sure his name won't endear him to his future suitors. Now that I come to think of it, do cows even bother to exchange names? Perhaps Nancy Boy won't have to deal with that sort of problem afterall. LOLThe feature act of the day was a performance by 'Jive Pony'. The team had travelled many miles to appear and the crowd seemed to appreciate their performance, particularly the audience participation part. The young guy concerned was escorted into the ring, dressed in a pink tu-tu and then legged up onto the Highland pony for his first ever riding experience. He did really well, considering the ribbing he endured from his friends.We were also lucky enough to see one of the world's smallest owls. I'm guessing it was some sort of pygmy owl, but I didn't want to pay £3.50 for a photograph, so you'll need to do a search to see what it looks like. Maybe I'm just mean, but £3.50 is about half a bag of hen feed, so not an amount I was prepared to pay for a photo on the Frugaldom blog. After the show we visited friends and shared a late afternoon cappuccino and chat on their patio. While there, I was able to take some cuttings (thanks, J) of an assortment of geraniums and some grapefruit mint. I'm thinking that an assortment of mint would be an ideal addition to the front 'garden' where each type could be planted in its own pot. This grapefruit one smells lovely.It was then time to collect our new bantams. There are six in total, four Light Sussex X hens, one blue Pekin hen and a lavender Pekin cockerel. At the moment, they're beng quarantined in a 2m coop and run. In a couple of weeks, we'll let the X bred bantams out with the others but will need to keep the Pekins in the run so Billy Gruff, my blue cuckoo Silkie cockerel, doesn't attack his smaller counterpart.   That brings us back to what's happening in Frugaldom. Last night I was sure I heard a small squeak coming from the incubator. Today is day 17 for the quail eggs, so I shouldn't really have been surprised to come through this morning to find the first chick hatched and bumbling about in the incubator. Since then, a second has arrived and several of the other eggs are rocking and rolling, with the tell tale cracking sound of tiny beaks on shell. Any chick from this lot is a bonus, as the eggs were all collected from my hens the week after they were seperated from the males. With no way of knowing how many, if any, would be fertile, I stuck 32 eggs in the incubator and crossed my fingers. 3 were removed shortly after that, but 29 remained. I wonder what percentage are fertile? I think we've reached 10% now, as I can see a beak pocking out of an almost open egg.   I'll update with photos as soon as I possibly can. For now, the incubator is remaining firmly shut. You can follow the updates by reading the section amed 'In the Incubator' on the free forums, which is where I normally upload the photos. Frugaldom now has a new project to add to the list of many - we need to build an aviary to house some Diamond Doves that we are rehoming from the same person who gave us the bantams. He's leaving the area in a few weeks time, so we'll need to get organised soon to ensure we can house these new birds. There are a few others comig too, mainly zebra finches and bengalese, but we already have those species, so they'll mix OK after their quarantine period. The Diamond Doves, however, I'd like to see outside in their own space. More on this at a later date.In the time it has taken me to edit and upload this post, quail chicks 3, 4, 5 and 6 have arrived! We've already passed the 20% mark. :)"},
{"title": "Eggs, Blackcurrants and Purple Cookies!", "date": "Tuesday 2 August 2011", "text": "What to do with the surplusToday turned out to be a kitchen day in Frugaldom. The kitchen hasn't been renovated yet, so fancy cooking and baking days are slightly restricted, to say the least. Garden produce, however, still needs to be prepared and stored. There's been plety of blanching and freezing done, so the freezer is full of vegetables and berries. But then I ended up with all those blackcurrants and hadn't a space left for all of them. Cue an ingenious idea... and some multitasking that resulted in my burning the fishcakes!First of all, the hens have been laying quite well recently and son has been using extra egg whites in his scrambled eggs - he's into bodybuilding, so likes his protein. This means, there were two dozen spare egg yolks needing used up as soon as possible and, as most of you will already know, that means lemon curd making.I normally make small batches of 4 egg yolks at a time but today was different - I had to use the big stock pot to batch cook 24 yolks' worth at the one time. That took a great deal of whisking to keep it all from boiling! At the same time, I was trying to bake some oat and muesli biscuits, while wondering what to do with the last couple of tablespoons of blackcurrants that hadn't fitted into my ice cream tub when freezing them last night. Have you guessed yet?Correct! I added them into the cookie dough! :)It looked rather strange as it all mixed together and I'd to add some extra flour in order to soak up the juices. Perhaps I shouldn't have microwaved the berries for a few minutes, as this was what caused all that extra juice. Anyhow, I kept whisking the lemon curd while donning my disposable latex gloves to knead the cookie dough. The mixture makes 24 biscuits, so two trays were greased when I was measuring out the margarine (remember it's frugal cooking here). The oven was already warmed for sterilising the jars, so no problems there.Once kneaded, rolled and shaped, my berry, oat and muesli cookies looked VERY novel and interesting! Who needs artificial colouring and flavouring when you can get this from 2 tablespoonfuls of fresh, garden grown blackcurrants? I could hardly wait to see how they turned out and, diet or no diet, I had to taste them to see what they were like.Before I could bake them, I had to get the jars out the oven and pour the lemon curd. There was a huge quantity of it! I normally use small jars but had to use the 500ml size to fit all of this into them. I got 4 clip top jars, one 400ml curry jar and a Nutella jar filled, and there was still enough left as a sample pot! I'll probably share this with a couple of neighbours who have been kind enough to share their surpluses with us of late.15 minutes later, the timer rang to say 'cookies are ready', though if truth be told, it would have been better ringing to say cookies are 'purpley'!Here's how they turned out - almost as purple as when they went into the oven! All I need now is to write 'eBid' on them in white icing and they could become big merchandising hits in the online auctions! :) (For anyone interested in buying hatching eggs, I'll be listing them in my eBid store once it's back up and running. I'll be offering eggs from the Silkies, Pekins and quail. I don't think I'd be allowed to offer the cookies for sale.)I passed round a sample of my novelty biscuits and got some very strange looks, indeed. Having tasted these, I can assure you that they are delicious, despite their colour, and have a very distictive flavour, almost a cross between an oat biscuit and a blueberry muffin. Brain was already wondering if I could achieve similar results using raspberries for a pink version and blueberries for their blue counterparts. Would rosehips or strawberries turn them red, I wonder?If anyone is interested in trying these, the recipes can be found in the 'Frugal Food' section of the Frugaldom Forums and please feel free to post your own results and/or variations."},
{"title": "Rosehips aplenty and chilli peppers, too!", "date": "Monday 1 August 2011", "text": "Cacophony of Colour - so vibrant, you can almost hear it!Who said red and green should never be seen? I decided to take a walk down the garden to see how everything had faired after the day of drizzle we had yesterday. The assortment of shrubs that cascade over the south-facing wall mean that it is now awash with colour, transformed from the former pinks and yellows to vibrant reds, greens and deep purple berries. These rosehips are particularly spectacular, huge orbs of glossy red against a background of healthy foliage. There are still a few pink flowers scattered among them, Dog Roses, I think. Thoughts of what I can do to preserve these are on my mind.Along the way, you come to the more muted, gentler shades of the fragrant sweet peas. I thought I had left these too late in sowing the seeds for us to benefit from such a colourful display, but they have battled on relentlessly and are now producing an array of pastel shades ranging from buttermilk through pink to deep maroon. Some of them appear almost frosted with their two-tone pink and white flowers.But it's the rosehips that have taken today's vote, as there are just so many of them.I wonder if these will still be here when the elderberries, haws and blackberries arrive? Hedgerow jelly is one of the favourites in this frugal household. Memories of rosehip syrup are springing to mind, but I haven't ever tried making. I wonder if I should? What else can be done with rosehips?You can still see quite a few of the pale pink flowers on this particular bush, so I am guessing there are plenty more hips to come. Hopefully, this display is not some sort of forewarning for a treacherous winter!In one of the little raised beds - made from a discarded chest of drawers - the leeks are beginning to resemble what they should. Despite weeding this bed almost every time I pass it, there are still telltale signs of what has shot up through the soil over the past two days. Previously, I didin't bother much with leeks but, like the brussel sprouts, we will learn to love them. Autumn and winter evenings need a bowl of warming homemade soup and I have had great success in the past freezing these to use as and when required. All going well, there should be enough here to see us through to next year's crop with enough surplus to trade with friends and neighbours.I have never had great success with tomatoes, mainly owing to the fact that I either haven't had the space to grow them, the weather has been awful or else we have been preparing to move house each time tomato season came around. This year, having yet again moved house, there was no time or space to organise the construction of a greenhouse, so these tomatoes - 6 plants I traded inwards through LETS - are sitting outside with a strip of metre high plastic across the front of their pots. It seems to have done the trick, but that's probably more to do with the fact that we've had such good weather for the past couple of months than anything else. Alongside these, I have some Cape Gooseberries, which are now flowering and beginning to set fruit.Our latest housemove, which will hopefully be our last, has found us in a street of like-minded people who all take great pride in their gardens. They really are a lovely bunch of neighbours, we couldn't have asked for better. Surplus produce and plants are happily exchanged and it isn't unusual to see folks walking along the street carrying some form of fruit, vegetable or plant. It's a great little place - very friendly and very welcoming! Just yesterday, I received a knock on the front door and opened it to find someone bringing me surplus blackcurrants, which I'll probably make into jam or apple and blackcurrant pie filling. In exchange, I hope said neighbour is happy sampling their dozen fresh quail eggs that I was able to offer them.Indoors, on the kitchen windowsill, I have my three pepper plants - one, a much appreciated gift from friends who were visiting and the others given to me by fellow LETS members.This is the Jalopeno pepper - a type of chilli - that has started producing quite a few long, green fruits. I daren't taste them, as they're too hot for me, but I will be using them in whatever Tex-Mex meals I make in future. Stir fried with other veg and served with chicken in a warm, homemade tortilla dressed with salsa, mayo and cheese, these are delicious.This is my Apache chilli pepper, the one that arrived through the post from the friends who had been to visit us last month. This is a lovely plant, which sits neatly in the middle of the windowsill in it's own little tin bucket. In the brief time that I've had it, the many flowers and tiny peppers have developed quickly and now range through all stages of the growing/ripening process. It is absolutely dripping in fruit.Again, these will be used in chilli type dishes, added as extra spicy topping to homemade pizza and I'll be drying all the extras for storing. If I'm lucky, I'll save some seeds to sow next year, but will also attempt to over winter the plants in the hope that they see us through a second year. My sweet pepper is just beginning to flower, so I didn't bother photographing that, maybe next time.The whole house now smells of sweet peas, as I'm clipping a few flowers every other day to keep in small vases in each of the main rooms. They certainly smell much nicer than any chemically manufactured spray, block or gel and I haven't ever found myself sneezing at these.Who needs air freshener, or even perfume, when the garden can produce such fragrant flowers? It reminds me of the times when we used to soak the rose petals to make homemade prefume many, many years ago. I wonder how easy it would be to dry some of these for pot pourri?I promised myself that I would try to keep the blog up to date even when there was no significant progress in the Frugaldom microholding, but seeing these photographs reminds me firmly that every day is a day of progress. Afterall, this time last year, we had not the slightest inclination that we'd have moved house again, nor had we even considered the possibility that we'd have bought a place like this. Never give up on your dream.

{"title": "Container Gardening While Facing East", "date": "Sunday 31 July 2011", "text": "What Could I Grow in the Front 'Garden'?This is what has been uncovered, so far, in our front 'garden'. It's a small space with big potential, in my opinion, despite its easterly aspect and it's ancient cobbles.As this is the first thing you see when you arrive at our house, it's only natural that I want it to look presentable, but it also has to be in keeping with the rest of the street. Many of the houses here, including ours, have Listed Building status, so the cobbles are of historic interest.I was delighted to discover that the original cobbles lay preserved beneath their layer of concrete, but cobbles don't make for the best growing medium. Container gardening has to be the way forward here, as it's going to be a bit like cultivating a patio.A little bit of research shows that there are many colourful and interesting plants that could do well facing east, so long as we look after them properly. Climbing roses, clematis, honeysuckle, fuschias, pansies, nasturtiums, geraniums... the list goes on and on, including most bulbs, so there's no shortage of variety for spring & summer flowers. It's where to start that's my problem.At the point of moving into the house, I sat my existing window boxes out, along with a pair of juniper bushes. These have done OK so far, although the begonias didn't like their new home at all. The nasturtium seeds grew without a problem and the marigolds seem to be doing well, but it's not much to look at, at the moment.Having now uncovered the first half of the cobbles, I've left a concrete border along the edge and plan on leaving the path to the front door. What I would like to do is plan a container garden that will sit well within this space, making the cobbles the main feature while still creating a productive garden. The name of the game, afterall, is microholding, so even this cobbled area needs to produce something alongside any flowers I may plant.Planning hasn't really begun for this project yet, but I am open to any suggestions regarding what could be grown here without it looking like a mish mash of pots. I'd like year round colour, or at least foliage, everything needs to stay in containers and it needs to be able to stand up to only a few hours of early sunshine during the latter part of the year, when temperatures will also plummet. A tall order, perhaps, but it's a challenge that I think I'll enjoy tackling, especially if it can be kept as low maintenance and low budget as possible.If anyone has any thoughts or ideas for how I might proceed, please let me know. And lest anyone forgets, this all has to be done within a very frugal budget, as it isn't exactly a top priority in a renovation project. Oh, and I don't have any bulbs or flower seeds, so it's very much a case of starting at the beginning.I do intend planting up some tubs with an assortment of daffodils, tulips, crocuses, snowdrops etc, but that's all dependent on what friends and family have available at the end of their gardening year. I'm also hoping that we'll have space cleared in the back garden to build the greenhouse within the next month or two, so that could provide over-wintering for whatever needs extra shelter during the coldest months and also a place for starting off any seeds and/or cuttings.Your suggestions and comments would be much appreciated to help me with yet another challenge. Documenting the progress is par for the course and I hope that others will be able to learn by any mistakes I may make along the way. You know there have to be a few calamities or gardening disasters, there always are. :)"},
{"title": "Interesting Creepy Crawlies & Some Extra Space", "date": "Wednesday 27 July 2011", "text": "Another Day for Shorts, T-shirts and Factor 50For those of you who have followed the Frugaldom story over the past few years, you'll know that space has always been at a premium while we rented an assortment of cheaper properties while pursuing the goal of saving to buy a place to call home.Where we are now is ideal. It has a long, walled patch of land, plenty of space for the feathered friends and a stream running through the bottom of the garden. But what amazes me the most (I'm incredulous, if truth be told) is the huge difference in climates between here and the previous house, less than 20 miles away. I do realise that many parts of the UK are currently being bathed in scorching sunshine, but Scotland isn't particularly prone to extended periods of blistering heat: the novelty of photographing the thermometer by the back door, which isn't in direct sunlight, hasn't worn off, yet.So here we are, stewing in 28C without knowing what the temperature is in the exposed part of the garden, not a breath of wind and a sky so blue that it looks like a well painted ceiling. The house has an easterly aspect to the front, so gets plenty of sunshine from just after dawn until early afternoon. I have a couple of pots and window boxes out there, but have been quite reserved in creating anything more, as the house sits right on the main street with no garden to speak of. Or so I thought...Today I mustered up the courage to phone the council and roads department to clarify the situation and have now had the call back to confirm that we DO own the front patch of land that stretches the width of the house out to the main road. This is BRILLIANT news! We now have another 28 (or thereabouts) square metres of space to call our own. This provides quite a large area for transforming into a potted garden - pots, planters and troughs - and maybe even some trellis for honeysuckle or climbing roses. (We could use part of it for off road parking, but that's not an option I want to take.)This 'new' garden. actually goes out a bit further than can be seen here, but I couldn't be bothered moving the car to take a wider angled photo. :) Now another challenge begins - to create something worth looking at on a budget of not a lot. I've already got the seats and a couple more planters at the door and I now have all sorts of plans for creating a much more garden-like look. But I'll be needing some bulbs for all the planters I'm thinking of moving there soon. I could probably grow some edible stuff in this extra frugal space.Our 'tropical' weather seems to bring out all sorts of creepy crawlies. There are plenty of lizards that sunbathe on the walls and fences and we've all moved away from the assortment of bees and biting 'things', but the arrival of the woodwasp that decided to hang around the back garden for a bit sent everyone running for cover, even the cat! These things are HUGE! At first we thought it was a giant wasp of the nasty, aggressive type but a quick search on Google confirmed its identity as a wood wasp.Today's flying visitor was some sort of dragon fly. It's been hovering around the garden for the past day or two, looking like a remote controlled micro-helicopter! I haven't got too close to it but it looks to be about 7cm (ish) in length. If anyone knows what type of crittur this is, please let me know.There have been several different dragon flies around, some of the blue ones, red ones and now this monster. It seems to like sunbathing on the garden wall but I'm wondering if us having dug the pond will encourage anything more 'exotic' into the garden. The heron has been back for another look in the pond, must be hoping we stock it with fish! There have beem no further problems with the hawk since we relocated the quail from their outdoor run and, so far, the foxes have stayed on the other side of the wall, or else across the road in the field.This morning, I reintroduced a couple of the male quail to the females - one male to 3 females. This should ensure I have a few fertile eggs for going into the incubator next weekend. There are already eggs incubating, but these were just what was collected from the hens when they got brought inside from their run. None of the eggs were weighed or candled, it's too difficult to see through their dark, mottled shells. I'm not expecting too many (if any) to hatch, but it would be nice to get a few.Project Quail has well and truly begun. The new egg boxes have arrived, so the labels now need to be designed and printed for future use. I'm hoping to have this all up and running within the next couple of months, when I'll be able to offer surplus quail eggs for sale in the hope that the project becomes self-sustaining. If anyone is interested in buying fertile eggs, let me know and I'll list them in the Frugaldom store on eBid. Planning on selling them at £1.95 per dozen (plus p&p).Well, that's about all the news for now - I'm popping back out to get more weeding done at the front, as I'm determined to clear out the ancient cobbled gully. There are a couple of tiny pansies (are they?) growing through, so I'll rescue them before hauling out the rest of the grass and weeds.Daily updates are posted in the Frugaldom Forum, HERE. All comments welcome here and please feel free to make some suggestions for the frugaldom front patch.Please correct me if I have the wrong names for any of the wild birds, flowers or creepy crawlies I write about - it's mainly guesswork."},
{"title": "Starting to See Some Results", "date": "Monday 25 July 2011", "text": "The New Garden is Coming Alive!We're still getting some great weather here, with temperatures soaring to 26C at one point today. It levelled out around 24C for this afternoon, so more watering needed this evening.After having the best year ever with our strawberries, I can see even more fruit forming, so I have my fingers crossed for a few more fresh strawberry desserts. The plants are still all in their wooden planters, but I'm considering making a raised strawberry bed for next year. It's great seeing more produce following suit. Today's little haul comprised peas, courgettes, carrots and yet more rhubarb.I picked the first courgette about a fortnight ago and this is another three from the same plant. The peas are growing in abundance, as are the carrots. What I'm picking at the moment are just the thinnings, but they're big enough for eating.This afteroon was spent shelling, scrubbing, slicing, blanching and freezing the vegetables and then the rhubarb got chopped, stewed and made into rhubarb crumble. By the looks of the rhubarb patch, I should be able to get a few more stalks before it gets to be too late in the year.My rhubarb 'champagne' is fizzing away fine style, although we've already drunk the first bottle of that. It isn't as pink as last year's but tastes every bit as good, perhaps better, as I added fresh lime to it, as well as the lemon. Which reminds me, I had better go and release some of that fizz lest another bottle goes pop!Work on the new duck house and duck run continues, with their secure enclosure being almost complete. The new one has now been attached to the old one, so we have semi-detached duck runs. The second house is a bit larger than the first, but still based on a pallet framework. The sides and roof have beem built from the wood that was saved after dismantling the big quail enclosure.Each run measures 10' x 3.5', so there's plenty of space for the ducks when they need to be locked in at nights. There are certainly plenty of foxes about at the moment, so the new run has also been wired underneath in an effort to prevent anything digging down and under the fence.All that remains to be done now is the gate into the run attached and then the felt laid along the top to provide some extra shelter. The entire structure, including the houses, measures nearly 25' in length and is sheltered on one side by the dry stone wall that borders the entire garden. Being sited along the edge of the orchard, where the pond is being constructed, means the ducks have free access to as much space as they need all day, every day.This afternoon saw the delivery of the paving slabs, which will be used to edge the pond and also to build a small seating area further down the orchard. I'm not sure when these will get laid, but it will, hopefully, be soon.Tomorrow, I'll work out exactly what wood is needed for repairs to the outbuilding, construction of the permanent raised beds and, possibly, the new log store, then allocate a budget for the timber. I'd really like the outbuilding completed before the new windows start going into the house, but that might be a bit ambitious, as the first window has already been ordered. (As could only be expected, we have odd-sized windows and doors, so each needs to be made to measure!)The pond has come in slightly under its £100 budget, even allowing for buying brand new paving slabs. The quail project has been allocated £150, of which I have spent less than £20 so far, stocking up on plastic egg boxes. These should be delivered tomorrow, then I'll need to design labels to reflect the new details. (These will be printed from home... won't they, H?)The duck runs have cost us nothing to build, as they're constructed from salvaged wood, pallets and nails (thanks to the hundreds that were carelessly dropped and had to be collected from the hen runs during reroofing of the old place). We're reusing wood & wire from previous runs, so no extra costs incurred there, either. Things like handles, bolts, catches and hinges are being salvaged from wherever we can get them but I'm sure I have a couple of brand new bolts somewhere, which may be safer to use with so many foxes on the prowl.Is anyone else attempting to create their own microholding on a frugal budget? If so, I'd love to know how you are progressing. Feel free to make suggestions or point out any glaring mistakes we may be making and feel free to join us in the Frugaldom Forums to discuss all aspects of frugal living, homebased working, microholding and the concept of the frugal entrepreneur. You might even like to join in with one of our cost-cutting or money-saving challenges.PS: Just in case you missed the origins of this challenge, the Frugaldom microholding is our version of a tiny smallholding, created within an ordinary garden setting on a frugal budget, aimed at being self sustainable."},
{"title": "Another Busy Fortnight Gone!", "date": "Friday 22 July 2011", "text": "Where does all the time go?It doesn't seem any time at all since I was on here announcing the arrival of our newest ducklings, so it's hard to believe that was about a fortnight ago! I hope everyone has seen a bit of the sunshine we have had and been able to make the most of it.I had family visiting for a couple of days and, would you believe it, those couple of days were the ones that the sun chose not to shine! Typical. But it did stay dry enough for us to sit outside, take them a wander around the garden and for my dad to create a circular route via peapods and strawberries, munching merrily as he proceeded. Yes, we now have peas... and plenty of them. :)All nine of the ducklings survived, all of them fit and healthy, all of them being cheeky, noisy, mucky duckies. We've had to move them into a much larger cage in the outbuilding, as they outgrew their brooder box within a few days and then outgrew their converted rabbit cage brooder the following week. The weather is mild and their run is under cover, so they no longer have their heat bulb. Some are beginning to grow tail feathers and we hear the occasional little broken squeak that could be the tell tale signs of a future quack.Last week, we set up some breeding cages for the Japanese quail then moved them from their run  to get them sorted out for breeding. They were all running together, so the past week's eggs all went into the incubator in the hope of getting some chicks. If fertile, these eggs will be due to hatch on 5th August. By then, I should have more eggs for a selective breeding programme to produce next year's layers.In the garden, rubble mountain is disappearing fast and beginning to show a semblance of becoming the site for the summerhouse. H has spent a great deal of time digging and hauling out all sorts of rubbish, concrete blocks and rubble. The concrete has had to be smashed up in order to move it, but the space is gradually clearing.On the other side of the fance, the ducks are still loving their new pond, which still hasn't got the paving laid around it, despite it having been ordered last week. Builders' merchant hasn't delivered it yet! The joys of rural living - nobody wants to have to make a special trip out here when they offer free delivery - more a case of, 'we'll get it to you when we can'.The pond drainage system is one thing I am really pleased with, as it saves so much time when topping up or cleaning and it meant absolutely no flooding after the couple of nights heavy rain we had here.I managed to haul a huge rock to the edge of the pond and can now have the water trickling down that to top it up. The ducks love that, too.   Along the edge of the orchard/duck run, all the soil has now been spread out along the south facing wall to form a border. At one end, we've fenced off about 5m of it and I've planted some sprouting potatoes a friend brought me - that was just over a week ago and all the potatoes are now growing, lots of greenery peeking through the carefully riddled soil. There was also a set of cat paw prints the entire length of it within the first day of digging, raking, sifting and planting!We did manage to get a few raspberries from the canes, quite surprising considering the amount of time they were in buckets between leaving the last garden and getting put in the ground here. There were nowhere near enough rasps to use as dessert, let alone make jam, so we ate them with strawberries and yoghurt each day we picked them. There are still a few out there, so it's a race between us and the blackbirds. The blackbirds have already beaten us in the cherry stakes!Peapods in abundance and we've already started picking. Peas are so easy to grow and always seem to grow in abundance! I would recommend them to everyone who has even the tiniest patch of ground, space for a trough or even a balcony. Friends have them growing along the edge of the bridge next to their house... but then again, those might have been sweet peas of the non-edible kind. Despite the lateness of planting, my sweet peas look as though they are about to flower, so I'll need to remember to get photographs of those, as I love them. It's just finding the space to allocate to flower garden that's been the problem, but that's all settled for next year. Plans are afoot for that. The courgettes are doing really well, with a further 4 on the plant I cut last week's from and several on the other. The yellow one has begun to grow much faster after losing its first fruit to the snails!This is the first time I have tried the patty pan squash. This was a seedling plant that came from our previous next door neighbours, who have, since, taken over the old house, stove, garden and greenhouse etc. Dreamer's blog should cover progress from over there.I think I planted too many carrots in one patch! I'm thinning them out every couple of days in an effort to make space for the others to grow, but they aren't being wasted: the larger ones are being eaten by us and the smaller ones fed to the rabbit. I'll bet if she realised that was what was at the bottom of the 'swishy' greenery, she'd be digging them up for herself. She does tend to help herself to whatever she wants when running about the garden. This is Floppity taking a mouthful of hay (dried grass from the verge trimmings) for a walk. She was in such a hurry to get out that day, she took her half-eaten mouthful of hay with her! She really is a very funny big rabbit, especially when she decides to chase the cat. Floppity is bigger than our cat, so she usually wins any scraps or carry-on they may have.We have a great many lizards here, little brown ones that get everywhere, both outdoors and in! This is one sunbathing on the back gate. I'm afraid I didn't hang around long enough to photograph the one that had climbed up the bedroom curtains when I woke the other morning. It's so warm, the windows have been left open constantly since we moved here, so I'll need to be careful of what can gain entry to the house! Since the lizard incident, Scruffy cat has chosen to thoroughly check out the windowsill every night - I'm sure she'd alert me to anything untoward. Wouldn't she?I ended up having to pick more rhubarb, as the stuff just keeps on growing. I traded it for potatoes, so that was good, but there's been another flush of it since then. I'll need to get that picked, chopped, stewed and frozen and let the light in at my belated sunflower seeds, which were thrown in the back corner in the hope that a few would grow. We have so many wild birds about here that some of them are bound to love sunflower seeds. It would be lovely if the flowers grew and put on a wildbird display for us at the same time. The latest arrivals in the garden have been the Linnets and H was lucky enough to see his first Yellowhammer. We've plenty of wagtails, goldfinches, greenfinches, siskins and willow warblers. In fact, I'm amazed at the number of warblers here, despite us having only a tiny stream and the willow not yet established. (Or is willow just part of their name, I wonder?)All the recent excitement of new ducklings, quail moving, visitors and family visiting seems to have exhausted the cat. She has firmly established her routine - breakfast, out to play all day, indoors before dark, check for lizards, crash out and sleeps soundly all night.

{"title": "The Frugaldom Duck Population is Growing.", "date": "Thursday 7 July 2011", "text": "THE DUCKLINGS ARE HATCHING NOW!After setting a dozen duck eggs in the incubator on Saturday 11th June, we were hoping to see ducklings hatch around Friday 8th July. However, on Wednesday 6th July, when I stopped the auto-turner in the incubator, this is what appeared!Along with the 10 eggs I got from a friend who has Campbells & Runner Ducks, I put 2 of the eggs from Phoebe & Joey into the incubator. One of these had hatched already.Overnight on the 6th, early hours of the 7th, we had an almighty storm of rain, hail, thubder and lightning. At one point, the power went out completely but came back on again almost immediately. I got up to check the incubator was alright - could see the light on the thermostat and could hear the duckling squeaking away, so I had a peek inside. A couple more of the eggs had pipped! By the time I got up this morning, a second chick was hatching, this time a dark coloured one. By mid-morning, number 4 was ust starting to emerge from its shell. You can just see the dark down emerging from the egg on the left of the photogrpah. You can also see that the egg right next to that has also pipped, so we're hoping for another duckling today despite these all being a day or so early. I'm not sure why the eggs are hatching early, as I have the thermostat set at 37.5 degrees and a second thermometer is reading lower than that at the base of the incubator, so too high a temperature cannot be the problem. Humidity seems fine, water trough was topped up at the start of this week. Ducklings seem bright and healthy, so no apparent adverse effects. In the garden, the pond drainage project has been completed. The drainage system has been joined to the back, right hand corner of the pond, with all the pipes having been sunk below ground level, joined and tested to ensure the gradient is enough to draw away any overflow.The ducks have had a great time following H up and down the garden as he dug the trench and any sound of running water brought them waddling, quacking and whistling along to see what was happening. As soon as we started topping up the pond with the garden hose, they were straight back in, swimming around and very curious about the new drain.Several attempts at flooding the pond were made, all to no avail, so the homemade frugal drainage system works just fine. Any flood water runs swiftly away and trickles out the overflow pipe and into the burn at the bottom of the garden. Total cost of duck pond project so far is just under £25, which is what it cost to buy the 4m x 4m pondliner and have it delivered. All we need to do now is level the ground around the pond and invest in some paving. I'd like this to go all the way around the pond to form a path that can easily be swept clean but will also protect the edge of the pondliner. I have already planted a row of small willows between the pond and the wall in the hope that I can train them over to create a shaded area for the ducks and leave enough space in the corner of the orchard for a small seating area.At the bottom of the garden, 'rubble mountain' is slowly disappearing and beginning to take on a semblance of a 'building spot' for the summer house. We no longer have a huge pile of rocks, boulders, rubble and concrete. Still loads to do and plenty of rubbish to be removed, but it's edging towards becoming a useable space.Still getting strawberries aplenty, along with blackcurrants. I really can't think of anything that I could complain about it not growing, as everything is. I managed to get one of the grape vines that Aldi had on offer and then I received a lovely chilli pepper plant in a gift from friends. I traded my surplus leek and brussel sprout seedlings for purple sprouting broccoli and more lettuces, I've one of the Himalayan Honeysuckles dug up (it had to be moved to allow the drainage pipes to be laid) and that's going to the friend who gave me the duck eggs.Since starting this post, the fourth duckling has now fully emerged. I've quickly removed the empty shells to allow more space, just in case more hatch soon. :) I can now see that there will be 1 white duck, 2 black ducks and a grey/blue/lavender duck that I thought was going to be a brown one.I hatched out my first chicks from eggs in an incubator in 1986 and, despite that, it is as exciting today as it was back then.

{"title": "Duck Tales from the Frugaldom Microholding", "date": "Wednesday 29 June 2011", "text": "The Frugaldom Pond is Nearing Completion!I know that having a duck pond in the garden should not rank very highly when first moving into a house that needs so much work done, but it was something that I really, really wanted to have. So, the frugal duck pond project began as soon as we got here.The good weather has helped no end and today was another scorcher. By 10pm tonight, Joey and Phoebe (pair of ducks) were taking their first splashy bath in their new pond!After all the digging, raking, rock smashing and rock removal, it was a very exciting to eventually get to the stage that we could move to the next stage. Even the cat was in the pond helping to dig those big red rocks. We gave up with the excavation, as it looked like it could have gone on forever. The gaping hole got filled in and pond making proper began.With a bit more levelling, we were soon able to rake out the gravel, sweep over the layer of soil and we left one large boulder in a corner, just in case anything fell into the pond and needed an extra foothold to get back out of it.Scruffy cat had a great time playing in there this afternoon!We have used an old carpet to cover the bottom of the pond in the hope that it will prevent any stones from bursting the liner.After laying the carpet, it was swept clean of grit and twigs then the excess trimmed from the side.Next, we unfolded the liner and laid that over the top of the carpet to form the base for our duck pond. It has had to be dug to a depth of about 60cm but it gradually slopes to the sides, to allow the ducks to get in and out easier. Hopefully, their nails won't burst the liner.As soon as we started to fill the pond, the sound of the water brought the ducks waddling along to investigate. They were very wary of the black liner, avoiding standing on it at first, but then started getting braver.Eventually, we had to close them in their small run to avoid them getting in the way, or worse, getting into the pond before it was filled!The cat thought this was a fantastic game, especially when she kept meeting her identical twin, who always seemed to be staring back at her whenever she looked into the water.A couple of times, Scruffy cat got too close and ended up with wet paws, but it was mainly because the midges had appeared and puss thought it would be fun to try and catch some of them!It took us until about 10 pm to get the pond filled, but it has been left a few centimetres short of that, as we still need to sink the overflow pipes into the ground. These are all salvaged 4\" plastic pipes, which will be laid down the edge of the orchard, with the overflow by the side of the stream. We aren't expecting any floods, buit it's best to take precautions and it will help keep the pond clean.It isn't anywhere near completed, as we still need to do the pipes and then pave around the edge. I also have willow for planting off to one side of it and would like a few water-loving plants. Having seen a spectacular pond surrounded by irises and other such flowers, my sights are set on smething similar, albeit on a much smaller scale.For now, the liner is being held in place by many of the rocks and boulders that we dug out, but the ducks don't seem to mind. They were in their for their first swim as soon as we allowed them. It took them a little bit of time to get accustomed to walking across the liner, but they soon got to know that it was safe. With the weather forecast saying the good weather is staying with us, we should get plenty more work done in the garden this week. For now, I am happy we have, at long last, got our duck pond.Meanwhile, back in the incubator, the duck eggs appear to be doing well. With 12 out of 12 of the eggs proving to be fertile, we are now over halfway through incubation. With luck, we could see some new ducklings hatching 10 days from now.Don't forget you can join us free in the Frugaldom Forums where frugal living is the good life.

{"title": "Red Rock Canyon in Southwest Scotland", "date": "Tuesday 28 June 2011", "text": "Digging the PondPond digging can be fun, especially when it comes to smashing rocks to remove them. So far, son has dug out quite a bit of the stone-filled soil and then he and H began smashing the rocks that were too big to dig out. Most of these are just your common, garden rock, grey in colour, but one, in particular, has proven to be very, very stubborn. The trouble with this is that it's right in the centre of where we're digging the duck pond.We have dry stone walls along the entire length of our garden, both sides, (does that make it a walled garden?) so the size of rocks we are digging up during the process of creating our microholding have been on the large side at times. But this thing was a monster - until today!Today, we reached a new layer of rock after 'the monster' had been smashed to pieces with a mallet. However, this monster is not the smooth, hard grey rock that's all around us, instead, it's bright red rock - huge, jagged boulders that sheer off in razor-edged chunks, even when smashed with a hammer. I'm assuming that the deep red colour is a result of high iron content, but I'd really like to know what sort of rock this is that we're digging. It's so red that it stains your skin.A sharp whack with the hammer doesn't chip and smash this, it sheers it vertically. It's not that I'm normally interested in rock formations in any way, shape or form, but the shade of red is quite stunning to say it's just some old boulder we're smashing up whilst making our duck pond. If there is enough of it, this would look great as a feature surrounding the edge of the completed pond. But I would still like to know what type of rock it really is.I'm also wanting to know what's beneath it, as the ground below is err... not there! Beginning to wonder if we're excavating rather than pond digging.Any suggestions about the origins of our micro red-rock canyon, please post a comment. I'll be very interested to find out what, exactly, this is - and what's below it.Watch this space."},
{"title": "It's the end of week 1 of the Frugaldom Microholding Challenge", "date": "Sunday 26 June 2011", "text": "One Week On and What has Changed?The weather has been quite good this past week, despite some cloud and mist, so the garden has received plenty of attention.Blue sky has greeted us most mornings, but there have been some very interesting wispy cloud formations passed overhead. We're reliably informed that the swirls foretell the arrival of rain. On this particular day, after what seemed like another mini heatwave, the shower of rain arrived around 7pm and watered all the plants for me.The bulk of the work has been digging, raking and weeding along with clearing more growing space. 2011, being our first year here, has got off to a late start for us, after having had to transplant so much at such a late stage in Spring, but things are catching up slowly.Across the other side of the burn (stream), H has cleared most of the weeds and brambles to produce an extra space that might be suitable for another hen run. It stretches to about 8m x 4m at the longest and widest parts, but that's taking it a bit close to the edge of the water for planting or building anything. Extending the hen run or building a second run, perhaps for the little Pekins, is feasible and would still leave enough space for planting a few willows and making some sort of feature by the edge of the burn. I haven't researched what could possibly be grown here but, at some time in the future, we'd like to improve on the bridge that crosses it. The Pheasant Berry, or Himalayan Honeysuckle, is growing on both sides of the water, so it obviously likes the type of soil and drainage it has there. I'm assuming that since this shrub produces edible berries, it will not be poisonous to the hens.On the opposite side, H has been digging away relentlessly at rubble mountain, in an attempt to clear out all the rocks, rubble and rubbish. Once cleared, there will be enough space for the summerhouse/art studio and adjacent patio or seating area, as it covers an area measuring approximately 6m x 6m. This area is behind what we call wild bird corner and overlooks the mini-orchard, but it has a view of the main garden all the way up to the house. On the other side, it looks down onto the stream. It will take many weeks of digging and clearing before the ground is anywhere near ready for preparing to build a summerhouse, but this is one of our longterm projects that has been given a top priority rating. It would be great to see it completed this summer.In the upper third of the garden, we have finished transplanting all the berry bushes. The surplus raspberries have been planted along the edge of the orchard.Yesterday, I dug out a new bed for the hardwood cuttings I had taken last year, so they all look happy enough in their metre wide bed. It's about 8m long, so plenty of space for these to grow and spread. Trouble is, I didn't mark the tubs they were planted into, so I'm not sure if these are the blackcurrant or redcurrants. All I know is that they are all the same variety.Today, I edged the bed with rocks to seperate it from the other fruit bushes and then topped it up with some of the soil dug from the soon-to-be duck pond.The duck pond is another one of those priority non-priorities. We all want it completed before any ducklings hatch (due 9th July) but the rocks in the ground have proven to be really stubborn. As with rubble mountain, the excavation that is our duck pond has been attacked by a big mallet, in an attempt to smash through the rocks that would, otherwise, have ended up as an island in the middle. It's very slow progress, slower still, as son has taken charge of this particular project and is fitting it in between work and weight training. Lifting the rocks should be good exercise for him!I have a proper pond liner for here but we'll be using an old carpet as the liner. It won't be a huge pond but it will, hopefully, be big enough to keep the ducks happy and well enough made that filling, cleaning and emptying won't be a problem. It will be so much better than the kiddy paddling pool that the ducks have been using for the past 18 months. In the meantime, Joey and Phoebe watch and wait. It's almost as if they KNOW what is going to be there one day!After setting out all the different growing and rearing areas in the garden, I decided to start measuring up for next year's raisied beds. In the upper third of the garden, which will be where all the vegetables will be grown, I have now marked out a space measuring 10m x 4m. This will be where we'll build proper raised beds, probably in two lots of four, so that the crops can be rotated each year.  At the moment, we have makeshift veg beds made from all manner of things, ranging from fish crates to old drawers and kitchen cabinets. It's a general mish mash of make do planting, in an effort to get some homegrown produce in year one. So far, I have picked several lots of blackcurrants and strawberries and there's a courgette almost ready for picking. The first of the peas now have pods and the lettuce continues to grow as quickly as we eat it.I have to admit that I can hardly wait for the fruit trees to grow, as it has always been an ambition of mine to own an orchard. Our little orchard is slowly taking shape and, although it will still only be a micro-orchard, it does have 20 trees growing in it already, a mixture of plums, pears, cherries, apples and a solitary nectarine that was planted by my grand daughter when she was 2 years old. She'll be 7 soon and the nectarine 'tree' is only two feet tall. This is the first time it has been planted into the ground after spending the last 5 years in a pot, alongside the tiny apple tree that she planted at the same time.I'm amazed that there are apples on a couple of the transplanted trees after all the digging and moving they had to endure in order to survive the move. One of the cherry trees is covered in fruit but I'll need to wait and see if it all ripens fully.The far corner of the garden, where the bird feeding station is set up, is going to be wired off from the ducks and turned into a proper cottage garden with flowers! Now that I've seen how well the foxgloves are doing, I have plans for all sorts of cottage garden type flowers to provide us with a blast of colour in summer and plenty of choice for the bees and other insects. This is also where I'll get round to planting my artichokes, but those will need to be started again, as they were left behind and have probably been mulched into the ground by now.I have seen a garden that I really like, created by a friend within the space of a year. Said friend has offered all sorts of advice on seed collection and what to plant where, so her help will be called upon when it comes time to plant.It's lovely to see a bit of colour in the garden, even if the bulk of it is overhanging from neighbouring gardens. I'll need to learn the names of all the plants and flowers so I know one from the other.Plenty of choice for foraging this summer, what with the elders, haws, rosehips and brambles... and all of this in our own back garden. What more could a true frugaler want?Frugal Living - it's a great life in Frugaldom!"},
{"title": "Anyone know what this is?", "date": "Thursday 23 June 2011", "text": "FINDING FLOWERS AND OTHER STUFFNow that we're here fulltime, the frugaldom garden project is now well underway. Every day we seem to spot something new or uncover more space that causes an instant reaction - what would look good in that space!Today, H has been digging out more of 'rubble mountain' and started hacking back all the overgrown hawthorn and brambles. This is the corner where I found bamboo growing, so that has been kept. However, we don't know what this is... It looks like a shrub and is over 2 metres high and is absolutely covered in these huge, fuschia-like flowers. It is growing by the side of the stream right next to the hawthorn and brambles.  The flowers are shades of pink ranging to deep purple and they hang down in pairs, either that or the flower is double-headed, one below the other. It's very striking and I'd love to cultivate a lot more of it. Anyone any ideas what its real name is? It looks like a giant fuschia but the flowers are about 8cm in length.This is the wild bird corner we've created at the bottom of what will be the orchard. Beyond this is where the nameless fuschia-like shrub towers above everything else. 'Scruffy' cat sat for ages watching H digging in here this afternoon! Or perhaps she was watching the birds?We're going to be leading the overflow pipes through here from the duck pond that's being dug halfway up the garden. This corner is so completely different to how it was when we fist came here, so we're planning a seating area nearby for relaxing in summer to enjoy the garden more. It's a very sheltered corner, despite getting full sun for much of the day.Next year, I'll prbably have lots more flowers planted here, to give it a real 'cottage garden' feel to it. Plans aplenty and, hopefully, plenty of time on our side.There's also space here to build a summerhouse once all the rubble has been removed, so that's another longterm plan. As you can see, it has to be longterm, just look at what still needs to be removed. It's early days, we've only been moved in for a fortnight and the entire garden looked a bit like this to begin with, so watch this space. :) For now, I'll be happy if anyone can let me know their thoughts on what our mystery shrub actually is and if I'll can take cuttings from it to grow some more. It really does stand out from everything else around itYou can see more of how the Frugaldom microholding project is progressing in our free forums, where I have a dedicated 'Frugaldom Microholding challenge' section.

{"title": "The Frugaldom Microholding project in now up and running!", "date": "Saturday 18 June 2011", "text": "A view of the street﻿﻿ The lochside road We have finally moved into our new house after a hectic 50 day challenge to make the place habitable. By 7th June, when our lease expired on the rental, we had completed all of the basic repairs barring the roof, which is proving to be a little trickier than first anticipated. But after living with buckets catching rain water for 19 months at the last place (until landlords finally decided to fix the roof) we'll cope with a few drips while attempting to trace back the root of the problem.7th June was a fairly momentous occasion. We had completely gutted the rental, freshened it up with a coat of paint where needed and returned the garden to its former glory of grass, hedging and dodgy fencing. I'm led to believe that after all our reseeding work, the cattle broke through into the garden two days after we left. I am so glad they didn't trash my veggies this time! Good luck to the new tenants (my previous next door neighbours), whose sanity or motives one might question regarding their choice to rent two adjoining houses from the same landlord. (I'm still shocked at that.)Anyhow, 7th June 2011 marked the end of an era - it was the last day we'd ever have to pay rent, as the new house is bought and paid for in one rash decision to dump a chunk of the frugal savings into a 'forever' home. The location is fairly rural, the nearby village post office is 3 miles away and it's a mere 1 mile walk to the shore - that's less than the walk to our bins at the old house. The cottage is over 200 years old, with the bathroom converted from an old stone outbuilding of some description, so removing damp plaster revealed the original stone wall. This may turn out to be a frugal  feature of the future. With much of the 50-day challenge having seen dry weather, the garden seemed to receive most of our attention. Even outside the front door received attention. Sunshine, shorts & t-shirt, bucket and dibber and I set about weeding the cracked concrete. However, there were loose pieces, crumbling pieces that lifted as I weeded, so I picked out a small corner to see what was below... it seems that the previous owner simply poured the concrete over the top of the original cobbles, so you can guess what one of my future challenges is going to be. So far, I have chipped out about 20% of the concrete, including part of the old drainage ditch that would have run along the edge of the cobbled street.The hens are all happy in their new home, out and about making the most of the extra space they now have. Surprisingly, there has been no interuption to laying, so eggs aplenty have been traded with friends, neighbours and tradesmen alike.  Phoebe and Joey (ducks) love their huge enclosure, which also makes up the orchard, where the pond is currently being dug. Longterm plans for this include overflow drainage, a small, central 'island' (thanks to the huge boulder ridge in the middle) and a waterfall-style feed-in point. Above this area, the shed overlooks what will become the 'jam' garden, comprising blackcurrants, white currants, red currants, raspberries, gooseberries and rhubarb. It's this part of the garden that Floppity bunny has adopted, as she has the run of the place when we're working outside. Her favourite sleeping corner is between the little feedstore and the shed, where she lies surveying 'her' garden after having a mad run around the place. She also follows us into the duck run, so has a fairly large area in which to exercise.Scruffy cat has already made friends with a neighbouring black cat, so the two of them have great fun running along the old dry stone walls and playing hide and seek among the trees. We haven't got around to fitting the cat flap into the back door but that will be done soon; then she'll can come and go as she pleases. At the moment, she's rather fascinated by the newts that seem to appear from everywhere. So far, we have had only one that's ventured indoors while I was working out the front of the house.We're practically living on part of what's known as the 'Pilgrim Way', a well known, local route of historical interest. Over the past week we have managed to make time to go walking a couple of nights and can now fully appreciate the views and local landscape. Nearby, there are ruins of an ancient church and smithy dating back to around the 8th Century. Not far from this is the House of Elrig, made famous by Gavin Maxwell, in his book of the same title. There are still plenty of references to the otters about these parts and members of the Maxwell family still live in the area.There's a little loch along the road from us and many old ruins surrounded by public walkways. The nearby bay stretches across to the Mull of Galloway and, on a clear day, you can see the Isle of Man. The nearest actual village to us is Port William, a couple of miles away, with a harbour, several shops, post office and part time bank. It has everything we'll need and, for more extensive shopping trips to larger supermarkets, we have Stranraer, approximately 20 miles from here.Back to Frugaldom and the whole microholding project... the theory is that we should be able to achieve a semblance of self-sufficiency by way of fresh produce and eggs. We've now managed to dig out several new veg beds and the first plantings are all doing well. The old plum tree at the bottom of the garden is laden with fruit, as are a couple of the little fruit trees that we've transplanted. There are tomatoes beginning to appear in the makeshift 'hot house', the first courgette has sprouted and I've been picking strawberries for the past week in an attempt to beat the blackbirds. Wild birds are plentiful, so I now have 3 feeding stations set up, one in each of the three main sections of the garden. So far, we've had plenty of chaffinches, sparrows, goldfinches, greenfinches, siskins, linnets, blackbirds, thrushes, robins, willow warblers and a visit from a solitary yellowhammer. There's a multitude of collared doves, a family of magpies (can't help but admire their plumage) and I am 99.9% positive that I heard a cuckoo. With the little burn running through the garden, there could be many more species that we simply haven't yet seen. That part of the frugaldom microholding could take quite some time to clear, as there appears to be the remains of a demolished outbuilding along with a mountain of junk. We reckon there should be space enough to build a second hen run on one one side of the burn, where I also have plans for planting the willow, and a summer house on the other side, where H could happily set up his little art studio, overlooking the orchard.To round off this first, epic post after the move, I can confirm that we are all very happy with the outcome, despite the peculiar turn of events that led us here. To our previous landlords, I say thank you for kicking us out - it made us realise that real opportunities abound. The longterm plan of renting cheap property while saving to buy a house without a mortgage may have been terminated prematurely and we may not have that extra land just yet, but it's a buyers' market on the property front and the quarter acre garden we have is adequate compensation for now. If I have learned anything from the past 6 months, it is that every negative can be turned into a positive with the right attitude and the willingness to seize any passing opportunity. I've now spotted my next potential 'big opportunity' and am in the process of preparing to grasp that as soon as it arises. I trully believe that when the time is right, it lets you know all by itself.Edited in - I have already got a dozen duck eggs in the incubator, set on 11/6/11. Last night, I candled them for the first time and have a fertility rate of 100%. After having got rid of the majority of the livestock, it's good to know that there could soon be some new babies for Frugaldom. Two of the eggs are from Phoebe and Joey, so I'm particularly pleased about their being fertile and am hoping for lovely, fluffy ducklings to hatch around the 9th July.Quail are laying well at the moment, so there'll be quail eggs going in next month in preparation for the new flock before St Andrews University researchers arrive to carry out part of their quail research project.Feel free to join us in the frugaldom forums to keep up with all the news and progress from here and from many others who are pursuing similar lifestyles, goals, challenges and ambitions."},

In four more weeks, we will have moved in, regardless of the condition of the house, as the new tenant will have moved in here by then.Despite the state of the house, most of the work that's been done has been outside in the garden. Four weeks ago, I said there wouldn't be any chance of getting anything growing in the new garden this year, but that was before the three weeks of amazing, summerlike weather that we've had. I now have the following sown or planted:strawberriesraspberriestay berriesblackcurrantsredcurrantswhitecurrantsgooseberriestomatoessweet pepperschili pepperschivesnasturtiums2 types of mintradishespeaslettuce & salad leavesspring onionsparsleypotatoesonionscarrotsrunner beansfrench beansgiant pumpkinsleeksbrussel sproutsThere's a small quail coop now set up, with quail inside it! The duck run should be completed this afternoon, weather permitting, and the hen run is almost complete. So, the first 4 weeks have gone into creating the basis for our microholding, which will be a fulltime project. The garden has now been split into three manageable sections - poultry, fruit and then vegetables. The stream has been fenced off, to keep the ducks (and little people, like grandaughter) out and we're gradually wearing a path down the length of the entire garden.The next 4 weeks have to be dedicated to making the house habitable.Since beginning, we now have:functioning shower roomrunning water (cold only)electricitycoal fireopening & closing front windowsopening & closing front dooropening & closing back door (needs panel of safety glass)floor taken back to concrete in kitchenupstairs rooms wood treatedstaircase wood treatedThe next 4 weeks will be the most important, as we need to be moved in by 7th June at the latest. I'll update on house progress first chance I get ad, in the meantime, we're there every afternoon if anyone drops in for a cuppa - running water and working sockets mean the kettle can go on anytime. :)"},
{"title": "Progress on the Frugaldom Microholding", "date": "Thursday 5 May 2011", "text": "Much Digging and Planting has Been DoneWe've really been making the most of the past three weeks of exceptional weather, although it has meant having to water everything every day. We're very lucky to have the stream at the bottom of the garden, as it's a simple case of filling the watering can from there and then watering the fruit trees.We now have the mini-orchard completely planted and all of the trees seem to have taken to the new ground. In total, we have the old plum tree, which was in the garden to begin with, 12 assorted apple, plum, pear and cherry trees plus 5 crab apples. The crab apples have been planted along the south facing wall and will be kept down at manageable hedge height as part of my 'edible hedging'.The orchard will be fenced off from the main garden, as I want the ducks to have the run of it. Slightly beyond this area, but within the fenced part, we plan on digging a pond. It was lucky for us that we found a pile of 10cm diameter plastic pipes dumped at the bottom of the garden. These have now all been retrieved and measured - there are enough to join them up and make an overflow drain that will run between the pond and the stream. I'll just need to source a few connectors and a couple of angled joints to lead it down through the middle of the garden and then round to the little footbridge. It'll take a lot of digging to lay them all in but the pond will take even more, when we get around to excavating that. Hoping to be able to make it between 3m and 4m diameter, with a small patio/seating area nearby.The big rhubarb patch has now been dug out, most of the rhubarb picked and the bed surrounded by a rock border. We used some of the chicken hut manure, which has composted, to dig in among the soil and I also planted the new crown that a friend gave me. In total, I have counted 10 crowns in this one plot, which measures about 4m x 1m. The large slabs propped along the side of the rhubarb patch still have to be moved but we can't budge them. That's a job for son and his weight-training buddies, I think. Hopefully, we'll can find some strong logs or blocks to rest these on, as they'll make fantastic garden benches down in the orchard.Since stripping out all the largest stalks of rhubarb, many more has started to come through. We should see an excellent second crop and I haven't wasted any of the first lot, as fellow LETS members have been trading for it.The microholding, is being created in 'layers', as the garden slopes slightly, down to the stream. The laying hens are going on the opposite side of the water in what will be a 10m x 10m enclosure with a 3m x 2m chicken hut. The chicken hut is gradually being renovated as and when we can salvage reuseable materials. There's plenty of space for the hens, plus there's the opportunity to clear a further area of rough land in the future. At the moment, this area is VERY rough - mostly overgrown with brambles. It also has the burn running along the side of it, so that would need to be made safe. We haven't quite decided what to do with this, yet, all we know is that, as microholding land, it won't be wasted. So, starting from the very bottom of the garden, we'll have poultry separated from the main garden by the stream. Next, we'll have the orchard with the duck pond. This is where we've laid out the old livingroom carpet that was in the house, so it helps kill off all the weeds and grass beneath it before we start excavating. We'll then use the carpet to line the actual pond before fitting a proper liner, so there's less chance of any stones or rocks bursting the liner once the pond beds in. I suspect eBay or eBid will be the source of the pondliner.The orchard will all be fenced from the main garden to keep the ducks enclosed and I'll probably keep the pure breed bantams there, so it's easier to keep an eye on broody hens and chicks. The compost bins have been fitted into a corner of this area, too. Next, we'll have fruit bushes - raspberries, tayberries, red/white/blackcurrants, gooseberries - and rhubarb. The shed will be sited here, too, which means it will be about halfway down the garden. We've already got most of the blackcurrants into the ground and some are starting to form berries, already. I've made a start on getting the raspberry canes in and I've got the gooseberries transplanted from their buckets.Proceeding towards the house, the next area is being dedicated to vegetable growing, so this will be an area for raised beds, square foot gardening and cold frames. Not sure how much of this will be achieved in year 1 but I'd really like to get somewhere dug out for potatoes, before it's too late. (If it isn't already!) I have only one row of potatoes planted along side a small onion bed. There are plenty of old windows lying about the place, so the carrot seeds are growing well under them and the courgettes are looking like fine, healthy specimens. Beyond the veg plots will be the greenhouse - not yet organised - and then the tubs and pots leading up to what will be the patio. At the moment, it had planters, tubs, pots and buckets sitting everywhere, along with an assortment of other garden 'stuff'. I also have a couple of tiny trees in planters that granddaughter planted from fruit stones about four years ago. I think there are two nectarines. I don't suppose that they'll ever grow to bear fruit but it's nice to keep them for her.In the assorted pots, planters and tubs, the strawberries are doing exceptionally well. The prolonged warm, sunny spell has really driven them on.  There are about a dozen planters and troughs filled with them, as I haven't decided where they'll eventually go. With luck, all these flowers will develop into fruit and we could see a bumper crop, despite their all having had to move. Some were only transplanted within the last week.Many of the seeds I planted over the past couple of weeks have germinated and today's rain should really help their cause: salad leaves & lettuce, radishes, carrots, peas, parsley, onions, the onions sets have sprung into life and the nasturtiums and sweet peas are catching up after their late sowings. In other tubs, I have sat seed trays containing courgettes, giant pumpkins, tomatoes, peppers, peas, runner beans and french beans. These tubs have been covered with glass, so I'm eagerly awaiting the results from there anyday now.My mint - two varieties - is growing well. We love this ground and mixed with crumbled chocolate into homemade ice cream but it's just as nice mixed into cheap, shop-bought varieties, which I suspect will be all I'll get time to use this year. The lemon balm mint gets used for drinking as tea - tastes delicious.With so much to do indoors, we are glad to see the arrival of the much-needed rain. For a start, it will make us stay indoors getting more of the renovation work done. But lest you all despair, we have managed to get quite a bit done in the house. All the wood treatment has been completed upstairs, we have holes in the sittingroom, hall and bathroom floors, the kitchen ceiling is partially down and we have, I hope, only one serious pipeleak to be mended. The new fuseboard for the electrics is being fitted tomorrow and the attic rooms should be completed by next weekend. By then, also, the shed should have been delivered and we can start getting all sorts of stuff stored into that.The Frugaldom microholding is coming together and we have another 29 days left of the 50-day challenge to make it all habitable.Challenging times - follow the daily progress in my '50 day challenge' thread of the Frugaldom Forums.

{"title": "The Frugaldom Microholding is Coming to Life!", "date": "Saturday 30 April 2011", "text": "Summer Sun in SpringtimeWe're labouring flat out to get as much of the garden converted into a working microholding as possible, before we actually move into the house. As long as the sun shines and the rain stays away, we concentrate most of our energies outdoors. Yesterday, 29th April, was day 15 of our '50 Day Challenge'. That's how much time we have to pull the project together and make the house habitable. That means it's only 5 weeks until we start moving into the cottage! It's one of our current next door neighbours who will be renting this house after we leave (start of June), so they asked if they could purchase the multifuel stove we had installed, along with the greenhouse and garden shed. After much to-ing and fro-ing, this was finally agreed, just in the nick of time, I might add, as H had already started dismantling around the greenhouse. This, however, has meant that we are left with the problem of no garden storage at the new place, so hard cash has had to be spent! As luck would have it, there was a Royal Wedding this weekend - congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, aka, Prince William and Kate Middleton. Anyhow, everywhere had sales on in celebration of the great event. Some were 'Wedding Weekend Specials', others were extended 'Easter Sales' and yet others were 'May Day Holiday Weekend' specials. I'm not sure which I opted for, but we bought a half price garden shed, so we need somewhere to build it. That somewhere, is here, between the main garden and the orchard.In the new garden, there are piles of discarded rubbish everywhere. As There have been several sets of matress springs amongst the debris, but also no fewer than 10 sturdy panels, each measuring at least 4' x 4'. So, I raked, dug, shovelled and raked some more to clear and level a space much bigger than needed and then we carefully laid the panels. (I suspect they've formed some sort of sectional animal shelter in the past.) By yesterday afternoon, we had this base all ready to receive the new shed, complete with enough extra space to sit some pots around itOn the opposite side of the garden, there's the huge patch of unruly rhubarb, so I tackled some of that. I'm trading it through our local LETS group, so it will all be used and appreciated; it will also help towards costs of hiring a trailer from fellow members.Not sure how much rhubarb I picked, but I couldn't carry it all. Having sat an old fish crate next to the patch, (we've collected about a dozen from the garden, chicken hut and outbuilding) I simply kept pulling up stalks until the crate was filled. I then bundled it all up to the back door to top and tail it, ready for distributing. I reckon 2 Crees per kilo sounds a fair price, as there's plenty more where that lot came from, plus there's still a big patch of it growing here that's in need of picking. Rhubarb, anyone? Ideal for frugal wine making if you like a bit of fizz, or stewed in pies, tarts and crumbles.On Thursday evening, I saw someone out in the street strimming the grass verges opposite a couple of the other cottages. I went out for a chat (everyone knows everyone else about here) and explained that we'd just bought the cottage and it would be unfair if ours looked scruffy next to the others. He totally agreed, commenting how bad it would look if the Royal bridal party had to pass along the street! The £5 charge seemed like an absolute bargain, although it's sheer luxury for a frugalite like me! We don't own a petrol strimmer, so I invited said gentleman to view the back garden. (Please note - this was not some random stranger). He appeared back yesterday afternoon, strimmer in hand, and set about the back garden, strimming all down through the new orchard. What a huge difference it makes! We can now see the basic lay-out of what will soon become our main concern - the great outdoors, within the confines of our very own walls. This photo was taken from the end of the soon-to-be patio, which seems to keep creeping further from the back door. Our future patio will end up being 15m x 5m, as opposed to the original plan to restrict it to the first 5m x 5m. It will be surrounded by patio planters, pots and trellis climbers, then divided from the main garden by a pergola-type structure, along which, I hope to grow the vines. All of the strawberries are along a south facing wall, so these are getting the best of the sunshine. They'll also be handy for nipping out the back door to pick for dessert during summer. There are 10 wooden planters and 3 troughs filled with them, so I'm hopig for a decent crop this year. We tend to eat them as they are picked, so I've never managed to get as far as making strawberry jam.Meanwhile, back at the ranch... H was working in 'poultry corner', digging, clearing and mending the chicken hut. It'll take a bit of time, as we can't move the sheets of wood until we next borrow a trailer, but the shed now has a new door and some new interior lining. The wire in the windows will be replaced with 1/2\" weldmesh. The entire shed measures 12' x 8', so it's a solid lump of a building, especially as it seems to have been reinforced in the past. It's built within a wired enclosure measuring about 30' x 30', so plenty of space for the poultry. The bonus feature that H discovered is the concrete slatted floor! Ideal, by anyone's standards.Today is day 16 of our 50 day challenge and the sun is shining. I wonder what we'll achieve today?Join us in the Frugaldom Forum to follow progress and to set up your own mini-challenges. These are 'Challenging Times', so why not make them fun?﻿Out with the old... or NOT, as the case may be.Our 'new' house is an end terraced cottage. It's probably about 200 years old and adjoins what was formerly the Inn and, adoining that, what's known as the weaver's cottage. We have no idea who lived in ours, originally, it could have been the Innkeeper's cottage, for all we know.These particular stone cottages in SW Scotland are all under some sort of conservation order and, as such, are listed as historic buildings. We need to renovate carefully and in keeping with the original design of the buildings. We need to do this on a frugal budget, so the easiest and cheapest part of the proceedings is preparing to create the microholding in the back garden and tearing out the interior of the house - these things cost nothing to do and it's all time well invested. So, I was delighted when I excavated down to a stone flagged hall floor!We've already put many hours into clearing the garden, it will take many, many more, but the micro-orchard has now been transplanted from the old garden, several borders dug and planted up, the first of the raised beds dug and sown and the hen house repairs have begun.12' x 8' hen shedReplacing rotten wood in hen shedThe old hen house at the bottom of the garden measures 12' x 8' and is situated within a 30' x 30' run, which is fenced almost entirely to a height of about 6'. The roof of the shed is solid and seems watertight, although we haven't had much rain to try it out properly. Anything that has rotted or been chewed, burrowing or damaged is being repaired and crittur-proofed. It will be a brilliant place for the hens, separated from the main garden by the stream. ﻿ Concrete slatted flooring in chicken hutThere looks to have been a lot of added 'security' in the past, so I'm assuming it's been to protect against mink coming along the stream and foxes from the adjoining fields.Only the hens will be kept in the enclosure at the bottom of the garden, as the ducks will have their own space in the orchard. Beyond the trees, I am planning on digging a pond and an adjacent seating area, for relaxing in summer.﻿﻿﻿﻿Duck pond will go hereThe main garden has now been split in two, one half for poultry, the other for veggies and fruit bushes. In the bottom half, I have covered over a patch that will become the duck pond. We found a whole stack of plastic piping of the 10cm diameter plastic type, so this will be used as drainage for overflow and to make cleaning of the pond an easier task. Coupled with the metres and metres of hose pipe retrieved from around the property, we should be able to create a good flow of water, topping up from an outside tap and draining off any excess into the stream at the foot of the garden.8' x 7' raised bed split into growing sectionsI've dug out the first deep bed and now have it filled with compost. It's split into three sections - main part has onions planted, then there's a block of carrots. The smallest corner is being kept for the lettuces, once I start thinning out the seedlings. The wooden frame on bottom left supports two 4' windows to form a cold frame for the carrots. This can then be netted to deter any carrot fly.When H started digging out the contents of the chicken hut, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned out in years. We know the previous owner also kept pigs, goats, rabbits etc, so the soil and manure have now broken down into lovely compost. I used some of this for the raised beds, but there's plenty more to be moved. There must easily be the quivalent of ten bags of compost piled up along the wall, so no excuses for buying any extra and it will also help start off the new compost once we get the bins moved over from the old garden.On what will be our patio, the platers are coming to life. The salad leaves (Speedy Veg variety) are growing very quickly. Thank goodness, as the number of salad sandwiches we're getting through whilst unable to make any lunches at the new house seems to be increasing by the day. All this good weather means packed lunches outdoors, sitting in the garden.I also noticed that the first of the peas, carrots, nasturtiums and sweet peas have germinated, so things are startig to grow all over the place.Trees awaiting plantingOne of my priorities was the orchard, as I wanted the trees into the ground as soon as possible. The cherry trees had already started blossoming in their tubs and I didn't want to wait a day longer than necessary. So, I measured out the plot of land allocated as orchard, marked out where each tree was going and then H got to work digging all the holes. These were soon filled!It's been a busy two weeks, since getting the keys to the new house. It's also been a sunny two weeks, so more has been done in the garden to start off our microholding than has been done indoors, making the house habitable.Follow the Frugaldom Microholding progress in the Frugaldom Forums, with daily photo updates and progress reports.

{"title": "Burst Pipes No More, Progress Being Made in Frugaldom!", "date": "Friday 22 April 2011", "text": "The Plumber Called Today.It's been just over a week since we got the keys to the cottage, so the major clear-up is now in full swing. It's very lucky we have the stream running through the bottom of the garden, as that's where the water has been coming from for the toilet - not only was there no running water, there was no cistern. But that all changed today.﻿﻿﻿﻿ We have running water!The plumber arrived this morning and by lunchtime he had fixed four of the burst pipes and had the cold water running. We've managed to salvage the toilet cistern casing and it now houses replacement parts that have transformed it into a useable loo! The sink, toilet and shower unit are now all perfectly fine, so these have all been scrubbed and will be kept - moneysving right away, as we thought wthey would need to be replaced. The bathroom wall tiling has come up almost like new and, although the lino still has to be lifted to dry out the floor properly, I washed that, too, so I could take photos for the progress album. The kitchen sink has scrubbed up really well, so that won't need replacing, either. Yeah! More money-saving.Next up was checking the heating. There are three radiators running off a back boiler behind an open fire in the livingroom. This will also heat our hot water, although we're planning on having an immersion heater fitted, too, for when it's too warm to light the fire. There was a small burst at the header tank, so that has now been fixed, plus a burst pipe in the hall beneath the radiator; then the water was turned on to fill the system... Cleaned up good as newThere were many glugs and numerous hisses and clunks as the water forced all the air out of the pipes, then promptly started spraying from all three radiator valves at the same time! I'm delighted to say, however, that as soon as these were all closed off, the water stayed within the system; all obvious leaks there seem to be fixed. The radiators will also be kept, as they seem to be perfectly serviceable. The bathroom one scrubbed up really well and looks fairly new. Let's just hope that the back boiler is in good working order once we get the fire going. At least we know the chimney is now swept and ready to go.Next it was the turn of the hot water system. This took a bit of time to fill up, but we now have water running when we turn on the hot taps. There are two valves with leaks in this system, but the plumber ran out of time to fix them today: I'd to turn the water back off and drain the hot water tank until he can get back to us next week. It was enough time, though, to get out and check the outside tap, which worked without a problem - so I watered all my plants in the garden.The pump for the heating isn't working, so that needs to be stripped to see if it can be repaired. We may need a new pump, so I'll be searching online for best prices and being prepared for the worst.This will become the gymAs always, I managed to get outside into the garden for a bit of clearing. Son was with me this morning, so he removed the huge, broken window from the outbuilding. He then removed the old workbench and made great progress with some clearing. I reckon he got about a fifth of the floor uncovered.CourgettesWe have found dozens of sheets of glass and old windows about the property. Conveniently, we should be able to fit four smaller ones into the space where the massive pane of glass was removed. Many of the others will be used for cold frames down the south facing dry stone wall, as there's really gopd soil there and plenty of sunshine.Next door neighbour gave me two little courgette plants, so I took advantage of son's helpful mood and got him to help me build the first frugal cold frame to house those. They look quite happy in their new home, which is 4' long and built from rubble that we found lying around the garden. (We have loads of rubble, broken glass, remnants of past bonfires and general rubbish lying about the garden, but that will gradually get cleared as the microholding takes shape.The first of the veg beds - potatoesThe chitted potatoes I had were getting to the overly-chitted stage so, once again, son's lifting power was put to good use as soon as he'd extracted the wooden sleeper from beyond the outbuilding. It's now the front edge for my potato bed. It's taking hours to clear a patch and get to decent soil, as there are rocks, gravel and broken glass all through it, but a bit of digging, sifting, separating out the glass shards and relocating rubble, I managed to get my first row of potatoes planted! I've still got another four square meters of potato patch to prepare, but I'll do it bit by bit, so the potatoes are planted a few days apart.Back door viewFront door viewIt was such a glorious day again that both the front and back doors of the house were able to be left wide open. I love the views from both the back and front of the house. I can't wait to get the garden done - the orchard planted, the fruit bushes in, the pond dug and the hens & ducks moved.We'll be able to dine in summer with the back door open and a vuew of the garden. Photo on the left shows the view from the back door, photo on the right is the view from our front door. From the front door, if we're sitting out there, we can see the sea and then more hills on the horizon. The one mile walk to the beach will be handy for keeping fit, that's for sure! It's a very exciting prospect to be moving to such a great place and, as followrs of the frugaldom lifestyle, I am sure we will be very happy there for many years to come.Fruit bushes awaiting plantingAll in all, I am loving having this cottage. It needs so much done both indoors and out that it's like a fulltime job at the moment, but it will all be worth it, especially once the microholding is in full swing. This is going to be a great summer, come rain, hail or shine. Salad leavesSpeaking of rain, it has just started, so that will save me watering the lawn here and should encourage the new seed to bed in and germinate. It will also help water everything that's been sown at the new garden. I'm totally amazed at how quickly the salad leaves are growing - I only sowed the seeds four days ago and look at them already! Speedy veg seeds, indeed."},
{"title": "The Great Clear Up Begins", "date": "Monday 18 April 2011", "text": "Burst pipes, dodgy wiring, leaky roof, we've got the lot.With views like these, we don't really mind how bad the place looks for the foreseeable future. When it gets too damp and dusty indoors, we can simply go outdoors and sit watching and listening to the surrounding countryside.There are several doves fluttering about, settling now and again in the old pear tree near the bottom of the garden. It certainly attracts plenty of smaller birds and we can hear the pheasants right down at the bottom of the garden on the other side of the stream.Out on the hills, which we can see from the kitchen window, cows graze peacefully. The cottage sits in the only street that runs through a quiet village. I still haven't seen or heard any children, other than a few visiting at the weekend. I have, however, heard a neighbour's cockerel crowing, so the chickens certainly shouldn't be a problem once we move them over to their new home.We've been blessed with good weather for the past five days. This should, hopefully, help to dry the house out a bit, as it means we can leave the front and back doors lying wide open to air the place.While son and his pal made a start on clearing rubbish from the outbuilding, we began strippig more wallpaper, ceiling tiles and carpets out of the house but the lure of the sunshine became too great. I ended up outside making a start on what will become our patio. There's a good 10m of concrete outside the back door and it's completely sheltered by the outbuilding on one side and a dry stone wall on the other - ideal patio for barbecues and as an extra dining area in summer.Having cleared away all of the rubbish, rubble and weeds from the first part, I was able to start setting out some planters. I even got one filled up and have sown some fast growing salad leaves. According to the pack, these 'speedy veg' could be ready for starting to harvest in as little as four weeks, so we should have something for the sandwiches by the time we get moved into the house. A walk down the garden soon found me carting glass panels for across the top of the wooden planter, turning it into a mini-coldframe. There are plenty of panes of glass, that's for sure. In fact, there are probably enough of them lying about the place to build a greenhouse! For now, I'll use them to protect the seeds as they are sown.That was yesterday's work, so today, I filled up the car with more planters and the first of the strawberries and fruit bushes. I also took over some of the willow, the honeysuckle, my (kept well pruned) Russian vine and a big tub of lupins.The friend who was with me today had a good rummage along the edge of the garden walls to see what could be found growing. I'd already found the big patch of rhubarb - a definite bonus - and friend identified the unknown fruit tree as a plum tree. Along the way, she found a minature rose, some buddleia, mock orange, honesty and a bamboo, which she reckons can be nurtured back to health. There are also the usual brambles, which will soon be cultivated into something more manageable than the trip-me-up traps they currently represent.The black looking boards we found, seen here behind the rhubarb patch, are what we have saved to make into garden benches. These will be ideal, once propped up on logs, as we should be able to drill them in to secure them. I still haven't a clue what they once were, but solid plastic, as well as being very heavy, is also waterproof and very durable.This afternoon, I discovered that we'll be about £120 per year better off, as the new house is only a council tax band B, whereas we are currently paying for a band C. Having the septic tank also means not having any waste water or sewage charges, but we don't have them here, either. This difference will almost cabcel out the extra buildings insurance we now need to pay.Next best news, after the news of actually getting the house, is that, even after we factor in the additional travel costs for being 20 miles from nearest town, our regular out-goings should drop by almost £100 per week! Now that's what I call a frugaler's dream! Tomorrow's trip, weather permitting, I hope to move over more of the strawberry planters. Wuth luck, these should all fit in the back of the car (and weigh us down nicely for making the trip). I must remember to bake tomorrow's loaf tonight, so we have our customary sandwiches, as the power company is doing major repairs in our area, meaning everywhere is affected throughout tomorrow from 8am. And I have remembered that we're now working between two houses, so the washing went out on the line here first thing this morning.Just for good measure, I have stashed all my flower and veg seeds into a bag to take to the cottage tomorrow. Many of the packs say April within their planting time frames, so I'm risking sowing some as soon as I can before this month is out. Must remember to take the garden fork with me, as I need to find a patch for digging so I can get some potatoes planted!Having immense fun, despite the fact that we're using nearly a gallon of petrol each day we go over there. It still feels a bit like being on a wild camping holiday when we're sitting out the back on the soon-to-be patio having our picnic and having to walk down to the stream to collect buckets of water to compensate for the lack of cistern on the toilet indoors!Don't forget you can join us in the Frugaldom Forums."},
{"title": "A Quick Post of Appreciation", "date": "Sunday 17 April 2011", "text": "In Response to Previous Comments  I can hardly believe that we have bought the cottage. To be honest, I find it unbelievable that nobody else did! It has to be fate, or destiny or simply the right page in the book of, 'The Grand Scheme of Things'. I appreciate all your comments, hints, tips and suggestions, as we really do have loads of work ahead of us as part of the longterm plan for a self-sufficientish lifestyle of microholding, which involves DIY wherever possible.The only way we have been able to purchase outright is because we really have lived a frugal life for the past number of years and plan on continuing to do so, only now we won't have much by way of savings set aside for a rainy day - it rained the day we went to look at the cottage.  :) Renting has cost a fortune, even by living in some of the cheapest properties available in whichever area I've worked. I counted it up and, between us, we have paid over £60,000 on rent and digs over the past 10 years. That would pay for the house we've just bought! The price also reflects the state of the property, however, so we've a long way to go before it will become comfortable and productive.With property prices rising and interest rates near non-existent, it was looking more and more impossible for us to buy, but it seems miracles really do happen! We were in the right place at the right time, it has to be as simple as that. It also helps that we live in an area where there is a high incidence of holiday and second homes, with prices, in my opinion, crashing.We didn't have as much available to spend as the sellers were originally asking, but events transpired that brought about a change and they accepted a compromised offer, imposing extra conditions like 'no guarantees on anything' and 'no clearance of the property prior to sale'. It was basically a 'sold as seen' deal, based on the Home Report, a few pertinent telephone calls and some Internet research. We had delays with the purchasing process owing to the Office of the Public Guardian being involved, but what's another 21 days when your 'forever home' is at stake?I will never understand why nobody else bought the cottage. A small building plot probably costs more than we paid for the house. In all honesty, I believe many people think money can buy anything in this life and they expect perfection in exchange for their cash. Perhaps the fact that this house wasn't overly expensive had everyone assuming that they'd only get what they paid for, so passed it by. How else could we have afforded to buy a house? With extraordinary luck, a heap of hard work in the DIY department and an attitude that involves making the most of a situation, we will have the place habitable within the next 6 weeks and be moved our of here by the 7th of June. It may not be an ideal situation, nor may it be anybody else's idea of fun, but I'm thinking long term and can't wait to get moved. I'll bet the hens and ducks will love it over there!Now the sun has come back out after hiding behind a thick blanket of fog. More of the garden will be transferred today and this time, we'll take the garden chairs rather than end up sitting on the planters.All I can add to this is:NEVER, NEVER, NEVER give up your hopes, dreams and aspirations and NEVER, NEVER, NEVER pass an opportunity to pursue those hopes, dreams and aspirations. Life passes quickly enough without placing self-imposed delays and diversions along the way. By all means, look before you leap, but be prepared to make that leap, if it's the one for you.   Many thanks for reading my personal web-log, I'm glad that you seem to enjoy it.   See you in Frugaldom."},
{"title": "My 50 Day Challenge Has Begun...", "date": "Saturday 16 April 2011", "text": "Making the Fixy-Up Habitable.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Starting the microholding can't really be done until we've moved into the new house. Moving into the new ﻿house can't really be done until it's safe to inhabit and has power and a water supply. Heating can wait, as we're getting closer to summer with every day that passes. So here is my first blog post of progress from Day 1 of 50.DAY 2 It's been a dry day, so we headed off to the house this morning, complete with flask, to meet up with son and his pal, who were making a start on clearing away some of the rubbish and taking it to the nearest tip.Not wanting to travel over there with an empty car, we decided to load up with the first of the planters and my two juniper bushes that sit by the front door.I was trying to be so organised... except that, in my haste, I lifted one planter the wrong way and the bottom fell out of it! My poor little juniper bush shot out the bottom, complete with its tangle of roots and soil, and went rolling along the drive! Soon fixed it all back together, not quite as good as new, but it's intact.As soon as we arrived at the house, we got the planters sat either side of the front door, so it has the beginnings of a 'lived in' appearance. I got a bit of the front path weeded whenever I could escape out the front. It was such a beautiful day and, without all the clouds and rain, we have a sea view from the front door, which I hadn't even realised until seeing it today!Inside, the cottage absolutely stinks of mouldy dampness, so the first thing we started to do was lift damp carpets and get then hauled off to the tip. In between times, I got chatting to the next door neighbour, who was (how lucky was this?) having her chimneys swept! Yeah! We got the sweep to go up on the roof to check our chimneys and give the main one a good clean out - he said it looks fine to light, just as soon as the water is on to fill the tank/back boiler. Heating and hot water will be from the open fire and back boiler, which will soon be reconnected to three radiators. We're hoping to have this fixed up and back to working order as soon as possible.Son's pal brought his dog with him, so it had a great time in the garden, running around with dozens of footballs and floats. I suspect someone in the previous owner's family was a fisherman! I have saved a lifebuoy to hang somewhere (I want to paint it to say SS Frugaldom) and son has saved a pair of oars for who knows what? We binned all the lobster creels, but I've saved all the fish crates and dozens of panels of glass - these will be my makeshift seed beds and coldframes for immediate use.Eventually, I got the electricity meter reset and then had to go back into the village to put credit on the key. That's when I met the electrician & plumber, so an inpromptu invite was extended to visit the new house to do a quick assessment of the electrics and plumbing. (Smart thinking, methinks. )The power is now on - we have electricity, albeit dodgy electricity, so it got switched off at the mains before we left. We need a new fuse board and a lot of the wiring updated. With luck, it won't extend as far as a complete rewire.Friends arrived for a quick visit, so we had a chat with them and showed them around the place. I think they were suitably impressed by the amount of work that needs doing within the space of 50 days! I actually think they'll be praying for us, but we appreciate any help, whatsoever.Next up was the water, as I was dreading the supply being turned on it case the place instantly flooded. Hmm... when plumber went to turn on the water main, he discovered it hadn't been turned off, so he opened the valve on the stopcock indoors and...Water started running... from several burst pipes! It was quickly turned back off again, but several bursts have been found. It appears the system was not drained down, it simply emptied itself into the house, probably last winter. Again - we were prepared for the worst, so we did expect there to be burst pipes.Then another friend arrived, so we had the tour and then sat on the upturned planters out in the back yard, having a natter and a good old laugh. One day soon, I'll be able to refer to this as, 'entertaining guests on the patio'.Anyhow, we did manage to strip off more layers of wallpaper and lift the THREE carpets from one room! I also spent quite a bit of time running around with a mop and bucket, mopping up water after watching it spurting from various points throughout the house! H started scraping the polystyrene tiles from the ceilings to reveal woodchip!I've managed to salvage loads of 'useful' things for the garden, like wire, buckets, wood and even an old hen feeder. The budget is everything, afterall, and a penny saved is a penny earned. We can't afford to waste anything - not even the old, heavy duty, plastic boards that we found. These will make a fantastic garden bench! Talk about Steptoe's yard... all that's missing is the horse! You'll see the funny side of this once I tell you the rest... I also got to meet the other next door neighbour, who came out to chat when we were carting all the rubbish down the side of the house. I recognised her and she recognised me! So H and I went in to see her spectacular, terraced garden. It is fantastic! Amidst all that was going on today, we could hear the cock-a-doodle-doo of another neighbour's cockerel, so we've let the neighbours know about ours. Not a problem, as there have been goats, pigs, sheep and all sorts of stuff in the back garden of our new house, apparently.Later, when pal and I were out at the front door chatting, someone else I knew walked past, so we had a brief catch up. It really did feel like being home - familiar faces everywhere.I reckon there must be around 30 houses in the village and they mostly look immaculately extended with large, landscaped gardens. I had just mentioned this, when the plumber informed me that it's known as \"millionaire's row\" and that we have no fewer than two different captains living there! I'm sorry, but I really did almost choke and laugh at this... Frugaldom in millionaire's row!Oh my! I really must learn to be on my very best behaviour and get them all on board the good ship Frugaldom! I hope they can all appreciate the funny side of a fulltime frugaler coming to live in their midst. I've now acquired a couple of extra window boxes, courtesy of my current neighbour, and will get these planted up tomorrow with my Aldi begonias and marigolds, so the place can begin to look a little presentable.Notice to all callers: Please use the front door and bring your own teacup. Don't use the back gate, as it's about to fall off its hinges, and please ignore the scuff marks on the doors, that's where we have to kick them to get them open. I feel like 'Ma Clampett' from the Beverley Hill Billies! But I promise not to serve up roadkill for Sunday lunch. Today's top find, buried in overgrowth and boards that have now gone to the tip (barring the salvaged plastic for making a garden bench) was this rhubarb patch! I have something edible in my garden!See you in Frugaldom."},
{"title": "The Time Has Come to Start that Microholding", "date": "Friday 15 April 2011", "text": "Now the Hard Work Can Really Begin﻿ One week old Black piglet﻿ Officially, this is our first day as the owners of our new house and garden, our very own microholding of the future. There is much to do and, as luck would have it, today has had to be spent here, getting workaday things out of the way in between contacting utilities companies, so we have some services at the new place.We collected the keys late on Wednesday afternoon, so we were able to spend much of yesterday pottering about the place, picking up rubbish and peeling off soggy wallpaper from indoors. The first task, though, was removing the 'For Sale' sign that had been screwed into one of the wooden window frames at the front of the house. What a very satisfying feeling it is to see that safely removed.﻿﻿ For the purposes of the Frugaldom blog, the bulk of what gets written here is a personal journal recording progress towards creating a frugal microholding and self-sustainable, home based work.After several years of scrimping, saving, renting, several house moves and a lot of hard work that, to many, may seem like a waste of time and effort, we have finally got a place worthy of turning into something that can help us to live a self-sufficientish lifestyle, working from home and garden to provide a self-sustainable income. It may not be everyone's dream home but it will be our home - no rent, no landlords, no mortgages - and we are more than happy with it. There's always more land available, should we decide to expand our project at any point in the future and there's certainly plenty of scope for development of the cottage, despite it being terraced - it's in a fairly rural street setting.﻿ Almost quarter of an acre of overgrowth﻿﻿﻿ This photo is a view of the strip of garden land at the back of the cottage. In days gone by, the land would have originally belonged to the estate, with cottages being built for the local workers. People moved on, houses and land leases were sold, time marched on and modern methods of doing most things overtook the tradition of 'smallholding' from your back garden. But some people still did.The house we have bought used to be home to hens, ducks, pigs, rabbits and, I believe, goats. Not much has survived from the past, despite the place only having been lying empty for the last couple of years, but the tell tale signs are all there.﻿ The old poultry housing﻿ At the furthest end of the garden, on the opposite side of the burn, there's an area that has previously been fence off completely. I suspect this is where the old hen coop and, possibly, goat house have been. There appears to be what's left of nest boxes, roosts and a fair sized area, big enough for a couple of goats, if anyone cared to keep them there. Although we have no intentions of keeping pigs or goats at the moment, it probably would still be possible to register for a County Holding Parish number (CPH) that would enable us to do so. (The piglet in the photo is one out of two litters born recently on a fellow-frugaler's mini-smallholding.)Along the length of the garden there are bits of posts and broken fencing ﻿﻿where, once, livestock must have been. There's only a single tree growing in the garden at the moment, possibly an apple tree, but it won't be alone for long, as I have a whole micro-orchard planned for that area.﻿ Poultry? Goats? Lambs?﻿ This is the old shed that, for all its rickety, tumbledown looks, we may be able to renovate into poultry housing. It's quite big; at a guess, I'd think around 3m x 2m, so there's plenty of space to make it into whatever we feel is most needed. I'm desperate to get started on the garden but I know that we need to get the house fixed up first. Gardening will be something that gets done in fits and starts during our first year. They do say that it is always better to observe the garden for the first year, don't they? No matter what, I will fit in the time to get something planted for this year, even if it means digging out a small deep bed closer to the house as a kitchen garden. Outbuilding - previous use unknownOn the other hand, the youngest member of the family has set his sites on renovating a block built out-building. We aren't sure what this has been used for in the past, although family members of previous owners did mention there had been pigs reared in the garden in the past. One side of the building is mainly windows, so I suspect it could have been some sort of tool shed combined with a potting shed and maybe even a tomato house. Then again, the other side of it could have been a pig sty. Had it been located elsewhere, I'd have taken it as a boat store, as there are buoys, creels, nets, floats and even oars in amongst the junk that's been festering in there for the past however long.﻿ A stream runs through the garden﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Neighbours either side have all got beautiful gardens, so I hope we can bring ours up to scratch. There were pheasants in next door's garden and, further along the street, there seems to be hens and ducks. As yet, we have nothing more than a concrete crossing over our part of the stream, so this will need to be made safe for grand children (and me on slippy days) and secured against the ducks being carried off downstream into the wrong gardens! My imagination is running riot on what could be done with this particular area of the garden and it involves my long awaited willow project. I can't help but thinking of how lucky we are to have got the timing spot on for buying this little property. When I think of how close we came to dropping a chunk of our savings into the woodland at the end of our current driveway, the 'near miss' was less than 24 hours!You'll normally find me logged into the Frugaldom Forums, as that's where most of the topic discussions take place.

{"title": "Help! I Need Fast Growing Grass Seed!", "date": "Monday 11 April 2011", "text": "How Do I Grow Grass Quickly?We moved here in November 2008 and knew we'd have our work cut out getting anything to grow in the garden. The house had been empty for some months, the surrounding grass left untended and nothing had been cultivated for years, by the looks of things. That was then, this is now. Having been served notice, supposedly on accounts of our chickens causing a nuisance (still dumbfounded by this reason) we now have less than 2 months remaining to return the place to its former 'glory'. We did offer to leave the garden as it was, complete with shed, greenhouse and patio, but the landlord insists we remove everything, including the new multifuel stove we had installed late last year.October 2008﻿﻿ This is how the back corner of the 'garden' looked when we came here at first. At some time in the past, previous tenants had kept dogs, so the remains of the derelict kennels and runs were still in place. Being of the 'make do and mend' brigade, we saw this as a bit of a bonus; we could renovate the kennel and runs to use them for poultry. Might take longer than just spending a fortune on brand new stuff, but it would suffice, for the time being. As 'Archie' would say, it's nothing a bit of baler string couldn't put right.﻿ November 2008﻿ The first photo shows how the back yard looked when we first came here. We got moved in at the start of November, so the grass and weeds had soon died back to manageable height, so we simply hacked down most of it for the time being. We were busy concentrating on other things, so left it for the winter.May 2009As soon as weather improved, we got around to renovating the old runs and replaced the overgrowth with woodchips. We never did dig up the grass, only turned the soil to stop it growing any further. It took us until May 2009 to make it look anywhere near presentable, but we think we did a good job. We ended up having to take the converted kennel off the stilts and move it, to prevent the hens from sitting on top and trying to clear the fence into next door's garden. They never have. I'll actually be rather sad to wave goodbye to the makeshift duck house - it has served us well. Perhaps it will become home to a future tenant's ducks, who knows?Now, having been served our notice and having already out-stayed our welcome, on accounts of not, yet, having anywhere else to move, we need to undo everything we have done. This needs to go back to grass as quickly as possible. Suggestions, please, on the quickest, easiest, cheapest way of doing this, as I can't afford to risk the landlord witholding our deposit on something as simple as the time it takes grass to grow. I've already reseeded the front lawn and the space where the raised vegetable beds used to be but it isn't growing very quickly.

{"title": "Sacrificing Chickens...", "date": "Saturday 9 April 2011", "text": "﻿﻿﻿ Lavender Araucana Cockerel﻿﻿﻿Sadly, We Can't Keep Them All! With all the upheaval of the forthcoming house move, I have had to have a long, hard think about what should and what shouldn't come with us. At the moment, we are living in a rented farm cottage where both sets of neighbours also keep chickens and both also have cockerels. However, our next move is onto a street, so there are several more neighbours to consider.Despite always having wanted to keep blue egg layers, the general opinion is that we shouldn't really have too many cockerels. At the moment we have 4, and nobody wants to say goodbye to Mr Chirpy, our little Pekin cockerel. It means I now need to sacrifice the Araucanas and the Silkies. This is my handsome Araucana cockerel. He was the first one I ever hatched in the incubator from eggs that had been bought in via eBay. The seller said they were from proze-winning stock and, to date, I haven't had any need to doubt that. We never did name him, as I tend to only name the pet hens. The Araucanas and cuckoo Silkies were all left unnamed, as they were more for producing saleable 'commodities' by way of chicks and fertile eggs. When we received notice to move out this house, I began rehoming much of what was here - but the friend who was supposed to come and collect the Silkies has never managed to make the trip. (It's quite far.) This means, I should really let them go, too. But we do like our Silkies. Maybe I could just sell a trio of them and keep the others. Surely having two cockerels at the bottom of such a long garden couldn't upset anyone too much?My Blue Cuckoo Silkies were also hatched from eggs bought in via eBay. I was really lucky in finding a good breeder who sent me 7 eggs when I bought 6. To my delight, 6 of them hatched out and gave me 5 cuckoo marked birds and one splashy lavender hen, which will be staying with us, as she's become such a great friend for 'Dumbledorf', our mischievous, and always filthy, white mini-Silkie hen.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿I'm about to start splitting the birds up into what's coming with us and what will need to be sold.

{"title": "Another Step Closer to Microholding", "date": "Friday 8 April 2011", "text": "This morning saw the arrival of the solicitor's letter headed, 'We are pleased now to confirm conclusion of a bargain on your behalf', along with the receipt for all funds transferred to pay for the house. As soon as the funds clear, we can collect the keys and begin work on turning the house into our home, at which point, our very own microholding project will begin.This is what we have to convert into a self-sustainable, eco-friendly, self-sufficientish garden.Here, we see the bottom of the garden. This is where the hens and ducks will soon be going to live. It's a fair sized area to fence off for them, probably measuring about 8m x 10m - plenty of space for our micro-flock.Between there and the main garden, there's a stream, so there's plenty of scope for keeping a duck pond filled with fresh water, not to mention watering the furthest corners of the garden.The far end of the garden meets the main garden by way of the small, concrete bridge over the stream. Perhaps, one day in the future, we'll have a more ornamental water crossing but, for now, this will do us just fine.Once across the bridge, we arrive at the bottom of the main garden. It's over 90m long and about 10m wide, so plenty of space for developing our great outdoors.Looking down the garden from what will, one day soon, become our patio, you can just make out the trees at the bottom, where the steam runs through and where the feathered friends will take up residence.It's all very exciting, but also a huge task, as the place hasn't been touched in two years. Apart from that, we still need to get the house reasonably fixed up this summer. There's no building work to do, thankfully, just major cosmetics and upgrading of services & utilities before we can safely move in; with luck and a great deal of determination, we're planning on being there sooner, rather than later.Apart from that, I need all my fruit trees and bushes planted so I can see what the space looks like once the bottom of the garden has been turned over to the feathered friends. The fruit trees will be transplanted to form the mini-orchard.Progress will be mapped here and in the forums, but you'll find all the relevant links at http://www.microholding.co.uk/ just as soon as we make a start."},
{"title": "Missive Concluding, Funds Clearing...", "date": "Wednesday 6 April 2011", "text": "Welcome to Frugaldom!As many of you will know, on 2nd February, we were served notice to remove ourselves from this rented farm cottage. I was away visiting family when I received the news, so it kind of put the dampeners on the visit, to say the least. To be honest, it dropped like a bombshell and took me a couple of weeks for the news to finally sink in - we'd had no real reason for being asked to move.Househunting is hard, especially when you have livestock, a tight budget and a deadline to meet, so we started our search. Unfortunately, that same week, the car broke down - cylinderhead - and was deemed to be a non-economical repair, thus scrapped. That left us partially stranded, as son works fulltime and needs his car for getting about the place. We're off the beaten track, so no such thing as buses passing nearby - cows and sheep, yes, but not buses.On the 8th February, we managed to get a lift from a neighbour and went to view a small flat that we thought might be suitable as a stop gap. Moving swiftly on... least said, soonest mended. We soon found ourselves pouring over rental agents' websites at anything within a 15 mile radius of son's workplace. Location isn't a problem for H or me, as we both work from home, but petrol prices dictate that son needs to be within an affordable travelling distance of work - it's not on a bus route, either.A full two weeks passed, phoning agents, phoning private landlords, phoning anyone we could think of who might have a suitable property to rent. Then, on Wednesday 16th February we spotted a listing in the 'for sale' section. It was one of those moments where everyone just looks at one another and each knows what the other is thinking... we could maybe afford to buy that!Thursday 17th February, still without any transport, we found ourselves hitching a lift from the neighbour again to do a 30 mile round trip to view the cottage. It was pouring rain, it was miles of single track road, it didn't bode well for us when we were almost run off the road by a tractor! But view the property, we did. The house in question had lain empty for two years, through two of the worst winters we have experienced in southwest Scotland. You can imagine the state of the place... but then we stepped outside of the soggy, wet kitchen and into the rain-drenched back yard ... and saw the full potential of what almost quarter of an acre of partially walled garden, complete with stream running along the bottom, could offer us!Buying property in Scotland is very different to how things are done elsewhere, so our first port of call the next morning was to our lawyer's to have them inform the agents of our interest in the property. Before any legal offer could be made we had to provide evidence that we could fund the purchase along with proof of identity. This takes a bit of time but we managed it within 48 hours.We made a few preliminary enquiries, obtained the Home Report and read the gruesome details. At this point, I might add, NEVER trust what it says in a Home Report - query EVERYTHING you aren't sure of. Only then can you avoid most nasty surprises. The Internet is the most glorious tool ever, as we were soon able to establish that the cottage in question was NOT, as described, circa 1880 and it was NOT, as described, connected to mains sewage. These are pretty relevant points that need to be considered if you are thinking of parting with your life's savings.Within about an hour, we had established that the building was at least early 19th Century and that it was, in fact, a Listed building! All of this aside, we still called the lawyer back the same day and asked them to make a verbal offer on our behalf, reflecting these salient points. Of course, that took us into the weekend, so we had to wait. Prospective househunters should note that most things regarding property sales in Scotland are carried out by the legal profession.Over that first weekend, we decided to go all out in our bid to buy ourselves a property rather than rent. Prices are tumbling around us, they could tumble further, but we hadn't the time to wait for that: it was now or never.Monday became Day 1 of what I called my 45 Day challenge. That was how long we had remaining before our lease was terminated. By day 2, our initial offer had been rejected with the seller looking for at least £5,000 more. We simply couldn't find another £5,000.00... In the morning of day 3 we spoke to the lawyer and gave her our bottom line - the absolute limit our budget could stand. In the afternoon of day 3, we learned later that our second verbal offer had been conditionally accepted, so we then needed to gather together all our paperwork and meet the lawyer to discuss the formal offer. (I should add that our lawyer was already aware of our financial situation.) That's when we discovered that the sale of the house was subject to approval by the Office of the Public Guardian. This means we had to apply in writing for permission to buy the house and allow a 21-day period for any objections that may be raised. The 21 day period expired on Wednesday 30th March 2011. This is now Day 45 of our 'challenge' and we are unable to move out of here tomorrow. However, we did receive a copy of the stamped approval from the OPG, followed by the Qualified Acceptance. We went and paid for our cottage at lunchtime today! Missive being concluded, funds being cleared, keys and title deeds are already with our lawyer.As of next weekend, our very own microholding project will begin.http://www.microholding.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Still Playing a Waiting Game", "date": "Sunday 3 April 2011", "text": "I Hate These Waiting Games!Somewhere in between realisation dawning that you have a house move ahead of you, the excitement of house hunting, property viewing, finding your ideal 'forever' home, making an offer, having a verbal acceptance and then awaiting the final 'Qualified Acceptance', there seems to be an awful lot of waiting about, mostly while being unable to actually 'do' anything.This is the stage we are at now - awaiting final 'Qualified Acceptance' to make everything legal. Then we'll be waiting to wave bye-bye to our hard earned, battled-to-protect, savings. It feels good knowing that the cash will be swapped for something tangible, like a house, but the waiting is definitely the sting in the tail.The process here in Scotland is slightly different to that elsewhere. We have to have indisputable evidence that all the finances are in place, ready to pay up, before being able to make a legal offer on any property. It doesn't matter if you're applying for a mortgage or buying outright, the process involves time and patience with most of the time spent in 'pre-buying' mode. As soon as the deal is done, however, it's wham, bam, thank you mam, here's your hat, what's your hurry, you're the proud owner of a house, now clear off and go live in it. This is probably why so few property programmes ever feature Scotland as their chosen location. There's none of this making an offer then the house being taken off the market while waiting for all the paperwork, funding confirmations, technicalities and legalities. Oh no, the fun starts here right from day one, because only a lawyer can make a 'real' offer and only once a house is legally 'sold' can it be safely taken off the market. It's flat out right to the finish and the winner isn't always the best horse on the day.The above is a very sketchy and non-professional description of how the property market works in Scottish law. Don't take my word for it, research it thoroughly before even considering buying in Scotland. By all means, have the estate agent note your interest in your chosen property, but swat up on the legalities well before proceeding any further than drooling over your copy of 'MacProperty Porn'.I may have time, but patience is sometimes in rather short supply here! I guess we should be grateful for the fact that, as soon as we have the appropriate signatures on the appropriately dotted lines, we are pretty much sure that we have a house, without fear of being 'gazzumped', if that's the correct spelling, but it's still a waiting game - no getting away from that.The Scottish buying process may seem quick to some - house sales can complete in under a month here - but being 'in limbo' between one's lease expiring on a rented property and getting one's hands on the keys of a newly purchased abode requires some fine tuning. I'm not very finely tuned - so we are running out of time. With only four more days remaining of our official rental agreement, the possibility of having bought our 'forever' home in time to make the move has all but evaporated. Mind you, this situation is probably more to do with the fact that, only 8 weeks ago, we had absolutely no intentions of moving house, far less pouring all our savings into buying one.We've sought an extension to the lease - left in the hands of the estate agent - we've done everything possible to make the property purchase straightforward, all our paperwork has been completed,  surveys inspected, local searches done, funds in place ready for the transfer... and still we await those final, crucial signatures that will enable us to own a house. Trouble is, the house we would love to own isn't quite err... habitable, shall we say? If I'm 100% honest, we have only seen inside it on one, brief occasion on a rainy, dull, March day. Some may find this shocking, others might understand the concept of, 'just knowing'.So, what's a girl to do when the landlord wants them out ASAP, there are hens, ducks, all their housing, a greenhouse, a patio and a garden shed to be moved and a whole house to be packed up and transported 15 miles along the road, most of that being single track? Yes, I thought so too... it's just another day in Frugaldom. The bread is baking, the washing is on the line and I'm making a trifle! The garden here is quickly being completely 'un-gardened' and there's absolutely no point in worrying about it. The rent's paid for another month and the 2 months notice period will soon have disappeared into the annals of time. What are they going to do? Take me out in the lane and shoot me? I think not.Fate lends a helping hand at every turn. To write down everything that has happened here since start of 2011 would be more like writing a novel, so I won't. Suffice to say, it isn't the actual buying of a house or moving house that's the cause of undue stress, it's all the other crap that life throws at you in between times. Logistics aside, no amount of money can pave the way for a smooth journey through life, so why worry? Frugal living does not limit the number of occurances of events beyond our control. It might help prevent some of those that might, otherwise, have been beyond our financial control, but it does't fend off fate.Money cannot make the world go round, nor can it stop it turning. We simply need to make the most of what we have without impacting, too much, on others.Life is life, in all its forms, and I guess we should count our blessings and make ourselves more aware of our immediate surroundings, be it friends, family or location. Only then can we prepare ourselves to grasp any opportunity and appreciate everythig that each of our individual lives has to offer. Frustration aside, life is simply a waiting game that we all need to play. But life is also about being on the lookout for opportunities. By some strange twist of fate, events have a way of shaping our futures, leading us blindly along unfamiliar routes, but it is only by experiencing such, that are we truly able to see the otherwise hidden opportunities that lie all around us, sitting quietly, playing the same waiting game we do. They are waiting for us to make our next move!"},
{"title": "Plans for Filming the new Microholding", "date": "Friday 1 April 2011", "text": "Microholding could become the next 'big thing' and we want to see it happen.With more and more people getting back to basics, growing their own fruit and vegetables, rearing garden hens, foraging and preserving, there has never been a better time to start planning to create your very own microholding. (It's like a tiny smallholding.)Frugaldom is about getting back to nature and becoming as self-sufficient as possible, so that means growing as much as possible by way of fruit, vegetables and herbs plus rearing poultry in sufficient numbers to produce enough eggs for home use and surplus for selling to help cover costs. I would keep things like bees and goats, but practicalities don't permit.However our garden turns out, we want to be able to share the trials and tribulations of setting everything up with other followers of frugal living.We opted for artificial incubation for hatching out eggs from our own hens, ducks and quail. The joys of those newly hatched chicks were shared with everyone on our website, by way of this inexpensive webcam and regular updates.  Now, however, we are planning on creating our first real microholding and would love to be able to feature part of what that entails on a live video feed. Not being technically minded, I haven't a clue where to start. As yet, I don't even know how to get a video uploaded onto You Tube!My big plan is to set up a system of webcams that can be used in the incubator, to monitor the hatching process, and then transferred to the brooder, for observing the chicks. But I'd also like the cameras to reach further afield, to provide a view of the garden hens and any wildlife we can encourage. This is all well and good, but how do I get it all to stream through the Internet via the website? I guess that's my next challenge - learning the technicalities of setting up and running a live webcam system and doing it all on a shoestring budget. I thought the set featured looked quite reasonably priced and would really appreciate any feedback.

{"title": "No More Google Ad Sense for Frugaldom!", "date": "Saturday 26 March 2011", "text": "Bang Goes Another Supposedly Great Idea!I joined Google Ad Sense programme several years ago and have never, ever been able to work out how anyone could earn the thousands of pounds or dollars that others purport to be earning. So, when I started my frugal entrepreneur's challenge, I decided to ramp up the efforts to generate some extra income by increasing traffic to my website, monetising my blog, encouraging new members to the frugaldom forums and, sooner or later, getting to grips with social media and online networking. That way, the chances of anyone clicking on a sponsored link and generating a few penies for the site are greatly increased - that's how I understand it - and I get a bunch of people who are iterested in frugal living. But we're the wrong types of people - advertisers seem to hate us because we simply don't spend enough!Since 22nd February, I have been monitoring my Google Ad Sense account closely, ensuring I had made the most of every available opportunity, checking I had the links added properly, even adding search facilities to the new pages. The day to day 'estimated earnings' had leapt from an average 16p per day (while doing nothing with the pages) to £3 - £4. (On one particular day, it reached £12, but I reckon that's the day that got me 'deactivated'.) It's still not startling, but great to see there was the opportunity to earn, once I learned a bit more and took the time to produce the articles for the pages. All of this, I was discussing with others (who are also doing the 'earn a little extra' challenge) in the frugaldom forums. Well, apparently that is the very worst thing to do! Having people check out your pages and links either by invite, suggestion or even indirect hint is against terms and conditions.Late last night, I did a final check of my email and discovered that my Ad Sense account has been deactivated! According to the email, \"...your AdSense account poses a risk of generating invalid activity.\" So that's that! There is absolutely no point in appealing their decision, as I don't know how else to promote webpages other than by telling people what's on them and asking them to bookmark/use my search!After spending hours and hours on pages, creating content, finding the right ad types, generating links, testing everything and doing my best to put together a website that can actually pay for itself, I fell into the old trap of trusting a third party! I trusted Google Ad Sense and was felled in my first month of really trying to make it work. Worse still, I am yet to discover the slightest idea about how people earn fortunes from their websites using nothing more than Google Ad Sense. I, for one, will be opting out of using that particular company as my prefered search engine. I will also need to transfer this blog, as I'm still relying entirely on Google to provide this 'free' service, too. What an idiot I have been!Join us in the free forums (also, stupidly, entrusted to a third party) to discuss this and other issues/topics/subjects that are of interest to normal, everyday, trying-to-make-ends-meet people."},
{"title": "Archie Sparrow's Book of Useful Tips to Beat the Recession...", "date": "Friday 25 March 2011", "text": "With Baling Twine!'The Tight B*st*rd's Guide to Running a Smallholding.'I have just received my copy of Dave Dealy's book, compliments of the great author, himself, complete with his own, personal autograph! (Cheers, Dave!) It dropped through my letterbox about half an hour ago, despite the postman having got here one hour ago. My 'Amazon' link, in the hope someone clicks on it to buy their own copy, is HERE. It takes 'Paul the post' all his time to negotiate the swirling mass of hens and ducks that patrol our garden gate. Phoebe, our white duck, now gets so excited that she has taken to laying her egg under the front hedge, just in case she misses his visit! Our feathered army struts, quacks, clucks and cock-a-doodle-doos in anticipation of his arrival every morning, in the hope that he'll have brought them a biscuit - he always does. (Thanks, Paul.) I do feel a bit sorry for the relief postmen when they need to venture into our garden and up to our front door. They could pay dearly for that. You can clearly tell that the other postie (the one who always wears shorts) is a shade wary by the way he legs it along the path, throws the mail with dart like precision, then dashes off before Inky grabs anything that looks edible!I also feel sorry for our feathered battalion on Sundays; they haven't quite grasped the concept of a 6-day-week.Anyhow, on this warm and sunny March morning, this little book arrived. I SHOULD be working. I SHOULD be out in the garden, dismantling the old poultry houses that we converted from the delapidated kennels but, instead, I found myself flicking through the pages of this amusing (and perfectly sane, in my opinion) book. It's illustrated, so that doesn't help - I needed to look at all the pictures! In fact, it made me laugh just looking at the cover! Part of my afternoon spent in the garden yesterday entailed winding up all the string from my pea and bean canes. It's perfectly good string, I can reuse it!Duty calls, so I need to get myself back into work mode, but rest assured, this evening will be early to bed with Dave Dealy and his useful tips to beat the recession... with baling string!All will be revealed as soon as I've finished reading the book. On completion, I shall be more than ready to plunge headlong into microholding which, as you should all know, will use much less baling string than smallholding. For a start, we don't need a tractor, so nothing to tie onto that.Must dash - the bread's almost ready for rescuing. See you all in the Frugaldom Forums, later than expected. Oops! :)Edited in: I have now read the tales of Archie Sparrow and his baler twine. This is a really amusing little book with some  great ideas, some not so great ideas and some downright silly ideas - but baling twine's the name of the game, no matter what. I know it's only April and we haven't, yet, reached Easter but my suggestion is to get yourself a copy of this book, knit yourself some wrappings and trappings from baler twine and put it all away until Christmas, when you're bound to know someone who deserves a copy. Before wrapping it, make sire that you have collected enough baling twine from your nearest farmer or horsey friends to enable the lucky recipient the pleasure of trying out all the great things you can do with the string. better still, knit them a string bag and pack the whole lot in there. I think I might try that one myself... knitting baler twine shopping bags!This isn't just for the farming fraternity, this is for anyone who pursues a frugal lifestyle, aspires to the good life or, even, just knows someone else from whom they can cadge some baling string!Order your copy here."},
{"title": "Absolutely Fabulous, Frugal Spring-like Day", "date": "Thursday 24 March 2011", "text": "What a Difference a Day Makes!We've had a gorgeous, warm, sunny day, here in Frugaldom. I hope the weather has been similar elsewhere.With 10 fruit trees to prune, dig up & pot before moving, I still ended up spending, but with good reason and without costing me a penny. I caved and ordered two lots of multi-coloured flexi tubs using Amazon vouchers that have accrued over the months from gifts, points redemptions and Topcashback. I'm a happy bunny, as these will all be reuseable after we've transferred the mini-orchard to what will become the new Frugaldom garden. <!--google_ad_client = \"pub-0449214954151758\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;google_ad_format = \"468x15_0ads_al_s\";google_ad_channel =\"\";google_color_border = \"333333\";google_color_bg = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_link = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_url = \"999999\";google_color_text = \"CCCCCC\";//-->We've managed to get a fair bit of the current garden dug and transferred into pots, ready for 'the big move', so I decided to do a photo update blog post. This way, those of you who have followed our progress over the past few years can see what 'un-gardening' looks like, after all the hard work that went into creating a garden in the first place.Sparrows on the archLast year, we finally managed to get an arch for the gate. It's been great fun for the many birds we have visiting our garden. I had planted honeysuckle either side of it, so that had climbed a fair way up it by winter, before it was pruned back. The plants had just started to waken from winter hibernation when it had to be dug up, but I think they should survive the transition period in their big pots. ﻿ The de-arched garden gate﻿ Along with the honeysuckle, I had cut some willow withies from a friend's forest, so these were starting to root. The plan was to have a willow archway with the honeysuckle intertwined. However, it's not to be, for now. As of this afternoon, this is how the gate looks.Inside the gate, we had constructed a large, deep bed, using four, 8ft long sleepers, sectioned into two beds, each seperated by a wooden walkway. Hens dust bathing in the raised bedSlowly clearing the cornerThe square foot garden has proven to be a very productive corner , especially after employing the square foot gardening method of growing fantastic vegetables. We grew huge cauliflowers and amazing broccoli, amongst everything else. Now, I've had to rip out the winter cabbages, early carrots and the last of the parsnips, as it all needs to be cleared prior to moving out of here. It was quite a quick job to do, what with all the little helpers of the feathered variety! After a few dry days, it has ended up looking ready to plant up again! The wooden walk has been removed and will probably be chopped for firewood to use in 'George', our logburner. The rich soil that's left behind will be used to backfill the holes where we dig out the fruit trees.<!--google_ad_client = \"pub-0449214954151758\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;google_ad_format = \"468x15_0ads_al_s\";google_ad_channel =\"\";google_color_border = \"333333\";google_color_bg = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_link = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_url = \"999999\";google_color_text = \"CCCCCC\";//-->In another corner, we had completely gutted out all the brambles, bricks and rubbish to create a growing space for potatoes, herbs, globe artichokes, peas and beans, all of this around a cherry tree. Like the square foot garden, this was also fenced off to protect it from marauding chickens and ducks. Aother corner clearedThis corner has also now gone, barring the cherry tree. With luck, the new trugs will arrive quickly, enabling us to make a start on digging up the remaining trees. I've already received the despatch notice after ordering them only this afternoon! Impressive! The telltale garden canes and fence stabs are all that's left to show what was once there. It took two years to cultivate the corner and about an hour to undo all the work. It's quite sad seeing it all disappearing so quickly, but we have the prospect of a whole new beginning, once we move. In this respect, the landlord's decision to serve notice on us has served us pretty well, thank you very much. Fate is beginning to lend a helping hand, once more, despite the heap of ill-fortune we have had to face this year, so far.﻿ Joey, at back, distinguished by his tail curl, and Phoebe.﻿As well as the sudden losses of one third of our household income, the old car (it died and had to go to the big carpark in the sky) and our rented home, we hace also suffered the loss of one of our trio of ducks - dear Monica passed away at the start of the year. We never did find out the cause of her death, although there had been a scuffle involving some of the chickens. We suspect there may have been another weasle in the garden, with the ensuing 'battle' encouraging the cockerels to attack. Joey and Phoebe have been fine, and are now back to normal, waddling about the garden with their comical, clumsy walks. Pheobe has taken to laying her daily egg beneath the hedge in the front garden.Silkie 'Chick'Our hens all freerange but, despite their freedom, they are normally to be found wherever we are - following us about the garden, digging wherever we dig, squabbling over any creepy crawlies or worms that we uncover. Silkie Chick (original name for a Silkie hen, NOT!) is one of the household favourites. She was the only chick to hatch from half a dozen eggs in the incubator. We'd had a lengthy power cut and had given up all hope of anything hatching. However, I left the machine switched on, just in case. Lo and behold, out popped a solitary Silkie chick. The name has stuck, even although she was two years old this month.  In that time, she has paid her own way handsomely.Willows and fruit bushesIn the furthest corner of the garden, we had our work cut out right from the start. This corner didn't really exist when we arrived here in November 2008. It must have been some sort of dumping ground. Out of here, we dug oil drums, a roll of fencing wire, an old mattress, a couple of bikes, the remains of a long-forgotten barbecue, a sackload of broken glass, a broken compost bin (we nursed it back to health and put it back into use) and hundreds of bricks. The bricks were salvaged to lay a base for the garden shed, but they'll need to be replaced in their original positions before we leave. Our landlords have not been forthcoming in their letting us know the condition they want the garden left in, although we've been well-informed by several people that we need to remove everything in order to claim back our deposit.I'm not too sure how we'll put this back to the way it was, if the landlords insist! Fortunately, I have the original photos for reference, but I don't really fancy re-hiring a van and driver to return to the council tip, where most of the stuff was taken. (At our expense, I might add!) By clearing all this lovely space, we managed to fit in three vegetable beds, space for beans and peas, a row of sweetcorn and some more globe artichokes. Strawberries, fruit and flowersWe also erected a small greenhouse, which has been along this road from one house to the next. We are the third house in the road to have made use of what was once part of a neighbour's conservatory. It's built on a raised, slabbed patio, which has been brilliant for growing tubs of salad stuff, courgettes and cucumbers. All of this will be removed, as we transfer everything to the new place. For now, it is being used as secure storage for all the pots of fruit bushes, herbs, flowers and trees that have already been removed from the main garden. ﻿﻿ One of our Lavender Araucana hens﻿﻿ Once again, we have plenty of helpers offering to scratch their way through the remains of this previously productive corner garden. Even the Araucanas were investigating every turn of earth, every moved fence post and every pot filled. At one point, this one ended up sitting in the wheelbarrow and was wheeled around the garden with rescued soil that we were using for filling in holes. I hate to think what will happen when we attempt to sow the grass seed!﻿ Dismantling the hen runs﻿ Our hens and ducks are all secured at night in pens along the back of the house. When we first arrived here, these pens were delapidated dog runs, complete with derelict kennels, so a great deal of time and effort went into refurbishing the wooden houses, mending posts, rewiring them and renovating the gates. We also ended up incorporating some flat-pack hen houses, purchased in haste while we prepared for my daughter's wedding. (We couldn't go away for the full day and leave the feathered friends to fend for themselves, so we forked out a small fortune to ensure hen and duck safety.)Spurred on by the incredible weather today, dismantling of the first of the pens began in earnest. It will take a good few more dry and sunny days to complete this task, but everything that can be, will be salvaged for reusing at the new place. Bernice, one of our Pekin hensOur Pekins relished the demolition work today. Bernice was particularly interested in any place where a brick was being lifted and could hardly contain herself with excitement. She squawked and chattered away to herself for hours, whilst digging and scratching in the fresh earth. That was, until she suddenly realised that she needed to lay her egg! She scuttled off at a number of knots, jumped into a box, dropped said egg and was back into the muck within minutes! Pekins are fantastic little bantams. They are so friendly and tame that they think nothing of hopping onto your lap whenever you're sitting in the garden. They're twice as quick if you dare try to sneak a biscuit without sharing it with them! The downside of these tiny, feathery, clockwork looking toy chickens is that their eggs are tiny! They do make great pets, though, and have a tendancy to sit and brood anything in the hope of hatching chicks. (The Silkies are the same, in this respect.)That's the story, so far, of the preparations for our next big adventure. Hopefully, we'll be away and settled into our new place before summer begins and we will have enough time to make a start on the new microholding project. Hopefully, too, we'll have plenty of time to breed a few more hens, quails and ducks. It's getting rather exciting, as there's probably enough space to keep another of my favourite species - horses and ponies - but I have promised myself that there'll be no more of those. I can't, however, promise that there'll never be any more pets.Keep up with the progress in our free frugal living forums. I'll eventually get around to reinstating more of the Frugaldom website and then the whole process will begin again - this time for REAL!"},
{"title": "The Decadence of a Frugaldom Mother's Day", "date": "Thursday 24 March 2011", "text": "DON'T FORGET MOTHERS' DAY SUNDAY 3rd APRIL 2011Today began early - the sun was shining before 7am, the hens and ducks wanted their freedom and I wanted my coffee. The computer gets switched on as soon as I get up each morning, that way it's booted up and ready to go when I come back indoors from seeing to the feathered friends in the garden (and collect any early eggs).While waiting for the kettle to boil, I check online for work updates from clients and make a start on sifting through the invariable pile of 'spam' in search of anything else work-related. I don't usually get very far in the process before the kettle boils, so that's what takes me up to breakfast time.This morning was glorious, so breakfast was taken on the back door step, shared with the chickens and ducks, I might add! But it gave me time to get into my woman zone and reflect on the contents of most of the 'newsy' type emails that lay in this morning's in-box. They were mostly reminding me of Mothers' Day, in some way, shape or form. I even posted a 'motherly' response on someone's blog update, reiterating what a paranoid lot we can be when it comes to our offspring. I omitted to add the fact that I was just as paranoid about watching my other 'baby', a horse, go out on the tracks back in the good old days when horses, ponies and racing were my chosen NOT SO FRUGAL frugal hobbies.So, what do women, mothers in this particular case, really want? I've never been one for cosmetics, perfumes, cut flowers or grand gestures. Most would call me 'down to earth', if a little eccentric (replace with whichever word you prefer), in my outlook and lifestyle, so helpfulness, usefulness and functionality are more appreciated here than fripperies. But then I began the morning's work, updating a few bits and pieces on the web pages that will, one day, prove my worth as a frugal entrepreneur. I was looking at CUT FLOWERS and thinking they looked gorgeous! EEK! Is this a true reflection of how age is catching up with me? It suddenly trips me up, leaving me sprawled in a heap of, dare I say it, 'normality'? I just don't 'do' pink! Or, at least, I didn't! But I have to admit that I do collect 'Posy Points' and I do make the most of free delivery and free chocolates! This is a brilliant site!Back on the trail of what women want - I'm practical, as well as frugal, but extravagances and treats are appreciated. Contemplating what I do from day to day, I came up with the following list::Look after the poultryBake - bread, cakes and biscuitsGrocery shopping & cook mealsDust & vacuumDo laundryCompute, write, blog, log data, research & earn a meagre income from itWork in the gardenSee friends, neighbours and family regularly Find the best ways to spend less moneyDIY - let's face it, we all need to be able to DIY if we want the frugal house of our dreams, don't we?I have a good life, I enjoy it, I don't hanker after riches, foreign travel, fine jewellery or designer clothing. I happen to like my green wellies (not Hunter brand) and my waxed jacket (not a Barbour). I like my checked scarf (not Burberry) and I like my secondhand bargains and charity shop treasures. So, when my family asks, 'what would you like for Mother's Day', I have a list of extravagances that could be suitably fitting for my chosen lifestyle...Some hatching eggs from purebreed poultry or, better still, half a dozen point-of-lay hens.A 'homemade' cookie stamp so nobody forgets that they're all home made.Bargain groceries with a delivery service or else a huge voucher for our local Sainsbury's.A 3-minute cupcake maker, so there are cakes to have with the coffee during the break between vacuuming and dusting.The box set of Absolutely Fabulous - so I can watch an episode when waiting for the washing machine to complete the cycleSome more people taking part in our frugal challenges - I can't believe the country is in austerity mode and yet so few homemakers want to share their frugal lifestyle tips - and several new sign-ups for Affiliate Window, so I can earn that last £7 needed to allow me to actually claim a payment.Compost (lots of it), vegetable seeds, fruit bushes or fruit trees to help quickly increase the food growing capacity of the new garden, once we move house next month, plus peanuts for feeding the wild birds.A good, solid garden bench for seating visitors when they visit for a cuppa and a catch-up. It's far nicer being able to sit outside in the garden during good weather.I wish my entire family, all friends, acquaintances, colleagues and, even, passing strangers would consider using a site like Topcashback, so they, too, can claim back a small fortue on almost all of their online shopping. The cyberdosh soon mounts up over the year and then it's up to you what you buy with the resulting cash or Amazon vouchers.A subscription to the Renovate Alerts, so we can watch for a really cheap fixy-up that could become someone's dream home.I think the above items tie in nicely with my chosen lifestyle of frugality and the quest to create our very own, mortgage free microholding. I can't think of anything else I'd like, unless I renage on my anti-pink and anti-cut flowers deal to opt for the bouquet plus extra chocolates, hand delivered by all the family who would bring dinner with them and then clear up afterwards. Then again, it just can't happen that way, not with five generations in this family! I guess what I'm trying to say is that family spirit and camaraderie can be lost in commercialism and consumerism. Gifts are all well and good, but it's remembering who and where your family are that counts most. Let them all know that they mean something to you. Don't leave it until some made up 'celebratory' day in the consumerist-society-driven calendar.What would YOU really like for Mothers' Day?"},
{"title": "Making Ends Meet with Social Media & Virtual Networking", "date": "Wednesday 23 March 2011", "text": "SHONA PROPHETT onSOCIAL MEDIA and NETWORKINGFrugaldom and microholding are all very well, but we still need to make ends meet. Bills won't stop arriving simply because we are moving house, nor will they decrease. In reality, they are going to double, temporarily (again), while we make the transition from one house to the next. Keep in mind that we have had to dig up everything from this garden in preparation for the move to a place that has no garden at the moment. 2011 could be a completely non-productive gardening year. But we still need to eat, pay for the keep of the poultry and have enough income to make a start on creating a cost-effective garden system that will suit our needs in years to come. (We also need to make the house habitable.)So where, exactly, does social media and networking fit into all of this?Simple! I need to be able to communicate with other people. I need to be able to spread the word of who we are, what we are about and how we are going about what we're doing.  I need FREE help while making the transition from the rented house to our very own  fixy-up, forever house. The bottom line is that I  need to generate an income from my time spent online - and that means being a virtual socialite, deploying tactics that can net me cold, hard, cash. I need to be SHOWN A PROFIT and that profit needs to be sustainable while other sources of income are out of action.Shona Prophett is essential for this task, as we can't simply 'make ends meet' while renovating a house and creating a self-sustainable microholding that includes regular income generation. It needs to be a great deal more than that - it needs a supportive network of people, whose combined knowledge store can be tapped into by making the most of social media. I'll mostly be asking questions and hoping to receive helpful hints, tips and advice. But, in so doing, I am inviting answers from social media moguls who represent themselves, their businesses and their clients' businesses, so it works both ways... it's free publicity for them and lending a helping hand to the new frugal entrepreneurs of this virtual world.There's also the fact that I've now set up The Microholding Daily - a free, online newspaper that's generated from all the content linked to my preferred list on Twitter. You could be part of that, if you play your Tweets right. Join us in the Frugaldom forums if you'd like to discuss this further."},

Smallholding is completely out of the question, as we just aren't in the financial position to look at properties with that amount of land - buying is expensive, renting can be extortionate - so it's microholding for us.Microholding should provide a semblance of self-sufficiency with a lifestyle sustained by working from home. And before anyone cocks an eyebrow or utters a sigh, we are NOT on benefits! It always amazes me the way some people automatically assume that anyone attempting to follow 'the good life' must be shirkers or social security leeches! This is completely untrue. Yes, we enjoy gardening and growing our own fruit and vegetables wherever possible. Yes, we're comfortable sitting at home earning our crust in whatever way we can. Yes, we bake our own bread and make our own laundry detergent. Yes, we keep poultry for eggs anf yes, we sell our surplus in an attempt to offset all the associated costs. We also keep long hours and have to budget to within an inch of our lives to afford an otherwise 'normal' life. Self employment means no sick leave, no redundancy pay-outs or unemployment benefit if things go wrong and no automatic pension plan. But it means freedom to live and work to meet whatever goals we set ourselves. As long as I can afford to live debt free and cover the costs of my National Insurance payments, I'll be happy. It's all relative!<!--google_ad_client = \"pub-0449214954151758\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;google_ad_format = \"468x15_0ads_al_s\";google_ad_channel =\"\";google_color_border = \"333333\";google_color_bg = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_link = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_url = \"999999\";google_color_text = \"CCCCCC\";//-->In order to take up the challenge of saving enough to buy a house without a mortgage, I began costcutting and debt-busting around 10 years ago. It has been difficult, it has been fraught with setbacks, there have been major expenses to meet throughout that time, including daughter's 21st birthday, an engagement party, a wedding, my son's 21st and, along the way, trying to pay off previous debts and welcoming not one, but two grandchildren into the extending family. There have also been 8 house moves stretching between Aberdeenshire and Suffolk. We want our next move to be the last for many years. The family is now grown and settled into married life and work here in southwest Scotland, so the ultimate move will still see us living and working in the same area.Becoming debt free is a most liberating experience. From thereonin, it is all about saving, so the frugal lifestyle does not stop when the bank balance moves out of the red and the reminder letters stop arriving. On the contrary, becomig debtfree urges you on to squeeze the budget even tighter in a bid to save as much as possible. We are still several years from having achieved our goals, but fate, as always,can throw a spanner in the works at any time. That spanner was the arrival of our notice to quit this house.We have been happy here. When we arrived, the house had been empty for months. It was extremely cold and damp, there was no garden to speak of and the roof leaked - badly! However, we overcame each problem gradually - the landlords eventually fixed the roof a full 20 months after we moved in here! I have a full diary of photographs and updates of our progress turning the 'garden' into something productive. It was beginning to look like we might even achieve our dream of microholding, despite being in yet another rental.I have to admit, the mile and a quarter long driveway that's here being lined with all sorts of foraging wonders has served us well. I have a year's supply of jams, jellies and wine stored, much of it made from free fruit, berries and flowers. I also make fresh lemon curd from our freerange garden hens' eggs. These are the things we can most enjoy about frugaldom - the release from the pressure to buy into a consumerist society. Make do and mend, preserve, bake, grow as much fruit and as many vegetables as you can and make space for some hens, ducks and/or quail. I even compiled a list of 101 things to do with eggs!<!--google_ad_client = \"pub-0449214954151758\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;google_ad_format = \"468x15_0ads_al_s\";google_ad_channel =\"\";google_color_border = \"333333\";google_color_bg = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_link = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_url = \"999999\";google_color_text = \"CCCCCC\";//-->Costcutting is the most important factor affecting how much we can afford to save. Apart from the obvious things, like monitoring electricity use, cutting down on transport costs, sharing with friends, only buying what you need rather than what you want and always shopping online through a generous and reliable cashback site, I have found that grocery shopping is, by far, the easiest place to economise on a regular basis. Thanks to bulk buying, batch cooking, shopping for bargains and growing/producing our own, we have succeeded in honing our grocery spending skills to an average of £1 per day per person. I find this to be a comfortable amount. We eat well, the cupboards, fridge and freezer are always full and there's always a variety to our diet. OK, so it completely cuts out fast food, takeaways and eating out but once you are attuned to such frugal shopping, there's always a way of getting more for your money.One side effect of all this frugal living is that it's both infectious and contageous! Numerical OCD (Obsessive, Compulsive Disorder) is thought of more as a behaviour trait than anything more sinister. In fact, it is to be welcomed. If there's a debt outstanding of £1,009.53, then the urge is to clear off that extra £9.53 as soon as possible. Likewise with the savings, once you reach that stage. If your account says £89.99 then you NEED to round it up to the next hundred or thousand, depending how far advanced you are with your challenge. Life, in all ots forms, is a challenge, so why not make them fun?My first challenge was to clear individual debts, getting rid of the smallest ones first and tackling the most expensive ones. Prior to the Bank of England base rate hitting 0.5% two years ago, I played the credit card switch - transferring balances onto 0% cards and paying debts off faster. Following my own debt free moment, I continued with this 'game', transferring card funds into high interest accounts purely to earn a few pounds more, whilst always paying back the minimum until such times as the entire balance became due to avoid charges or interest. It used to work - it doesn't any more. To this day, I swear on the life of my cashback credit card and look forward, every year, to my payment. It isn't much, but it's free money and that's what I love about it!The day of juggling savings to utilise the highest interest rates has well and truly gone, for now. For the past two years, it has been a prime time for shifting secured debt, like mortgages, or else shifting high interest debt onto mortgages with the potential there to clear them quicker and at less cost overall. Sadly, savings in the bank just are not worth it for now. With inflation at 4.4% (probably much higher for followers of the frugaldom lifestyle), money in the bank earning anything less than 5.5% gross is LOSING you money.Being served notice to quit this house has been a blessing in disguise. We'd become too comfortable with our frugal lifestyle while saving, we had failed to realise the true damage we could be inviting through lost interest. Worse, still, we had already lost one third of our income to these hard times of recession and I suspect there could be much worse still to come. Receiving notice gave us the kick up the backside that reminded us that life is a challenge and it has to be met head on - nothing ventured, nothing gained. And that, dear readers, is how we have found ourselves in the position of buying a little house with a big garden and starting from scratch. It will leave us with no financial security net and very little guaranteed income for the foreseeable future. It's a full renovation job, both inside and out, but it's a challenge we're finally ready to meet, come what may.I find that ordinary folks like us don't get given much of anything, let alone luck. Take the weather, for example. I feel as if we're living in one of the coldest, wettest areas of Scotland at the moment - not that there are many dry and warm parts - so that's always conspiring against us. Can you tell it's raining here, yet again? But in a funny old way, we have turned around the ill-fortune of facing impending homelessness to a positive thing. We are embarking on our next big adventure, sailing on the winds of hope and then paddling like mad to stay afloat when the reality of this all kicks in. I recently began a new challenge - find a house and move in 45 days - but we won't be able to do that. So now what? We have requested an extention to our vacating these premises date and, in the meantime, we are gathering together every single penny that we can in preparation to exchanging the lot for a fixy-up.We count ourselves lucky in that we are debt free (for now), in reasonably good health (wear and tear permitting) and not living in constant fear of the next natural disaster or war zone.My thoughts are with all of those unfortunate people around the world who find themselves in war zones, famines, natural disasters or dictatorships that offer no escape to freedom and little sense of self-worth. May friends, family and true community spirit see you through tough times.I hope readers will join me in the Frugaldom forums, where we share hints, tips and suggestions for debt-busting, money saving, frugal living and, dare I say it, DIY!"},

The spring equinox having been and gone means that the days will gradually be lengthening and the hens will soon be in full lay.﻿ The girls have produced enough eggs to keep the household going through the winter, but there haven't been enough to warrant any regular sales.We've only got one pair of white ducks remaining with us, for the time being, but I'm already planning on having a couple more as soon as we get settled into the new house - probably Khaki Campbells or some more Indian Runner ducks, as I like both. Our solitary duck, Phoebe, is laying an egg every morning now, but I don't want to incubate/hatch any of these, as there would be no point. We need some nice new ducklings for spring, completely unrelated to Joey, our white Aylesbury X drake.Preparations for moving house are underway. We are digging up everything that we planted; it's a bit like un - gardening! Fruit bushes, apple trees, plum trees, pear trees and cherry trees - the entire mini orchard has to be moved. The crab apples have already been transplanted into large pots, as have most of the gooseberries and tayberries. There's an entire row of raspberries still to be dug, along with the blackcurrants. If the rain stays away, we should get them into pots this weekend.<!--google_ad_client = \"ca-pub-0449214954151758\";/* Basic */google_ad_slot = \"3164760665\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;//-->All of the vegetable beds have been dug over, so the hens and ducks have now been given free access to these areas, in the hope that they'll root out anything we've missed. Our miniature white Silkie hen, however, prefers to dust bath in the damp soil, so she is constantly filthy!The sleepers that surround the deep vegetable bed are being rehomed. The soil from the original square foot garden will be ideal for filling in holes after the fruit trees have been removed. It will mean raking and rolling the entire area, but I'll get some grass seed spread on it, just as soon as the hens and ducks have all been transported to their new home.The grape vine seems to be surviving relatively well, as is the Russian Vine. Not a very popular species, I know, especially for anyone with a small garden, but it will be kept well trimmed. I'd not long put an arch across the garden gate and planted honeysuckle either side, so it all needs to be carefully removed and transplanted before the plants fully recover from their winter hibernation. Bird boxes along the fence should be removed, but I've already seen bluetits flitting in and out of them on a regular basis. I have no intentions of disturbing them and am prepared to forfeit a few bird boxes in order to encourage them to continue breeding here.<!--google_ad_client = \"ca-pub-0449214954151758\";/* Basic */google_ad_slot = \"3164760665\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;//-->My longterm plan of cultivating willow had just been newly implemented when we received notice to quit this house, so I'm hoping that the withies that were planted won't mind too much if we move them again. I'm determined to have a mini willow plantation somewhere, so the next garden should be the place to start again... without fear of any landlord asking us to move.Most of what is in the greenhouse will be composted. Only the trays of lettuce seedlings will come with us, although I am desparate to get a few more seeds sown. Trouble is, we don't, yet, have an exact date for moving, so the greenhouse needs to be dismantled in readiness, as does the garden shed.The next step is to sell the surplus quail so we can dismantle their run. Japanese Coturnix Quail are very hardy little game birds! They have lived outside in a corner of our garden all year round and we're still getting a few eggs. I was amazed they survived the -16C temperatures during the hardest part (so far) of this winter. At that point, their eggs were freezing solid before I could get out to collect them in the mornings. It's still dipping below zero here first thing, but a few of the hens have continued to lay throughout winter - not bad going for what is traditionally thought of as a migratory bird. I'll probably keep about a dozen quail hens and three of the best cockerels to take to the new place, then start incubating / hatching new stock as soon as we're orgaised enough to safely run an incubator and brooder. Pity this variety of quail are known more for their laying ability than their interest in breeding!There isn't a great deal more we can do to prepare the garden for our next big move. All I can do is hope that it will be our last for many years, and that we can reliably call it home. I'm glad we didn't set down too many roots here and am now looking forward to beginning again - a whole new frugaldom project and the creation of the new microholding.Rest assured that the entire process will be well photographed and documented, once again. I now have three full years' worth of this project, including two false starts. 2011 needs to be our final startup! Wish me luck!"},
{"title": "Swatting Up, Before We Start Microholding.", "date": "Sunday 20 March 2011", "text": "<!--google_ad_client = \"ca-pub-0449214954151758\";/* Basic */google_ad_slot = \"3164760665\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;//-->10 Days and Counting...I decided to have a really lazy morning, so I went back to bed for a couple of hours, after seeing to the feathered friends and sticking a loaf into the breadmaker. It gave me time to catch up on some reading, rather than sitting at the computer or, dare I say it, doing more laundry!Yesterday, we took the new (secondhand) car for a trip out to view our prospective new (tumbledown) home. The sun was shining, so it would let us see the place in dry weather - something we weren't blessed with during the official viewing, nor were the surveyors, when they had visited.A quick look about the strip of rough, untended land that could become our next garden confirmed that it was as bad as we remembered from the first viewing! But it still had my head absolutely choc-a-bloc full of ideas and longterm plans. Microholding may soon become our entire way of life, so I'm swatting up on all the helpful information I can get, while reading all the books I can lay my hands on, without it eating into the 'house fund' or regular budget.I allowed myself the luxury of buying The Back Garden Self Sufficiency book, using some of my Amazon Vouchers 'stash'. (See my earlier post about how to earn vouchers free from Topcashback - I call these my cyberdosh earnings, as it's like online cash.) This book is very practical in nature, very easy to follow and gives concise 'how to...' information, so it's an easy read with loads of helpful information, hints, tips and suggestions, along with some simple-to-follow recipes. (We all love foraging for fruit, flowers and berries, then preserving, don't we?)Whilst we'd been out gallivanting, stopping off for coffee with friends and generally having a relaxing day, another friend had popped in at the house and dropped off some of her homemade goodies - lip gloss & bubblebath - along with a few surplus duck eggs she needed using up. My son, being a body-building, health and fitness fanatic, makes short work of almost all the eggs produced by our small flock of garden hens, so the extra duck eggs were going to be used to top up the baking. That plan, however, fell through, as beloved son decided to scramble them for his supper last night! But I digress... among the assorted contents of the bag found sitting on our doorstep was a copy of , 'It's not Easy Going Green', by Dick Strawbridge. I just had to get started on that as soon as I could. Despite being of a practical nature, it has a bit more of a story to it, so that was my choice of reading material for this morning's luxurious lie-in.So far, it's a great read. This is especialy so if I look at it as being a much grander and far more expensive version of what we're about to (hopefully) commence. I'd love to generate some of our own power and reduce our waste to almost nothing. We currently manage to fill about one bin bag per month with household rubbish, mainly plastic and polythene, but we have been doing our best at composting and recycling as much as possible, plus anything suitable gets chopped and fed to the hens.Yesterday's trip out to see what will, all going well, become our new, permanent home, was just the ticket. We're fairly rural about these parts of southwest Scotland, so the roads can be quite quiet at weekeds, apart from milking times. The house we're after has a reasonable sized garden, probably the largest I've had since renting a smallholding many years ago. Apart from being in need of complete renovation, the house could offer us tremendous potential to create a longterm home, along with our very own microholding. This, however, would need to be done on a very tight budget! Basically, it's going to be on a shoestring, if we're to succeed in avoiding any form of longterm debt.I guess that's why I'm really looking forward to reading 'Archie Sparrow's Book of Useful Tips to Beat the Recession with...Baling String' by Dave Dealy. It sounds much more in keeping with our budget. My guess is that, with a combination of this book, my assortment of twine, string and garden wire, and all those 'fandabidozy' pallets that can be salvaged locally, we should be able to DIY construct just about anything for our new microholding.Last night I lay plotting and planning all sorts of things - baling string cargo-style nets for the peas & beans, crocheted twine 'baskets' to support butternut squash and all sorts of lovely wooden items - hen houses, picket fences, trellis, raised beds, compost corners and, even, floor boards - each lovingly created from recycled 'stuff'. From what I could see from our recent visit, there's certainly plenty of 'stuff' that would, ordinarily, be dragged off and carted into a skip.With only 10 days remaining until we hear, for definite, if we'll be making the move to our dream 'home in the making', it's getting quite exciting. The garden here is slowly being dug up, as we repot as much as possible into buckets, tubs and old bins. The little greenhouse that might, one day, become my vine house, still needs dismantling, as does the shed and the hen runs, but the logistics of a move at such short notice are complicated, to say the least. We have a total of 18 days remaining of our challenge - to find a house and move within 45 days.We haven't started packing anything indoors, but in my head the plan is clear... from rental to chaos, then from chaos shall spring the 'forever' house of Frugaldom, complete with it's own microholding. After 10 years of renting an assortment of places, even if it ends up being built from pallets and held together with baler twine, I'll care not a jot! It will be home, at last.Feel free to follow the challenge of moving house and setting up a microholding online for free in the Frugaldom Forums. You'll need to register, but that's just to prevent anyone spamming the pages with utter trash that irritates me when I have to delete it. :)"},

This means we'll need to move all the fruit trees and bushes that were planted here, and that's going to be quite a task!I have the beginnings of an edible hedge of crab apples, about a dozen assorted fruit trees (all around 2m height) plus an assorted array of currant and berry bushes. Should I prune these right back before all the buds start emerging? Spring is on its way and everything has started to come back to life.There's still a nip in the air and we're still getting frost - that can last until mid-May here - but most of the above are in the ground and many are beginning to bud. This means we need to dig everything up and get it into large containers ready for moving; we need to do this as soon as possible, but how do I do it? I'm thinking large trugs with handles would be alright for the trees, although they're going to be heavy to move, but do I plant them into virgin ground once we move or would I be better to leave them in their big tubs until the end of the year? I've been advised to lift a fair sized root ball and pack them into the containers with as much of the original soil as possible, then keep them protected from the frost. Any other advice would be much appreciated.I also have rhubarb and strawberries to lift and move. The rhubarb is already quite a fair size in the sunniest corner of the garden, so I'm worried about damaging it by moving it this far on into the growing season. I might be best to leave it for as long as possible, in the hope that it's big enough to pick before we are away from here. Unfortunately, we're working to a very tight deadline, unless the landlord concerned decides to respond to our requests for an extension.Any helpful suggestions or advice that anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone knows of anything lighter weight than soil that can be used to pack around the root balls of the fruit trees, I'd love to hear about it.Please post comments either here or into my forum thread marked 'Moving Fruit Bushes & Trees'.

{"title": "Recycling Pallets on a Microholding", "date": "Sunday 13 March 2011", "text": "Books are my downfall!Having succumbed to the temptation to treat myself to a copy of a great Self sufficiency book, despite having no more than a rented garden, I am thoroughly enjoying reading it. As followers of the frugaldom lifestyle, our small garden has produced plenty of fruit and vegetables, along with all the hen, duck and quail eggs that we've had from our poultry microholding. But I keep finding myself tempted by several other very quirky book titles.Today, for example, I was updating a few links on the new 'Woman Zone' section of the main website and, for some unknown reason, I found myself back on the trail of smallholding. It's most likely because my mind is constantly on microholding, what with the impending housemove, the longer days and the increase in egg production from the hens.  I am trying not to get overly optimistic about the possibility of moving into a new house with a much larger garden, but it's very difficult!Anyhow, it's safe enough to say that my heart is set on one particular house and having seen the large garden, almost a quarter of an acre of it, my imagination has been running riot. The contents of the current garden all need to be moved, regardless of where we end up, so anything that's old or broken is being sawn up for fire wood, along with what's left of all the salvaged pallets that we had. Some were rescued form the skip when the roof here was being done, others were rescued from a nearby distribution warehouse, when they were about to burn them. (Shock, horror!)Pallets are fantastic things - brilliant as firewood, brilliant as raised bases for things like sacks of coal and brilliant for recycling into other things. To date, we have a log store, a roof over the quail run and a duck house, all constructed from salvaged roofing boards and pallets.  (In the photo is our latest duck house, built from pallets & scrap roofing board.) It was the word 'pallet' that attrecated me first, when I happened across a little book entitled, 'Build It!... with Pallets'. I really must read this book, especially after seeing someone build a microhouse from the things! Bring me pallets, bring me all the pallets you can find - one can never have too many pallets, especially when they are free.But then I spotted an even quirkier book title... Archie Sparrow's Book of Useful Tips to Beat the Recession with ... Baling String? I love it! We used to always collect the baling twine when splitting hay bales for the ponies & goats. Most times, we recycled it into homemade haynets. Anyhow, I don't know what's in this particular book, but it's a tightwad's guide to running a smallholding! Fantastic! How much more tightwad can I get than attempting to set up a miniature smallholding in my next garden? (Hence the name 'micro' holding.)Everywhere I look I see great titles of books that I'd love to read! It isn't like we don't own any books here, we have thousands of the things! But most of these are either about moneysaving or horseracing. Times have changed, we've moved on, we've aged another few years and we're now looking for a place to call home. Most importantly, we want a little bit more of the good life.In anticipation of the brand new microholding project that we hope to begin soon, I've been eagerly following updates on Twitter and have, just recently, compiled a list of interesting people who appear to have similar interests. The list has now been added into a fantastic, free website programme - I hope it's free - to incorporate everything into a daily newspaper format. It will be through this medium, along with the Frugaldom forum and this blog, that the whole microholding project will be documented.Have a look and see what you think of the first ever edition of, 'The Microholding Daily'. Feel free to subscribe, so you don't miss any updates and, if you like it, spread the word to friends, colleagues and family. You are welcome to become a part of it.As always, you can join us in the Frugaldom forums and keep up to date with the daily lives of those frugalers who have already chosen to participate in this year's challenges. Or, perhaps you would like to set yourself a totally new challenge for 2011? There are plenty to choose from and still another 10 months left of the year. Check out our frugal entrepreneurs and our microholders then get started with your frugal challenge in 'Challenging Times'.My personal challenge is to run our frugaldom household on no more than £4,000 per year (excluding rent & council tax) until we have saved enough cash to buy our own place. This personal challenge began about five years ago. The last two of those have been particularly cruel, with regards to the interest rates, but frugal living and smallholding have been with me, I think, since birth!Hope to see a few new names appearing soon - take up the challenge to take control of your own spending - it puts you more in charge of your own financial destiny."},
{"title": "What Women Want... GRAB IT NOW!", "date": "Friday 11 March 2011", "text": "Woman ZoneEddie  Elwood shocks the nation by revealing that, despite what they say, most women  actually do  WANT TO SHOP!\"...Shopping is a bloodsport with the best designer labels, at the best discounted prices, fast becoming the prize kill. I defy you to prove me wrong.\"In a recent survey, three out of three women questioned agreed that shopping of any description was not their most pleasant experience. This was especially so when dragging screaming children around, or when being woefully followed by an unwilling partner with whom they could share little (or no) enthusiasm for the 'sport'. But surprisingly, when asked, given guilt-free, limitless time and limitless money, would they really want to shop, 100% agreed, wholeheartedly, that they would! Not only that, they unanimously agreed that the mere prospect of it completely enthralled them! The only problem they could foresee was the fact that, in most cases, it is almost impossible to participate in this sport to any great degree of satisfaction. Why? Well, when both time and money did permit, they still could never find exactly what they wanted!How often have you set aside enough time and money to relax and enjoy shopping? Shopping of any description is fast becoming a nightmarish chore! It's because of the choices we have to make these days and therein lies the major problem - too much choice!Shopping could easily become a wonderfully fulfilling, fulltime occupation - if someone was daft enough to pay us to shop wherever, whenever and for whatever we wanted, but let's get real... that is NEVER going to happen! Instead, we can opt for a busy trawl through shops stuffed with different similarities and similar differences or we can sign online, head for the search engines, key in our wants and voila! Home delivery at our fingertips. (Don't forget to register for Topcashback - it helps you cream off a percentage of your spends without it showing in the bank or credit card statements!)Okay, so it isn't that simple, because there are literally thousands of websites and we don't all have hours to surf, browse, select, crash, swear, reboot, relocate the site and start again. Online shopping could be voted as the cruelest sport, or it could be nominated an Oscar for worst movie ever made! But it's still the best thing since sliced bread, in my opinion. We love it and we won't let it go! But I still have trouble finding exactly what I'm looking for, at exactly the kind of price I'm prepared to pay. Shopping is a bloodsport with the best designer labels at the best discounted prices fast becoming the prize kill. I defy you to prove me wrong!Special Note from Eddie to Shona:Dear Shona, You need the SUPERMODEL TUMMY TRIMMER  for only £3.24 right now! Cheers,Eddie!(Dons crash helmet and runs off very quickly to hide inside a disused bomb shelter!)Eddie's Handy Notes:Grabitnow offers one new deal everyday at a crazy low price! The deal changes at midnight every day and a new offer is made available. With such great bargains on offer, you need to grab them quickly, as the deal may sell out at anytime, and there is no opportunity to go back and buy previous deals. Grabitnow aims to save you £££'s off the high street and retailers prices on everyday goods for your home and garden, electronics, gadgets, toys and games and even branded items.Eddie observations, hints and tips:Shoe shopping is VERY addictive!!!!Very few women buy themselves perfume, erotic lingerie, fancy boxes of chocolates, expensive jewellery or bouquets of flowers, hence the reason they all qualify as top 'guilt-trip' gifts from men.It does appear to be true that women can never have too many shoes so, next time you want to impress her, take her to the best footwear retailer you can find and set her free with a huge budget.Many women carry their lives in their handbags, therefore, a really good handbag is a definite MUST HAVE.Contrary to popular belief, women can control their spending. It's most men who fail to see the importance of frugal housekeeping. Anyone whose top priority is satellite television needs their head looked at, so get your priorities right... some domestic help would be far more beneficial! To really impress the woman in your life, provide her with sufficient 'housekeeping' to encourage investment of the surplus.

{"title": "How to... assess your own financial state of affairs", "date": "Tuesday 8 March 2011", "text": "FRUGAL LIVING DOES NOT MEAN YOU'RE MEAN!News abounds of potential interest rate rises, property slumps, price increases, business failures and job losses. Threats of redundancy are looming over many, unsuspecting heads. It seems to be doom and gloom wherever we look. (Unless we happen to be top bankers or trade wisely in the city.)I read, with interest, that the resilient Brits are fighting back in the only way they know how - by acting like the proverbial Scots and tightening their grips on the purse strings. I mean no offence by this! As a native Scot, born and bred, I like to think of myself as thrifty, even frugal to the point of no return. But this has, for many years, been perceived as meanness. It's almost as annoying as describing yourself as 'home-based' with regards to work, then a certain sector within society jumps to the conclusion that it means being sat at home sponging an 'income' from the Welfare State! It simply is not true! If it was true, I wouldn't fancy my chances for longterm financial happiness, me being a mere home-working 'Jock' and all!                       <!--google_ad_client = \"pub-0449214954151758\";google_ad_width = 468;google_ad_height = 15;google_ad_format = \"468x15_0ads_al_s\";google_ad_channel =\"\";google_color_border = \"333333\";google_color_bg = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_link = \"FFFFFF\";google_color_url = \"999999\";google_color_text = \"CCCCCC\";//-->                      Frugal living does NOT mean you're mean! It simply means that you are careful in your spending. I like to think that 'frugalers' have the intelligence to budget and have the will power to refrain from making rash money decisions that could affect their longterm financial goals.Sadly, many don't find frugality until after they've hit the fast road downwards. Many have already been sucked into debt traps or plied with false hopes of earning fast fortunes in far from lucrative (non) investments. There are money pits everywhere, glossed over with finery that can beguile even the most money-savvy minds. In some instances, there seems to be nothing more than a filament separating frugality from blind stupidity. So how do we tell the difference? We budget wisely. We aim for a debt free future. We plan. We experience the results and learn by those experiences.Suggestion: calculate a well-informed estimate, don't articulate a 'guesstimate'.Step 1: FORGET about how much money you have coming in for a moment. Instead, sit calmly (and patiently) with your entire household and get everyone to write down every single item that they spend money on - use credit card bills, bank statements, receipts and houshold bills. Count it all up for everyone in one lump sum. If it's a weekly amount, divide it by 7 and then multiply it by 365 - use a calculator if you must. If it is monthly, just multiply it by 12.Step 2: THINK long and heard about how much you possibly spend on non-regular items, like car servicing, MOT, tax, holidays, gifts for family and friends, socialising, pet care, healthcare (prescriptions, dental treatments etc), entertainment, beauty products, haircuts, hobbies, cigarettes, alcohol etc, etc, etc... this list can be extensive.Step 3: ADD totals from steps 1 and 2 together - this can be a scary number!Step 4: ADD up the total household income.Step 5:DEDUCT the total spends from the total income - this can be an even scarier number!If you are fortunate, you'll see how much you have left over to kickstart a sensible money plan in the event that any one of your sources of income stops. However, more often than not, this is NOT what seems to happen. More often than not, the household suddenly realises that there simply isn't enough coming in to absorb any major dip in the income.That financial dip could be for any reason - a pregnancy, illness, redundancy, a wedding, a funeral, a house move... even a major repair bill can upset a fragile balance, leaving families unable to meet regular payments. But how can anyone foresee the future?The simple answer is that nobody can! Big events will occur, the cycle of birth, life, death will continue, Christmas, birthdays and anniversaries will come around every year, prices will fluctuate, jobs will come and go and life will carry on regardless. No matter who you are, how much cash or debt you may have or what you do, you ARE part of that cycle. It's the nature of life, itself, so go with the flow.Inflation is high, interest rates are low - every penny in the bank could be losing us money. Inflation can fall, interest rates can rise, debt levels can reduce or increase accordingly. Unfortunately, we aren't living in a country where our national leaders are leading by example, not by a long chalk! As far as balancing the books is concerned, but without getting into a political debate, the current state of affairs has been with us for a long time. Truth be told, it will probably be with us for a great deal longer.Someone knew it was coming. Someone possibly knows that worse is still to come.Someone might tell us that things will get better.Someone might spin a great story, create a great diversion or distract our attention.Whatever happens, the problem of dealing with insufficient money remains real!Don't follow in the footsteps of the British Government, take control of your own financial destiny and act now, even if it is only one penny at a time. Protect your own assets, no matter how much or how little you might perceive them to be. Keep your friends close and, as they say, your enemies closer.If a bank debt is costing you 10p in the pound, pay them at least 11p plus the necessary contribution to the overall balance. Get rid of it as quickly as possible.If a credit card debt is costing you 20p in the pound, pay them at least 21p plus the necessary contribution to the overall balance. Get rid of it as soon as possible.Learn to see clearly, so you can distinguish true needs from unrealistic wants. Don't be duped by marketing and advertising, they're merely trying to convince you that life is meaningless without the goods or services they are plying.

{"title": "Peer to Peer Lending, With a Look at Zopa", "date": "Wednesday 2 March 2011", "text": "Lending Versus SavingSince blogging from my high horse on the subject of the possible Barclay's takeover of Egg's UK credit card accounts, I thought I'd take a look at peer to peer lending. It's springing up all around us and, on first quick glimpse, my mind automatically jumped to the dreaded game of 'money lending'. However...Who or What is Zopa?I took a look at both their website and their affiliate programme to learn the following: Zopa is a peer to peer lending and borrowing exchange where real people sidestep the banks to get a better deal.- They offer loans of £1000 to £15000 for up to 5 years.- They're also one of the only loan providers allowing borrowers to repay their loan early with no penalty or sneaky fees, so it's a really flexible loan.- Zopa lenders also offer loans at some of the lowest rates in the market.Unlike the high street banks, Zopa claims to have, \"no shortage of funds, so there's no crunch!\"All highlighted text links are clickable and should take you to the relevant page on the affiliated Zopa website.To start me off, I played around with their loan calculator and was pleasantly surprised by their rates. Considering some credit cards are charging an astonishing 20%+ in interest, the Zopa rate for £5,000 over a 60 month period was refreshing, to say the least. Despite there being a £130 fee attached to the loan, this seems to be incorporated into the overall loan, which was listed at a fixed 7.7% - that's 0.2% LESS than a low rate credit card is currently offering... frugalers, are you following my drift on this one? I currently have no debt accruing interest, I'm very lucky and appreciate this fact. I worked extremely hard to get here. But, if I did have debts, I'd seriously be looking at the possibilities offered by peer to peer borrowing in order to reduce the interest charges. The rates are half, or even as much as one third, of some credit card options or hire purchase deals. There are also no penalties for early settlement of a Zopa debt.But Frugaldom isn't just about giving debt the heave-ho as quickly (and as cheaply) as possible; Frugaldom is about attaining and maintaining a debt free status in order that we can begin to increase our overall savings. We like keeping a tight rein on the costs of running our household, microholding and/or business. We like seeing where every penny goes. Not only do we need to pay off everything we owe in a timely and reliable manner, we also enjoy the benefits of being in a position that enables us to help and support others. We love to reduce, reuse and recycle. We love to increase our savings! So how might peer to peer lending help us?Joining Zopa offers you the chance to become a lender - actually lending your money to others. The current average rate of return showing on site is 7.6% - that's about three times what my top savings account is paying! I'm assuming there is an element of risk attached to this type of 'investment' but Zopa does have quite an extensive set of safety measures in place. I'm now beginning to wonder how lucrative it might be to invest some savings into becoming a lender, despite the old saying, 'never a lender nor a borrower be'. In these days of austerity, collapsing banks and unstable property markets, there seems to be risk involved in almost everything. At the same time, there are many more people seeing sense, becoming more money savvy and reducing their debts in whatever way they can. For many more, the notion to set up business on their own can mean bashing their head against a brick wall trying to get finance - peer to peer lending could be the next big thing.

More difficult, still, is organising where the assortment of livestock will be temporarily housed, in the event everything goes horribly wrong and we find ourselves homeless. But the ducks don't know about any of this. All the ducks know is that there were seven of them a couple of weeks ago and now there are only two. We rehomed four and then we had the sad and sudden death of dear little Monica.In preparation for vacating this address, we've begun deconstructing everything in the garden. This means the hens and ducks can now access what used to be the raised vegetable bed. It also doubled up for Square Foot Gardening. It's almost northerly facing, so we edged it with mirrors in order to catch every available ray of sunshine during summer. This morning, Joey and Phoebe discovered the mirrors!They were so comical, fluffing their feathers, flapping their wings, head bobbing and staring intently at their own reflections. Ducks, I can conclusively state, CAN see reflections in mirrors. Their ability to recognise themselves, however, is still debateable.This is Joey attempting to head bob and look cool in front of Phoebe. She, on the otherhand, was less vain, and decided that it was better fun to dabble among the blackcurrant and raspberry cuttings, before waddling off to nest beneath the conifers.Ducks are so funny.

{"title": "Could This Lead to a Frugal Cashback Crisis?", "date": "Tuesday 1 March 2011", "text": "This morning, I spotted this piece of interesting (and rather worrying) news, posted by thisismoney on Twitter: \"Barclays has stuck a deal to obtain more than one million credit card accounts belonging to internet bank Egg, it announced today...\" read full story here->  http://ow.ly/1byOOOMy instant reaction to this news is one of horror! But then again, Barclays has also just announced one of their longest term 0% offers for new cardholders.As all good frugalers know, Egg has been our friend for a long, long time. Many of us cherish our Egg plastic. We have celebrated many anniversary transfers at 0% and switched funds throughout the accounts, using 'Egg Money' to hatch all sorts of schemes, gaining high interest rates from savings accounts. Meanwhile, we'd be repaying minimum monthly amounts at 0% for the specified period, then repaying the lump sum on termination - no fees incurred, no interest paid. I guess we are the types of customers that financial lenders DON'T like! As stated on their site, the \"1% cash back Egg Money is a credit card that gives you 1% cash back on all your spending (maximum £200 cash back per year; if less than £5 no cash back is payable).\" What this means for many of us is that everything goes on plastic, every bill gets cleared each month, no fees, no interest charged and, for the priviledge of using their card, we get paid.Many of us have, over the years, been collecting that 1% cashback on all our purchases, cashing in each March or April. Personally, I never spend enough to get anywhere near the £200, but that extra £50 or so always pays for something in the Frugaldom household budget, even if it is only the annual household contents insurance policy.We eventually had to give up on balance transfers with the introduction of 'transfer fees'. We dealt with them admirably, at first, when banks like ICICI were able to offer rates as high as 6.5% and still provide us with instant access, whilst Egg offered a 0% transfer fee and 0% interest rate - it was an absolute no brainer to overlook that kind of offer. Even with the introduction of the 2% or sometimes 3% transfer fees, it was still possible to glean a few extra pounds interest from their money - similar to the way the banks 'invest' to earn from our money! But then there was a mass hysteria about charges and misselling of income protection payment schemes. The nation rebelled, celebrating the great Martin Lewis, hailing him the people's champion to all who were in debt. To all and sunder, he became known as the 'Money Saving Expert'. Case after case was heard, the financial institutions were being forced to repay customers thousands of pounds of money they had been, dare I say it, 'duped' into paying.  Then the banks began collapsing! We saw bail out after bail out - many money-savers became alarmed when, in 2008, Icesave went topsy turvy. This was a huge shock to many systems, none less than the UK local councils that had 'invested' IK Government money! Many had chosen Icesave over ICICI for their 'stoozing' funds. The UK banks began to wobble - you all know that story... Around March 2009, Bank of England base rates sank to an all time low of 0.5% , obliterating any opportuity for 'stoozing', as it had become known throughout forum networks. Interest rates have never recovered. Two years on, Bank of England base rates are still 0.5%  Incredibly, credit card interest rates sem to have soared, with many exceeding 19% - they are clawing back what they think is rightfully theirs, coming at borrowesr with all guns blazing. But with no debts, they can't earn from our 'type'! Therefore, it should surely come to pass that they will prevent us from earning from them!Talk revolved around the introduction of monthly fees for cashback credit card holders - they may have implemented it for new applicants, for all I know, but they haven't introduced it to those of us who have 'played the game' for several years. But we're still expecting something to happen.As frugal lifers, we were left with very little choice. For cashback credit cards, there are still several options but they are limited. These, in my opinion, have Will Barclays buy over our accounts? Will they restructure the cashback clause? Will they abolish it all together?Personally, I suspect that the opportunity to earn  between 10p and £3.84 per week from spending on an Egg credit card will be lost. Who, then, will we turn to for our free cash? Well, there's always the likes of Topcashback! For now, I'm gleaning my 1% from Egg and my percentage from these third party mediators. Their ability to spread out a thin layer of the advertising & marketing revenues from large companies appeals to me. It works for me, for now... make the most of it while you can. I suspect that the end of the cashback era could be nigh. (But I hope I'm wrong.)MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES!At the rate the bargains are disappearing, we may all end up preferring to use a BREAD Card while researching other possibilities for making a an extra penny in the pound for our frugal budgets.Don't forget you can join us in the forums to discuss any aspect of frugal living and working.BRILLIANT NEWS! I've just heard that there's a new store planned for Glasgow city centre! It's The Peoples' Supermarket.   This is tremendous news for all fans of frugal living and for everyone on a tight budget. The opportunity to obtain bargains in locally produced or grown foodstuff is paramount to the success of any environmentally sustainable programme - Government or otherwise!   It's a pity that we're over 2 hours drive from the city, but I'd certainly go in search of the store if I ever visit and I'll definitely be recommending it to everyone I know. I sincerely hope that Glasgow City Council rates office sees fit to a reduction or waiver of the commercial rates on whichever property is being used. It's the rent and rates that can cripple any small business, so the fact that The People's Supermarket is more of a community based co-operative has to bode well in that respect.   Lest we forget, this store will also mean that the opportunity is there for local producers to pass on their surplus (or supermarket rejected) fresh produce. Glasgow already has a fruit market - we used to have to get up about 4am in time to get there and be back in time for opening time - but I am sure that many farms and producers will be only too happy to trade out what their main contracts don't cover.   The latest news has come at a very appropriate time:  only yesterday, the Coalition Government published its vision for sustainable development. (Check it out. There's not an awful lot in it, so it shouldn't take you too long.)   Twitter members can follow the news @TPSGlasgow   Frugaldom and all concerned will be following this story very closely and will pass on any news we hear.   WISHING GREAT SUCCESS TO ALL CONCERNED! :)"},
{"title": "The People's Supermarket Got Me Started!", "date": "Sunday 27 February 2011", "text": "Tonight was one of those rare occasions when our TV actually managed to pick up a signal. We managed to see a full episode of Landward, then watched 'The People's Supermarket' with great interest. I'd caught part of one episode previously and then clicked to follow @TPSLondon on Twitter. Not having the benefit of superfast broadband in these rural parts, I can't watch any reruns online, so my research has been severely restricted - Twitter, Facebook and their website.Twitter bio says:Name: People's SupermarketLocation: Holborn, LondonWeb http://www.thepeoplessupermarket.org/Bio: The People's Supermarket is a bold new venture which allows a community to come together and take charge of the food they buy and eat.   Sadly, tonight's TV episode appears to have been the final part of the series, ending with the shop picking up a few more members and trading briskly enough to warrant its immediate survival. There's even a suggestion of another store!   With around 650 members paying £25 each per year to join the TPS project, unless I'm wrong, membership has generated a mere £16,250 before deduction of admin costs. That's equivalent to less than one week's overheads on the entire project. So, how much bang do members get for their bucks?   First of all, it looks as though members need to volunteer an average of an hour per week helping run the store. In exchange for membership and helping out, members are also entitled to a 10% discount on their groceries. Based on the National Minimum Wage of £5.93, membership equates to a total of just over £333.00 per year. My question is, can someone save more than that by joining?   THE ANSWER IS YES, OF COURSE YOU CAN! But only if you're a shoppers who is guaranteed to spend an average of £65 (inclusive of discount) every week in TPS.   People, there are massive savings to be made here! Everyone tell a friend, relative, neighbour or colleague. Do a bulk shop on whatever items you all need. Batch cook and share. The apples and broccoli in tonight's programme were perfect examples; adapt the diet and the meal plan to suit what's available, join forces with others and share-shop. It's a no brainer! You're helping local producers, You're supporting your local community,You're helping others save money and You're helping keep perfectly good produce out of the landfills. It's second nature to followers of the frugaldom lifestyle but it's also the oldest 'new trend' to hit the high streets! TPS really is a store where every penny and every person counts! And that's coming from someone who has only ever set foot in the City of London once in her entire life! Let's ask the same question of a typical frugal family. Here, we base grocery shopping on the concept that an average of £1 per person per day is sufficient to feed a family, assuming you are prepared to batch cook, preserve, implement a zero waste policy, grow your own wherever possible and stockpile on any bargains. For a typical 'frugaldom' family of four, even allowing for special occasions, the annual grocery budget is still only £1,500.00  TPS membership may have no appeal to our frugalers, until you remind them that by share-shopping, that exact same £1,500 could buy them a lot more (or cost them less) and provide the opportunity to meet a whole group of similarly minded individuals. Not only that, look at the opportunities to get away for a day into the country, fruit and veg picking.   With TPS being open to the general public, I'm struggling to see why the place isn't mobbed on a daily basis. I haven't seen enough of the series to understand the original concept, location or footfall past the door. From what I understand, it appears that the project, while being underfunded from the start, was set up to offer fresh, locally sourced produce at below supermarket prices. This is based on the premise that fresh produce being offered there was unacceptable or unwanted by the big supermarkets.  Misshapen or over/undersized fruit & veg seemed like brilliant buys, to me. I mean, where else can you buy fresh peppers for 15p each without there being a 'whoops' yellow or orange sticker on them?    TPS offering hot food to takeaway was an ingenious idea, although I'm not sure how prices compared to elsewhere. Regardless, it's a great way to reduce, reuse and recycle leftover fresh produce. Followers of the frugaldom lifestyle are well used to cooking up such delicacies on a regular basis and would eagerly flock to bag a few more bargains, given half the chance.   Being underfunded from the start, it can't have been easy to get the whole TPS project off the ground. However, there seemed to be a distinct lack of co-operation and communication among the members during meetings. The fact that the majority of existing members didn't seem to be taking advantage of what was on offer clearly proved that the supporters of this scheme are divided. Seeing only 6 people out of 350 members turn up for apple-picking was sad, but that, again, reflects on how precious everyone deems their own time and how disjointed society has become. Time is money, for many. That's the society we live in today and the society that we have allowed ourselves to create.   From where I'm looking, there are those who want to pay their money as 'silent partners', there are those who want to be seen to volunteer their services within a less fortunate area than their own (but don't channel their own spending power through the store) and there are those who prefer to just shop - with money saving in mind. For many others, it might even be beneath them to be seen in such a store as TPS!    But the 21st Century has brought a new trendiness to austerity. It's good to be green, it's perfecly acceptable to be prudent and, for all those 'big spending, flash Harrys', saving is uppermost on their minds, whether they acknowledge it or not. Just check out all the current tax evasion strategies being employed within the UK right now.   Only by offering lucrative 'deals' can the big spenders be drawn into the picture. Fresh veg boxes are all the rage, lunch packs and snack packs are all the rage, get those frugal entrepreneurial brains into action and create a whole new chain of products from what's already available. How close is TPS to large office blocks or concentrated numbers of lunchtime snackers? If they don't want the whole fruit, offer to cut it into smaller pieces for them and charge them accordingly, ask the guy on the bicycle to deliver in time for lunch or teabreak.   The possibilities are endless... aim for FREE implementation of all you can, aim to REDUCE every overhead you can, aim to SAVE OTHERS time, inconvenience and money, aim to encourage DISCUSSION among existing members and spread the word... those are my personal thoughts on the matter.   So, where does that leave the concept of a people's supermarket? I don't know about London, (£18,000 minimum turnover to break even every week is a fortune to someone like me!) but here in Frugaldom, there is always a need to set the bottom line and then keep lowering it. If rates are payable, I'd be seeking some form of rebate for the community project. I'd be monitoring every single unit of electricity consumed, every litre of water, every penny of insurance paid and every penny spent on transport. As an active member of a Local Exchange Trading Scheme, the concept is similar - we all pitch in as much as possible and we all pay out as little as possible. There's cashback, promotional activities, free publicity, free advertising and marketing opportunities, free involvement of the general public, free opportunities to SAVE MONEY...  The basic concept of The People's Supermarket is brilliant, yet the implementation may be its failing... I'd bring in 'back up' in the shape of the nearest London LETS group or similar. At worst, all surplus produce could be traded out on their points system and then the accumulated points could be offered to other LETS members who were prepared to put in a few hours of work in exchange for cheap fruit and veg.   I may be coming across as a bit of a country bumpkin with no apparent concept of city life, but I trust in society's playing fields not being level. And I have worked in a city, albeit Glasgow in the 80's.    Rural living on a frugal budget can, in many ways, be much more challenging than budgeting in or around the big cities. Throughout the UK, I am sure there must be thousands of families that could benefit from being part of a scheme similar to The People's Supermarket. Even if they can't promise 4 hours of their time a month and £25 a year membership, they can appreciate bargains and they do need to eat. We just need to look at the huge success of the newest 'big 3' frugal food stores: Approved Food, Food Bargains and Big Brands for Less to see that it isn't just the low income households who are taking advantage of this type of shopping - we do, afterall, see the vans delivering the boxes!   Don't forget to join us in the Frugaldom Forums to discuss Frugal Food, amongst many other subjects.During the first week of February we were issued with a notice to quit the house we currently rent. This came as a huge shock. Despite all previous verbal agreements and discussions with our landlords, they simply changed their minds and now want their house back. (See 'Counting the Costs of an Unplanned Move'.)Having put over two years into creating a garden that could produce fruit, veg and our own freerange eggs, it's going to me a massive exercise just thinking about moving house, let alone transferring everything elsewhere. In short, it's a bit of a nightmare.First and foremost, our next 'home' needs to be located somewhere that allows us to continue keeping pets and poultry. Secondly, it needs a large enough garden that we can start again, creating a microholding that fits nicely with our frugaldom lifestyle. It's a tall order to find all of that, get the relevant paperwork sorted out and then up sticks for the move - all to be completed by 7th April 2011.I guess that I'm still in some sort of denial, because I haven't given up hope that the landlords will renege on their decision, even if it's just for a few extra weeks to allow us time to find the right property. Being self-employed and keeping livestock of any description doesn't bode well for us in the eyes of many landlords.For several years, we have been on a mission to live an extremely frugal life in the hope of filling our ISAs and accumulating enough savings to afford to, some day, buy a place of our own. Once again, being self-employed and working from home does not bode well when it comes to mortgages and loans of any description, so we are stuck in a situation that we can only rent or buy property within the range of our income and/or savings. With Bank of England base rates still bottomed out at 0.5%, it means that the monthly interest payments have plummeted accordingly, paying roughly a quarter of what they did when our savings challenge began - not good! In fact, it's very bad! The reward for being prudent has been more of a punishment and I resent that fact. Our only glimmer of hope is that the property market appears to be on the brink of collapse, meaning it's a buyers' market right now. Rents are increasing, tenancy agreements are unreliable in the longterm, oil, gas and electricity prices are increasing, food prices are increasing, inflation is rising and our income has remained quite static. Correction, our income has halved over the past 3 months! Having savings brings its own problems - no entitlement to any form of income support or Government financial help for anything like rent, council tax or unemployment, should the worst happen. But let's be positive about all of this - we do have our savings. So, the decision was taken to sweep all the accounts and come up with a total sum of money that we could realistically afford to invest in property of some description. The frugaldom property hunt began in ernest, with only 45 days remaining before our 'moving out' date. All three estate agents were contacted (don't laugh, this is a small, rural area) and we enquired about anything at all within our price range. The results were sparse, to say the least. Rental properties mostly seem to be for 6 months, many are on the market for sale, many more couldn't be found on the Landlord Registration through local authorities. The following are a few of the options we've discussed - no stone has remained unturned - it may be helpful for anyone facing a similar situation while living on a shoe-string budget:Small flats mostly with no gardens.Small, unserviced building plots.Ex-local authority maisonette - bit pricey!Miniscule cabin by the sea - more of a dolls house, really, but this one is so cute!Tumble down terraces. Derelict cottages, if you're lucky, they may have land.Green belt land - great for microholding, but still need to live nearby.Woodland - brilliant project with no accommodation and no chance of planning permission. But this particular woodland looks brilliant!A caravan - but sites don't allow residency throughout the twelve months of the year, nor do they allow for fruit  & veg growing or poultry keeping.Go after an auction property - this one looks interesting.Cheap rented accommodation but rather remote and no pets permittedBlow the savings on renting a smallholding - nice thought but no thanks.NB: the above links will probably become obselete as the selected properties become unavailable but it'll be interesting to see how long it takes for those that are currently available.We spotted a steal of a property - three storey 'townhouse' in a Listed building in the Scottish Book Town of Wigtown. Along with the house was a garden out the back stretching some 150m. Beyond that, is a garage. Now if this property had been anywhere near within our price range, we'd have probably jumped at the chance, packed up and headed for Wigtown. It's a lovely little town with a village feel to it. We've been in that house many times, as we knew previous owners from a few years ago. At that point, they were hoping to sell for offers over £120k. If I recall correctly, they paid £95k for it several years previous to that and spent a bit of money rejigging the ground floor lay-out. It's on the market right now, open to offers over £80,000! A cheap property, in current economic climates and a sad reflection of the on-going property collapse. If anyone out there is looking for a bargain, this is certainly worthy of consideration even after it having lain empty for the past two winters.Google Maps website has been our best friend for the past month! It's an amazing piece of software that can save house hunters a small fortune. As soo as you spot a property anywhere (in the world!) you simply type in the location and Google Maps takes you there! Not only can you see an aerial view to see what sort of garden space there is, you can see a street view! I'm astiunded by this technology. Having viewed the exterior of dozens of properties recently, from the comfort of my livingroom, my brain is now confusing these visits with actual visits to view. Only last week, I found myself telling a friend that we'd been to see a house in the Galloway town of Newton Stewart, only to suddenly remember that we hadn't even left this house - we had 'viewed' the property remotely via Google Maps. It was really weird, all very MK Ultra and a bit spooky. Remote viewing is no longer the dream of agencies like the CIA, it's a virtual reality, when it comes to property, places and Google Maps!To be continued..."},
{"title": "Introducing the Concept of Microholding.", "date": "Tuesday 22 February 2011", "text": "THE CONCEPT OF MICROHOLDINGIt's smallholding on a smaller scale and self-sufficiency in everything, including home and finances. It's about self-sustainability, frugal living & homebased working. From shed working to allotments, from windowsill gardening to rearing livestock. It's about a new way of life. It's about Frugaldom. Microholding is the term I use to describe the source of everything concerning the 'Frugaldom' lifestyle. It isn't about smallholding, because we don't have land. We do, however, have a home and a garden, and that is the basis for what will, hopefully, become a self sufficientish lifestyle. There's no limit to how small your property, garden, allotment or patch of land need be, so anyone can create their own microholding. It's about the lifestyle, the community, the camaraderie and the willingness to pursue the dream of establishing a degree of self sufficiency, be it for business or pleasure. We all need to start somewhere, so don't worry if that somewhere is nothing more than a tiny garden, a patio or even a windowsill with a pot of herbs. We each have space to grow and learn. A true smallholding comprises anything from 2 to 50 acres, so even the largest microholding would have to be less than 2 acres. We have a specially designated section for Microholding in the free to join, Frugaldom Forums. Feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, share your trials and tribulations. Follow the frugaldom blog, where you can leave your comments or ask questions there, too. We have an entire micro community right here, waiting to welcome other like-minded people such as you. Welcome to the concept of microholding and the wonderful world of Frugaldom.Man's home is his castle, so I'm guessing that the first thing we need is a secure roof over our heads. An adjoining garden offers essential growing and rearing space to provide us with edible produce, be it fruit, vegetables, herbs or eggs from poultry, game or fowl. Ideally, our microholding could provide us with meat, but we haven't ventured within the realms of putting what we rear into the food chain. It could provide us with financial freedom. If you ever fancied life as a smallholder but haven't the time, energy, space, health or wealth to do so, then will power and the ability to adapt one thing into another is all it takes to create your very own microholding. Finding the right property might seem like a problem but frugaldom means adaptability, so we shall overcome all these problems in due course. Your future microholding may already be on your doorstep.Remember - There's no minimum land mass requirement - a patio, balcony or, even, your windowsills could provide you with the basis for your own microholding project. \"Micro\", by definition, means very small or, in other circumstances, suitable for being operated and maintained by one person, so the prefix associated with a smallholding sounds apt to me. You can even use the term in reference to property, a shares portfolio or your personal investments.The plan is to become as self sufficient as possible, earning a living by working from home as mini smallholders and frugal entrepreneurs - otherwise known as microholders. You might even like to make a small investment in a home study Garden Design Course or hone your skills in Property Development in anticipation of your future success. Knowledge is something you can never have too much of, so it's something we all need. It's a definite longterm investment that can pay rich rewards by way of living our chosen lifestyle and you can start that right now.Generating an income from your microholding project could include egg sales, gardening services, home produce or even becoming a virtual assistant. With this in mind, I chose to pursue some Home Study Courses. First and foremost, I sought out the relevant certification that enables me to make and sell homemade preserves on a small scale. A Food Hygiene Certificate costs just £25 + vat and should be sufficient for current legislation governing the sales of your home produce. What's more, the course can be studied online within a matter of hours, then it's just a short multi-choice test, all from the comfort of home. It's always advisable to check with your local Environmental Health Office if you have plans for further development of your ideas. Always be prepared to take the next step forward.On the other side of this virtual coin, there's money - the hard cash that we all need in order to survive within the realms of modern society, leading a normal life, paying bills, investing, saving for the future. In this respect, 'microholding' is about the small investments made in an attempt to grow and safeguard your own financial future. Think of it as growing your own money trees. Your personal investments portfolio may be miniscule (or micro) to begin with - a mere handful of seeds - but it is yours, bought and paid for by you, for your future. It is your responsibility to ensure its safekeeping.Just like sowing the seeds that produce the food in a garden, you need to sow the seeds of individual investments, ensure they are provided with the best possible opportunities to germinate then carefully cultivate them to ensure their future productivity. Just putting food on the table isn't enough, you still need to think of the future. In our present economic climate, during these times of what's being called, \"austerity\", we need to do more than just save a few pennies. Secure your own future, start your microholding now. Knowledge is power, so start learning how to develop your own self-sustainable future.Brand new MICROHOLDING CHALLENGE starting soon!﻿ Take up the challenge to create your very own microholding from scratch. Hints, tips, pros and cons, the good, the bad and the downright ugly - we'll be charting the progress online and everyone is free to join in.

{"title": "Earning While Spending... a look at getting cash back.", "date": "Saturday 19 February 2011", "text": "TopCashBackThis has to be my all time favourite cashback site and I could still kick myself that it took me so long to get into the habit of logging in to use their links to claim my free cash!Unlike affiliate links you see in websites, having your very own account with a site like Topcashback means that YOU earn the equivalent of advertising revenue rather than it going to the website owners. It won't actually earn you a living, but why pay full price when online shopping when you can access discounts AND get a percentage of what you pay returned to you? It's all the pennies that make the pounds.To let you understand the concept, almost all companies who sell anything need to advertise themselves. Advertising and marketing is big business, so there's always a good deal of money ploughed into that side of things. Now, imagine if you are that company and you discovered that you didn't need to sink as many £millions into glossy, shiny, traditional adverts. Imagine if you discovered that millions of people were prepared to advertise your company FREE OF CHARGE, simply by placing links on each of their own websites! It's an amazingly simple concept but, as with all things, few people like to help big companies earn even more money without being rewarded. That's where commissions come into it. Affiliate marketing is all about promoting and advertising other people's goods and services in exchange for a tiny percentage of any sales you generate on their behalf. Great! Website owners everywhere can generate a flow of cash by way of advertising in exchange for sales commissions... but that still doesn't help you, the price conscious customer. Step forward the concept of CASH BACK. It's such a simple idea that most shoppers still think it's too good to be true. This is where many of you are now losing out on some completely FREE MONEY! This is my story of how I discovered the joys of being paid cash back, simply by shopping online via someone else's links. It goes completely against the whole concept of cutting out the middle man because, in this case, you NEED the middle man! This is, afterall, the person who pays your share of the advertising revenue simply for your being a customer on their website.Late in 2007, I discovered a website called Topcashback. Like many, I was dubious of their third party links and didn't like registering my details for anything. I disliked the idea of having to do my research online and then still having to log into yet another site to seach for the appropriate companies - it was as though time was so precious that I couldn't afford the hassle of doing all this extra 'farfing' around when I could simply go directly to my chosen website, be it Tesco, Argos or eBay etc. But I decided to give it a go.Woolworths was still trading in its original form and I had a large order going in during their pre-Christmas sale. I say large, as it was for me! I'm a frugal pennypincher! However, this order was Christmas shopping for the family and it amounted to almost £300 by the time a friend added a few items to share the delivery costs! I took the time (a few seconds) to log into Topcashback, I used their link - I even used a discount code! I paid using my cashback credit card, which gets paid in full, faithfully, every month. As you'll perhaps know, followers of the frugaldom lifestyle are hell bent on clearing (and then avoiding) all forms of debt. But I digress... My Woolies' order went through as normal and there was no resulting deluge of spam emails and no financial repercussions with regards to my having registered through an unheard of (to me) website. That was it! Nothing else happened - my order arrived safely, Christmas 2007 came and went and I eventually remembered to check my Topcashback account... and there it was! My FREE cash! It was only £6, but it was mine and it went sailing straight into my bank account without any problems, whatsoever. That was how I discovered the joys of cashback!Being a frugaler means I don't spend an awful lot on non-essentials, it's necessities only and nothing more. But we still need things like home insurance, car insurace and gifts. I began playing the cashback game. By the end of that first year, I had claimed back over £100 from Topcashback. Not only that, I was spreading the word about the site - advertising it for free on my own and encoraging all my friends to join, too. In return for this, the site allocates you a unique link for recommending friends so you can track the success of your own advertising campaign carried out on behalf of the cashback site. In return, they will pay you a small fee if and when any of your friends generates sufficient cashback to warrant such a payment. To my utter disbelief, having told everyone I know about Topcashback both in person and online. 778 people clicked through my referal link to read about it but of those, only 50 individuals decided to register and try it out for themselves. How many of those people do you think actually continued to log into their accounts and start to claim free cashback?The answer to the above question is 10! Their loss, I guess, but I'm delighted with the results produced by my sparing a few minutes extra to check for cashback before buying anything online. I mean, why would you NOT want to get paid a few pence every time you buy something on eBay or shop online? Why would you NOT want up to £50 in free cash just for going via a cashback link for your insurance or to switch your utilities service provider? I'm dumbfounded! Since joining Topcashback, I have generated a grand total of £536.79 and I'm an extremely frugal online shopper!What's more, there is an option to transfer your cashback into Amazon vouchers, which is what I am doing for 2011. This means I get about an extra 0.5% on top of the cash amount. THIS is how I intend to pay for family gifts during my 2011 Frugal Living Challenge. I don't need to set aside a budget for such things when Topcashback is giving me money! It's a no brainer!Insurance companies pay top rates of cash back and often have great deals available. In 2009, I paid around £55 for my home contents insurance and the cashback promotion was offering about £75... it meant that I GOT PAID to insure my own belongings. The economic climate has changed over the past couple of years, so I only clocked up £35 cashback on my contents policy for this year... how much did you pay for your insurance? What did you receive in return, other than a policy?And lest we forget - cashback credit cards are still an option. American Express is often cited as being one of the best introductory deals and guess what? You can even get cash back for applying online through, you got it... Topcashback! So, not only have I generated my Topcashback money, I've also been accruing a tidy little cashback sum by paying with a credit card. I've paid not a penny in interest, because the bill is always cleared in full each month, and the card company pays out my cashback once a year, around April. Now that's what I call cyberdosh - extra cash generated through the wonderful world of the Internet. Don't forget to join us for some fun money-making, debt-busting or money-saving challenges in the free Frugaldom Forums... unless, of course, you're too rich to care about the pennies that make the pounds. :)Number-cruching is usually fun, much more so when you don't have any debt to worry about. However, our own current situation of having been served two months notice to quit the house got me wondering how others would or could cope. I consider myself fortunate to be in a situation where we freely chose to rent a fairly cheap, slightly neglected property in order to afford to save towards buying our own place. But what if we'd had debt? What if we didn't have the wherewithal to save and were now faced with the unenviable situation of having to move the entire household elsewhere on a budget of absolutely nothing and within a tight timescale?Homelessness IS a situation that can be forced upon anyone relying on privately rented property for no good reason other than the landlord wants their property vacated. They'll find a reason or an excuse. Similarly, it is a situation faced by many mortgage holders in the event of sudden job losses, interest rate hikes, sickness, a death in the family or unserviceable debts. We do have a homeless problem within the UK, whether we all acknowledge it or not, and it's not just reserved for those with drink or drug related problems.  There is a genuine need for housing, a genuine need for safeguarding existing tenants and home owners and a genuine need for employing radical measures to protect against future changes to circumstances that are within human control. The population just keeps on growing while the availability of housing cannot keep pace. No amount of money will buy living space on this once great island once all the land has gone.So, you're facing the real possibility of being made homeless...First of all - don't panic! Easier said than done, but there's no point wasting energy on it as the outcome will remain the same - you will need to find another house and move home within a short space of time. Landlords are perfectly within their rights to serve as little as two weeks' notice, depending on your tenancy agreement or if you breached the terms of your lease so, in that respect, our personal situation is fortunate. If you are of a disposition that things could really get you down and you feel there's no place else to turn, there's always The Samaritans who are there to help all. If you simply need a little bit of cheering up in the wake of an otherwise gloomy situation, or for a bit of light-hearted banter, feel free to join us online in our Frugaldom Forums, where there are always others to share your plight. Our frugal ways and regular catastrophes may well help to make you feel a little bit more 'normal'.If you have debt and have been struggling to meet your financial commitments, there are agencies you can contact free of charge. Citizens' Advice is one, CCCS for free debt help is another and, in the case of housing, we've found plenty of helpful advice on our local community action centre hub. Contact your local council to find out if there's one in your area or try searching online. For us, we have the Nithsdale Council of Voluntary Services with Dumfries & Galloway Voluntary Action. As private tenants, you may want to look at your options for applying for social housing or to local housing associations. And then there is the power of social media - our old friends the forums, blogs, websites, Facebook, Twitter or any other broadcast platform. Don't be afraid to shout out for help when help is needed. Just be careful of what you say and how you word it, as it is unbelievably easy to offend others. Trust me, I have first hand experiece of that!Finding your next house deposit while not knowing when (or even if) your existing landlord will refund your current deposit can be unnerving. There is a Tenant Deposit Protection scheme in place in England & Wales:  we haven't been made aware of any such scheme becoming mandatory in Scotland, although it is reported to be implemented in future.When leaving your current home, always ensure you either a) Leave the property exactly as you found it orb) Have an agreement with your landlords regarding any reimbursement for improvements you have made to their property at your own expense. I would highly recommend that any and all relevant conversations and agreements with any landlord be recorded in writing, signed and witnessed for future reference. It prevents any unneccessary disagreements when one or other party could very easily renege on their word at any time in the future. Man's word is not always his bond; sadly, that is one mightily important lesson we have recently learned.Here, in Scotland, we have what is known as Landlord Registration, whereby all landlords must be registered. It is illegal for anyone to let out any property to any tenant without first being registered as a landlord through their local council; failure to do so can result in fines of thousands of pounds. You can check to find out if your landlord (or any other landlord in Scotland) is registered by completing the online information request or by telephoning your local council.Landlords do have statutory obligations to their tenants, just as tenants have obligations to safeguard any rented property in their charge. Make sure you know your rights and the landlords' rights before you rent. These do not relate exclusively to private landlords. Housing associations and even council housing is governed by much the same thing. The only thing that seems to differ greatly is the reduced or Government subsidised rental costs for social housing. There is a Rent Deposit Guarantee Scheme (RDGS) that operates in some regions. It enables people on low incomes and in housing need to access accommodation within the private rented sector. You can find more free online help from the CAB Advice Guide. This scheme is available in Scotland, although I suspect you'll need to be in receipt of some form of benefits in order to claim hardship. In the first instance, contact your local council to enquire into the existence of any such schemes in your area and don't forget what a great source of information your local library can be. Check out Shelter, which is a UK based charity dealing with housing and homelessness, they appear to have separate information for Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales. Even if you consider alternative types of accommodation, rather than regular bricks and mortar, Shelter should be able to offer free housing or homelessness information or advice.Getting closer to the final moving date without having secured alternative accommodation can (and often does) place extra strain on any family, but I'm well informed that a landlord cannot simply make you homeless. In the unusual situation that they will not negotiate an extension to allow you time to find another place to stay, they must, by law, give proper notice between serving the original 'notice to quit' and any potential court proceedings. Before you MUST leave your home, your landlord MUST have done 3 things:Served on you a Notice to QuitServed on you an AT6 andObtained a Court OrderI believe the above to be true as pertaining to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, therefore I cannot be sure that legislation elsewhere is the same or similar. It's Government legislation and, as such, you can find out more about it here. On the other hand, you are free to request the return of your original deposit and turn in the keys to the property on the stated day, assuming you have someplace to go. You are also within your rights to seek independent legal advice and contest the landlord's intention to repossess your home. Help with legal costs may be available under any Legal Aid legislation.I do hope that this blog helps someone and I fully intend keeping up with posting throughout the process of househunting and moving after being served Notice to Quit by our current landlord. I guess the most important thing in all of this, just like in any other dispute, is NEVER DO NOTHING. Take action immediately, seek appropriate help or advice and be prepared to make the necessary changes.Don't forget that you are welcome to register and become a part of the free Frugaldom Forums, where everything frugal or moneysaving can be discussed - helpful information, chats with like-minded others, recipes, garden plans, self-sufficiency, hens, ducks, property, how to make ends meet... if it's about saving money, cutting costs, clearing debt, frugal living or working from home, you'll probably find it discussed in Frugaldom."},
{"title": "The Search for Frugaldom Continues", "date": "Friday 18 February 2011", "text": "It's now day 17 of the search, after receiving notice to quit this house on Wednesday 2nd February 2011. On first looking, it seems there is a huge number of available properties, but the vast majority of them are for sale at prices way beyond anything we could ever consider - this includes most of the short assured tenancies being on the market at the same time! I really don't think they should be allowed to put tenants in without telling them up front that the house is also for sale!It's hard to believe that so many people must be living such precarious lifestyles, trying to establish some sort of normality, building a home for themselves and their families, yet having no real form of security regarding the roof over their heads.Countless, fruitless phone calls have been made from here, many home reports studied and a few properties visited, but we're still at the start of our search. I reckon that the best thing to have come out of this situation, so far, is discovering the true value of Google Maps. What a God-send! Having lost the car the same week we found out we were losing the house, this has left us pretty much stranded in our rural rental, relying almost entirely on the kind help of our neighbours. Google's online mapping system, however, has saved us a small fortune by way of travel expenses. Being able to sit in the comfort of the livingroom in front of a roaring log fire, while gliding virtually around the local towns, streets and villages to view locations and amenities is fantastic! Better still, 'visiting' postcodes corresponding to the estate agency property details allows for all sorts of exploration.I'm not sure about anywhere else but rental properties seem to move really quickly here, especially those priced under £500. That's a huge amount of money for some of us but I guess it will seem a drop in the ocean to big city dwellers with good salaries and everything available on their doorsteps. That lifestyle all sounds very tempting, but 'the biz' is not for us - we appreciate the peace and quiet and love our frugal, rural way of life, pursuing a semblance of self-sufficiency while earning everything else we need from home.I called about another house this morning, one we saw yesterday. (We've been up and down that street a dozen times on Google over the past 24 hours!) We need to wait for the property agent to contact the owners, first, then get back to us. I'm guessing that won't be today, as it's now just gone 5pm and I've been on tenderhooks all day!Of course, this is Friday... another weekend of not knowing. We'll be waiting and watching, wondering if there'll be any updates to websites or any new ads appear anywhere. We'll be wondering if the owners will meet up with friends over the weekend and strike an agreement elsewhere. I've blogged, forum posted, phoned, tweeted and contacted everyone I know in the area to alert them to our quest for a new home, so don't be scared to contact me with anything you hear of if it's in southwest Scotland.Our turn will come, I know it will. In the meantime, we need to sit out another weekend waiting for Monday and the relevant offices to re-open.It's a horrible situation to be in, knowing you have to pack your entire life back into boxes without knowing you have some place to move them. Like I said, this is only day 17 of 66, so we have another 49 days left to complete this next big 'challenge'. It's rather weird thinking that seven weeks from now we'll need to have found a house, emptied a garden and moved our entire lives elsewhere, yet we have no way of knowing where that might be. I do know one thing for sure - it won't be too far from all the great friends and family we have around here.Much number crunching will be going on this weekend to see how best to cope with not being able to find a rented property in time. Who knows what tomorrow might bring? I wonder if the weather will improve? I wonder if anyone will catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis if the sky clears tonight? That would be a once in a lifetime experience and might just help to turn the tide of bad luck that seems to be flowing over many of us. At least we know the tide WILL turn.Hoping to keep you up to date with the progress and also hoping none of you reading this is in a similar situation. Catch up again soon - keep on frugaling!"},

Condition of decor and state of the garden isn't a major concern, neither are basic remedial works, as we're used to starting from scratch and, as you all know, we enjoy a challenge. We'll need power, water, toilet facilities and a basically sound roof over our heads. I guess the priorities after that can be juggled accordingly, so long as it's within about 10 miles radius of the booktown and we can have a telephone line to ensure we can access work from home. As followers of the frugaldom lifestyle, we aren't all that difficult to please.I don't think this is too tall an order and would love to hear from anyone who knows of any suitable properties either to rent or to buy.

{"title": "Time to move on... AGAIN!", "date": "Thursday 17 February 2011", "text": "Apologies for the lack of recent blogging - we've had a few setbacks in our part of Frugaldom.First and foremost, this blog will NOT be closing, it will just be starting again as soon as we get back on our feet. Secondly, I make no apologies for what I research, write or blog about, so any problems that any readers may have are their own, regardless of what they think. I won't be bullied or harassed into retracting thoroughly researched articles just because someone takes personal offence to any of the subject matter.=====================﻿Serving notice for a tenant to quit a house is commonplace. I've been renting from private landlords for the past 10 years - 7 different landlords in total. At first, it was part and parcel of work, relocating to follow the income. But then we decided to fully adopt frugaldom - a simpler and more self-sustaining lifestyle in fitting with the frugal living ethos we'd been pursuing in an effort to save for a house. It meant no more worries about where the next assignment of work might be - we'd become self-sufficient in all things pertaining to a good life and just earn whatever extra we needed, locally and from home.Here's how far we got with the first place - rented in 2007/2008. The garden was around 50' in length and produced some lovely vegetables and bucket loads of apples. Sadly, we had to leave here when trouble sprang up between the joint landlords, eventually resulting in tragedy. Thiose who know us personally will be aware of the situation and circumstances at that time. Very sad.This particular house has just come on the market for sale, under what looks like a repossession order. Such a shame that it has lain empty for so long. There is absolutley nothing to be seen for the many, many hours that went into the garden.I often wonder if the pear or plum trees produced fruit and what becomes of all those lovely apples. My first grandaughter had such fun being lifted up ito the tree to pick bucket loads of apples in autum of 2009, when she was just 5 years old. She planted 2 trees and had her very own vegetable plot.Anyway, time marches on. In November 2008 we found ourselves moving into a little semi-detached bungalow on a working farm. There was no garden to speak of, so we had to start again. New home, new furnishings, new garden, new blog... Right from day 1, we've logged our progress and then brought it over to a proper blog, here, to run alongside the new forums we had going with the other followers of the frugaldom lifestyle. It had originally begun as a challenge to live on £4,000 for a year. If I remember correctly, I ran much of it through http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ forums between 2007 and 2010.We arrived here in November 2008. It appeared that, at some point, someone had kept or bred dogs on the property - there were remnants of dog runs and old delapidated kennels outside and plenty of evidence inside, judging by the chewed plaster and skirting boards. The dog kennels and runs we were able to salvage, so we recycled them into hen and duck houses then replaced or repaired all the wood and wire to renovate the runs. February, 2011 arrived, but thoughts were not with what could be started off as seedlings on the windowsills or sown in the greenhouse. Thoughts, instead, were with where the hell are we supposed to move to after the landlord suddenly served notice on us to quit the house? We have until April 7th 2011 to vacate the premises and remove everything from the garden - lock, stock and barrel. For the purposes of remembering how the garden should look when we remove ourselves from this property, the above are samples of what was here prior to the many months of work put into it. Until we hear otherwise, it is assumed that we have to leave the property in the same condition we entered it. I haven't a clue what to do about the new stove!We succeeded in rearing enough poultry to produce all the eggs we needed, grow many of our own herbs, vegetables and fruits - we planted a miniature orchard of apples, plums, cherries and pears plus an edible hedge of crab apples, raspberries, blackcurrants and an assortment of other summer fruits - and still have space left over to incorporate a seating area for leisurely coffee breaks. We love living here and assumed we had some form of security. Without that, we'd never have put down roots.All of this was done on a standard Short Assured Tenancy and VERBAL agreements with our landlords, who chose not to put anything in writing regarding pets, livestock, gardens, house repairs etc.We now find ourselves facing homelessness unless an alternative, suitably located house can be found. One very valuable lesson learned again - man's word is NOT his bond.We may be down, but we most certainly are not out - frugaldom will carry on, regardless.Don't forget to join us in the Frugaldom Forums where it's free to discuss all aspects of frugal living & working."},

{"title": "Tales From the Frugaleur (Frugal Entrepreneur).", "date": "Friday 28 January 2011", "text": "Have you got a cash cow?﻿OK, it's time to fight back against all the doom and gloom of austerity measures and the reportedly 'footloose to frugal' shift for Britain. What a piece of nonsense! If everyone took some responsibility for their own actions then we wouldn't have so many problems. Trouble is, we all thought we were being responsible when we borrowed cash to buy property, visit foreign lands, enjoy luxuries we were too impatient to save for and set up dot com businesses. The mass media is only the mass media because we pay for it - it's not an essential, but we pay for it and it tells us what we're meant to believe. Is your finger in too many pies?'Designer wear' has a nice ring to it, far nicer than 'hand me downs', so let's make frugality pay! It makes good money sense, it makes for better business relationships, it ensures the safety of more jobs and it invites wiser investments. I don't hear any complaining from the 'Dragons', nor do I hear the likes of Lord Alan Sugar, Sir Richard Branson, Bill Gates or Warren Buffett whine about being skint. There's plenty of cash still floating around the global economy but, also, plenty of governments attempting to devalue it. No point banking it, there's s*d all interest to be gained. No point investing it in foreign currency, they're all depreciating, too. No point spending it - because then you're back to having nothing other than the memory of what might have been a good time. So what's the next big thing?Make your dough go furtherI read about Martin Lewis and his quest to bring things like household budgetting into the national curriculum, but in the self same forum I read posts from so many teachers who cannot cope with the job of teaching. Doesn't he read his own forums? Who will teach the subject, how will it be monitored and who knows how best to budget for any special needs? I speak to kids of 6 who say they cannot read, they can barely write their own names, yet they can key in a 12 digit password to access the school's computer system - what the hell is that all about? These kids cannot read or write! Their parents are too busy trying to work every hour available to take the time to support teachers that cannot take the time to teach because they're strung up in paperwork, red tape and preparation, probably at the expense of their own families.So what's a frugaleur to do? Learn to live with the fact that life doesn't have to cost a fortune, learn that there probably is enough of everything to go around for a long time yet and learn that nothing lasts forever - that includes life! Make the most of what you have and if you can spare £10 to try to do the job of £20 then all the better.Don't count your chickens...Frugaldom is my way of life, it's a homelife, a business life and it's enough! It's not just about being frugal, it's about helping to show others that debt isn't a life sentence , it isn't a terminal illness and there IS a cure. That cure IS Frugaldom - freedom to live YOUR life in frugal comfort. Frugaldom is my business - so let's get this show on the road. Now You Know!Variety is the spice of lifeToday is the final day for applications from prospective challengers seeking micro-funding, with the newest frugal moneymaking challenge beginning on Tuesday 1st February. The maximum start-up investment is £10 but there's no limit to how often you can reinvest any profits. The object of this 'game' is to have at least £10 plus the 6.7p interest you might have earned from the bank in interest remaining at the end of 10 weeks. With a little bit of forethought and planning, some dedication and some self-promotion, anyone has the capability to convert their seed fund into a self-sustaining enterprise. So, let's get enterprising.Anyone who chooses to take part should join the forum to ensure access to any free hints, tips or suggestions offered by other budding frugaleurs. It will also be the meeting place for discussions relevant to the challenge topic and your opportunity to write up your progress, ask questions, offer suggestions and compare notes. £10, 10 weeks, 10 good reasons to give it a go:It is funYou'll can interact with like-minded othersIt's a chance to prove to yourself that you can complete a short challenge£10 is a small price to pay to experience the thrill of working your money, rather than spending itIf you focus on somethig you love doing then the prospect of profiting from that in the future isn't like any other job you could haveYou could find yourself self-employed with a successful businessYou might choose to spend your £10 seed fund on eBay and eBid trading, then end up running your own store.It could lead anywhere - meeting new people, making new business contacts, introducing you to other moneysaving and moneymaking schemesA self-sustaining profit could pay off debtsIf any profits keep on turning a profit, sustaining your lifestyle, the sky's the limit.As they say, pigs might fly, but so, too, might the lucrative, creative juices of any fertile mind. Give it a go - what have you got to lose?No secrets being divulged until Tuesday.Good luck to all who participate. If you plan on starting a business, don't forget to register (free) as self employed with HMRC and be aware of your obligations to pay National Insurance & any relevant taxes, should your profits soar above the minimum thresholds.

The object of the game is to generate sustainable profits, but this is just the start. In order to beat the banks, we need only increase the £10 by around 6.7p, so it really shouldn't be much of a challenge.So, time for me to clear the way to getting started for Tuesday 1st February 2011.

{"title": "SOCIAL NETWORKING, SPREADING THE WORD, THINK ABOUT IT…", "date": "Tuesday 25 January 2011", "text": "The world's gone Gaga!Everyone seems to like numbers - statistical analysis, percentages, ratios, conversion rates, the price of cheese... so I've looked at a few more. Before discussing them, I'd like you to take a quick think about these popular websites - with Apps!I don't really 'do' Facebook, as far as social media and business networking is concerned. I do find it extremely handy for keeping up to date with friends and family, arranging social events and, in general, doing anything except work. We can share photos, reminisce, poke fun at one another and pick up from wherever we left off, even if we haven't seen one another for years. Facebook is fun, it's where we hang out with familiar faces, it's where we go to skive, or to sit down at the end of a frustrating day and relax. OK, so our photos have probably all been digitally scanned for facial recognition, profiled, logged and listed in some Government funded, global database but, on the whole, we don't care. It's FacebookMaking your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came. You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same You wanna be where everybody knows your name. You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, You wanna go where everybody knows your name.Theme song lyrics from 'Cheers' \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" by Gary Portnoy & Judy Hart AngeloTo me, that's Facebook!Twitter, on the other hand, is about a hard and fast game. It's about the hard sell, the attention grabbing, the in your face, fast driven media. It's a digital revolution that combined the Internet with mobile phones on every level and is now threatening to outpace the national news networks and revolutionise the 'text all' facility on our mobile phones. On Twitter, there is no 10 second delay - it's out there for all to see and it's what's happening now.In my opinion, the Twitter + Facebook combination doesn't work very well for the 'man on the street'. You just wouldn't take Wall Street, CNN and The Whitehouse staff to meet your friends at Cheers. Twitter is far too fast moving for such a cheerful, jaunty tune. Twitter, by comparison, is Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee!Facebook's social network was launched around 2004, the brain child of college students. Within seven years, it reportedly welcomed 600 million active users worldwide. The there was a book about it's origins and now we have a film (due for release February 2011, here in UK, already released in USA).Twitter appeared on the scene a couple of years later, in 2006. It's more of a micro-blogging site, based on the 140 characters allowed within a standard mobile phone text message. To date, it's said to have around 190 million users. Curiously, individuals, companies, charities and other groups appear to be using Twitter as a source of gathering customers, members or participants in all manner of things, including using it as an introductory gateway to... you got it, Facebook! But the two, allegedly, have no affiliation to one another - unless you count the vested interests of Marc Andreessen. Indeed, it was reported that Twitter declined an offer worth around $500 million from Facebook. Astonishingly, the Twitter founders still don't sound sure of which direction their company is heading, other than up. It's all very strange and beyond my comprehension. Everywhere we look we see signs, suggestions or hints of big names, but they are no longer those of tobacco, alcohol, drug or oil companies. Instead, they belong to the 21st Century World Wide Web - eBay, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook and now Twitter.Many TV shows, including news programmes, flash up a Twitter username for audience interaction or participation. 'Tweet us @whatever!' In fact, I've even noticed a trend toward small print simply saying @whatever, without any reference to Twitter! Only those 'in the know' understand it, though.Mobile phone networks seem to fit more comfortably with social networking than, say, retailers or service providers, although they are all begining to interact. URL shortening drives countless streams of traffic to countless websites and probably about 1% of those visitors convert to customers. But how do the numbers crunch for small players in this fast-flowing game of digital networking? Is success a dead cert or are the odds stacked against us?With a UK population of almost 62 million, the BBC can reach over two thirds of us every week. Programmes like Eastenders can attract viewer figures far in excess of 10 million. A major event, like the funeral of Princess Diana, attracted over 30 million viewers. (So did the 1966 World Cup!) That's just UK.Now let's go global, which is what WikiLeaks does when it hits the headlines throughout the International mass media network. I haven't looked at global figures, so I haven't a clue how many individuals on this planet have access to such things as TV, radio or Internet, but I do know that it's many, many millions and that the stakes are high when it comes to communicatioln with them all.WikiLeaks has been mentioned several times over the past months. What fantastic publicity! Almost every newspaper, TV station and news broadcaster has uttered the name. Just like eBay, YouTube, Amazon, Google and Facebook, WikiLeaks momentarily became a household 'name'. So, how well are they doing in the publicity stakes compared to others? Keep in mind that there's no income generated just from seeing a name. (All figures correct at time of writing.)How many people like eBay on Facebook? 411,320 How many usernames follow eBay on Twitter? 23,131How many people like the main BBC World News on Facebook? 521,551How many usernames follow BBC World News on Twitter? 448,671How many people like Amazon on Facebook? 525,467 How many usernames follow Amazon on Twitter? 58,948How many people like the WikiLeaks Facebook page? 1,557,588How many usernames follow WikiLeaks on Twitter? 679,918How many people like the main CNN on Facebook? 1,691,464How many usernames follow CNN Breaking News on Twitter? 3,754,210How many people like iPhone on Facebook? 1,872,655 How many usernames follow iPhone on Twitter? Can't find their official account!How many people like Google on Facebook? 2,499,468How many usernames follow Google on Twitter? 2,714,933 INTERESTINGHow many people like iTunes on Facebook? 10,218,408 How many usernames follow iTunes on Twitter? They have several categories:iTunes Trailers - 1,578, 784 : Music - 619,188 : Movies - 53,048 : TV - 45,312 : Pod casts - 43,725 How many people like YouTube on Facebook? 26,257,028How many usernames follow YouTube on Twitter? 1,556,061How many people like the Lady Gaga page on Facebook? 26,932,157 How many usernames follow Lady Gaga on Twitter? 7,869,076How many like the Lady Gaga page on Amazon?I think this tells us that virtual social networking, blogging and micro-blogging is more about negative escapism for the masses. We cannot accurately analyse the global reach of such platforms when they are subject to Government legislation, even banned in some countries, but we can begin to understand the enormity of the Internet and all the associated problems that brings with it. What I can see is that communication is key. Apple's iPhone, alone, boasts 62,949,864 monthly active users, so how many Internet users might there be?Next, in this comedy sketch, come the big guns, those who profit from providing the masses with an assortment of negative escape routes from the harsh realities of their lives – whether they be virtual, actual, medical or psychological. Their wingmen are the financial institutions and the major drugs, food, drink, alcohol and tobacco industries.Following them, there are the general money-makers, chasing along in an effort to entice the masses to part with their cash. Many don't care how, why, where or what for, it only matters that they succeed in generating wealth. The further down the line we go, the fewer stragglers there are with cash left over to spend. That's where we find the micro-loan companies springing up, in their hope of earning from those who have fallen by the wayside.So what does this all mean for a budding entrepreneur, frugal or otherwise? Where, next, should our enterprising minds and spare investment capital be heading? What might be, the next 'big thing'?Perhaps we should hold onto our hats, harness our dreams and be prepared for the ride of our lives. It could be fact, fiction and fantasy all rolled into one. It does not have to be within eyesight for us to see it, nor within earshot for us to hear it. Perhaps, even, the Mayans knew much more then than we do now.Think about it…Frugaldom Forums at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/Frugaldom Blog at http://www.frugaldom.com/Follow Frugaldom on Twitter"},

Over that time, you might be able to earn as much as 6.7p interest from a high interest savings account, so you can see that it isn't much of a challenge to beat that. As an added incentive, NYK Media will provide the initial £10 to selected, money savvy challengers...More hereIt's Saturday morning, just gone 10am. I'm sitting drinking coffee, eating toasted crumpets with homemade blackcurrant jam made with berries picked from the garden. Two thirds of the household hasn't, yet, surfaced, so I'm now wondering if it's the same all over Britain. How many people just don't waken at their normal times when it's the weekend? I could fill several books with the numbers and percentages my mind queries.Over the past week, I've crunched hundreds of numbers - household accounts, website affiliate figures, followers on Twitter, response levels to numbers in headlines, the number of 'professionals' who seem to have missed out that part of their education that dealt with spelling, punctuation and grammar (mine is far from perfect)... the list goes on and on and on. I must be mad to even contemplate being a part of this online media circus, let alone write about it, but it's so beguiling! It's TwitLit at it's best!If the majority of the nation is still asleep, what better chance to capitalise on their absence? The ducks and hens have been fed, eggs collected, stove's lit, bread is baking and the cat is calling in the kitchen, making an almighty racket that echos around the red and orange walls, yet still they sleep - the other occupants of the Frugaldom household, that is, not the walls! For now, this idiot is sitting here contemplating the future as a frugal entrepreneur, a frugaleur, if you like.It is not impossible to earn enough cyberdosh (cyber = virtual, dosh = cash: I felt the need to invent a few new words along the way) to generate yourself a healthy income and build a business. The biggest difference between success and failure seems to be based on cash! Most people and projects need it to start up, advertise, generate business, achieve targets and grow to become successful enterprises. Most people, that is, except for the 'frugal entrepreneurs'! They start out with very little, in some cases nothing, and pursue dreams of creating empires. Never give up on your dreams: at worst, you could become self sufficient in baking your own bread, even if you're rubbish at earning it - or vice versa!Frugal Entrepreneurs (Frugaleurs) are driven not by the need to make money, but by their need to realise dreams. (Shamelessly adapted from a definition found on http://www.entrepreneur.com)/A 'frugal entrepreneur' is someone who tries to make as much out of life as possible without focussing on cash and an advanced education. The ultimate goal is to live a rich and fulfilling life, free from financial worries. This goal needn't necessarily be achieved with copious amounts of cash and we'd do well to remember that.Business entrepreneurs judge their successes on how much profit they make. Social entrepreneurs judge their successes on how much social change they can achieve.Frugal entrepreneurs judge their successes on freedom from debt and fulfilment of a lifestyle dream. If becoming a frugaleur happens to lead to a fortune in the bank, then so be it. It's simply a by-product of a frugal lifestyle - making do, mending, bartering, recycling, reducing, reusing, sharing and helping others reach their goals. You can always give the cash away if you don't want it.I've pursued many, many different projects - some work, some don't, none have earned my fortune. But I think the secret has to be about living well within your means, regardless of how little or how much that may be, and making what's left work hard for you. Risk is unavoidable, but frugality should allow you to minimise that risk considerably. If needs must, pool funds with friends or family rather than pay interest to the banks.What is risk free, can provide you with an income and can guarantee that your capital increases to beat inflation year on year ad infinitum? I don't have the answer to that question. (I wish I did!) Banks and building societies certainly can't guarantee this, nor can Premium Bonds, so my guess is that people could pull a great deal of cash from those financial institutions, in favour of investing elsewhere. The big question is, where? The bigger question is, would they invest in you? The biggest question is, would you invest in you?WHAT'S NEXT?Frugal - economical, thrifty, resourceful, financially savvy without being mean.Entrepreneur - someone with initiative who takes risks in an attempt to make money, but should also accept responsibility for the consequences, come what may.Frugaleur - A frugal entrepreneur is in the business of making frugalism pay. My plan is to explore all avenues, regardless of how ludicrous they may seem to others. Words flow freely, it costs nothing to talk, write or type, so feel free to take this journey with me and share your own experiences. If nobody ever reads this, it has neither cost me, nor lost me a penny and that's the best way to look at doing anything on a budget. Building a frugal business is no different.

Admittedly, I do seem to have an Obsessive Compulsive Desire to crunch numbers, but it's always for the benefit of maintaining a debtfree and self-sustainable status and I usually share my findings for FREE. Number crunching - it's what gets us out of debt, it's what keeps us solvent, it's what allows us to speculate and, hopefully, accumulate. For the purposes of this research, I am analysing accounts from 40 individuals to take a sneaky peak at what they are most likely to spend their hard earned income on and what they are not prepared to give up, regardless of what austerity measures need to be put in place. My initial findings are surprising, to say the least.COMFORT - FOOD82.5%Luxury food items! As expected, the top item traded within the marketplace is food. No surprises there, we all need to eat and drink, so it's good business practice if you can incorporate something edible into your portfolio. However, my findings show that most people don't cut out the luxury items. More importantly, even those on the tightest of budgets will indulge in non-essential or luxury foodstuffs - takeaways, meals out or the odd treat, be it organic, freerange or gourmet. Food sells and that's all there is to it.COMFORT - HOUSEKEEPING57.5%My first surprise came in the form of the runner-up in my preliminary findings - domestic help! It seems many people hate household chores and would do without other things in order to get out of doing what they refer to as 'the mundane stuff'. From basic cleaning to sending the laundry off to be ironed, some folks just hate housekeeping and, for anyone prepared to put in a few hours work, there's an income to be earned right there. Anything, it seems, that helps keep the household or small business premises spick and span is not a luxury, it's an essential at all costs! There's certainly space to create a booming business by oiling those wheels - cleaning, ironing, window cleaning, carpet cleaning, painting & decorating, mending... COMFORT - FREEDOM FROM GUILT50%Now we come to the great outdoors. There's some fairly brisk trading going on within the gardening and pet sitting categories. I guess spending all your time trying to make ends meet means there's a chance you could neglect the garden or leave the dog shut in for too long while you're at work. But fear not, salve your conscience by hiring a gardener for an hour or two and having someone walk your dog or do some pet sitting for you.COMFORT - THE FEEL GOOD FACTOR35%Finally, in this brief update, is health related - alternative, complimentary or holistic therapies and feeling fit. If a shortage of money is getting us down, it seems help is always at hand and always within budget, no matter what. Massage, reflexology, crystal therapy, meditation... feeling better is worth the expense, it seems, even if it means buying a cheaper brand of everything in the supermarket.I cannot guarantee that these findings will translate to all other areas of the country, but I would be interested in discussing this further. Feel free to contact Frugaldom through the forum or via Twitter.What might this tell us? Well, it tells me that, regardless of the situation, people still want to feel good about themselves and their lives. I can completely relate to this and am now off to paint my nails a rather fetching shade of purple."},
{"title": "An Eggs-cellent Frugal Business", "date": "Wednesday 19 January 2011", "text": "January Sale Now On﻿﻿﻿ I'd like one of these, please!﻿﻿﻿ 2011, year three in Frugaldom and we're still pursuing the debt free, frugal living, frugal business, frugal blogging plan but now incorporating a frugal business plan for the future. Afterall, we still need to earn a living in order to pay all the bills. There's no such thing as cash free living, no matter how much we want to believe it exists. In a nutshell, it doesn't!﻿﻿ Not wanting to carry all my eggs in one basket, making Frugaldom self-sufficient in all things, including cash, means diversification from ground level. There are no employees, there are no doors to be opened to allow the public access and there are no lengthy meetings or negotiations to fit into my day. What I do have is a small poultry flock that needs caring for from dawn until dusk, literally.If you have any plans for keeping and rearing poultry or deriving part of your income from them, you'd probably be safest registering via Defra from the outset, get your flock onto the GB Poultry Register. At the moment, registration is voluntary for small keepers, but it is compulsory as soon as you reach 50 birds, including quail. Registration is completely free and it can be done online, so there's no excuse for not meeting minimum legal requirements once your flock is built up to a productive level. You'll also need to complete an annual questionnaire to confirm and/or update the numbers. This can also be done online.﻿ Freerange eggs﻿Being of a frugal nature, keeping hens means that eggs become part of the staple diet. It's not just hen eggs we eat, there are also the duck and quail eggs, so there are always plenty on the go, especially once the better weather gets here. Birds usually need around 14 hours of daylight to produce eggs, but there are always a few appear through the winter. We've been really lucky in that we've managed to have an average of half a dozen per day right throughout the worst of the winter weather. The main problem was collecting quail eggs before they froze solid - something for which the cat was extremely grateful, as she got all the defrosted eggs.﻿﻿﻿ Homemade Lemon Curd﻿ Spring will soon be creeping in and then egg production will soar. If the household can consume 40+ eggs per week then what happens when we're getting 100+ duck and hen eggs and another 100+ quail eggs? There's a limit to what we can sell, especially as the law dictates eggs can only be sold directly to the consumer. There's all sorts of legislation governing eggs and egg sales, so best stick to selling directly to friends, neighbours, family and colleagues. Quail eggs, on the other hand, are a delicacy that can be traded retail or wholesale, to the consumer or hotels, restaurants and wholesalers. Here in Frugaldom, I breed and rear Japanese Coturnix Quail mainly for eggs but it's the surplus eggs from the hens that get channelled into my small scale lemon curd production. I'm still tweaking the recipe to give it that 'something different' but feedback, so far, has been very positive for both the lemon and lime curds. I even make meringues and coconut macaroons in order to use up all the extra egg whites left over from using the bright yellow yokes. But before you jump for joy and rush out to start making and plying your wares, one word of caution: In order to make and sell food, it is mandatory that you have a valid and current Food Hygiene Certificate. Your certificate needs renewing every 3 years. On the plus side, it costs only £25 and you can do the short course and sit the exam online within a few hours. As long as you are only making small quantities when you have surplus eggs, this project shouldn't need further certification for the premises. This is a handy publication (downloads as a .pdf) about starting a food-based business.﻿﻿In the long run, I'd love to be able to build a Log Cabin and live the good life, but let's not try to run before we walk. In the meantime, if anyone has a scrap of land available for sale, please get in contact."},
{"title": "Life as a Frugal Entrepreneur: Self Sufficient Working", "date": "Tuesday 18 January 2011", "text": "The Frugaldom understanding of self-sufficiency is one of self-sustainability. It's about earning your own living and then spending accordingly, living within your means, regardless of how great or how meagre these may be. It's a lifestyle choice. Frugaldom is freedom from debt by way of living and working in frugal ways.Over the past few years we have organised various challenges relevant to moneysaving, clearing any debts and building a lifestyle that fits in with the whole ethos of sustainability. With a little bit of planning, this lifestyle can enbrace greener living or a more environmentally-friendly way of conducting business within the household and workplace. Frugaldom is about taking on the responsibility of providing for yourself and, hopefully, being able to share skills, goods and services in a way that can both benefit others and cover all associated costs. True, cash free self-sufficiency, in my opinion, isn't legally possible within the UK. In order to live and work, we need shelter and that shelter incurs a tax. In order to live we need food and water - we could attempt to rear and grow all of our own food and pump our water from a well, but in order to do so there are welfare issues and legislation to be considered - these things cost money. We still need to earn and, as long as we earn, we need to pay taxes where and when due. Some might trade and barter or move around but, at the end of the day, everyone needs an income and earing that income costs money. True Frugaldom means the ability to provide all things for the household in order to sustain a chosen lifestyle and afford everything that it entails. There should be no need for State hand outs but neither should there be an aversion to seeking financial help where and when genuinely needed.  In this respect, it is time to start building our self-sustainable business in order to help secure our future.  We are our own employers, without working (for ourselves) we can neither pay ourselves nor keep a business running.On the surface, it's always handy to grow whatever fruit and vegetables you can, as everything you can produce from home is one less thing you need to spend money on, allowing you to focus your hard-earned cash elsewhere. Over the past few years we have documented the costs involved in setting up a garden to produce as much as possible, including eggs from the assorted poultry. We can make each micro-project self sustaining or cash-neutral; hens lay eggs, selling the surplus can pay for their keep. Quail lay eggs and are quickly hatched and reared - the sales of surplus birds and eggs can cover the costs. Cash generated from any source can be used to neutralise each of these individual budgets, each of these projects can be built up to combine into one business. It's what microholding is about - all these small, self-financing pieces of the jigsaw fitting together to form a much bigger picture - that picture is your business of the future.Christmas and all the festivities have now passed and we're halfway through the first month of the new year. For those who are still relying on other people's money, the credit card and bank statements will be arriving, reminding you of the dire state of your finances. But not for all of us. For the debt free, each statement is a reminder that there is an alternative route, one that can and should be followed carefully if Frugaldom is to be achieved. I have estimated that for every £1,000 it costs you to exist each year, you NEED to save £2.75 each and every day that you're not earning. So, if life is costing you £12,000 a year, you need to save £33 for every day that you won't be earning, weekends included. The figures are simple - the less life costs you, the less pressure you are under to earn or save extra. Building a business isn't so different. Everything has to pay for itself, some things need to pay more to cover the inanimate objects that house them, some need to cover the cost of storage and distribution. In the case of gardening, plants need to cover the cost of the patch of land they take up each and every day it takes them to grow - fertiliser, protection from pests, time in planting, tending and harvesting... consider all costs, don't ever assume that because you did it that your time is completely free. Any legislation governing what you do needs to be accounted for, just like the costs involved in owning a car to enable you to go about your daily life. If that car costs you £500 to have it parked in the driveway for 365 days of the year then that's almost £1.37 that needs to be earned every single day without even driving the car. (The figures get much bigger when you factor in the percentage that's needed to cover tax and National Insurance etc.) Only by analysing the true costs of living and working can we begin to understand the basic principles of self-sustainability and self-sufficiency. After 10+ years of lifestyle planning, 2011 is my year of Frugaldom business planning.Fel free to follow Frugaldom on Twitter or join me in the Frugaldom ForumsI've just received the following message via an email from elephant-loan.co.uk, a company that I have never had any dealings with, nor do I intend to, especially now:==========================Dear xxxFinancial Institutions, Lenders, Banks and Building Societies have changed their Lending Criteria due to the current financial climate. You now meet the Basic Lending Criteria as you are; over 18 years old, in some form of employment, earn more than £650 per month, have access to a bank account and are paid at least once a month. Therefore:You have been Pre-Approved for a loan of up to £15,000 Loans available to Tenants and Home Owners New loan rates starting at 7.9% APR CCJs, Arrears and Defaults accepted Loan amounts from £80 to £25,000 ========================Just a little bit annoyed by the above because it is a prime example of how some gullible fools can be lulled into a false sense of security and encouraged to take on debt! The red text was highlighted by me. I fully understand that there are millions of people out there who have debt, but there are so many of those people who shouldn't really have had access to credit in the first place because they simply cannot budget for themselves. I know - I was one of them!We nearly all fell for the endowment policy sales - the guy selling them wore a suit, why question him. We nearly all fell for the 'take a loan, it's only X amount each month', we nearly all fell for the 'have a store card, get 10%  off all your purchases today' and we nearly all forgot to ask what happens if or when our circumstances change and then we cannot afford to pay it. That was probably because we'd nearly all been brainwashed into believing that Personal Payment Protection Insurance would save us. When it didn't, many became unstuck. (Few policies cover self-employment - check the small print.) When the endowments failed to pay out enough to cover the original mortgages, many became unstuck. When the interest rates went up and up and up, many became unstuck. It's the monstrous debt trap all over again, waiting to swallow up the next generation. But it's not too late to alert them to the dangers. The Government won't do it - they can't even climb out their own debt pit! So it has to be up to us, as friends, colleagues, family or even just as someone wanting to help avert a future tragedy; we are the ones who must 'save the world' if it really is money that makes this wacky world go round... and if anyone really does want saving!MY TOP 10 TIPS FOR BECOMING DEBT FREEDon't incur any more debtKeep up payments on existing debt to avoid costly defaults or service chargesPlan to clear those existing debts one by one, most expensive firstPrioritise ALL spendsStop spending on non-essentials - do you smoke/drink/go to the gym/expect holidays etc?Get your spending priorities right - if you have debt worries then your priorities need changingMake savings wherever possible - cook & bake more, make your own laundry detergent, cancel subscriptions etcCalculate your true budgetStick to that budgetDon't try to save cash while there's debt unless that debt is interest free and you can earn more by saving any surplus after making the minimum payments.I think my biggest shock has been seeing how some people deal with debt. It is their inability to take initial responsibility or to see it as a result of their own doing, their own overspending, that astounds me most. A budget should always include 'spare cash left over', because that's what gets saved for the weeks or months when there is nothing left, for when the choice of avoiding the overdraft looks most bleak. It's also the only money that can, realistically, be spent on luxury, non-essential wants, as opposed to real needs.Most of us fall into the trap of thinking we can't afford to save a fixed percentage of our income when, in actual fact, that should probably be one of the most important regular expenses we incur whilst earning. It's the best way to protect ourselves from future, possibly severe, austerity measures. Saving is good, regardless of how hard the banks are currently trying to penalise us for it. If you don't want to save it in cash, save it in something that you know FOR A FACT will be able to help you out during a financial crisis. Don't resort to fiddling the figures in order to burden yourself with more debt. Drag out that breadmaker, get yourself down to the library and swat up on your frugal living habits, swat up on your batch cooking skills, dust down the sewing machine and get your knitting needles out; if you don't want to wear charity shop clothes, redesign them. Do anything, just don't sit and sulk until you've drowned in debt."},
{"title": "It's Blue Monday, It's #debtday, It's Another New Beginning!", "date": "Monday 17 January 2011", "text": "Depending on where you skim or absorb your daily news and topical updates, today might be 'Blue Monday'. It's reportedly the most depressing day of the year. But, apparently, the phrase was only coined by Haven Holidays around 2005 as part of some advertising campaign or other. Other than that, most of us think of it as a song, so why not sing away the blues if you experience them?It's also #debtday on Twitter - a debt awareness campaign being tweeted out to the nation by the team at CCCS as part for their free debt help.Regardless of what you think of today, it is still another new day, another new beginning, another opportunity to progress along your chosen path or turn off in a new direction. Today, as they say, is the first day of the rest of your life, and life as we know it is changing. Relationships are changing, the way we earn is changing, the way we interact with each other is changing and even the way we perceive our own lifestyles is changing. So let's make this a day of change. Is there one tiny thing you can think of that could be changed to help further your quest for whatever your current aim, goal or ambition really is. Could this be the first day of your progress towards realising your own dream?I've just been reading Ricksblog about a film called, 'The Social Network' and was so taken with what the great Mr Schwartz had to say about it that I've now added it to my 'must see' list of films for this year. As you all know, going to the movies isn't on the Frugaldom budget and, with such unreliable TV reception about here, even seeing advertising and trailers for movies is limited, so I'm not all that up on what's happening in the land of film and entertainment. But having an Internet connection, albeit a slow one, and having experienced the incredible world of social networking, this struck a chord with me. A quick bit of research shows that the film is based on a book, The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal and, better still, the entire screenplay of 'The Social Network' is available FREE OF CHARGE to download and read for yourself as a .pdf file. so that's what I have done for now - downloaded Aaron Sorkin's screenplay. It seemed like the most frugal answer to the 'I want it now' scenario created by the good Mr Schwartz, thank you very much. For UK viewers, 'The Social Network' is due out February 2011 on DVD and the book - The Accidental Billionaires - is available to buy for under £5, eligible for free P&P.Right now, it's lunchtime in the Frugaldom household, so I need to go slice a newly baked loaf and gather a few more eggs from the garden hens. I fully intend reading the screen play and then I'll be back to let you know what I think.Edited in - I didn't know that about China, either!"},
{"title": "Brilliant Weekend of Sociable Social Media Moneysaving!", "date": "Sunday 16 January 2011", "text": "Don't you just love all this 'social media' whizzkid stuff? It's so moneysaving that it's completely FREE! It even sends your responses to your mobile if you want them there, free of charge. AMAZING! Orange, I believe, were the quickest off the draw in firing up that department.I love it that the founders of Twitter appear not to know what their long-term goals are for the site, nor do they engage in its use all that often. In reports, they seem to admit that it's some sort of global entity (barring places like China, I guess) that has taken on a life all of its own - I even read the term 'eco system' somewhere, but I'm not sure that's very apt. I love that the site has exploded over the past 4 years and I love that we, the common people, can keep ahead of what the mass media subjects us to via our TV screens, radios and newspapers. Now, however, we are able to peel it all back and look behind the sensationalism of the tabloids. I would venture as far as suggesting that such platforms could, quite easily, bring about the downfall of newsprint.Now for the most intriguing part, the part that has me completely stumped. It's also a problem I can closely associate with... how does it pay? Imagine hosting an extended party for millions of people and having to contain the event within one location. Imagine the costs involved in preparing such an area, furnishing it with everything needed to host the event and then finding out all your guests wanted to bring all their friends with them and stay permanently. Worse still, many of those attending want text message reminders of everything. It all adds up to a phenomenal amount of money to cover costs. HOW DOES IT PAY?Looking at it logically, the mobile network tie-in has to be one source of revenue, because so many members can now text news and photos direct to the networking sites. The likes of Orange must be creaming a fortune from the huge increase in their network traffic through their deal with Twitter alone. But I digress... the economics of online social networking isn't what I meant to get into right now. What I would like to show you is how simple and effective the likes of Facebok and Twitter can be for moneysavers and, dare I say it, followers of Frugaldom. So come on people, let's see you all making the most of a fantastic opportunity here. There's absolutely nothing in it for me by way of any affiliation, but please join Twitter and then follow Frugaldom. Here is one reason why... I needed to spend money! There were two items I needed that I could neither source for free nor borrow. I'm not talking fortunes, here, I just needed a book (work related) and a humble kitchen kettle (home related). In true frugal living and working fashion, I began my research for the best deals.Amazon is normally a pretty safe bet for best prices on many things, especially when you're sitting in a prime position holding vouchers, mosty earned from points gathering and cashback sites. I found the £14.99 paperback book marked down to £8.49 and eligible for free delivery. But let's not order just yet - let's TWEET! (Post a short message onto Twitter.)Amazon runs an affiliate scheme whereby members can earn commissions on sales, so I 'Tweeted' out a message asking for someone to post an affiliate link to my chosen book. It wasn't long before I had a response. Not only did I buy my bargain and save myself over £5 on the book's cover price, I was also able to help a fellow Amazon affiliate member earn a few pence extra in commission.Next up was the kettle - I wanted a large capacity, low energy model so I could save on electricity. What with the power prices going up and the number of times this household boils the kettle for a cuppa, I reckoned there must be savings to be made there, even allowing for the fact that any extra boiled water gets decanted to a thermos flask. So I posted on Twitter and Facebook. Here's how that went:Me:  Does anyone know for a fact if these eco-friendly, superfast kettles really boil water faster, cost less to run and save on CO2 emissions? Brain can't compute that less power can boil water faster. Surely it must just be more power, less time but same cost per unit overall?Response:  Power is a rate of transmission of energy. You can only make comparisons if the power rating is used in conjunction with the time taken to boil the same amount of water. It will only use less total energy if a) the heating element is more efficient at converting electricity into heat or b) the loss of energy to the surrounding is less during the heating process, perhaps through insulating or vacuum-lined kettle walls and base. Of course, you may well find that a superfast kettle will work faster, and perhaps even work more efficiently, possibly saving you money on electricity, but will it last as long as a conventional kettle and need to be replaced after a shorter lifetime. We had a \"fast boil\" kettle replaced under warranty in less than a year.Me:  Thanks, Dave. Just contemplating buying a new kettle and looking at cost-effectiveness (as you'd fully expect). I can't help but be tempted to make do with the old one and invest in a new, much larger, traditional one that can be sat on top of the stove. No electricity needed to boil that, as long as the stove is lit, and enough in there for rinsing up the dishes. It could save on electricity in two ways - less need for the immersion heater and no need to boil the other kettle. However, the large, traditional urn-type stove top kettles are several times the price of cheap electricals... but nothing can ever go wrong with them unless they rust.£50 Vs £20 ... decisions, decisions... I'll bet you already know which way this is going to go!Response: I'm guessing stove top kettles need a thick metallic base to conduct the heat up to the water, that, and economies of scale relative to plastic leccy ones, is probably what makes them so expensive. Nice though! See ebay item 190487521687 or 200563748687Me: I already have a little Le Creuset whistling kettle, that's what I'm using now on the stove. I also use the camping kettle and the stainless steel tea pot works well once the tea's brewed. But I need greater volume of hot water for dishes. THANK YOU! ...That's a great find on eBay with the 3.5L model. Better still... I have my January 'eBay plus' voucher still to use! YEAH! Pat on the back for Dave - just bought me one of his finds! £16.09 after redeeming the voucher. ! also got 37 eBay plus points, cashback for going via TCB and cashback for funding PayPal with a cashback credit card. Job done!  The kettle I'd looked at in a hardware store was priced at £44.99, so that's a saving of at least £28.90 without factoring in the extra cashback.Response: Short answer to the original question is no! (thanks J and J)So there we have it - the simple act of buying a book or a kettle and it's already proving to be very beneficial when doing so with the help of social media platforms. It's easy to understand how helpful sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace etc can all be but it still doesn't explain how these websites make their money. That's still a mystery to me. But I don't simply want to make money out of social media or online networking, I want to SAVE money. A penny saved is a penny earned, so this weekend's socialising has earned me £35.40 for the hour or so it took me to check the posts, respond, order and, finally, put this blog together.Follow Frugaldom on Twitter and stay ahead of the game - tweet your bargain finds so you're sharing the news with friends and followers - instantly.Join us in the fun, frugal forum at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/Read the Frugaldom Blog at http://www.frugaldom.com/Follow Frugaldom on www.twitter.com/frugaldom"},
{"title": "Give Us Our Daily Bread", "date": "Saturday 15 January 2011", "text": "We're now about halfway through January, 2011. To date, this  year, much of what I have been reading has been about costcutting,  moneysaving, stretching the budget and trying to escape 'the rat race'. For  most, it seems, it boils down to a growing dislike of current lifestyle  or of a particular situation.    This feeling of discontent can be stirred by underlying causes such as  family life, work, relationships, health, an apparent inability to control  income and expenditure or just lack of free time (or energy) to perform any  form of balancing act, let alone have some fun and reap the rewards.     One thing common to all of the above is an innate need to 'do something  about it' in an attempt to change a lifestyle that can no longer  be sustained. We have three choices:      Increase income to enable current lifestyle to continue or improve   Reduce expenditure to bring about acceptable changes then adapt the    lifestyle accordingly   Give up and drop out of society - doesn't seem to work very well on any    level The above things can be tackled individually and exclusively, or they can  be worked together into a combination that suits. It's a bit like making bread:  you need the correct amount of each of the basic ingredients to get the mix  right, then you knead it to get all the right reactions. Leave it to prove  itself and then, if you want, you can punch it all back down and start again  before finally moulding it into shape and baking it it into your daily lifestyle  loaf. With a bit of forethought, that resulting loaf will cost about the same,  regardless of which method you choose. Probably the most dificult part is  deciding on which ingredients are most important to you.    A 25p homemade loaf can be enjoyed just as much as a 99p loaf. It's much  the same with most things if you are happy with your lifestyle. I reckon this  analogy can work just as well for business or homelife - it's the affordability  and sustainability that really counts.     Join us in the fun, frugal forum at www.frugaldom.coRead the Frugaldom  Blog at www.frugaldom.comFollow  Frugaldom on www.twitter.com/frugaldom"},
{"title": "Time to Start Planning Your Microholding", "date": "Thursday 13 January 2011", "text": "MICROHOLDINGIt's almost mid-January, the ground is still frozen, part of mine is waterlogged and yet more of it is undermined, nae, completely riddled, by moles. Looks like I've lost an apple tree to the little blinders, too! Time marches on regardless, so I'm dragging out the box of seeds and starting to plan this year's garden for that part of my 2011 frugal challenge. This self-sufficiency lark isn't as easy as many might think, so I guess I'm lucky that I equate earning my money to growing a cash crop. The better the harvest in one area, the less importance or reliance there needs to be on another. So let's start at the beginning, by analysing what it is we NEED from our gardens, or microholdings.The main Frugaldom lifestyle revolves around a semblance of self-sufficiency in all things, including cash. So, first and foremost, I need to be fully aware of how much cash is needed to keep the household running comfortably, throughout the year.Household bills - electricity, insurance, telephone, Internet, TVFuel - coal, logs, firelighters, matchesGroceriesCleaning products and toiletriesSelf-employment costs - National Insurance contributions etcFamily petsGarden poultryTransportGifts for family and friendsExtras - club memberships, savings policies, charitable donations etcEvery household has its own version of the household budget. We now want to build in a plan of action that will both contribute to the income and reduce the expenditure in a way that balances out into a cost-effective, cash-neutral, work in progress. There is absolutely no point in spending £200 on vegetable seedlings and compost when you would normally only spend half of that when buying potatoes, carrots and onions from the supermarket. It is false economy. Instead, think about what you spend your money on and then plan accordingly. Microholding is about holding as few risky investments as possible - they need to break even, at the very least.This household uses around 4 dozen eggs each week, which amounts to almost £250 per year had we chosen to opt for the very cheapest, supermarket-bought ones. But I want to help support ethical farming and promote cruelty-free egg production. I'd also like to see changes in current legislation governing the definition of the term 'freerange'. All these factors mean that I would probably need to pay up to 34p per egg for truly freerange eggs (~ £850 per year). That is one ENORMOUS difference in price! I value my own garden hen, duck and quail eggs highly. If I average the cost out at 20p per egg, then my annual bill would be around £500. It costs me less than this to keep the hens and I always have extras for selling during summer months, so it is viable. The poultry will pay for themselves on the condition that I sell all the surplus eggs and/or any resulting chicks. If I've shown a profit by the end of the year, I'll be delighted!We should eat at least 5 portions of fruit and veg per day, according to health specialist, so that's 5,475 portions for this household of three over the year. Let's call it 5,500, because I don't like messy numbers. Has anyone, anywhere, actually calculated the average cost of those 5-a-day? There's no way I could grow all of that in my garden, especially when you take into account that potatoes don't count as one of your 5-a-day. I reckon I can only allocate 10p per portion for this and use that as a starting point. Does that sound about right? Just as well we don't eat much meat here because that's half the grocery budget accounted for already, unless I'm able to grow plenty in the garden. On a budget of £1 per person per day, 50p per person per day goes on the 5-a-day, leavin 50p per day for everything else? It's not much when you think about it that way, is it? But for every portion of fresh produce that can be grown in the garden, it's 10p saved on the budget. (I have a sneaking suspicion that 10p is nowhere near the amount needed, but if we need account for all those beans and pulses, which DO count, then the averafe price has to come down.Quick recapOur microholding needs to produce at least 208 dozen eggs and 5,500 portions of fruit and vegetables. It also needs to generate enough income from surplus egg and poultry sales to cover the cost of feeding and bedding for the livestock. The other alternative is to generate a cash income of £1050 just to buy eggs, fruit and veg.What I'm aiming for is a happy medium, whereby the cash generated plus the eggs, fruit and veg, all balances out and allows a little left over to show a profit, even if it is by way of trading lemon curd via the LETS group.Where and when to startStart now!We already know that we need £4,000 to keep this household ticking over for a year, so the main aim is to keep within this budget and make adjustments to cover changes. When global markets affect local prices, we need to be prepared to meet any sudden increases or to invest in bulk buying to help reduce costs wherever possible. Taking part in a frugal challenge is a bit like balancing a plank on a barrel see-saw fashion: the barrel can roll either way but it's up to you to keep things balanced by moving with it. Counteract the shifts. If carrots hate growing in your garden but leeks do really well, concentrate on the leeks and trade the surplus with a friend who grows carrots. You could even sell the extra leeks and go buy carrots. If electricity prices increase, see what can be done to get useage down. (I recommend the 'imeasure' site for this.)  If wheat prices increase, check to make sure you aren't cheaper feeding your hens mash or pellets. It's all just one big balancing act - tending your garden is the exact same.﻿﻿ ﻿ Square foot garden from  railway sleepers﻿ ﻿﻿ Source free seeds now - keep an eye on the Frugaldom forums, as we post about them here. Some folks have already started germinating their first pepper and tomato seeds in pots on windowsills. I've restrained myself. I know there's no point in my attempting anything this early, but that's not to say I don't have salad leaves growing. These are already in plastic tubs under glass and they've survived the sub-zero winter temperatures so far. With luck, the weather will be a little kinder this weekend and allow me out into the mini-makeshift greenhouse to assess any winter damage. Hopefully, it won't be too serious, but the high winds haven't really arrived here, yet. ﻿ Plants keep growing, squares keep fillingThe pergola we built over the raised patio is looking exceedingly lop-sided but it has, to be fair, succeeded in holding the plastic roof of the greenhouse in place. This corner of Frugaldom will be one of only two growing areas this coming year, the other being the raised beds constructed from four railway sleepers. That area is my favourite, as it's all about square foot gardening, which I love! So much produce from so little space, absolutely amazing! And better still, it just keeps on growing. I still have a square filled with leeks, a few brassicas that are clinging on to dear life after the near-arctic confitions, and a row of early carrots that were sown as seeds in October. Incredibly, these seem to be surviving the winter. On the other hand, the winter cabbages look more like over-cooked spinach spread on the ground than anything resembling green, leafy vegetables that will ever be worth eating! I suspect they'll be getting dug into the soil as soon as the ground thaws enough to turn it.Here's hoping that the coming days brings us some drier weather, but it's not looking too promising. At worst, I'll get the seeds looked out and plan my square foot garden.

{"title": "The Cost of the Weekly Shop, Part II.", "date": "Tuesday 11 January 2011", "text": "Further to my previous post about the cost of the weekly shoppingI have been sitting looking at a year's worth of receipts from 2008. They made for very interesting reading, if you like that sort of thing. Sadly, as an avid number cruncher, I get a warped satisfaction out of analysing such things, then challenging myself to beat any apparent 'system'.The first items looked at were from January 2008 receipts: a small block of cheese priced at £1.74 and a 500g pack of pasta for 20p - today, a small block of cheese costs £2.99 and the cheapest pack of pasta is 49p. 2008 price - £1.942011 price - £3.48Correct me if my arithmetic is wrong, but I make that almost 80% increase overall.But don't despair... that same month in 2008 it was costing me £1.48 for 2 litres of milk. Today it costs £1!Sultanas were costing 43p per pack in 2008, (as opposed to a small fortune now) but, \"Can't Believe It's Not Butter\" was an incredible £1.15 per tub. This week, it's on half price offer at 62p, so not too much difference there.It seems as though it's butter and cheese that are mopping up the shortfall in milk as a loss leader, so it would appear that general grocery prices are still pretty stabilised, as long as you are prepared to adapt your eating habits to fit your budget. Cheapest cut of minced beef has increased around 25% but poultry appears to have more than doubled, as have eggs. Flour is creeping up, but nowhere near as quickly as bread, so homebaking is still an option. To me it looks as though it's the huge increase in fuel and utilities prices that affects manufacturing and distribution costs of freshly baked goods - yet another reason why freshly baked at home may be better, especially during cold weather when you need to heat the house anyway.Within the household chemicals department - washing up liquids, laundry detergents and other similar products - there has been a massive shift, with many products more than doubling in price. Indeed, the supermarkets' basic saver, non-branded products have all but disappeared. (That was my greatest disappointment in 2008 - the final nail in the coffin for 14p washing up liquid.) But fear not, cheap vegetable soap and washing soda are still available for us ardent frugalites who make our own laundry detergent (see earlier post for recipe). What's more, vinegar remains inexpensive if you want that added comfort of softer clothes. They always say white vinegar is best, but I've had no problems using malt - not even staining.Hot beverages - we were heavy coffee drinkers in the days of 69p instant coffee, but we've found ourselves drinking more and more tea, recently. With coffee now costing about 100% more (for our chosen cheap but drinkable brand) and teabags costing something ridiculous like three for a penny, it's obvious where we're being led in the hot drinks stakes. But fear not! Although non-branded instant hot chocolate may be increasing slowly in price, the fact that you can now buy 100g of fairly edible, dare I say enjoyable, chocolate for around 30p shouldn't be overlooked. Luxury in a cup, right enough, once you grate a square of that over your supper drink. You can even afford the decadence of making it with milk!Next time you read a sensationalised headline about food prices in a newspaper or magazine, or hear it on the news, don't gasp and quake at the thought of how you are going to manage to feed your family and stay afloat. Stop and ask yourself how you are going to adapt. Prioritise your grocery spends to make the most of these shifting sands as they reshape the way we shop, the way we eat, the way we drink and, even, the way we think about our household budgets. There is no place for brand loyalty in the fight against debt.The recent VAT increase may have caused all sorts of problems for retailers who are having to alter their prices, but it also appears to have brought a great opportunity for supermarkets to increase their prices across the board.Each week we visit town, we check out the stores' own basic brands and, without fail, the prices have been climbing steadily. This week, however, there apeared to be a blatant 10% increase! It wasn't difficult to spot, as a friend buys a pack of Sainsbury's sausage rolls as a treat for her dogs: \"It's only £1,\" she normally says, and hands over a coin. But not this time! £1.10 and the need to break a fiver! And for what? A tiny piece of puff pastry wrapped around a minimal amount of sausage meat and rusk, if you're lucky there might be some onion flavouring in there, not that the dogs care. I'm not complaining about this, but I am CONCERNED for those who have HAD to downshift their brands in order to survive. If there's no more money to spare, how will these people afford the increases after having had it so good for so long on the cheap food merry-go-round?Over Christmas, I received a nifty little set of pasty makers as part of a gift. They're plain, white plastic contraptions, three different sizes, with crimping edges on one side and pastry cutting edges on the other. (By Kleeneze.) The largest will probably be ideal for Cornish-style pasties, the middle one for fruit turnovers and the smallest, as suggested by neighbour, will be great for homemade pasta stuffed with whatever filling the leftovers can provide. I guess you could also use them to make crispy pancakes - like those Findus things we loved as kids but hate as adults - if you wanted to take the time to thinly roll pastry then dip it all in breadcrumbs before frying or baking them. Anyhow, all of this is leading up to the potential to ditch sausage roll buying and, instead, opt for homemade pasties. That's the next experiment to begin in the Frugaldom kitchen!I'm afraid we seldom buy butter, which is a shame, as I much prefer that on my homemade wholemeal toast to margarine or 'of course that's not butter' spread. But prices have shot through the roof, with a 250g pack hitting £1.50 whilst the store's own basic brand is only 2p short of £1. In saying that, the spreads have practically doubled in price! I would love to be able to use butter for all the cooking and baking but it just isn't possible while sticking to a rigid budget. Butter has become a luxury item and home made isn't an option. I know it is still possible to buy whole milk from registered farms in England, but here in Scotland it is strictly illegal. Looks like cheap spread is the only option and butter reserved for special occasions. It's just as well it freezes, that's all I can say!Meanwhile, back in the fruit and veg aisle of Aldi, I can buy half a dozen Spanish tomatoes for 39p. It makes me wonder how much the Spanish householders pay for them? Of course, we're all fully aware of loss leaders and, like the milk, the weekly fruit and veg offers in Aldi must be loss leading promotions. I wonder how long it will be before the Government bans such a practice? (Possibly around about the time they want to abolish 'best before' dates on dried or tinned foods.)This afternoon, I looked out my 2008 accounts and am about to immerse myself in receipts and invoices to calculate the REAL cost of inflation, by way of grocery prices. I've only just glanced at some receipts and am already horrified by what I see, but I won't spoil the surprise. After careful analysis, I'll be back to update the Frugaldom blog, so WATCH THIS SPACE.Join us in the fun, frugal forum at http://www.frugaldom.coRead the Frugaldom Blog at http://www.frugaldom.com/"},
{"title": "Saving on the Annual Costs of Laundry", "date": "Friday 7 January 2011", "text": "Shop-bought laundry detergent is becoming a luxury item!It may not seem much at the time, but laundry detergent is becoming somewhat of a luxury for many frugalers. Naturally, we were all very keen to get out of having to pay pounds at the supermarkets for glossy boxes of powder, tablets, capsules and plastic containers filled with chemically enhanced liquid. That was how we all discovered the marvelous 'LAUNDRY GLOOP'. It had been discussed often on the Moneysavingexpert website, so it had to be worth a try, adapting the 'recipe' to suit our water type.I'm not sure if it's because of our soft water, here in Scotland, but I get almost 50% more out of one bar of soap than was originally recommended. Please keep this in mind if you decide to make your own, homemade laundry detergent. If it sets too thick, just reheat it slightly then dilute it or else dilute a tablespoonful at a time in some hot water as and when needed.I made my first batch in 2009 after having used *soapnuts for the previous year or so. I haven't bought any laundry detergent in a long time! It now amounts to a saving of around £1 per week for this household, an extra £50+ into the savings pot for other things - anything except spending it on laundry detergent.﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ Frugal Laundry Detergent ﻿﻿﻿1 Bar of soap, grated (or 8 tblsp soap flakes)1 cup of washing soda 2 litres water few drops of essential oil﻿﻿I'm a little bit extravagant with my recipes, as I prefer to use Natural Extracts soap, which is already infused with tea tree and lavender. I keep a small stock of it - it's available from Sainsbury's at around 38p per bar - and it's also great for adding into gift baskets. Sheer luxury for the frugal living!Boil the water in a big stock pot or similar, dissolve the soda crystals and soap in it, add the essential oil and then dilute to at least 5 litres. (I make mine up to 7 litres.) It takes a bit of time to fully dissolve the soap, but make sure it's all gone before you dilute, cool and decant the liquid. I store mine in 7 litre lidded buckets, after finding out it was too thick to pour from a 5 litre container. I use a ladel to fill a plastic laundry ball and then that goes in the machine.As with all washing machines, you'll still need to give your machine a boil wash cycle every few months to ensure all the hoses stay clear of soap residue. This homemade laundry cleaner works equally well as a hand wash for you ultra frugalites who live without the modern convenience of an automatic washing machine or a twin tub. I have used it often in my Ventus 'Twister' foot operated washer.I make 2 lots of detergent at a time, one has a few drops of blue dye in it to help 'whiten' whites. I also now make it for another friend, who is always happy to return a favour by way of some freshly picked strawberries or the odd bunch of carrots.Frugal Washing Up LiquidHeaped tbsp grated soap or soap flakes (Natural, not heavily scented) Heaped tbsp soda crystals 1 tbsp vinegar 1 tbsp lemon juice 3 litres water few drops essential oil (tea tree & lavender) Exactly the same as for laundry gloop but please note that this will NOT lather up like ordinary washing up liquid. The mass produced liquid is chemically enhanced in the commercial product to make those soapy bubbles. Again, I tried this using 'Natural Soap with lavender & teatree'. One bar grates down to produce 8 heaped tablespoonsful of flakes and it saves on the expense of buying essential oils.You can use ordinary white vinegar as a fabric softener without it leaving your laundry smelling like the local chippy.I use the same quantities of the above as I would if using their shop-bought equivalents. *Another moneysaving option is to use natural soapnuts instead of laundry detergent. These can also be used to make washing up liquid. See http://www.inasoapnutshell.com/ for more information and a FREE SAMPLE (just pay postage). I was very pleased with these, especially as £4 bought enough to last a full year for us. But even that's a bit expensive when comparing it to the homemade liquid. You can make a year's supply of that for around £2 if you stick to store's own basic soap, as the washing soda is under £1 per bag and is enough to make gallons of the stuff. I have to admit, though, I do get beguiled into buying washing up liquid when it's on special offer. I think I've been subliminally programmed to expect bubbles in my washing bowl.Frugal hint - Always keep a good stock of soap, vinegar, lemon juice, washing soda and baking soda - with that little lot, you probably have enough to keep the whole house spick and span, all the washing kept up to date and the daily dishes done without the need to buy anything else. Away from the rural communities, I'm led to believe you can buy basic soap for less than 5p per bar! We don't get bargains like that in our local stores, that's for sure.Join us in the frugal forums"},
{"title": "More to Reconsider - More Budget Rejigging", "date": "Tuesday 4 January 2011", "text": "Every Penny Really Does CountHaving just checked my Topcashback account, I see that it's offering a bonus for accepting Amazon vouchers instead of cash. Now I know that Frugaldom isn't meant to be about spending, but this could be an ideal way of racking up a few more pennies into the gifts category, freeing any cash already alloted to that elsewhere... It seems a pretty easy way to me to increase part of the gift budget savings by 2.5% rather than the 0% available from the current account. Yes... I have talked myself into this one and just need to decide when to claim. There's £9.91 there at the moment, but it's £10.16 if I claim it as a gift certificate now. Just in case you've missed this, if can sign up to Topcashback then you can get cashback from all your shopping when using their relevant links. Even those eBay purchases can earn you a few pennies back, as long as you remember to log into your account before shopping, bidding or buying. Since joining this site, I have accrued a total of £527.62 and have already claimed £476.87 And lest we forget, I normally pay everything I buy using a cashback credit card paying 1% with no fees - it all mounts up and every penny counts.OK, I decided that a moneybird in the hand is worth two in the bush and claimed the £10.16 Amazon voucher. I'll let you all know how long it takes to arrive. I will need to rejig the Frugaldom challenge budget again to reflect this change in plans for the 2011 gifts category.Never forget to ask...Is there cashback available?Is this available cheaper anywhere else?Is there a bonus available for accepting vouchers rather than cash?Is this the very best deal I can get? http://www.frugaldom.co/ Don't forget you can join us in the Frugaldom ForumsReconsidering all my options.﻿﻿﻿ Reed Bunting﻿﻿﻿This time last year, it was snowing. Temperatures were sub zero and all around us was white. The lane was frozen solid, almost impassable because of it's icy state, glittering invitingly to anyone who dared even attempt to skim its glassy surface in anything more than a pair of wellies. Walking, although a very frugal pastime, was quite treacherous, but not so much that it deterred us from partaking of frugal photography. Within the scope of affordable inventions, I reckon digital cameras surpass most new visual technology. They have opened up the doors to a whole new world for amateur photographers, especially those who had previously found the costs of film, development, delayed results and, ultimately, wastage, prohibitive. No more shall we feel the financial pain of throwing away the bad photos, for the 21st Century brought technological magic to the fingertips of ever prudent, camera-wielding wizard - affordable fun! Indeed, we purchased an exceptionally fine model using eBid Buddy Points - no cash involved. Many a stunning view was captured from around the place we call Frugaldom with many of these images saved and printed for calenders, postcards and greetings cards; some even became keyrings, coasters and fridge magnets.This time last year, I had already seen my daughter celebrate her engagement (July 2009) and then her wedding (September 2009). These things are major family events that NEED to be budgeted for well in advance. Thankfully, frugal living, for me, had begun in 2001 and has continued, unabeited, since. It is neither inhibitive nor does it prevent me from living life the way I want it. In fact, it is very liberating. Self-catering a birthday party for 120 people on a budget of around £100 for food was entertaining, to say the least - but everybody loved it and nobody cared - they ate, they drank and they made merry. By pulling together, the families managed to throw a most memorable wedding party the following September and then, come mid 2010, my son didn't go without for his 21st. Frugal living is the only way to live if you intend becoming a frugal entrepreneur. It's about grasping opportunities and running the risk of succeeding in making something out of almost nothing.Throughout 2010, frugality was the watchword. The resulting spreadsheets have slowly, year by year, been developed to reflect everything I could possibly need or spend. At the same time, they have managed to remain incredibly simple and show me where changes need to be made at any given time. The ISA may not have been filled and I may not own my own home, but that's not the point. As a frugal entrepreneur, I feel it is better to live and save within my means, able to take advantage of whatever small opportunity comes along.I originally started this challenge to clear outstanding debts and then accrue some savings in the hope of buying a house without a mortgage - but now I'm not so sure. If I buy a house, it represents nothing more that a roof over my head until it becomes inheritance for my kids, but why should they wait? Why shouldn't they learn my frugal ways and benefit from them now? This time last year I promised myself we would save every £2 coin and every piece of spare change into the homemade papier mache banks we'd all made. By Christmas, the household had an extra £150+ to play with and my son still hasn't even emptied his bank, yet.This time last year was a full year ago and it's hard to believe how quickly that time has passed. But pass it has. This New Year, I was blessed with a brand new baby grand daughter, my second in the family, so why should I squirrel away every penny to pay for a house that will, ultimately, be sold? I haven't fully given up on buying a house without a mortgage. To be 100% honest, I know, exactly, what house I want to buy. But money in the bank isn't everything. So I have another plan...Back on the frugal grocery challenge, tonight's dinner was courtesy of the freezer - leftover roast beef with gravy, puff pastry and assorted root veg - homegrown potatoes, turnips and parsnips -  that were lurking in the bottom of the freezer. Frugaler and frugaler... another day goes by without needing to buy.  I did spend some money, though: £23 on coal, £15 on electricity and £15 to my friendly society bond with life assurance. I also squirreled £66.94 into the savings account to round up to the next even hundred, but that was only because it was such an untidy figure at the start of the day. The friendly society bond isn't a brilliant investment but it does allow you to put up to £25 per month into tax free savings and offers a guaranteed life assurance from day one. At worst, it'll cover a cheap funeral, at best I'll get some money back in a few years time. I opened the policy online via Topcashback, so I made the most of that and the extra £15 of M&S vouchers I received. They're offering £50 cashback at the moment for a Scottish Friendly Bond, but it takes a long time to track and pay out - most insurance related products seem to take at least three months. I'll let you know when this year's home contents policy pays the cashback - it should be due soon. Please always double check for the best available deals at the time. Savings bonds can go down as well as up, so not always the best option for anyone just wanting to save for a rainy day. Personally, I dislike life insurance because of the risk of losing it all by out-living the policy! At least the life assurance with the friendly society bond offers me something back after the alloted timescale or a small death benefit to save the family from any sudden expenses like a funeral. It isn't morbid - it makes good frugal sense.Tomorrow, I think, might be Premium Bonds checking day!Here in Scotland, we're supposed to have the extra bank holiday, which means there's no post. But plenty of people work it and just as many others ignore it. Fortunately, our local village shop is home to the post office counter and the shop part was open. Latest orders have gone, albeit nowhere before tomorrow, but it's always good to stay ahead of things.Online banking is working just fine, so there wasn't a problem checking the finances. This is something you'll either love or hate, depending on your bank balance, but it's also something that needs to be done on a very regular basis. Free online banking is an essential in Frugaldom. You should seriously consider it if you've afforded yourself the luxury of having an Internet connection.A single missed direct debit or standing order is all it takes to trip you up or drag you down in this moneyspinning game of snakes and ladders. Finding your bottom line on the year's expenditure is one thing, but juggling all those payments to fit in with the availability of your cash at any given time is another. Timing is paramount to your success in achieving a debt free status. It's also never a good sign to be starting the year in the red, so why plan it that way?Christmas falls but once a year and it's always on the exact same date, so why do so many people get caught short and panic buy?  It's much easier and far less stressful if you can stay one step ahead of the festive financial splurge, as well as everything else. So here is my Frugaldom suggestion for an exercise in number-crunching:Count up what Christmas 2010 has cost you - the whole lot, every gift, every roll of wrapping paper, the turkey, the extra stocking fillers, every single ribbon, cracker, chipolata, right down to the last brussels sprout - and then look at that number. It's a real figure, it's how much money you spent. What percentage of that overall cost went straight into the bin? Was there any food wasted? How much packaging, how many cards, labels, bows, advent calendars and festive plastic stockings were cast aside as rubbish? What percentage of your entire year's disposable income got spent on the last week of 2010? You may not even have stayed home, you might have dined out, but it all costs extra. You have your number...I'd like you to divide that number by 365 then multiply it by 7... This is how much you need to put away from this week until the end of 2011 just to cover the cost of Christmas at last year's prices. Inflation is around 3% but the retail industries look closer to 10% from where I'm sitting, so safest to add on at least another 10% to help cushion the blow. Straight off the top of your head, can you afford to easily save this amount of money every week on top of everything else you pay? Now add on the cost of birthdays, anniversaries and any other commercially driven celebratory days. You can easily see how the costs mount up, so why take it in one big hit?Don't fall into the trap of being a year in arrears, get ahead of the game for 2011. We all know that we won't leave our nearest and dearest without during special occasions, so plan them very carefully. Only by knowing how much you spend can you spread the costs with your own money rather than risk covering them with someone else's. And that's without even considering the exorbitant rates of interest that a loan or credit card could cost you.Make it your New Year's resolution to skip ahead of the spenfing game and avoid all hidden debt traps.Personally, I find I need to save about £20 per week just to cover what it costs to have friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances throughout the year. Gifts, travel costs, extra coffee, cakes, biscuits, something to wear when going visiting or to a big occasion, cards, shoes to match the 'posh' outfit... the list is endless. It's like lassoing a wild mustang without first confining it to the corral - it can bolt and drag you everywhich way but loose, with the noose of debt eventually hanging around your own neck. Next time someone says, \"wild horses couldn't drag me away,\" just remind them that it only takes the one to do it once and they're down!  :)OK, so we've added in everything relating to what we spend on others over the space of a year and established that it's a whopping great percentage of our disposable income. What do we do? Firstly, DON'T PANIC and secondly, COMMUNICATE! Believe it or not, most people are in the same boat and just haven't realised it, yet.Communication is the most important tool you can use and, best of all, it is absolutely free. If you have debt, call a halt to all your non-essential spending until you have a semblance of control. Explain to everyone who may be affected by it, even if it's just to tell relatives that all they're getting for birthdays is a homemade card and a papier mache animal bank if they're lucky. Tackle your budget head on - deduct the utmost essentials to keep your household warm, clothed, fed and watered, afford the breadwinners enough to enable them to work and budget to within the last penny to keep debt collectors at bay. Seek help if you cannot see a way of covering all your costs by contacting an organisation such as the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) for free debt help or contact your local Citizens Advice office. You can join us free online in the Frugaldom Forums, where the name of the game is debt free living, and share experiences with many others who are or have been in similar situations.Assuming your budget isn't in a critical state and that you have done everything possible to minimise and clear any debts, it should be safe enough to start saving for next Christmas. If you can't be trusted to leave the money in the bank, buy some Premium Bonds each time you reach £100 rather than leaving the cash in a non-interest paying piggy bank or, worse still, a hamper or voucher club that could easily go bust! With Premium Bonds, the worst that will happen is your money will be safe, at best you could win a £million and solve your money worries.NB: Nothing contained within the Frugaldom Blog posts should be construed as financial advice. This is simply a blog by a frugal living, debt free individual who is now in the very fortunate situation of being able to save for a rainy day.

I decided that the cream throw that's normally over the couch would be the best thing to get done, so gave it a quick wash with some of the latest batch of homemade laundry detergent.  It smells lovely, with mandarin essential oil added to the mix!The throw was hauled over the line and left to dry. H was outside clearing space in the shed but it wasn't long before he appeared at the back door carrying a squirming cat - Scruffy, our wee frugal mouser in-training. Not only had she been jumping in amongst the hens and ducks, scattering them all ways, she'd been running through the mud and then decided that scaling the fabric wall that had appeared in the middle of our garden seemed like a fun thing to do! My lovely cream throw now has a full set of cat prints up one side, along the 'tightrope' that was the washing line, and down the other side! It really needs washed all over again but I'm wondering if the muddy pawprints might brush off once dried and then I can just throw the infernal thing back over the couch pawprint side down! The one that's on there just now has already got paw prints from where that darned cat jumped in the window!Whose great idea was it to have a cat? Think I'd have been better sticking to trapping or baiting the meeskies that were invading the garage!At this rate, Frugal pusscat will be posted on the Frugaldom forum as being in search of a nice, new home!Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},

Even those on the smallest of incomes can achieve rich lives but, similarly, even those with high earnings can find themselves on a downward spiral of debt. The Frugaldom forums are here to support anyone who has an interest in managing their own finances in a prudent and wise fashion. We don't mind if it's to clear debt, follow self-sufficiency or amass fortunes while building business empires, we are all frugal entrepreneurs, at heart, with the capacity to succeed.It's not about how much you have, it's about how you spend it and every penny counts in the game of frugal living and working.Frugal does not mean poor, nor does it refer to any form of meanness. Being frugal is having the ability to achieve financial freedom by living within your own means. It's about sensible money planning and about taking full control of your own future in a way that leaves you solvent.Bearing all of the above in mine, I'd also like to remind everyone concerned that the most important factors in following the Frugaldom challenges are FUN, ACHIEVEMENT and FREEDOM to interact on a regular basis with likeminded others. We are all here for the same reason - an interest in money (or lack of it) and all that it encompasses.Though the paths to success can be long and twisted, strewn with obstacles and pitfalls, the paths are always there. We just need to take that first step in the right direction.From everyone here in Frugaldom, good luck, good budgeting and good living in 2011.Thank you all for being a part of it.NYK Media / Frugaldom"},
{"title": "The Final Roundup of 2010", "date": "Friday 31 December 2010", "text": "HAPPY HOGMANAY FROM FRUGALDOM!This is a final post, on the eve of the new Frugaldom challenge, to summarise the results of the 2010 one. But first and foremost, I'd like to welcome baby Niamh, my newest granddaughter, who arrived into the world at 02.53 this morning. :)WHAT WAS THE 2010 CHALLENGE?2010 was all about living on a budget of £4,000 after paying rent/water/council tax.  In addition to this, I've been building up a small poultry business alongside fruit and vegetable growing.  Everything that wasn't part of the household accounts (the £4,000) had to be generated from outside of the normal self-employed income in the hope of achieving a break-even point by 31/12/10  I am delighted to announce that I managed to run the entire household on a sum total of £3,990.59 whilst everything else concerning the poultry, garden and home improvements amounted to £57.97 pence LESS than the extra or residual earnings from egg & poultry sales, LETS trading, cashback, winnings, gifts and bank interest. To conclude 2010's frugal challenge budget, I have a credit balance of £67.38, which will be carried forward into 2011. A full breakdown of all earnings and expenditure have been incorporated into the Frugaldom Forums.For 2011, the challenge is to continue with the £4,000 houshold running costs with the rest of the Frugaldom project developing into a self-sustainable, homebased business. We're still a long way short of making Frugaldom completely self sufficient but we have taken several steps closer. The biggest expense of all relates to fuel and power - electricity, coal and logs accounted for approximately 37.5% of the entire household budget!Nonetheless, we are starting 2011 with zero debt, a lovely little multifuel stove in the kitchen, the coal bunker and one logstore filled plus enough food to sustain a small army. We have 50+ assorted chickens, ducks and quail that, despite the atrocious weather and sub-zero temperatures since mid September, have managed to keep us well supplied with eggs. In fact, I haven't had to buy eggs, preserves, wine, lemon curd, bread, cakes or biscuits since 2009. Long may it continue. I also invested in a new incubator, decorated the kitchen and managed to include a corner bistro-style bench set, all without dipping into the savings. Not a bad year, all things considered, and it's thanks, mainly, to all the great frugal friends I've made during the previous years' challenges. I wish each and every one of you health, debtfree wealth and happiness in 2011. I hope to encourage many more people to take up the Frugaldom Challenge and will look forward to seeing you all in the Frugaldom Forums. Until then...

{"title": "What is a Frugaleur?", "date": "Thursday 30 December 2010", "text": "A Frugaleur is a frugal living, self-sufficientish career choice, a frugal entrepreneur, a job with many hats!Recently, I overheard a heated debate. Quite frankly, I was horrified by some of the far-fetched misconceptions people have about anyone attempting self sufficiency or anything associated with being frugal. For confidentiality reasons, I won't disclose the identites of those involved but, suffice to say, I think you're all a bunch of wallies for being so small-minded. Frugal living is NOT about a bunch of drop-outs avoiding work and not paying taxes, nor is it about staying home and depending on State Benefits. Working from home means exactly that - you work from your home. Yes, you can work whatever hours suit you and take as much time off as you want but when you're not working, you're not earning. There are no state benefits or statutory sick pay if you're ill, there's no holiday pay and there's no unemployment benefit or income support of any description when work is in short supply. There's no final salary and no company pension, we still need to do annual accounts, pay income tax when due and pay National Insurance contributions. That's the price you pay for being self-employed, debt free and having savings in the bank. It's also a great position to be in when that great opportunity presents itself.If anyone says to me that they hate going out to work, hate sharing the responsibility of being a parent with some stranger, hate spending hours commuting or hate never having any time to do things for themselves or to spend with their families then my answer to that is, work out how to afford to QUIT! Set your sites on the lifestyle that you want and aim beyond working to pay off debts - aim to live life. The majority of people will reply along the lines of, \"I can't afford to give up work,\" then blame it on a host of other reasons - need the money, too many bills, too many debts... you get the picture. What they really mean is that they aren't prepared to make the necessary changes. The other thing about this scenario is the fact that many people just don't know how much they are actually earning and, worse still, how much their jobs are COSTING THEM! Let's start off with the very basics - I'm talking about those who pay basic rate income tax or the minimum earners in our society. The simple reason for this is that I haven't actually witnessed any debate with anyone earning a top salary: they all seem to love their jobs and have stay-at-home partners representing them in the parenthood/child-rearing stakes. These are the lucky ones, but they studied for it and they've worked for it, so leave them alone. These are the very people who make it possible for other people to work and earn over £100 per week in the UK without paying any taxes!So let's look at all the career options that are rolled into just being a frugal living, self-sufficientish homeworker. I have used the Prospects and Wikipedia websites for the basis of my speedy research.Entrepreneur - a person who is willing to launch a new venture, project or enterprise and accept full responsibility for the outcome.Frugaleur - a person who is willing to launch a new frugal venture, project or enterprise and accept full responsibility for the outcome.Quantity surveyor - manages costs relating to building and civil (as opposed to military) engineering projects, from the initial calculations to the final figures.

Eg - budget analyst.Auditor - carries out an evaluation of a person, organization, system, process, enterprise, project or product.

The term most commonly refers to accounting, but also project management, quality management and energy conservation within the frugal household.Chief Executive, Director, Administrator, Secretary, Dietitian, Chef, Housekeeper, Cleaner, Gardener, Interior Designer, Decorator, Caretaker... look up the definitions of any, or all, of these careers and you'll find something relevant to the job of running a frugal household. There are many more and we need to harness basic skills relevant to them all. On top of that, we also need to earn the cash that pays the bills in the first place, whether that be by selling or providing services (of the legal variety, let's not get too carried away). So, next time someone suggests to you that frugal living is just taking the easy way out, ask them what their job description includes and how much of what they earn is theirs for the keeping.Salary - £XX,000Deduct income taxDeduct National InsuranceDeduct pension payments and any other deducted at source costsDeduct cost of suitable clothing and footwearDeduct cost of health and beauty - you know it's trueDeduct cost of travelling to and from workplace (car, train, bus, taxi etc)Deduct cost of lunches, coffees and snacksDeduct cost of 'chipping in' for gifts and nights outDeduct cost of child careDeduct cost of convenience foods when there's no time to cook from scratchDeduct cost of eating outDeduct cost of membership fees - there are usually someDeduct cost of foreign holidaysDeduct cost of finance on the reliable car you may need to replaceActual Salary = £much, much LESSAnalyse the true cost of your job before you even contemplate calculating a responsible budget for your household. Factor in the regular savings so you've adequately covered all the major spending blips, like family occasions, celebratory events, holidays, extra car costs, annual veterinary fees for pet vaccinations, overnight visits, social events, concerts, unscheduled garage/veterinary/dental bills...I'm not even going to attempt to guesstimate all of the above, as they vary so greatly depending on location, work and lifestyle. The bottom line is that many people still have debt that can easily spiral out of control if the worst happens and their main source of income disappears. The amount on any pay cheque means nothing unless that money is budgeted wisely. (I'll bet even the Beckhams can't claim to be completely debt free.)So, in conclusion to anyone who may think that an attempt at making frugal living a fulltime job is a 'cop-out' and that it's about dropping out of the rat race, think again... being a frugal entrepreneur is something entirely different.It doesn't cost much to stay debt free and accumulate savings, but it does take hard work and determination to succeed. Remember - when you stay ahead of the game you can drop back into it anytime.Are you a Frugal Entrepreneur?Join us in the fun, frugal forums athttp://www.frugalforums.co.uk"},
{"title": "Shona Prophett on the Frugaldom Challenge in 2011", "date": "Tuesday 28 December 2010", "text": "Hellooooooooo Fellow Frugalers! Just introducing 'Shona Prophett' on here before the start of the Frugaldom Challenge in 2011 - £4,000 for a year, will I be Shona Prophett by the end of it? Who knows! Getting started immediately, with £4k at the ready: £1,000 is in Premium Bonds in preparation for the first draw of 2011, so the starting figure for everything else is £3,000. Working from home should make the entire Frugaldom project self-sufficient, self-funding and, eventually, profitable.It's going to be difficult juggling the various challenge budgets but I'll overcome any problems as and when they arise, with a little help from my friends. Here is the link to the spreadsheet I'll be using.(Right click the link and save file as whatever you want it to be.) The above is the Frugaldom Budget spreadsheet - it shows all the budget amounts from which all expenses will be deducted, but it also has a seperate section to the right for all the other things not included in the household budget. If anything gets spent, it gets logged in the negative and anything that comes in from any of the categories listed gets logged in the positive. The household budget balance is still maintained but it then continues across to the overall budget in the lower right hand side of the spreadsheet. My challenge is for this figure to be positive or, at the very least, '0' by 31/12/11. Because the budget is supposed to beat the bank, the minimum this final figure should be is £20, to reflect the 0.5% interest that the £4k would attract had it been left in the bank - my reward, or profit, had I not needed to spend it. I want to be 'SHONA PROPHETT' next year. But don't we all? _________________I was Shona Penny but it turned into a pound, so I'm now Shona Prophett Check out www.shonaprophett.com/_________________I have just logged -£119.88 from the telephone budget, as I opted to pay BT an annual lump sum in order to make the most of their discount. Weekend calls are free, so no phone bills as long as we don't use the phone through the week. 1571 service cancelled - we don't really need it - but still got online billing for checking the monthly statements and calls plus the DD set up for internet calls to 0845. Despite this being a free number for many, it excludes internet dial-up, which is what needs to be used here once a month or so for updating a website. Keeps it otherwise free. Going into 2011 with a grand total of £2,880.12 plus £1,000 of Premium Bonds in the hope of winning something, even if it's only £25. It will still beat the bank, working out at 2.5%I'm planning on earning everything extra needed by selling surplus eggs, surplus stock, hand crafting decorative eggs, small investments, utilising cashback sites, using a cashback credit card for almost everything, negotiating discounts, trading and bartering, possibly trying a few free competitions, selling on eBid and hoping the interest rates increase so the monthly ISA interest payment covers the cost of the chicken feed. I'm also hoping to make the most of social media, learning what I can about it in a bid to generate some extra interest in the challenge.As always, you are welcome to follow the Frugaldom challenges in our free forumsGOOD LUCK TO ALL WHO DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN 2011"},
{"title": "To Spend or Not to Spend: Review of the 2010 Frugal Living Challenge Budget", "date": "Monday 27 December 2010", "text": "HOW DID 2010 SHAPE UP ON THE FRUGAL BUDGET?Having no intentions of venturing anywhere near shops until after New Year, I've just done a complete review of my 2010 results from the Frugaldom 'Frugal Living' Challenge. I hope several more of you will consider joining us HERE for the 2011 challenge. We regularly compare notes, swap hints and tips about best deals and discuss both moneysaving and money making ideas . (You'll need to register a username and password but it's all free.)My 2010 Frugal Living Challenge budget was set at £4,000 for the household of 3, excluding rent/council tax/water/work costs.Of the above amount, £1,155 was allocated to groceries, made up of the following:£1,095 for food related£50 for toiletries£10 for cleaning & laundry productsThe final amount spent over the course of 2010 was £1,154.28This means I have 72p left over from my 2010 groceries allowance - enough for 10 packs of saver brand instant custard, 10 jars of saver curry sauce or 2kg of flour that could make me 4 loaves of bread.For the 2011 grocery challenge, I have allocated £1,150.00 It's £5 less than 2010, but I've allowed the customary £1 per person per day (£1095) for food etc and £55 for toiletries, laundry and cleaning products. I just hope that prices of things like toilet rolls don't escalate too quickly. I'm amazed that paper prices haven't been soaring, as there's so much in the media about wood and renewables - it has to push prices up somewhere along the lines! The entire 2010 budget comprised the following: Groceries etc - £1,155 Electricity - £1,190 Coal - £133 Logs - £210    (Total for heat, light, fuel = £1,533) Internet - £175 Mobile - £20 Telephone - £160 TV licence - £142.50 Clothing and footwear - £75 Gifts - £450 Misc - £155 Travel - £85 Insurance - £45 Other - £4.50 TOTAL £4,000As I write up this final review of the Frugaldom 2010 challenge budget, I have a grand total of £9.41 remaining from the original £4,000.00On the other hand, Frugaldom also has 50+ hens, ducks and quail to feed, fruit and veg to grow and had some fairly expensive interior works carried out in the house, mainly the purchase and  installation of 'George', our multifuel stove. The 'Everything Else Kitty' (lovingly known as the 'EEK') had to be stretched to extremes over the past 12 months, but stretch it we did, to the point that there's even a small balance left over in that account, too.   The 'EEK' was started to pay for everything else that fell outside of the 'household' category. Everything that needed to be paid for had to be settled using sources other than regular, earned income - wages, if you're employed. Over the space of 12 months, Frugaldom managed to spend £2,938.31 on all these 'everything else' items. Being part of a cash neutral budget challenge, they all had to be paid for from somewhere. So here's how it was done:   Cashback  and vouchers - £518.59 Sales of hens, eggs  and other tradeable stock - £1,263.88 Gifts  and winnings - £863.75 Interest and small investments returns - £344.19 TOTAL: £2,990.41   I'm expecting another £30+ to arrive before the end of this week, which should take the balance on the 'EEK' to almost £85. I could have the best part of £100 remaining at the conclusion of my 2010 Frugaldom Challenge. I'm also well in credit with my LETS account, reflecting how much I was able to trade, barter or exchange throughout 2010. This included the building work when the stove was being installed in the kitchen. All of this has meant that I am now in a position to start my next challenge debt free and with the renewed hope of accruing some new savings. But, in the meantime... To spend or not to spend, that is the question!Frugaldom will be watching for best buys over the coming year as the balance remaining represents my profit from frugal living - I have SHONA PROPHETT!Please feel free to ask any questions in the Frugaldom Forums"},
{"title": "Leftovers, homemade pink champagne and the 2011 budget", "date": "Sunday 26 December 2010", "text": "Christmas Cheer from Festive Frugaldom! Much milder here at around -1C so, despite still being frozen solid, it's feeling a little warmer. Weatherman said rain but it doesn't feel humid, still very dry with not much to show for the bit thaw we had yesterday. Christmas day went well - turkey with all the trimmings including homemade braised red cabbage and a spot of rowan jelly. The potatoes were boiled, veggies steamed and soup made on the stovetop but I finished everything off by roasting it in the main oven, along with the stuffing, pigs in blankets and the slow-cooked turkey. By way of celebration, we drank homemade rhubarb 'pink champagne' with the meal and I was very impressed by the fruity fizz this year! The bottle would certainly have gone with a pop had I not used the 1L glass screw top bottles and, with no proper champagne glasses, the fizz in the wine glasses was quite substantial.Diehard frugalers, you know what today is... it's leftovers day! Yes, that's right, it's time to get creative and repack your freezers to ensure everything's rotating, being used up and being replenished by the latest batch of whatever goodies have been leftover from the festive food extravaganza. I have plenty of turkey, a pot of turkey soup that had been made with stock from the giblets and I now have the turkey carcass to turn into the next batch of turkey stock, but the freezer space is still very much at a premium. We're going to be eating soup and pudding lunches for a while longer to use up the rest of the trifle and dumpling. The dumpling has already been sliced and frozen and the trifle wasn't done with fresh cream, so it will last another day if needs must. (I sincerely doubt it, as I'd eat trifle morning, noon and night.)Fidgetbuzz... your homemade raspberry ruffles and fudge/coconut ice are absolutely delicious! Remind me to give you back the jar, just in case you want to do something similar next year. The jar should be empty by around 2pm today.Stockmaking has begun - what's left of the turkey has been carved into mealsized portions, bagged up and put into the freezer. As is customary, I've kept out enough for tonight's curry (or stir fry) but the rest should be enough to make up another meal plus a couple of pies. I don't have the space in the freezer to fit in pies just yet, so the meat is going in 'as is' for now. The soup has been decanted into 500ml containers, enough for a lunchtime snack, and everything else - bones and all - is seasoned and ready for stock making. I'll boil down the stock, once it's made, then freeze it for future use. Having received a set of 'Kleeneze' pastry presses for Christmas, I suspect some my leftover turkey might find its way into future pasty-making. A full review of this product will be posted as soon as available. For now, it looks like a bag of trappers' tools modelled in white plastic... scary looking things!I've got my 2011 challenge budget spreadsheet all set up and ready to go for next week. This spreadsheet is a very simple format that helps me see exactly how much of my annual budget is left at any given time. Each of the columns is preset in January to reflect the challenge targets, so it automatically shows me a running total. Once again, the Frugaldom household is going to attempt to stick at £4,000 after payment of rent, council tax and water. The budget does NOT include the cost of work related items, these have already been deducted. Feel free to play around with the spreadsheet if you think it can be of any help to you. You might also like to take a look at Spending Diary and iMeasure - the former for recording day to day spends and the latter (created by Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, part of the UK Energy Research Centre) to help analyse your week to week electricity and gas use. It also shows how your household ranks in the energy rating stakes. We're currently maintaining a 'C' rating but the system does not take logburning into account.With only a few days lefts of the current challenge, I should come in just under budget; I won't know, for sure, until the 31st December. Looking good, though, looking good! There wasn't any credit used to fund Christmas (or anything else during 2010, for that matter) and the savings have survived intact. I do use my cashback credit card wherever and whenever possible, it always gets paid back in full each month. I should have accrued around £50 by the end of this tax year. I love cashback! I treat the interest payments on savings a bit like cashback because let's face it, the interest payments are a far cry from representing a serious income. I now look on the ISA as being there to prevent any bandit stealing my money and, in return for providing me with this free service, it rewards me with enough cash every month to cover the cost of feeding the poultry. It's pretty great, when you think about it - free cash on a regular basis, even if it is only chicken feed.Hope everyone had a lovely Christmas day and has now had a bit of a boost towards the new year. The final countdown has begun, so make sure all your sums are done and dusted, build up to a huge celebration next weekend and make your New Year's resolution one that can last a lifetime - embrace frugality and all that it has to offer, shift those debts and live a good life."},

Frugal living isn't easy to begin with, nor is it particularly fun, unless you become addicted to number crunching. (I call this addiction, 'Numerical OCD'.)  If you've been leading a lifestyle that's put you on the wrong side of the 'living within your means' barrier then trust me when I say, the good life of being completely debt free is attainable and it is very rewarding. The trip to frugality is fraught with danger, the ascent to debtfree status is steep and any number of cliches can be used to explain the learning curve that is about controlling your own budget. So let's be prepared to try our best and reap the rewards of success.'T was the day before Christmas and all through the house... there was a trail of devastation from the cat climbing the Christmas tree, corners stacked with pressies, boxes waiting to be posted (work still carries on, people continue to buy books, thankfully) and there's the panic thought of... what if there isn't enough food? Oh, and sooty footprints all over my fireplace and traipsed across my hearthside rug! Arg! Yes, you may well ask why, and no, it isn't because Santa arrived a day early in Frugaldom... it's because I've just had to grab the cat by the tail as she was about to disappear up the chimney! I guess she was fed up hinting that it's time to light the livingroom fire!Thankfully, in the Frugaldom household, we don't generally panic about food. We're never without, as the pantry, larder, freezer, fridge, cupboards and shelves are always full of basic ingredients, home produce, preserves, bargain buys and BOGOFs (buy one get one free). The homemade elderflower and rhubarb 'champagnes' sit ready for the festive tipples and the logburner warms the kitchen. We're getting a bit low on kindling sticks, but H will soon be out with the hand axe splitting the pallet that arrived with this week's poultry feed order. Free pallets could easily become your best friends, as they are so incredibly versatile! (We even have a duck house built from them.)Over the space of a year, 2010 has proven to be much less of a struggle than anticipated, but this is mainly because there are no debts to worry about - the well deserved result of our frugal living for so long. But what of those households that do carry debts? How do they combat the annual celebratory pressie-buying problems whilst trying to keep afloat? Crafting and cottage industries aren't dead, they are, once again, becoming the key to success, as are trading and bartering groups like LETS. See previous posts for a few simple, cheap and quick recipes for festive treats that most people love. Nobody has grumbled about them here that I know of, but it might be a case of, would they dare? :)I've been speaking to several people recently who are in all sorts of dire straits, despite having fulltime incomes. I was aghast at some of their stories but was also shocked by the amount of their income. I'm not talking about low paid, part-time workers or those struggling on the minimum wage, I'm talking about people who pay upper rate tax which, in my opinion, reflects their upper rate credit limits and their potential for super-debts. Although these debts may not slowly sink them, they can suddenly crush them when the main support beam of their income comes crashing down and they realise that they haven't laid proper foundations to stabilise their own financial futures.I am also aghast at the current TV commercial offering 'buy now, pay nothing until 2012' with small print reading something ridiculous about only having to spend a minimum of £50+ to qualify (terms and conditions apply). Did I read it right? This, in my opinion, is outrageous! I would plead with anyone in financial difficulties NOT to fall into this extended form of debt for the simple fact that things CAN, and often do, get worse. Your income could drop, a member of the household could lose their job, someone could take ill, the main breadwinner could lose their life in an accident. Sadly, I have heard of a couple of tragic accidents this past year. I've also heard of several suicides over the years, possibly because financial ruin became the final straw. Please think very carefully about how you would, or if you could, cope in any of these circumstances because they don't just happen to other people and it's not just storylines for a soap opera. Kill the debt before it drags you so far down that you could drown in it.OK, let's cast aside such depressing thoughts and look to the brighter side of life - the act of living is FREE and we each have the chance to take control of our own lives, to live them to the best of our ability. For me, ridding life of what's commonly known as 'stress' is one of the best things you can do. Being debt free may not necessarily mean being stress free but it goes a long way to helping alleviate many of the associated problems. Having savings in the bank is another step in the right direction, but knowing how to keep ahead of the game is one of the most important problems we all need to solve. We need to invest in our own futures because, let's face it, the British Government isn't capable of doing all of it for us, nor should it be expected to, in my opinion.With only a week left of 2010, perhaps you could take time out to look at what your real financial status is - it's not about what you want out of life, nor is it about what you have. It is, first and foremost, about what you need to survive, everything else is extra. This is why I find it much easier to strip the lifestyle bare and assess the most basic needs - food, water, shelter, warmth - and then look at what's left over and how it gets spent. An experiment for all:The bottom line is that we need to pay for a roof over our heads and the associated costs, such as water, council tax and buildings/contents insurance. We need to pay to keep the occupants of that household fed, watered, clothed and warm and ensure that their basic necessities are met. Almost everything else is extra. To conduct this experiment, count up your 'Needs Budget'. Keep in mind that we have already proven that a family can be fed at a cost of £1 per person per day. Many others have shown that it's possible on less, but we all appreciate little luxuries now and again, especially here in Frugaldom. I happen to like coffee and I like eating meat at mealtimes. Basic, non-processed foodstuffs are zero rated for VAT - if you happen to think of frugal eating as avoiding tax then go raffle yourself. If you happen to think that earning insufficient income to pay income tax is tax evasion, do likewise. Those are my personal thoughts on that subject. I'd really appreciate some feedback on the basic budget subject. I don't need to know actual figures, just percentages of annual household income. I'll use my own figures as an example.Rent, council tax, water & insurance - 31.5%Electricity & fuel - 11.6%Food - 8.3%Clothing - 1%As you can see, the merest essentials account for 52.4% of the Frugaldom household budget. H has a car, albeit it an old runaround, but it still nibbles away another 5% of the overall budget, leaving us with just over 42% with which to 'live a little'. Our idea of 'living a little' is to save at least 25% of the income in the hope that it secures a better future and covers the costs of all eventualities but, for those with debts, what's left needs to pay debt. Only then can they afford to live a little. It doesn't take a genius to see how easily some people could be conned into falling for the easy, quick fix of seeking credit.My son spends about £4,000 a year just to go out to work - it's a whack of money off a minimum wage job (almost 40%)  that certainly does not allow for him to have his own place. but it's amazing how few people consider the cost of living needs to be calculated after deductng the cost of working. Do you know the true cost to the job you are doing? Perhaps a quick look at that will cast some shadows you weren't even aware were lurking. Transport, workwear, lunches, snacks, childcare, help at home, takeaways, convenience foods, eating out, extra gifts for work associates... they all need to be budgeted for and they are all part of the cost of working. Please don't assume that an annual salary of £xx,xxx is what you actually get, it's only the number of pounds that you earn from your employer BEFORE deduction of your costs.Should financial awareness begin at home or in school? How do parents instill an interest in saving for the future in their offspring? I may be lucky in that by living a frugal life, mine have partially understood the concept of saving to buy what they want (in the case of my son - cars, tv, games consoles, the latest DVDs and games) but that's not enough to prepare them for the future. This topic, in itself, is fodder for another frugal post, but I fully agree with the concept of teaching the youth of today that credit can only be good when it's benefiting them in the long run. It should never be seen as a quick fix or a get out clause.NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION SUGGESTIONDitch all debts unless you've shown a profit.2011 is, by far, looking like the most challenging year so far. It isn't helped by the fact that basic groceries seem to have increased in price by around 10%, the cost of electricity has done likewise and we're all meant to be happy in Scotland that they have frozen the Council Tax at current rates but omitted to include the fact that, for some of us, they had already increased when they abolished the 4% discount for pre-paying in full last year! Things are getting tougher and we can't all just print more money.If you have any worries about debts, please consider contacting CCCS, the UK's leading debt help charity. There is absolutely no need to pay anyone to help solve financial problems. You'll also find some excellent advice on their Money Aware website.Don't forget you can read more and participate in the Free Frugaldom Forums."},

If it's too crumbly, rub in a little more margarine.Form into a round, approx 1cm thickPlace in a baking trayMark out into 6 'pie slices' (or else cut into desired shapes and bake loose on a lightly greased or floured tray.)If baking as a single, large round, you can fork round the edges for that wavy effect and pierce the surface in a dot-to-dot pattern on each triangle for added effect. I just jab a few holes in them.Bake for approx 25 mins at 170CYour shortbread should stay pale in colour. sprinkle with sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven - leave to cool for 10 minutes then transfer to baking rack to cool properly. I've done mine double thickness for a bit of added luxury. :)FRUGAL TIPAlways have a supply of various flours, margarine, oil, sugar, salt and yeast. It's the basic essentials for so many recipes.EEK MOMENT! Must keep busy or nerves will get the better of me. Daughter's due to have baby on 24th but she thinks it'll be sooner. With an hour's travel for her to reach the nearest hospital, I'm more nervous now than when I was expecting my own! Why don't they teach you these things in school? Son-in-law off on holiday for a couple of weeks, so there shouldn't be any need for me to worry... I'll go into the kitchen, make or bake something... bread's made, corn's in the big pan on the stove to make more hot mash for the hens, I'm running out of biscuits and mince pies and I need to make some lemon curd. Where should I start?Frugal tip - any time you see porridge oats or muesli on clearance, stock up... BEST BEFORE dates mean nothing in Frugaldom, the contents of such packs will stay in fine condition for years as long as they're kept sealed and dry. Likewise with tins, pasta, pulses and sugar. In fact, sugar has no 'Best Before'date, it lasts as long as it takes you to use it, sometimes years! Don't be conned by the 'BBE' dates, the food isn't bad beyond them. It's the 'USE BY' dates you should adhere to and eggs are always best consumed within 3 weeks. Sadly, I can't guarantee that shop bought eggs are less than 3 weeks old but having garden hens, ducks and quail means I always have fresh eggs available. (OK, so the quail eggs freeze before I get to them in the mornings but with temps at -14C, I'm amazed the birds don't freeze!)FRUGAL FRUIT, NUT and SEED BISCUITS230g rounded tbs self-raising flour1 1/2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp salt175g muesli50g sugar115g melted margarine1 large eggPreheat oven to 180C & grease or flour a baking trayMix all of the ingredients into a soft doughSplit into walnut sized pieces and roll into ballsPress gently onto the baking tray to roundsBake for about 15 to 20 minutes until golden brownCool for 10 minutes and then transfer to baking rack.The above makes enough for approx 24 - 30 biscuits depending on the size you make them.SODA SCONES / FARLSWhile these were baking, I also mixed up 450g soda flour with about 175ml of milk. The dough was lightly mixed then formed into a round, scored into quarters and is now baking so we can have soda farls grilled with cheese as a quick snack - 2 for today, 2 for the freezer.OK, that's the biscuits baked and the soda bread is still baking - time to mix up some short bread and some shortcrust pastry for more mince pies.Off to make the shortbread and mincemeat pies now - making the most of all this extra heat in the kitchen.

Felt a bit daft, as I hadn't checked the times for myself and H had said it was beginning at 05:28 so there I was, up and at 'em by 5am only to discover he hadn't been reading the times in GMT! No matter, it's a beautiful crispy morning and the cockerels are already crowing because the full moon reflecting off the fields of snow makes it almost daylight at ground level.﻿ 06:00﻿ Photography of this great lunar eclipse is a bit hit and miss, as I don't have a tripod for my little digital camera and the webcam has decided that it doesn't like -14C in the dark, it preferred to automate the LCDs and probably had the nearby farmhouse calling SETI to alert them to the presense of UFOs over Galloway.﻿ 07:00﻿ ﻿Tuesday, 21st December 2010 - winter solstice and a total lunar eclipse - a very rare occurance for us mere mortals here on the great planet Earth.﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿ 07:15﻿ I'll update the blog as the eclipse progresses.

{"title": "In the Frugaldom kitchen now... white chocolate truffles", "date": "Sunday 19 December 2010", "text": "WHITE CHOCOLATE COATED TRUFFLES﻿ Dark chocolate truffle﻿ After yesterday's batch of milk chocolate truffles coated in dark chocolate, I decided to repeat the same recipe but use plain chocolate with whisky cream liqueur for the fondant centres then cover the truffles in white chocolate. Costs are the same, as it's 30p per bar for the 100g plain, milk or white chocolate if you buy store's own basics.The exact same quantities of each ingredient were used but I managed to squeeze 21 from this lot - it leaves a couple extra for sampling.Melted white chocolateI used a full 100g bar of white chocolate for coating the truffles and just rolled them in the melted chocolate. I also leave the bowl of melted chocolate inside the steamer, which is what I use as a frugal bain marie; it means the chocolate stays fully melted.I cover a chopping board with greaseproof paper and ise this to set the chocolates, as it fits inside the freezer compartment of my fridge. This means the chocolate sets much quicker.Dipped and dustedAs soon as the truffles are dipped, I sieved a mixture of icing sugar and cocoa over the top. They're looking and smelling delicious already. Ten minutes in the freezer should set them then I can sample to goods.Ten minutes later...The truffles are ready. I've removed them from the greasproof paper and they're now ready for packing into little presentation boxes.All completes - these are dark chocolate centres with white chocolate coating, dusted with a cocoa and icing sugar mix. We've already tested one and they do taste as good as the smell. Frugaldom chocolate heaven for 2011. I LOVE making chocolates.The finished productDon't forget you can follow the day to day exploits and updates in the Frugaldom forums at http://www.frugaldom.com/ PROGRESS IN THE FRUGAL KITCHENFirst job, today, was to get the clootie dumpling on to cook, so here's the simple, step by step method to show you how it's done.The first thing you need to do is get a big pan of water on to boil. You'll need to put a plate on the bottom of the pan so the dumpling can sit on top of that, rather than straight onto the base.I put out all the ingredients straight into the mixing bowl then mix them all together with just enough milk to make it 'muddy' without being too runny or gloopy. The spoon should just be able to stand upright and no more when the consistency is right, as per photograph.Once everything is mixed together, prepare your cloot (cloth) by dampening it down and sprinkling it liberally with flour. This is what will help form the skin on your finished dumpling. I put the cloth in a large jug before pouring in the mixture, but you can just as easily lay it out on a flat surface and then gather up the edges to tie them. My 'cloot' is cut from an old cotton pillowcase with the trimmings kept for tying it all together. Remember to leave enough space for the dumpling to expand during cooking.Once it's all tied up, it should look something like this: It's an old family tradition that everyone in the household pats the dumpling before it goes into the pot of boiling water but, as I was alone in the house at the time, ours escaped its 'skelp erse'. It was also traditional to hide silver sixpences inside the dumpling but, for obvious health and safety issues, this part of dumpling making has now been omitted. Afterall, we don't want granny choking or breaking her wallies on a coin at the Christmas dinner table, do we? Your clootie dumpling is now ready to be lowered into the boiling water. Always ensure that there's enough water to cover the whole dumpling but don't worry if it's floating a bit. Just tuck the whole lot into the pan and put the lid on tightly.  You now need to keep this on the boil for about the next 4 hours - not very frugal if you need to cook with electricity or gas, but great if you have a multifuel stove or logburner.While the dumpling is boiling, I'm getting back to making the marzipan fruits. I was able to text a friend who was en route here for coffee and a catch up, so she brought me the much needed cloves - all I was needing to finish the marzipan apples. I'm now in the process of doing the oranges and bananas.Using the cloves, they are inserted long end in for oranges and star end in for apples and bananas. I haven't bothered painting in the ridge stripes on the bananas as mine are all sugar frosted. I've looked out some small boxes and think I should be able to cut lids into these and use them for presentation packs that can be personalised accordingly, but I'll tackle that job later.Next up, more truffles. But I need to wait until the dumpling has finished cooking so I can use the hot plate. I only have a tiny pot belly 'pig' stove, hence the name, 'George'.UPDATE﻿The dumpling is ready. After about 4 hours of boiling, lift the bag from the boiling water and carefully untie the cloth. At this point, you'll need to very carefully turn the dumpling out onto a large, ovenproof dinner plate. It will look quite wet and, as we put it, peely wally (pale).Traditionally, the dumpling would be sat in front of the fire to dry out the skin and turn it a deep golden brown but for health and hygiene reasons, it's safest to finish it off under the grill or in a warm oven. This is primarily because we now have the cat and I'm sure she would love to sample a clootie dumpling.This will now be cooled, sliced and eaten... NO! I mean it will now be cooled, sliced and frozen for next weekend. I'll probably keep a couple of slices out for eating this week. It can be eaten hot or cold, served with cream, milk or custard, fried for breakfast or just eaten like cake. Dmpling is an ideal frugal extravagance, so I always have all the ingredients in store. It's very filling and quite rich, so it's best not to over-indulge.Don't forget you can join the frugal fun in the Frugaldom Forums at www.frugalforums.co.ukCHILLY, OR WHAT?It's -11C this morning, or thereabouts: I had to defrost the thermometer to get the photo, so I haven't a clue how low it was before bringing it indoors and scraping the ice off it. But it's still a novelty going out and reading it every morning because it probably isn't all that much colder than previous years, I just never checked back then. Time was better spent battling our way to school in Shotts - notorious for being the worst hit town in Lanarkshire when the snow arrived in winter. At least, that's what we always though...Anyway, I'm just thawing the ice from the inside of the windows. The bedroom curtains were actually frozen to the windowsill, but there's a lovely clear sky, so I think we might get some sunshine very soon. Doubt if it will be enough to dry any washing on the line, more likely freeze it solid.I am so glad that we invested in the multifuel stove for this year but that was mainly as a result of last year's proponged winter. We pulled out all the stops to get the job done to avoid a repeat performance and it's incredible the difference it makes! OK, so I can't leave 'George' burning overnight - he's too small - and we've no central heating, but this time last year meant having the three storage heaters plus the coal fire, a fan heater and an oil-filled radiator plugged in just to keep warm. The costs were phenomenal, hitting £53 for a single week's electricity. Unsustainable! We had to invest in some way of protecting the finances against the cancerous electricity charges. The new roof is also coming into play, too, as there's no leaky skylight window and no water running in that can freeze and split any wood. I can only imagine how much electricity we'd be going through and that's without the latest near 10% price increase that's been announced.Coal is costing £11.50 per 50kg bag at the moment, but I'm able to make a bag last about 10 days. Then there are split logs to be paid for; these are between £40 and £50 per trailer load delivered. We have little space for storage, so no choice in this matter. We haven't anywhere to bulk store wood for the year, so no chance of being able to season it ourselves for the following year. The cost of heating a rural property without central heating is quite staggering when compared to bills grumbled about by towns' people with the luxury and economy of mains gas. To date, in 2010, I have spent £1,190 on electricity, £110 on coal and £210 on logs. The electricity is on a prepayment meter, which is about £70 in credit, so this lot will need to see me through the new year - the budget for each of these categories has gone. With the help of the new stove, I'm hoping to reduce the overall annual expenditure on heat, hot water and power from £1,510 to £1,140, a drop of almost 25% before the price increases.One of the biggest plus sides to having the stove is that while it heats the back of the house, it also heats innumerable kettles of hot water and doubles up for cooking. I can keep it ticking over on a good enough heat to roast a chicken or, as I'll be doing today, boil a clootie dumpling.More marzipan fruit and truffles to be made today, along with the lemon curd and the clootie dumpling. That should keep the kitchen warm! I've a friend visiting later, so organisational skills must be honed so I'm ahead of the game by the time she arrives.Hope the weather isn't too bad wherever you are.Feel free to join us in the Frugaldom forums at http://www.frugaldom.com"},

{"title": "A Bit More About the 2011 Frugaldom Challenge", "date": "Thursday 16 December 2010", "text": "2011 will be year 5 for many of the followers of the Frugal Living Challenge, so here's an introduction for anyone wanting to join us in the new year. It's all about getting out of debt, living within your means and making savings wherever you can. For some, it has now developed towards self sufficiency, becoming stay at home parents, retiring early or else setting up their own homebased business. Whatever you decide is right for you, be it business or homelife, a little bit of austerity goes a long, long way.Frugaldom is set in rural southwest Scotland, so the budget we set here is not always suitable for everyone, but it's readily adaptable to suit all budgets. For example, we don't have superfast broadband, we don't live on a bus route and we don't live within easy walking distance of any shops, banks or post offices. The bins are over a mile from the house, so recycling and a zero-waste attitude towards most things is very helpful. If you have a basic knowledge of spreadsheets, you are welcome to download a copy of my simplified budget HERE. It excludes the cost of keeping the garden and livestock, as these things must be self-funding in order for them to become part of our self-sufficiency challenge and part of the homebased business.I work with the free programmes available to download at http://www.openoffice.org/ but the spreadsheet has been saved into an Excel document for ease of use. Open Office allows for many different formats, so it's a very frugal office suite.How to get started.Join us in the Frugaldom challenge forum so you can keep in contact and compare notes wth others with similar aspirations. We're all in it to cut costs, kill debt, increase savings and simplify life. The 2011 set of challenges also incorporates setting up homebased cottage-style industries, so there will be plenty of information available - good, bad and downright ugly. The good life isn't all good, it gets messy and it gets complicated but we can all work though the problems together.You need to calculate your entire annual income then deduct all unavoidable/neccesary bills and debt payments etc to reach your actual budget amount that is left for running the household/living. If you work, any costs relating to having that job (transport, lunches, childcare, work clothing etc) are classed as unavoidable costs. These items are essential in order for you to do that job and are nothing to do with the cost of living. Deduct all of these from your annual income. Once you have a figure that's left over for all payments you have control of, then you work back through a prioritised list, starting with necessary things like power, heating, water, household bills, food etc. In my opinion, getting those priorities right is key to the success of coming in within your budget while keeping up with necessary bills. If there's anything left over, use it to kill off any debt starting with the one that costs you the most by way of interest or other charges. If you have small debts, I prefer to kill these off first so it's fewer payments going out the bank. My personal budget is £4,000 so I prioritise it from most important needs to basic, non-essential wants. Rent (or mortgage), council tax and water payments are non-negotiable, so these are the first things deducted from the annual total. Any debt payments that need to be made on a regular basis - loans, HP, contracts. The cost of your job (if relevant) as per above. Regular, essential prescription medications. Any other regular, unavoidable paymentsOnce you have deducted all of these things, you should arrive at your annual housekeeping budget. Always Prioritise: Needs, not wants. Group 1 Food - basic staple diet, zero rated VAT Essential toiletries Electricity Oil/Gas/Coal/Logs (where applicable) Basic clothing Home insurance (where applicable) Essential travel - bus, taxi, car share etc Group 2 Baby Food/Formula Disposable nappies Foods & drink incurring VAT @ 17.5% (20% after Jan 2011) Telephone Internet Mobile Phone Television (basic Freeview) Non-essential travel - bus, taxi, car share etc Group 3 Household pets Gifts Hobbies Subscriptions (TV, newspapers, magazines, films) Holidays Beauty & Health related Cosmetics Costume jewellery Socialising Entertaining Eating out Alcohol Cigarettes Cars Caravan/campervan/Tent Private health Private pension plans Personal insurance Timeshare Shares in racehorses Off the peg designer wear Latest electronic gadgets etc., etc., etc... Group 4 Designer fashion - direct from the London, Paris, New York, Milan catwalks Fine jewellery Original art Gold Executive class cars Cruises Cosmetic surgery Racehorses Holiday home Yacht Wine collection Country estate Helicopter Private jet You get the picture... Group 1 relates to things we couldn't or shouldn't live without, although we are still in control of how much we spend on each. Group 2 comprises of quite basic items but, to someone having to really cut down to help avoid bankruptcy or at risk of losing the roof over their head, these things can be classed as non-essentials. We can survive without them. Group 3 is made up of examples of things that are extras to running a frugal household - luxuries that many cannot afford but we tend to indulge in a few of them when the cash is available. But we need to always keep in mind the consequences of spending on these things at the expense of clearing debts or adding to our savings. Group 4 is just a few ideas for once you're completely debt free and have accrued enough savings to enjoy some decadent living. Where Group 2 may read 'George' brand from Asda, Group 4 would read something like Chanel, Gucci or Prada etc. Anyway, you all get the picture. These are examples of how I would prioritise sample lists, but I'm not suggesting everyone differentiates in the same way I do. By my way of thinking, Group 3 items should never feature in any budget where there are arrears on any form of debt. Household pets is a very tricky one for many. Obviously, if the pets are already there and you can't bear to part with them, allowances need to be made and all animal-related costs incorporated into the budget, but it will probably be at the expense of something else. Gift buying is another tricky one but a true frugaler would be able to make something of some description, even if it was just some baking, homemade preserves or handcrafted items. We shouldn't really need a budget for gifts but we all like to give them, so best be aware of what you're prepared to spend without it affecting how much you can afford on Group 2 items. Worse still, it should never affect the ability to pay Group 1 items. Please let me know if you think I have prioritised anything into the wrong category or if I've missed out any necessary basics. Also, please remember that this is just my personal thoughts on the matter. Your priorities may be different from mine.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/ Today's aims: Bake mincepies, bake a loaf of  bread, play with Google.   PART ONE, FIRST DRAFT   As many of you already know, one of  the Frugaldom challenges for 2011 is to set up a  self-sufficient microholding. Shona Prophett is important but we need to  get the balance right, first. We need to neutralise all spending and we need to  ensure people can find us when they search for us on the  Internet.   I'm fascinated by companies like Google - they  can earn people fortunes or they can cast aside what you think is a  fantastic site, no matter how relevant it seems to the topic you're researching.  The 21st Century solution to succeeding with anything online seems to  be, employ an SEO specialist and engage in relevant social media. But is Search  Engine Optimisation worth paying for when you're a frugal newcomer to small  business? I certainly wouldn't pay for social media services because I don't  believe that all the followers actually read what you publish, so  number of followers is irrelevant.  Some, however, do click through the  links and read, respond or, better still, spend, so it pays to be found on the  Internet.   Frugal 'Microholders' can't afford the  ridiculous cash fees requested by do-good Search Engine Optimisation  specialists and, let's face it, does any of it really matter? It's not just  the end results that count, it's how people search and that's the secret  ingredient we may miss from our frugal recipe for microholding success. It's  also a question of how you want to be found in the first place. Unless we have a  site containing goods, services and/or information that people are likely  to search for, what gets found means nothing to us at the moment. But the Frugal  Entrepreneur has to build a business from nothing. Your new microholding is going to depend on customers  finding you, because you don't have an advertising & marketing budget, you  don't have free merchandise, you don't have any professional promotional  expertise and you don't have a business mentor offering FREE help. I'm assured  by many that SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION is paramount to success, so let's start  there and play with Google for a while, just to familiarise ourselves with how  the results appear. Afterall, we have all taken advantage of the FREE  DOMAIN NAME AND WEBSITE offer provided by www.gbbo.co.uk, haven't we? We all have an  online presense ready for launching these homebased microholding businesses in  2011.   To me, search engine optimisation is a bit  like baking: you add all the right ingredients, get the mix right, pop it  into the oven and then it's baked to perfection within an alloted time... Or a  bit like planting seeds in that perfectly prepared garden: you provide the  right mix of care, feeding and watering, then after their alloted time,  your seeds become perfect flowers, fruit, vegetables... But as we  all know, life isn't like that! Neither, I believe, is Google.   Right now, I need to have lunch, get the  mincepies into the oven and another loaf into the breadmaker, but I'll be  back with Part 2 of my free 'Frugal Google Solutions' soon and I hope you'll be  able to add your own comments and make some helpful suggestions.     Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "The 25p Loaf of Bread", "date": "Wednesday 15 December 2010", "text": "Bread prices have been rising for some time, the assorted media and press have been providing plenty of information regarding soaring wheat prices, the farming community are well aware of huge increases in fertiliser prices - again affecting crop growing - but where, oh where, is all the good news? It's managing to stay hidden from site! But fear not...In reality, stores seem able to sell flour at REDUCED PRICES! How can this be? I'm not even going to try to fathom that one out because my main concern is keeping the household going in bread. It can be served with almost anything, it can be made with almost anything, it can be sweet, it can be fruity, it can be savoury or it can just simply be bread. The cheapest supermarket loaf appears to be around the 49p mark, so I thought it was about time to show how simple it is to make huge savings on something that many of us use on a daily basis. Give us our daily bread - at a price we can all afford.A kilo of plain flour costs around 35p but a kilo of strong bread flour can cost £1 - that's enough for two large loaves. These aren't highly marketed brands, just stores' own basic brands, but they do make surprisingly good bread and rolls. To begin with, you can practice with 4:1 ratio but it is possible to completely omit the more expensive strong flour and use only plain flour - making it cheaper still!THE 25p LOAF This was an experimental loaf to see if it would pass as good enough for the Frugaldom family. It's the most basic loaf I've ever made.  INGREDIENTS 220ml warm water 100ml whey (leftover from cheesemaking) 2 tsp salt 400g strong white bread flour 100g plain flour 1 tsp fast acting dried yeast All into breadmaker in that order, set to light, medium, basic loaf, and here's what I got -  It weighed in at 800g. On a gram for gram comparison, it's almost half the price of the cheapest available basic sliced white loaf. If you don't make cheese to produce the whey, make up the difference with water.Have fun experimenting. We have a frugal food section in the Frugaldom forums where you can compare notes, post results, share your successes (and failures - we all have them) and even share your photos. Hopefully, I'll see you there.The above is my basic recipe to which all sorts of herbs, fruits and/or seasonings can be added. If you are handbaking, you can easily split the mix into smaller loaves or bread rolls. Always remember to make the most of the heat being used to bake the bread as every penny counts in the quest for frugal living. Visit the Frugaldom Forum at http://www.frugaldom.com/  This morning felt warmer, despite the thermometer on the front windowsill  reading -4C. It's now almost 10.45am and there's no sign of sunshine, the place  is thick with frost, Itsy Bitsy (young Pekin, son of Mrs Splashy) is looking in  my livingroom window and the cat's run off with a mini Christmas tree. But it's  still milder weather and the water basins weren't frozen solid. I did have to  break the ice and thaw the smaller water feeders first thing, but it  didn't take a gallon of hot water to do so - thank goodness! The immersion  heater costs a fortune to run!   We've no central heating here, only 3 storage heaters, the open fire and,  now, the logburner. Oh, and there's a small, wall-mounted fan in the bathroom  that occasionally goes on for 10 minutes in the morning to warm the place.  With electricity prices soaring, I have the three storage heaters all set on  medium heat with no boost. It seems to keep the edge off things but, even at  that, we're getting through nearly £25 per week of electricity. This  includes one tank of hot water per day. It's a huge drop on last  year's closer to £50 during the prolonged sub-zero temperatures when we were  iced in for several weeks. Coal prices have, thankfully, stayed steady. We were  able to take advantage of the September special, so a neighbour and I went  between us for an extra ten bags of coal to get it at £10.50 per bag. One bag  lasts me around 10 - 12 days in this weather but we also have logs to account  for, so costs soon mount up during freezing temperatures. I haven't had to light  the stove in the kitchen yet because I'm now at the computer - laptop in the  livingroom, where the fire is lit. Bliss!   Having just read about the rebellion going on in Greece, as a result of  their Government's austerity measures, it got me wondering, yet  again, about the future. Is it really worth saving cash in the bank in  return for their dishing it out left, right and centre, paying ludicrous sums to  their executives, lending to failing businesses and all the time they are being  propped up by our taxes? After all, we get very little in return for 'lending'  it to the bank. Perhaps the students rallying around the country to demonstrate  against the UK tax situation maybe right - the UK Government should be looking  closer to home to raise what's needed to provide a decent education and  health service at the same time as provide an adequate AND  FAIR social security system.  Perhaps our demonstrating students  will gather support snowball fashion but what would they do if there was NO CASH  to lend them in order that they may study?    Does the UK really want to be renowned, the world over, for frugality?  Many Scots have been frugal for many years - the proof has been  recorded in history. The 'mean' Scot, the 'canny' Scot... take your  pick from many others, the world media still portrays us as MEAN.  Personally, I prefer the term 'frugal', as there's nobody I know who would see a  friend in need nor would they refuse to share their last pound with someone in  the same situation. Speaking of which, here comes another frugal Scot for a  frugal computer lesson, so I'd best be off... I'm away to analyse the cost of  our daily bread and will be back later with the results. :)         Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "Frugalcat's First Christmas Tree", "date": "Tuesday 14 December 2010", "text": "A festive, frugal update.Today, the Christmas tree went up - better late than never. It was a lovely surprise seeing it all lit up when I got back from town, all coloured lights and twinkly tinsel shining through the window. It's a very frugal tree, a locally grown spruce freshly cut from a fellow LETS member's forest at the *Doon of May. The barter cost equated to 2 jars of lemon curd and a dozen eggs. It's traditionally decorated, as this frugaler has used the same box of decorations for years. There's only one thing missing now... I need to make 'edible tinsel' to string along the hedge for the wildbirds. I suspect there will be corn popping and nut cracking in Frugaldom soon.Regular readers will know that Frugaldom became home to a kitten during the summer. Frugalcat is now 6 months old and still very playful and cheeky, so she's had a great time exploring the tree and testing all the decorations. I'm guessing there will be plenty of opportunity for playing catch and retrieve with the rolling Christmas baubles that have already been flicked off the branches. Redecorating the tree looks to be a daily exercise for the next couple of weeks. Silly cat has already got one of her presents - a kitty stocking from next door neighbours - and has her new toys all over the house.*Doon of May is where we're preparing to set up the Galloway LETS' food growers and producers group by way of a landsharing project in 2011. News will be available via Channel 4's Landshare website soon.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/If anyone ever tells you quail are lovely, simple to care for little gamebirds, remind them of how silly these feathered friends can be.Having spent many weeks deliberating over the best way to keep mine - penned in a shed or space to run around outdoors - we eventually settled for building them an outdoor pen with a large sheltered platform. Quail are originally migratory birds, so they should not like the cold and they certainly shouldn't like the dampness followed by sub-zero temperatures. However...My lovely little home-hatched, Japanese Coturnix Quail defy everything I've just said, so ignore it all. They don't hate the cold. Mine are hardy, Scottish quail. MacQuails, even!Last night, it being such a clear, starry night, I wrapped up and went outdoors late to watch the Gemenids - meteors - that were flashing overhead. It was about 10.30pm, it was -5C and the sky was amazing, so I guess that must have been why all the quail were out runing about their pen! I could hear them chirping and gurgling that throaty noise they make when chasing one another. They were out playing in the freezing moonlight!This morning, I peered anxiously into the run half expecting to see stiff little feathered bundles frozen to the ground but oh no, that wasn't what my quail were doing, they were dust bathing in their shavings inside the shelter and there were eggs lying OUTSIDE, FROZEN TO THE GROUND! Lifting them out, I could clearly see that the eggs were frozen solid, they had expanded and had split their shells from end to end. No wonder the Frugaldom cat likes meal time... I'd to thaw the eggs in her porridge so she didn't miss her fresh quail egg breakfast. How does the saying go? Toffs are careless? Frugal living does have some luxurious side effects besides helping you remain debt free.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/It's that time of year again, when porridge always sounds good for breakfast, followed by a soup and pudding lunch. Not being of the right stuff to be able to kill my own chickens, I have to buy mine from the supermarket, so it's a case of a freezer full of chicken when our nearest supermarket has them on a half price offer. They have just such an offer running at the moment, alongside half price beef, ham and gammon roasts, so the freezer is full. I managed to cram it all in along with all the frozen fruit and veg, breadcrumbs and tomato based sauces that accumulate throughout the summer.Roast chicken in this house, since the arrival of 'George', my pot belly stove, means slow cooking the bird in a roasting tin on top of the log burner. I normally put about a litre of water in the bottom and then sit the whole chicken on top of the wire rack, where it probably steams more than it roasts. A few vegetables can be cooked around the edges and a sprinkling of mixed herbs and salt over the lot of it helps add extra flavour. I have indulged in placing some smoked bacon over the top, too, but that's just for special occasions.First day is roast dinner with gravy, potatoes and mixed veggies, second day is soup-making day. The majority of the meat has already been removed and portioned up for piemaking, curries, stir fry and/or sweet  and sour but what's left stays on the bones, then the whole thing gets slow cooked overnight to produce about 5 litres of stock. Last night I made the stock, so today was soup-making day... Only the soup has turned out more like stew! Having drained the stock, I did as I usually do - added onions, a chopped leek and a few carrots then rounded it off with a good dose of rice. It's well seasoned with salt, pepper and herbs, so I water it down to allow for the rice absobing the stock. Things were looking good.I'd to pop into town to take a neighbour for her shopping - being frugal, we car share. Only problem was, I had absent mindedly turned the slow cooker to high instead of off completely! There was someone in the house at the time, but I'd had no reason to let them know the soup needed any attention. Got back 2 hours later to find the rice had almost filled the pan! I've had to water it down again and now have enough soup to feed a small nation. Looks like neighbours on both sides will be getting knocks on their doors and I've posted out an offer through Galloway LETS (Local Exchange Trading Scheme) to see who else needs some. There's certainly enough chicken soup for us all!That's not bad for a £3.84 family sized chicken - 4 meals and 5+ litres of soup. Sad thing is, with all this frugal living, there's never any space in the freezer for any inadvertent over-production hiccups in the food department.Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.com"},

{"title": "The Great Frugaldom Challenge of 2011", "date": "Monday 6 December 2010", "text": "BEATING THE BUDGET IN FRUGALDOMThe challenge - pay the rent/mortgage, pay the council tax, live off £4,000 for the yearThe annual budget is something that has been analysed, reconfigured, reanalysed and rejigged so often that it has become second nature to readjust all the columns of the spreadsheet with each spend. It now accounts for every penny that comes in or goes out of the Frugaldom account. This isn't like the good life, this IS the good life, only we can't rear animals in our back yard for meat and we can't keep a pet goat or a pet cow for milking. We need to work to earn the cash needed to pay for the things we can't produce for ourselves. Frugaldom is going to attempt, once again, to beat the budget. We can keep poultry, grow fruit & veg and work from home at making it all a success.£4,000 was the figure I arrived at several years ago, when helping others with their debt consolidation. The figure, or thereabouts, cropped up often in various financial situations. whether the households concerned were earning £10,000 per year or earning £30,000 a year, their overheads and household expenditure seemed to follow accordingly and, in most cases, the £4,000 was what was left over after paying all the bills, hire purchase, rent/mortgage, council tax, work related expenses and debt repayments. Now, the differences are beginning to show, with those of us in rented houses paying more than some of those in their own, mortgaged homes. Yet the general concensus is that things are getting worse. They aren't, it's just that people's perceptions of what they must have as opposed to what they actually need have changed drastically over the past thirty or so years. In the late 80's, a reasonable income for an ordinary worker was around £3,000 to £5,000. Taking the lower limit, a £3,000 per annum income would secure you a maximum £10,500 mortgage. In today's dire and dangerous economic climate, each £3,000 could have secured you £15,000 so it isn't difficult to see how that would affect the housing market. But I digress.From the late 90's, £4,000 was the average amount left over for your average household to survive. From this, all the household bills, food, clothing, utilities and extras had to be paid. But we've moved on twenty years since then and, for many of us, the income hasn't kept abreast of the pricing increases and it's now impossible to buy a house for 3.5 times the minimum wage. (If anyone knows of any reasonably habitable, ready to move into properties in the £37,000 range, please let us know.) So, with several years of practice beneath my belt, I'm about to embark on the 2011 challenge - to live off £4,000 for a full year. This will be the fifth year in a row that the challenge has been set at this figure and we haven't failed yet.Since the original challenge began, prices have fluctuated to such an extent that it IS still possible. Many things are now readily available at a fraction of their original cost, whilst others are much more expensive. In 1980, you could buy 20 cigarettes for around 75p, petrol was around 75p for a gallon. Cigarettes and petrol have roughly stayed neck and neck in the pricing stakes, both costing over £5 now. But think of computers. I remember we paid around £1,500 for a basic PC with a 9600bps modem and thinking, in 1995, that it was amazing being able to access the Internet. I could now buy an all singing, all dancing laptop for under £300. In the late 90's, Internet access was billed by the minute on a local rate number. You paid your £25 per month then had to pay your telephone company for all time spent online. Running an online business could mean bills of hundreds of pounds per month. Now I pay under £20 for 24 hour access at speeds that were unimaginable back then. Times change, progress marches on, we CAN adapt by manipulating our budgets to fit what now seems like a miniscule amount.How can we live on £4,000 for a full year? Well, for a start, I am not counting on having any fancy holidays or spending on extravagancies like hair styling, manicures, regular trips to the pub, a wardrobe of new clothes or umpteen pairs of new shoes, nor am I intending joining a gym, paying to be told not to eat so I can lose weight or parting with any of my cash for the purposes of any other fun exercise or hobbies. These are all non-essentials. We have acres of forestry and national parks that can be enjoyed free of charge and we have who knows how many channels on TV plus a whole worlld of websites if you prefer staying indoors. Homebrew is fun to make and tastes just fine to me - better still when it's made with foraged or homegrown fruit then turned into frugal champagne. How much could you save, how much extra could you pay off your mortgage, how many debts could you clear if you were able to run your household on £4,000 per year? This is not for the faint hearted, so be warned. It can get tough, it can get boring, it can get frustrating and it can get mind-bogglingly complicated to the point of distraction. But it's also rather addictive and can create what I call 'Numerical OCD'.If you're brave enough to take on this challenge, join us in the Frugaldom Forums and get ready for 2011.If you thought it was hard work going out to do your shift for an employer, try working your money until it's screaming at you. The household budget IS your job and it's no easy feat when it gets to frugal living. It could be the ride of your life or it could be you'll give up and resort to the consumerist lifestyle of fulfilling your own wants at the expense of all others. Either way, you've nothing to lose in trying. It is, afterall, better to have tried and failed than never to have tried in the first place. (And you've always got the savings to play with at the end of it all.)Good luck to all who choose to take up this challenge and many thanks to all who have taken part during previous years.Coming soon... the easiest way to assess your own household budget."},
{"title": "Getting Chillier by the Day", "date": "Monday 6 December 2010", "text": "Temperatures have plummeted again, this time to -9C. It's still nowhere near the -21C they're getting in the north but it's cold enough to ensure everything here remains frozen from one day until the next. Thankfully, we have been getting some sunshine in between, so the hens and ducks are still able to soak up some rays, enough for them to lay us a few eggs. There's still only one of the five ducks laying every day but there are six or seven of the hens laying, plus a few of the quail. Eggs are in plentiful supply in the Frugaldom household and any surplus easily find a home.The forecast this week is for more snow but we've been very lucky so far. Here's hoping it will miss us for a while longer. Frugaldom is pretty much stocked up with everything needed to survive a few weeks of being blocked in but I'd prefer that not to happen. Apart from that, I'm going to end up having to buy potatoes! I'm still gutted that the mice got at the potato sack in the garage and, over the weeks, almost emptied it before anyone noticed. The remaining potatoes are frozen solid in their barrels on the greenhouse patio, so no hope of retrieving them for a while and not too confident that they'll even be edible by the time I can dig them out. The leeks seem to be surviving, though, even if they are looking a bit sorry for themselves.LEEK & CHEESE QUICHEMade up some shortcrust pastry last night and decided to have cheese and leek quiche. I still have about half a dozen leeks in the freezer and these are so easy to chop for using immediately. I chopped one large leek, gave it a couple of minutes in the microwave on high then put it over the base of the uncooked pastry. Next, I grated over a thick layer of cheddar (it's all I keep in stock) then poured over the egg mix. I used half a dozen of my freerange garden hen eggs with some milk, salt and pepper. This was baked in the oven at avout 220C for 20 minutes and came out looking a lovely golden brown on top. I had beaten the eggs, so it had risen a fair bit. Tasted delicious and there was enough left over to have for lunch today."},
{"title": "The tax avoidance debacle - what about inheritance tax?", "date": "Sunday 5 December 2010", "text": "TAX AVOIDANCE and TREESAfter reading about the situation that has arisen between The Hub and the Forestry Commission, it got me thinking a bit more about the billions of tax pounds that don't reach the Treasury because of all the avoidance loopholes. It suddenly highlighted the next potential 'loophole' that will be flooding the rich list marketplace - Forestry and woodland.As we all should know, there is no inheritance tax liability on forestry or woodland, so it makes it a fairly lucrative asset, especially if it's generating an income in the meantime. But it's also one that's quite difficult to find at the right price at the right time. I know - I have been trying to find a little square of land for many years, but there's always something gets in the way. (Usually someone with a great deal more money.) Soon, however, there could be a huge sell off of up to 150,000 hectares of Forestry Commission land in England and I can't help but wonder if the Government has timed this nicely to coincide with a possible tightening of the existing tax avoidance 'schemes', especially in the wake of their capping the pension investments limits. Could we see multi-national companies and individuals with huge annual dividends shelling out their dosh on wood? Perhaps money really does grow on trees. It's certainly a very lucrative (and IHT avoiding) investment if we can afford it. It also puts the some capital back into the public purse. Sounds a bit of a 'quick fix' solution to budget deficits, albeit on a tiny scale, but the land they'll probably sell will be based on commercial viability. If it doesn't pay, get rid of it. Good theory if you haven't the readies to develop something - cut and run, let someone else do it, then tax them somewhere along the line.What I don't quite understand is how the sell-off will contribute to the current green policies and how virtually privatising forests will help the Government to achieve the unrealistic carbon emissions reduction targets. Surely, by selling the woodland & forests into the private sector, it can only result in commercialisation of that land and I wouldn't bet on it all being for eco-friendly biomass. I realise that one man and a chainsaw cannot manage a huge forest, but nor can he take up residence to earn his living from that land, even if he owns it outright. So the 150,000 hectares that's set to flood the market will surely become the property of the chosen few. No word of a similar sell off here in Scotland, yet, but let's hope the day never comes when we see the break up of the great Galloway Forest.My suggestion would be to contact your local Forestry Commission and stake your claim on whatever you can. Ask friends, relatives, colleagues and acquaintances, set up a co-operative, do whatever it takes to keep the forests and woodlands from being ruined. At worst, you can cultivate part of it, apply for a holding number and follow a frugal lifestyle whilst planning your retirement. Your kids won't be liable for inheritance tax but neither will they ever be able to live there. Nor can you. But if they ever abolish those rules, there'll be plenty of commercial entities out there waiting to snap up your land when given half the chance.Money may not grow on trees but without trees and the associated plant and animal life, what good is money? I'd venture as far as to suggest that our entire existence has relied on them."},

I can't go back on my word, what should I do? ==================== Answer: Invite them to your place at various times, tell them all to bring a bottle and then get to the supermarket ASAP to buy the following: 20 tins/jars of supermarket basic curry sauce (£2) Onions (£2) Mixed peppers (£5) Sultanas or raisins (£1) 4 large chickens (£20) 5Kg of rice (£5) Any spare veg you can pick from the garden, even carrots & potatoesTotal cost = £35 (50p per person) By cooking the extra veggies and sultanas to add into the sauce, it'll disguise that it came from a jar or a tin. If you can get jars, all the better. (Asda and Sainsbury's do jars) That way you'll have 20 empties that can be recycled for next year's jam-making. Don't forget to strip every available piece of meat from the chickens and chop it fairly small. And certainly don't forget to save all the extras & bones for making stock. You could get 20 litres of soup out of that lot.  The above can all be frozen. If anyone complains about the quality, tell them you said only that you'd 'get them a curry', if anyone offers to chip in towards all the expense, charge them £1 each and offer to make it a regular event.

{"title": "As the snow reaches Frugaldom, we hope we're fully prepared.", "date": "Friday 3 December 2010", "text": "03/12/10 - Snow arrives at Frugaldom﻿Last night's thermometer reading was -8C and the sky was clear but by morning it was snowing. There was only about 1cm lying but the temperature has now risen to 0C and the snow is still falling. Weather warnings have just been issued for the A75 Newton Stewart to Stranraer, as so little traffic is passing that the snow is lying on the road. It's now 12.30pm and the snow is still falling.Thankfully, neighbour and I made it into town yesterday, so the cupboards are still full and UHT milk supplies are plentiful. Fresh fruit and vegetables look to be what will be in short supply, as stores struggle to keep shelves filled while deliveries are unable to replenish dwindling stocks: no 'Super Six' offers in our local Aldi - shelves there were completely bare.The hens and ducks have actually gone in search of shelter, which is quite unusual. We may need to put the tarpaulin back over the top of the 'feeding station' run to ensure they have a dry spot for feeding. Extra feed and water dishes have been placed inside the coops for the less bold, to ensure they have constant access to feed.The driving time restrictions have been lifted for drivers of feed wagons delivering to poultry farms, so this should help in ensuring that deliveries get through, even if there are hold ups along the way. Frugaldom has been quite lucky in missing the recent heavy snowfall but it doesn't take much to block the mile plus of single track road that joins us to the outside world. I strongly advise all garden poultry keepers to ensure their stocks of feeding and bedding are kept up to avoid any 'running out' emergencies.In the Frugaldom store cupboard there's always a stock of flours, sugar, yeast, porridge oats, pulses, packets and tins. In the event of power failure, the stove can double up for cooking and heating water (or melting ice & snow) to ensure an uninterupted supply of drinking water for the poultry. How we're going to dig out any more veggies from the garden is a bit of a mystery, though.Quail seem to be doing OK, all things considered. We even got a couple of eggs from them this morning. Electricity consumption is well up, though, as keeping a tank of hot water for thawing out water dishes is a bit of a down side to running a household on a budget of £4,000 for the entire year.I hope everyone is keeping warm and well. Please don't venture out onto the dangerous roads unless it is absolutely essential. This is where working from home really comes into play because no work always means no money but the ability to earn despite blocked roads is a definite plus. But it all hangs on the ability to access the Internet and that's dependent on the electricity and telephone cables staying fully functional.Delivery drivers, take care. We need those main routes kept open for emergencies.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},

Not like water off a duck's back at all - it's frozen solid!Well, so much for the old addage, \"like water off a duck's back,\" as that certainly doesn't hold true at -5C I didn't notice it on the white ducks but when Pingu and Pongo, the young drakes, managed to get in for their 'bath', the black feathers revealed the truth - the water is freezing to the birds' feathers! Sunshine just appearing over the hill at the moment, so that should defrost them but it's a bit of a to do when we need to thaw out our ducks in the mornings!Let's hope the sunshine arrives and hangs around for the day - those clouds aren't looking very friendly.Meanwhile, one of my Silkie haens has dcecided she wants to be broody and is sitting tight, neck deep in straw, refusing to move for anything or anyone. She looks very snuggly in her nest but she doesn't have any eggs, so I'm not sure what she's expecting to hatch.The dark clouds have now passed overhead and we have winter sunshine again. Time to get a washing on and see if it's possible to get anything dried on the line. Not much of a breeze, so I suspect it will freeze solid quicker than it will dry."},

Despite the winter sunshine, temperatures in the shadier parts of the garden haven't been getting above zero, so it's a constant battle to keep the supply of fresh water available to the hend, ducks and quail.In such cold weather, their breakfast is warm mash, their water dishes get thawed out and then replenished with warm water. However, I decided to sit a basin out in the open this morning, to allow all the ducks around it. Hmm... not sure this was such a good idea, as they're taking turns at having a warm bath and spraying water all ways, scattering the hens and creating what should soon become a lovely ice rink! I'll need to go move it back into its corner before everything freezes and we have big ducky feet stuck to the metal drain cover!

{"title": "Chilly Weather But No Snow in Frugaldom.", "date": "Wednesday 1 December 2010", "text": "﻿1st December 2010The past couple of days have been very cold but gloriously sunny. It's actually quite warm in the sunshine, so we've been sitting out at the back door for coffee breaks in between seeing to hens, ducks and quail.Egg laying is on the increase, so I've been able to set aside a few extras for selling and also made the first batch of stove-top lemon curd. It's just cooling now. I've also popped two trays of muesli biscuits into the oven, so bring on the visitors - we have something to accompany the coffee. :)Keeping the stove going is a daily chore, as is trying to keep a ready supply of dry  firewood. Chopping logs and splitting sticks is a very regular occurance here - we just can't get enough of the stuff. With temperatures not getting above freezing, most days, it's going to be great once the wet weather returns - NOT!The plan to summarise the past year fell apart. It just seemed silly copying it all over here when it's already on the old website, so that time-wasting project has been called to a halt.Off to check on the biscuits then make lunch; can't decide between soup and bread or eggs on toast. Such are the major decisions that have to be made in Frugaldom.LUXURY LEMON CURD RECIPE4 egg yolks (I use our own freerange hens' eggs)150g sugar100mls lemon juice (you can substitute this for lime juice or do half and half mixed)70g butter (or margarine)Beat the egg yolks and sugar together whilst gently warming the butter and lemon juice. Add the egg yolk/sugar mix to the pan and whisk together with the lemon and butter. Keep this on a low heat and whisk regularly until the mixture thickens to resemble custard. If you are cooking on a log burner, it's easier to take the pan off the heat to whisk it, otherwise cook slowly over a low heat. Do not allow the mix to boil.Pour into a sterilised, pre-heated jar and leave to cool. Once set, keep it refrigerated.

{"title": "What is microholding?", "date": "Sunday 28 November 2010", "text": "MICROHOLDING  COMPANY   It's smallholding  on a smaller scale and self-sufficiency in everything, including finances. It is  also a miniscule holding company for all  future investments pertaining to the frugal  entrepreneur.   Microholding is the term I  use to describe Frugaldom. It isn't a smallholding because it's too small and it  isn't a proper holding company, because it has nothing much to hold.     We only have a garden, but it is  the basis for a self sufficientish lifestyle. It offers essential growing and  rearing space to provide us with edible produce, be it fruit, veg or eggs.  Ideally, it could provide us with meat, but we haven't ventured within those  realms. It provides us with a roof over our heads and a place from which to work  and earn a living. So, if you ever fancied life as a smallholder but haven't the  time, energy, health or wealth to do so, then will power and the ability to  adapt one thing into another is all it takes to create your very own  microholding.    There's no minimum investment and no minimum  land mass requirement - a patio, balcony or, even, windowsills could provide you  with the basis for your own microholding project, along with a comfy seat and a  laptop, which can provide you with what's needed to conduct all your  financial dealings.   \"Micro,\" by definition, means  very small or suitable for being operated and maintained by one person, so the  prefix associated with holdings sounds apt to me. I have a micro-office  from which to run my microholding company. But can I call it a company? Of  course I can. It's an entity engaged in the commercial business of  earning a living.    On the other side of this  lifestyle coin is real money - the hard cash that we all need in order to  survive within the realms of modern society, leading a normal life, paying  bills, investing, saving for the future. In this respect, 'microholding' is  about those small investments made in an attempt to grow and safeguard your own  financial future. Think of it as planting and growing money trees. Your  personal investments portfolio may be miniscule (or micro) to begin with - a  mere handful of seeds - but it is yours, bought and paid for by you, designed to  help provide for your future. It is your responsibility to ensure its  safekeeping. Just like sowing the seeds that produce the food in your garden,  you need to sow the seeds of individual investments, ensure they are provided  with the best possible opportunities to germinate then carefully cultivate them  to ensure their future productivity. Just putting food on the table isn't  enough, we still need to think of the future.   In our present economic climate,  during these times of what's being called, \"austerity\", we need to do more than  just save a few pennies into the bank. Secure your own future, start your  microholding now. Even £100 transferred to Premium Bonds is a start.  It's for the longterm, afterall.    Join us  in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "Contemplating Self Sufficiency in the 21st Century", "date": "Saturday 27 November 2010", "text": "Self Sufficiency in 21st Century - Can it be achieved?How could it possibly be made to work from an ordinary house with an ordinary garden? My answer to this isn't smallholding, it's microholding! We haven't any land for grazing livestock or cultivating orchards but we do have a garden and that's enough to be going on with for now.Self-sufficiency needn't exclude generating cash, it just means gainful employment and state benefits don't count. Being self employed means we need to earn sufficient money to pay bills, taxes, National Insurance, overheads, running costs and day to day living expenses.  Self sufficiency is simply the term we use to mean personally sufficient in all our needs, bill paying included. The lower the overheads, the less need to worry about how to generate sufficient cash to survive. Understanding the overheads is paramount to success, as is fully comprehending the differences between needs and wants. At this precise moment in time, we are entirely self-sufficient on the financial front but not in the homegrown produce department. The proof that it could be done is something I have always wanted to witness. The following is a breakdown of the estimated amount we, as a household of two adults, would NEED in order to survive until such times as the microholding was working to its fullest potential. As an ordinary household, rearing livestock is out, but there's still space for poultry.Groceries £600.00Toiletries £35.00Cleaning £10.00Electricity £450.00 - £1 per day plus standing chargeCoal £115.00 - multifuel stove for hot water, heat, cookingLogs £200.00 - multifuel stove for hot water, heat, cookingInternet £216 including phone callesMobiles £0.00 - no mobilesTelephone £144 - line rentalTV Licence £0.00 - no TV, it isn't an essentialClothing & footwear £40.00Gifts £0.00 - homemadeExtras £70.00Travel £180.00Household Insurance £45.00Other insurance - £360.00 - 2 lotsLivestock £350.00National Insurance £250.00 - 2 lotsCouncil Tax £935.00 - no water rates as no water mains, reservoir fedTOTAL - £4,000.00Although a TV is not an essential, the telephone and Internet access are. These are your basic contact networks with the outside world, a source of income, advertising, marketing and PR. Most of all, it's the quickest way of keeping in contact with what's happening in the world of finance - where you can source the best bargains and really work your money. The above scenario assumes that you own your own home outright - no mortgage, no rent. Between two people, it's only £5.47 per person, per day that needs to be earned in order to survive. If you have rent or a mortgage, add that in, too.But move on from that for now, we're still preparing the microholding. We need to grow fruit and vegetables as well as have fresh eggs. Cheap Fruit Bushes - Aldi special offer was 3 for £2.49 in February 2010, so that's at least a dozen fruit bushes for under £10. I set aside a tenner. I was still mulling over the incubator conundrum for quail egg hatching and had decided to sell 2 of the 3 portables and invest in a more substantial one. Promptly listed them on eBid and sold the first one overnight. Result!The usual chores get done on a daily basis - sorting out the fire, stocking up the kindling (cones and sticks), chopping logs, breadmaking, laundry, seeing to the feathered friends and stopping for coffee whenever a visitor arrives. Rural living doesn't need to mean being anti-social, there are always friends and nearby neighbours who'll visit.Reducing the overheads pound by pound or penny by penny - whatever it takes - do it. Managed to shave £2 per month off the Internet and got all standard telephone calls included, an overall annual saving of around £115.00 by the time the BT online paperfree billing discount and free calls were taken into consideration.Dug up a few more potatoes that had survived the winter frosts, food is food, waste not, want not. The garden wasn't looking too productive at the start of the year. The coal bunker was almost empty - we were down to the dross, but the log store was full. By the end of January, there was £3641.19 left of the household budget. £210 of the £358.81 spent had gone into the electricity meter! February arrived with sub-zero temperatures.Despite the frozen ground, we pushed on at getting the new raised bed completed in the front garden. The railway sleepers allowed for 64 square feet but I wanted 16 of those squares to form a path along the middle, so every square was easy to reach. Filled up both sides with compost and molehill soil. The hens and ducks had a great time helping by scratching and pecking, so they got left to do the job of breaking up the clumps of frozen soil.Aldi fruit bushes came on special offer. Remained strong, though, and only bought the 4 packs of 3, as planned. Managed to get:2 x Tayberries4 x Raspberries2 x Gooseberries1 x Redcurrant3 x BlackcurrantOn the 5th of February, I noticed that the first of the tomato and pepper seeds had germinated and popped their heads through the soil in their pots on the kitchen windowsill! That same day, the postman delivered the 2 free packs of Allinson's baking yeast, so it was a good start to the day. Dry weather meant getting into the garden so preparations were underway for getting the new fruit bushes planted.Indoor jobs included the making of more marmalade, in order to use up some oranges and limes that I'd traded for via LETS, some kidney bean pate and a game/veg pie.Bean Pate RecipeKidney beans2 Tablespoons Olive OilFinely chopped onion2 cloves garlic. crushedTeaspoon Chilli - finely chopped or powderedTeaspoon PaprikaLightly fry the onion and garlic in the olive oil then blitz everything in a blender. It's so easy to make that you can adapt the recipe to suit your own taste. Seems to keep fine in the fridge for a couple of weeks.The incubator was ready to set half a dozen Silkie and Pekin eggs. Wasn't 100% sure which were which, so set half a dozen.I started a rag rug using an old hessian peanut sack and strips of material from a bag of scraps. Was full of great intentions until I got bored with it! I'm not very good at sitting still for any length of time and, apart from that, the weather had taken a peculiar turn - I ended up getting sunburned on 6th February. We managed to get a much larger growing area dug in the furthest corner plus the fruit bushes got planted - all 21 of them from what was supposed to be 12. Last year's fruit bushes got fenced in to safeguard them from ducks, the new square foot garden got topped up with more compost and we discovered a few more potatoes that had been missed. Got a couple more meals out of them. The following day, the raised bed/square foot garden got fenced and a gate fitted. It's the only way to keep the feathered marauders from demolishing whatever gets planted.Took some time out to go over the 2007 challenge notes to see if there were any glaring differences and there's an entry about seeing the first bumble bee of the year - in February! There's also a note saying that cigarettes were £4.29 per 20. Same brand now is £5.30 That's a 23.5% increase! If only I'd invested heavily in cigarettes, I could have made a small fortune! Are there sell by dates on them? No!By the 9th February, we were getting 9 hours of daylight, almost two thirds of the way to the magical 14 hours that the birds need for optimum laying. Still weren't getting many eggs at that point but it was enough to avoid the need for buying them. It was also sufficient to keep the lemon curd production line operational. Soup making was at its peak, to the point that I needed to increase production to keep up with demand. Managed to find a 6 litre slow cooker for under £20 including delivery - excellent! Despite the continuing sub-zero temperatures, the sun kept shining that week, enough for line drying laundry, which was great. By the 11th, it was -7C This was good for emptying the contents of the freezer to reorganise it, not so good for digging a duck pond! By the 13th, we saw the arrival of the first lamb in the fields adjoining Frugaldom. 13th also brought news of Aldi's fruit tree offer - cue more cheap trees! Keeping control of a strict budget is difficult but fruit trees at under £5 each is fantastic! Perhaps it's safest not to know about these bargains; what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over, and all that. Then again, look to the future and all that extra potential for homegrown apples, pears, plums and cherries.Still spending £30 a week on electricity while trying to keep the place from freezing, but the budget is being adhered to; if money gets spent on anything outside of the basic household budget, it has to come from residual income - egg related sales, commissions, eBid, winnings and bank interest payments on existing savings. With luck, there would be a few more chicks hatching soon.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Life in Frugaldom: Catching up - 15th to 28th Jan 2010", "date": "Thursday 25 November 2010", "text": "The day of reckoning was upon us! The washing was done, there was a pineapple upside down cake in the oven, the biscuits were baked and I'd to wait for S2BN (soon-to-be-neighbour) getting back from town before the deed could be done - the preparing of the two brace of pheasants. I'd already printed off step by step instructions and S2BN had been watching YouTube videos of people making it look easy. Not going to go into detail on here but, suffice to say, the plucking was easier than I'd expected - despite the giggles! I slow cooked the four birds overnight, adding red wine, garlic and brown sugar for flavour. Thoroughly enjoyed the end result, although the other occupants of this frugal household weren't so keen. I didn't bother telling them that the broth was game soup or what was in the pies or casseroles from that day forward.Went to a birthday lunch on the 17th, most enjoyable. Arrived home laden with leftovers of cake and trifle. The weather was dry and bright, so we got outside afterwards and spent an hour or so tidying the greenhouse, preparing seed trays and looking out the vegetable seeds.After the fog cleared away on the 18th, most of the outdoor time was spent trying to clear up the aftermath of the mole-duck-hen wars. Then I managed to rescue a sole survivor, in the shape of a lonesome lettuce, from the big, covered tub by the back door. (Except it was no longer covered - ducks had demolished it!) It got emptied, refilled, more seeds sown and moved into the greenhouse. It was surprisingly warm in the sunshine! 18C in the greenhouse! There were no parsnips planted here in 2009, so I was down to the last of the leeks, turnips and carrots in the winter veg beds. Aiming for more leeks, onions, potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, peas, beans, and beetroot in 2010. The garlic has already sprouted through the frozen soil!Bailey, the pheasant, was still with us, perfectly happy to eat, drink and socialise with the hens alongside. He got a newly revamped run with solid brick base that shouldn't let anything burrow in or out - Bailey bird seems to think he's a chicken!By the 20th, it was pouring rain again, but there was a bit of excitement. People were starting to view the empty property next door! It'll be nice to see some life about the place, I only hope they've done their homework properly and can embrace frugal life by bartering with the neighbours. Progress in revamping the kitchen was slow. I wanted to create a mini-farmhouse kitchen, complete with pot belly stove, but what I had was a shambles that sent a chill through your bones in the winter mornings.Finished picking the last of the leeks and got them into the freezer - another item I won't need to buy in 2010 - then baked several carrot and sultana loaves to help reduce carrot mountain. The winds were howling by then, so candles were at the ready, along with some quick-fix snacks and flasks of boiling water, just in case of power cuts . More baking - gluten free loaves, to make a start using up the 10p bargain packs I'd bulk bought. First lot turned out like bricks, might make good fuel for the fire!Laundry detergent getting low, so had to make another batch of that:5 litres water1 cup washing soda1 bar of soap (or equivalent) Few drops of essential oils - I like tea tree & lavenderMade 15 litres of the stuff, added some blue dye to half of it so it, hopefully, would make whites whiter. It should last for a good few months. Can't remember last time I bought laundry detergent. Cheated on the essential oils by using natural soap with lavender and tea tree oil added - makes it anti-bacterial and it smells nice.22nd January - dragged a big wooden workbench frame from the garage, cleaned it up, then added an old piece of kitchen worktop. Re-jigging of the Frugaldon kitchen was now in progress. The charity shop bought stand was looking quite good once it was cleaned up and filled. Meanwhile, H had to do emergency repairs outside after last night's storm - replacing collapsed fencing, mending and pinning everything down with the surplus bricks from next door's messy corner. Share and share alike in Frugaldom, that's the number one rule of living here. 23rd January - Hens and ducks fed & watered, paths swept, new kitchen space admired and breakfast made. Attempted to make some 'elixir' for adding to the poultry water feeders: surely that would help encourage more egg laying.ELIXIR1 cup apple cider vinegar1 cup honey8 cloves garlicBlend for 60 seconds, pour mixture into a glass container, seal and leave in the frige for five days. Normal dosage is 1 to 2 teaspoonsful in a glass of water or fruit juice before breakfast for humans. Guess a tablespoonful will be enough in each hen water feeder. Hoped the duck eggs wouldn't taste of garlic!Met up with S2BN for a cuppa and traded off some gherkins in exchange for a large jar of pickled beetroot. Next job was thinning out all the cookery books that I'd acquired, traded them out, too. Planted up a pot of mixed herb seeds, recycled a box of glass jars, started making a trifle and fitted in a two hour walk to take photographs. Between clearing out jam jars and having the walk, met landlord and had rewarding chat - got permission, at long last, to install the woodburner into the kitchen. CELEBRATING! (Elderflower 'champagne', anyone?)The price of washing-up liquid had been annoying me, so an attempt was made at a DIY variety:Washing Up Liquid3 x litres boiling water6 x drops tea tree or lime or lavender essential oil (or just use lemon or lime juice!)1 x heaped tablespoon soap flakes1 x heaped tablespoon of soda crystals1 x tablespoon white vinegarI grated a bar of my 'natural soap with teatree and lavender extract' to make the soap flakes. On measuring it, there's enough to make 8 lots of the above... 24 litres! My recipe worked out at the following prices:Soap flakes - 33p (8 heaped tablespoons)Tea tree - already in the soap flakesLavender - already in the soap flakesSoda crystals - 16p (8 heaped tablespoons)Vinegar - 8p (8 tablespoons)TOTAL = £0.57 for 24 litresCan you believe that? I couldn't!  Homemade, own variety eco-friendly washing up liquid for less than 3p per litre when shop bought stuff costs about 98p per litre! Awesome frugalicious find! I will never again buy W.U.L.! (Or so I thought!)24th January - Whole list of stuff added to the 'to do' list while waiting for the porridge to cook. Ive been baking regularly - bread, biscuits, macaroons etc. Found time to start researching logburners and multifuel stoves and also managed to get several hundred single sachets of sugar split and emptied into a tub. A friend rehomed them this direction from a cafe closing down clearance. Counted out the £2 coins stash - £100 exactly! A good start to the stove fund.Made a list of products I should no longer need to buy in 2010. It currently stands at:EggsPastaBreadBiscuitsCakesJamLemon curdJelly (preserves)Pickles & chutneyLaundry detergentWashing up liquidGreetings cardsKindling for the fireThe longer the list grows, the less I need to spend. The less I need to spend, the more I can afford. Every penny saved is a penny earned and put in the bank for the longterm. 'Project logburner' was well and truly underway with every penny (and £2 coin) counted.25th January: Happy Birthday, Rabbie!  Burn's night was a chilly affair. Temperatures had plummeted and everything had frozen solid, back to defrosting everything and thawing out drinkers, feeders and door catches at dawn. Indoor work seemed more appealing, so the freebie sewing machine got set up, the pinny got mended and then a curtain made for hiding the wooden work stand that now graced the Frugaldom kitchen. I couldn't fix the broken dial for setting the stitch type, but I was able to turn the spindle with a pair of pliers. This was the only reason someone wanted to discard this machine to landfill!An electrician called, so the faulty light fittings have been repaired and he'll call back as soon as a date has been arranged with landlord for the removal of the broken storage heater in the kitchen. That will, at last, make way for the new stove. Electricity spending was standing at anything between between £30 and £50 per week plus the cost of coal & logs for the open fire.Did I mention we had a psychotic Silkie? Dear little Captain Cornflake had grown up and turned into a grumpy psycho-cockerel that hated the mere sight of moi! He'd taken to sitting behind things, just waiting for me to appear, then he'd pounce - all fluffy feathers, beak and spurs!! Rehoming enquiries were ongoing after one too many attacks - beak and claws tearing at my legs when I stupidly went out wearing shoes instead of wellies! Ouch! I'm a complete coward - psychobird won the fight despite my pathetic efforts at shaking a big stick at him! Pheasant casserole for dinner again - I called it stew, the others ate it with puff pastry. It was either that or I'd have had to buy a haggis, befitting the occasion. What we should really have had was that damned, fluffy psycho of a cockerel. Woe to the woosies who walk among us, for thee shall starve in the event of attempting real self-sufficiency on such a small scale.To round the night off, I did a bank sweep of all the extras that had accumulated from not spending plus the surplus raised in sales etc - £550!Approaching the end of January, the following is what's now being saved for recycling:paper - shredded for paper bricks & nesting material for henscardboard - for kindlingtoilet roll & similar inner tubes - stuffed with paper for kindlingtins - to the recyclingglass - mostly for storing preserves or else sent to recyclingclothing & material - sewing projects & recyclingegg shells - washed, dried & crushed for hensduck egg shells - going to attempt blowing them for decoratingtea bags - making plant food then compostingall fruit & veg peelings etc - hen feeding and compostingbreadcrumbs - frozen for future usehen bedding - recycled into compostwood ash - dug into garden or used as dust bath material for hensfallen cones & sticks - for kindlingdry leaves & wood chips - for hen runsseeds from peppers & tomatoes - for growing the following yearcandle ends - for kindlingsoap ends - for making laundry gloop & WULPlastic containers & tubs for storage & plantingTomato puree tubes - make excellent embellishments & decorationsAfter another powercut, I was back to 'project logburner' - I spotted a really cute little pot bellied stove / log burner on eBay that has the much needed hotplate on top! Stove cheap, all the accessories and fitting not cheap. Keep on saving.Managed to get given four large railway sleepers, so plan for a new raised bed for square foot vegetable gardening was put into action. All three of the compost bins were full, so a good basis for getting the new veg patch started. Hens and ducks got very excited about the arrival of the sleepers. They all had a great time helping. The overly exuberant ones, however, went and dig up my garlic! Son still wanted to look like Arnold Swartznegger, which meant feeding him copious amounts of chicken and eggs - told him he'd to buy all the extras himself, so he brought me three extra chickens to cook, 'because it was cheaper'. I'm so proud! Glad he likes cous cous with it - bulk bought that from discount food store, cost less than 10p per pack.28th January 2010 - Read the sad news of the death of J. D. Salinger. The man was a literary genius who influenced so many, yet actively sought neither fame nor glory. Decided to read, 'Catcher in the Rye' again.Spotted an offer for two free sachets of baking yeast on http://www.bakingmad.com/ while wasting time waiting for  biscuits to bake. Apologies for these posts being a bit disjointed. There's just so much to summarise and so many photographs to consider for inclusion.There ends weeks three and four of January 2010. Managed to spend a total of £86.49 over the fortnight and made back £6 in egg sales. With a son who eats half a dozen eggs a day and chickens that don't want to lay full tilt in winter, having 3 dozen spare eggs to sell was a miracle in the first place!£3,651.19 remaining from the original £4,000 but there's now £117.52 in the 'Everything Else Kitty'.More info and photos HEREJoin us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Part 2 in the Countdown to Frugaldom's 2011 Challenge", "date": "Monday 22 November 2010", "text": "﻿  =========================================================Woke at dawn and recorded outdoor temperature of -10C, but the sun soon shone from the clear sky. No amount of sunshine would call a halt to the morning's porridge making, so the laptop was left to boot up while the porridge oats were being blasted for their 6 minutes in the microwave - works out cheaper that way. :)Snow must have been playing games with the airwaves because the wireless modem was picking up a public access network, which was showing as a wi-fi hotspot! In this area? I think not! Never did work out that strange, technological conundrum. Concern at that point was for path clearing and constructing a better shelter where the hens and ducks could feed safely before their dinner and water froze solid. The paths around the house needed sweeping several times a day to avoid frozen poop syndrome! Stubbing your toe on a frozen one is no laughing matter, especially when nipping outside in slippers to top up feeders and break the ice that was continually forming over the water. The other problem was the blustering winds - forewarned the neighbours that a tarpaulin could end up hanging from their satellite dish.The slow baking meringues that had been left in the oven overnight failed miserably! As the oven cooled down, the condensation rose in the cold kitchen and the meringues seemed to have soaked it up like soggy sponges! Another lesson learned.Still chilly at -7C so the feathered friends have needed an extra top up of warm water at nights. Joey has been most annoyed at not being able to get into his bath and appears to have taken the huff with everyone, so the empty run got scraped clear of snow and we stretched a tarpaulin across the top of it in the hope that we could provide a bit of dry, non-icy space for the birds to eat, drink and be merry.Indoors, we'd resorted to turning up the electric heaters rather than risk running out of logs. The only other concern was that we'd run out of loo rolls and milk. By the 9th of January, temperatures had risen to around 0C, but not before my homemade rhubarb 'champagne' had frozen solid - glass bottles no good in these temperatures, so we lost several - the glass shattered. The elderflower variety seems to be doing ok wrapped in its straw jacket in the garage.Spent an evening churning over the spending, saving and trading possibilities within our frugal community and the number-crunching threw up the following:.Groceries £900Toiletries £60Cleaning £15Electricity £1,100Coal £150Logs £160Internet £240Mobiles £20Telephone £180TV Licence £145Clothing & footwear £35Gifts £200Misc £100Travel £120Insurances £225Livestock £350TOTAL £4,000A few major changes had occured:1) The grocery budget was slashed by about 25% to reflect LETS trading, bulk buying, bartering and home growing as much as possible. 2) Electricity had to be increased to reflect the Arctic conditions.3) The cost of keeping the hens was incorporated. Estimated annual costs of feeding & bedding for the hens and ducks is about double the above, but I hoped to recoup half the costs this year and have it fully self-funding by 20114) Insurances include a tax free savings bond with life assurance built into it. I reckoned it was OK to have this as a funeral-type policy5) Gifts budget got slashed until the Frugaldom project generated more cyberdosh.Bread, cakes, eggs, jams, pickles, preserves, gifts, greetings cards, wrappings and trappings were all listed as 'do not buy' items. I'd have loved to have included vegetables, but the garden just wasn't quite up to that yet. Managed a trip into town on the 10th but all the shops had run out of salt and porridge oats! Worse still, the cashline had run out of money! (Took note never to run out of any of the above ever again!) A frugal cookathon produced 16 beef olives, a marmalade and treacle tart, the usual bread, a tray of lemon thin biscuits and a tray of ginger biscuits. I was beginning to think there was an extra person hiding in Frugaldom, as cakes and biscuits just seem to disappear! Sadly, it's more a case of my subconscious efforts at increasing my winter padding.Fuel was getting low and by the 11th the log man still hadn't arrived. The snow was back, falling onto the icy lane, the meter was eating credit as the electric heaters stayed on continually and the guinea pig had taken not well. Poor, 'John Galloway', he went downhill so quickly and, sadly, passed away that night. Digging his little grave was a hard task, but he's now free to wander Guinea Pig heaven safe in the knowledge that his grave is protected by a homemade wormery, recycled from a wooden blanket box.Attended a LETS meeting on the 14th and got to meet a couple of new faces. Traded homemade soup and lemon curd for 4 pheasants, which got hung in the shed. Having never plucked or prepared anything before, I enrolled the help of future neighbour, who duly studied YouTube videos in advance of the pheasant plucking kitchen party. Too right there'd be homebrew involved somewhere! The hens were NOT amused when they spotted the birds hanging in the garden shed! Can't decide if they got in a flap at the mere sight of them or if it was because they knew their feed was in the same shed!On the eve of the 13th, the log man arrived - just in the nick of time, as it's cold and snowy out again. He just managed to get the little tipper truck back out the road, but had some serious problems trying to make it up the incline to the main road. It had been too dark to move the logs, so we left them until next day, when the rain promptly arrived! Everything got soaked! Then the fog rolled in - don't you just love Scottish weather? Hot chocolate was a warm welcome afterwards, as was the tax code notification letter that had arrived from HMRC - no tax to pay on the first £6,475 income - I hadn't even earned that!Did a cost analysis of Frugaldom poultry keeping, it showed I needed to sell 182 dozen eggs a year, whilst still having enough eggs for home use - EEK! New strategy needed, had to count in chicks before they're hatched - a good looking trio can fetch well over £100 on a busy day at market. Biggest problem - no poultry markets within 100 miles of here. Hmm... don't suppose singing to the chickens will make them lay any more eggs.Missed loads of fun-looking TV programmes because the adverse weather meant no signal. Only in our region could they discontinue analogue before digital was fully functional! The evening's entertainment proved to be just as funny, though - loading old photos into an album on Facebook.The snow slowly thawed to reveal what was left of the lawn - a muddy minefield covvered in mole bunkers! My lovely plastic-covered lettuce planter (made from a recycled tub, was a sad sight to behold. The quackers had pulled the cover to bits and scoffed all but one lonely, straggly little lettuce seedling. But all is not lost - some of the carrots, leeks and turnips had survived the feathered and furry brigade.When fridge inventory day arrived, I went foraging to the depths of refrigeration to see what was lurking in the furthest recesses. The expedition produced the following report:Duck eggs x 7milk x 1Lwhite wine (1/4 bottle approx)tomato ketchupbrown saucesweet chilli saucehot chilli saucelemon juicesalad creammayonnaisechutneymarmaladebramble and apple jellylemon curdlardblock of Briecheddar cheesepineapple rings6 yoghurtsa savoy cabbagebag of onionscookie doughjar of mincemeattiny piece of buttertub of margarinepack of bacon (still defrosting)Absolutely no space in the freezer at this point, so another bulk bake and cookathon day was out of the question, but cookies and a pineapple upsidedown cake got baked and a Brie based sauce got made. Syrup sponge in 6 minutes was microwave pudding and there were  plenty of sandwich options. There wasn't a lot of scope for 'real' meat and two veg type dinners, but the day of reckoning was fast approaching - the Frugaldom pheasant pluckers' kitchen work-out. End of week two, a very expensive week at £154.39 by the time the logs got paid. However, a lucky break meant payment arrived from a sales commission, a small amount of cashback landed in my account and the weekly sale of surplus eggs. Total extra income came in at £111.52, so the first fortnight in January 2010 actually cost me only £150.80 and I had a full log store, fridge, freezer and larder. Frugal living rules! :)"},
{"title": "A Look Back at 2010 in the Run up to 2011", "date": "Sunday 21 November 2010", "text": "Week One, 2010.I started the year full of enthusiasm with the usual list of New Year's resolutions - spend less, save more, get fit, live a more frugal life... you know the type of stuff. My year's budget for running the household was set at £4,000 after rent and council tax and the amount I wanted to save had been deducted. It was the same amount I'd budgeted for the previous four years, so I was already combatting the problem of inflation by adjusting lifestyle and eating habits to fit with each consecutive year.We'd had a lovely white Christmas, with some of the snow still lying. The day normally starts at dawn in Frugaldom, heralded in by an array of noisy cockerels, hens, ducks and quail. At this time of year, the cattle and sheep are normally fairly close by, sheltering as best they can from the chilly winds and I'm up before dawn to get the fire lit before going out to face the freezing morning. It was a dry, frosty start to the new year, with temperatures slightly below freezing. I'd managed to take a few photographs of the 'blue' moon before it disappeared. I also took some of dawn breaking over snowy Frugaldom; the skies look spectacular from here at this time of year. Celebrations like New Year, in the Frugaldom household, include the making of the clootie dumpling. It's a traditional Scottish fruit 'cake' that gets boiled in a cloot, or cloth. Mine is a family recipe, one that's been passed from mother to daughter for several generations. As a rule, I now keep all the basic ingredients in stock at all times – flour, suet, sugar, treacle, syrup, dried fruit, assorted spices and milk. A dumpling was duly made for New Year's Day. I also made shortbread, to try out my new cookie cutters. I think everyone was fed up with my using the hoops made from empty tuna tins, so I eventually caved and got myself a set from the eBid online auctions. Homemade elderflower champagne was the drink of choice on New Year's Day. The main meal included beef broth followed by the traditional steak pie accompanied by carrots, potatoes and braised red cabbage – a friend made the braised cabbage. Pudding was, of course, clootie dumpling. There were mince pies for later, homemade by a friend who would eventually become a neighbour.During that first week in January anything edible that could be frozen got frozen. Even the big old heron, not that I'm suggesting we eat him, looked frozen standing in his icy patch of the stream. Freezing weather is a great time for defrosting and cleaning your freezer, as none of your foodstuffs defrost if you leave everything in a box outside. After defrosting, cleaning and repacking my little chest freezer, I added a blanched cauliflower, pate, sliced dumpling, stewed tomatoes and a heap of chopped and blanched carrots. Even the surplus cheese found a space. Along with the normal bread baking, I also baked four banana loaves to use up my share of the bananas that soon-to-be neighbour bulk bought for a few pennies on New Year's Eve. I managed to squeeze the four of those into the freezer, too. Waste not, want not, my freezer was filled and Frugaldom was ready to face another year. All the vegetable offcuts and scraps get boiled for the feathered friends and, in return, they provide us with eggs. Egg production was picking up a bit, so lemon curd making was on the horizon.The 'wishing book' was duly unlocked and the previous year's list inspected. Out of the 'top 10' items I had in my 'To do in 2009' list, I had succeeded with 8 of them, failing only in the 'homemake all presents' category and the 'fill my ISA' stakes. We'd had a big wedding for daughter, so what wpuld have been savings had been put to good use, meaning no borrowing and no ensuing debt.With hindsight, hand-making ALL presents was too far-fetched for the world in which I live. I hadn't thought through the reality of preparing and making stuff and then ensuring it reached the right people at the right times, especially when they are scattered all over the country. Basically, I didn't plan, nor did I try hard enough to achieve that goal. I didn't really want to, if truth be told, I'd prefer to leave creativity to the creative or hand crafting to the handcrafters and simply trade for their skills.The garden and poultry 'project' had been the bulk of the work done in 2009, but it was still nowhere near completed. With the ground being frozen solid, nothing could be done outdoors at this time, so indoor jobs became the main focus. Baking and preserving were two things I loved about 2009! The gift of the bread maker from a very good friend was a godsend. I haven't bought a loaf of commercially produced bread since September 2009! Living where we do, with such a vast hedgerow, means that everything preserved one year will keep us going in jams, jellies, relishes and wine throughout the next plus, of course, I hadn't had to buy any eggs since the hens started laying in Spring of 2009! Surplus either get sold, traded via LETS or made into something that can be frozen for future use. Eggs fast become part of the staple diet in a frugal household, hence the need for my compiling the Frugaldom '100 things to do with eggs' list.But it was time to renew the list of goals and ambitions for 2010. Here goes...1) Grow more fruit, veg and herbs2) Improve on the poultry keeping set-up to make it self-funding3) Home make gifts - plan ahead!4) Do not buy any bread, cakes, biscuits, jellies, jams or relishes5) Improve the kitchen for better use of available space6) Make better use of recycling, trading and exchange schemes7) Live on £4,000 or less (excluding rent and council tax)8) Maintain a debt free status whilst working from home9) Fill my ISA10) Continue to reduce, reuse and recycleRubber chicken is a great favourite in our household. After a roast chicken dinner with the breast meat, there's enough left over for a curry from one leg, a stir fry from the other and then at least one pie from what's remaining. What's left of the bird can then be turned into stock for a big batch of soup... it just keeps stretching to more meals. I hasten to add that we do NOT kill or eat any of our own chickens. I may be frugal to a fault but the buck stops at killing anything for the pot. Frugal chicken stock gets simmered in a 5 litre slow cooker overnight, during cheap rate electricity. It's then bulked out with whatever vegetables are available and a quantity of rice. It makes for a huge amount of soup but it's cheap, it's nourishing and it's great in winter for a hot snack or at lunchtime. Of course, all that surplus had to be fitted into the now bulging freezer. No matter how hard we try, there's just no emptying a freezer once you're into the way of using up leftovers to turn them into another meal, even if it's just a single serving for someone taking to work. I was considering my 'master plan' to better utilise the kitchen space to provide more storage and introduce some extra heat to the place. It was freezing in there! But 12 degrees was starting to feel warm after being out in -6C Porridge became the staple morning diet of all Frugaldom inhabitants. The bitter cold kitchen was making me think of log burners and multi-fuel stoves. Once again, I began to wonder of the landlords would permit us to install one.The lemon curd did get made (4 jars), followed by coconut macaroons and some frugal meringues to use up the egg whites. I also made pizzas and a big batch of bolognese sauce, which had to be fitted into the freezer. I'd had my New Year visit from daughter and family and then a friend had popped in with some odds and ends that she'd de-cluttered from home. I rescued a copy of 'Life of Pi' from her. Between us, we still managed to fill a couple of boxes of stuff for the charity shops. By the 5th of January, the snow was back. Nothing too serious, we thought, but enough to trigger the 'top up the electricity meter and be prepared' type of mild panic. Son was due back at work, so he topped the meter key up while he was out, just in case the weather situation got any worse. How he managed to get his little car out the lane that week I will never know! It was getting so cold that I was worried about the water supply pipe freezing. The coal fire was lit continually, eating through the supply of logs. Sun, sleat, snow, ice, sub-zero temperatures... the road out of Frugaldom got worse. The snow fell on top of the ice that we'd had for the past several weeks and, eventually, all deliveries into Frugaldom ground to a halt – no animal feeds, coal, logs, even the postman wouldn't attempt to reach us. I went as far as send off an order for overnight delivery from one of those discount food supply outlets, but we'd to collect the box from the road end, just over a mile from the house. We took many photographs that week. How the digital camera survived it's speedy decent flailing from a frozen wrist is beyond me. All I know is that someone going arse over elbow then plunging head first down an icy slope like a human tobogan is rather amusing, especially as it wasn't me!I was extremely glad that the electricity meter was topped up, cupboards and freezer full and plenty of grain in stock for the feathered friends. The landlord was out with a snowplough to clear the deepest snow from the road outside the houses, but it ended up making it worse than ever. Main roads were fine by then, just these little lanes and farm tracks that couldn't be cleared. The paths and driveway were soon like glass, so smooth and frozen that the salt was blowing off before it had a chance to melt. It was so cold, I'd to plug in oil-filled radiators to supplement the open fire and storage heaters. Electricity budget took a battering, using over £50 for one week, while temperatures remained below zero. It was a case of prioritising our needs and, in order to remain sane, we NEEDED heat. Logs were running out fast but still no commercial vehicles of any description were getting along our road. Salt was sold out everywhere, so it taught me a very valuable lesson - be much more prepared, keep a bucket filled with household salt for emergencies. Temperature rose to -2C, power stayed on and the phone line meant we maintained access to the Internet. We discussed Berkshire pigs in the Frugaldom forum and I learned that the Berkshire is, \"a first-class light–weight porker, suiting the modern smallholder, killing out at 55-65 kgs live weight\". Apparently, “it's the ideal freezer pig for the discerning customer.\" I also learned that the housemartin nest in the eaves of the gable end had become a winter retreat for upwards of 20 wrens, which we managed to video at dusk! I photographed my first Reed Bunting that week, too, whilst out walking along the lane. Temperatures dropped again, to around -8C. By the end of the first week in January, the council had to plough their way through and grit the lane in an attempt to get a hay wagon to the farm before supplies ran out completely. Our hen and duck eggs were freezing to the straw in the nest boxes! I stupidly tried hanging out washing in the winter sunshine, but it froze solid. I re-read my '100 things to do with eggs' page and awaited a slight thaw. That same week, the cows began calving in the field! I'll bet their babies hadn't expecting to dive headfirst from 38C to -8C or less! That was my week one of  Frugaldom in 2010. The future next-door neighbours made it through the snow for their New Year's visit, the cattle and sheep at the farm got their hay, the wrens continued to pack into their tiny, temporary home and the weasel began making regular visits to the Frugaldom garden! Of my £4,000 budget, I had managed to spend £90 on topping up the electricity meter and £17.93 on bargain bulk food supplies like savoury cous cous, that could easily be made using the kettle of boiling water that is always on standby in case of power cuts."},

We have 40 days and 40  nights remaining until the end of 2010 and, in that time, I am going to  challenge myself to tweet (post on Twitter) the entire year's Frugal Living  Challenge. Can't promise that I'll succeed, but try I must. And then I'll can  start from day one in 2011.   The 2011 Cyberdosh Challenge will be the most, umm... challenging, so far.  We will start the year with a £4,000 budget (after payment of all  rent/mortgage/council tax/water) and attempt to end the year with a credit  balance of no less than the maximum amount we would have earned had the money  been kept in a high interest account. (Anyone can join in with the challenge by  setting their own budget.)   Current Bank of England base rate is still at its historic low of 0.5% but  there are accounts out there offering 2.5% Basing our figures on the latter  figure, we're looking at having a minimum bank balance of £100 at midnight  on 31st December 2011.   Despite inflation running at around 3.5% we have succeeded  in maintaining an annual household budget of £4,000 for the  past 4 years. This means that spending habits are continually adapting  in order to beat inflation and, as each year passes, more cash is available to  clear any debts, invest or save. We are beating inflation whichever way you look  at it.   So, 40 days to Tweet 365 days of frugalising a budget, pursuing the good  life and saving for those rainy days. It'll be a bit of a whirlwind,  but I'm branding it my first TwitLit ebook.

I like this social  networking thing, it's so frugal when it's all free! So, checked out that  my account was still active, after retrieving several lost passwords, then set  about investigating. Joy of joys! The techno-wizardry that is digital social  networking has, indeed, brought MySpace into the mainframe. Talking turkey?  Well, in simple Scottish terms, I write myself an email update, fire it off into  the electronic ether and it posts onto this blog. I can edit it or  upload photos any time thereafter. The clever bit comes when I hit the Twitter  button at the bottom of the blog, (or any other website where you see  something that can be 'tweeted') as this then posts an update to Twitter, which  in turn posts the update to all friends and contacts on Facebook AND MySpace.  How nifty is that?    This is my first attempt at the above, so I'll refrain from celebrating too  much until I've checked to see if this has been a success.

{"title": "Dramatic skies and a mixed bag of weather", "date": "Monday 15 November 2010", "text": "It was -5C this morning again, but this time it was prolonged enough to frost up the backs of all the sheep. Temperatures must have dropped through the night, so the resulting frost was thick and heavy and the water in the basins had to be cracked. Looks like the hens will be back on their warm water with cider vinegar and a spoonful of honey.Dramatic skies warned of all sorts of weather and that's what we got. Heavy frost followed by a brief sunny spell, followed by a shower of rain then a flurry of snow. The hens didn't really mind too much, they were catching the flakes as they fell, like it was some sort of new game they had discovered.The veggies in the raised beds out the front are all looking a little bit sorry for themselves - droopy and still frosted at almost 11.30am. Not sure how they survive the weather we get here but they always seem to bounce back, somehow.Mr Mole hasn't retreated for the winter, that's for sure. He's making the very most of digging before the ground freezes completely. Trouble is, the lawn has dropped about 15cm and the ducks are now tracking the mole runs whilst the hens scratch and scatter the offending molehills. Arg! Not sure what to do about this; the solar powered sonic mole deterent proved to be completely worthless. In fact, it's been a total joke, as there have been several molehills appeared within a meter of the offending object. Don't like to get rid of it, though, as it was a gift from family who will ask where it's gone. I wonder if the reply, '\"Into the field\", would suffice?I have 3 large rolls of marzipan and am hoping to use at least one of them to cut into sweet-sized pieces then coat them with chocolate. I'd fully intended tackling this job today, as I could melt the cooking chocolate over some simmering water on 'George' while he's lit. But then I thought of something else... I could make them in three different varieties if I held off and bought some store's own, basic brand chocolate in white, milk and dark. At 30p per bar, it isn't too expensive to melt it all down and turn it into Christmas presents and New Year gifts. After all, they are as gifts and frugal shouldn't really mean 'cheapskate'. My biggest problem will be trying not to eat the chocolate or the resulting marzipan sweets.The sun is now trying to shine through the clouds so I'd best go and get the post ready to go while the car is defrosting. eBid and eBay goodies going out - every penny counts in this game.Join in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Rain, rain, more rain, then ice... then sunshine... then SNOW!", "date": "Sunday 14 November 2010", "text": "After a night of torrential rain battering down on the (storm damaged) roof, the temperature must have plummeted. Dawn looked promising, but there wasn't the usual pretty white frosting across everything. This morning, instead, we had sheets of ice! Beautiful shades of pink, violet and blue in the sky with the promise of some sunshine. But the low slung white tinted fluff balls on the horizon behind me serve as a reminder of the threat of snow. Winter, afterall, seems to have arrived. It's only -1C outside, so nowhere near as cold as the -5C that we've already been subjected to on a couple of occasions but it was cold enough to freeze the rain lying on top of the poultry houses and cars. By the looks of the sky, it should clear up and we'll get some sunshine.'George' was lit as soon as I'd finished the morning's outdoor activities. Puss cat had a mad dash around the garden before the hens and ducks became too much of a temptation for her, so she's now confined to barracks for misbehaving. I daren't let her off with it, funny as it may be to watch, or she ends up sitting on the garage roof pulling faces at me as she swishes her tail in sheer defiance.The sun is just beginning to break through now. It takes its time clearing the hill behind the house at this time of year but when it does, the kitchen gets a glorious burst of winter rays that bounce off the orange walls and make for a very cosy place to be on a chilly day.Dawn breaking over Frugaldom.The promise of some sunshine but are those snow clouds on the horizon?Alas, the snow had already begun falling! The snow clouds seem to be all around us, but the sky directly above is clear... for now. (Edited in: We did have another brief flurry around mid-day.) This is as close to us as the snow has come this winter... PRETTY CLOSE! That's the car last night, showing off its dusting of snow. But the picture on the right isn't the Galloway Hills, which have been snow clad, periodically, for weeks, now. That's just the top of the ridge of the next field.

{"title": "A chilly, yet sunny November day", "date": "Saturday 13 November 2010", "text": "Woke at dawn, as usual, with the cockerels crowing and the ducks head-butting their doors in their normal, impatient 'let me out NOW' way. Went out to release the flocks and was pleasantly surprised by a crisp morning that promised some sunshine. After the torrential rain and blustery winds we've had recently, this had to be a bonus.By 7.30am I was in the front garden just in time to greet the arriving neighbours. After 18 months of preparations and plans, they have now arrived to begin their new life in the country. Going to be strange trying to get used to fulltime neighbours next door again.Washing done, it went out onto the line to soak up some rays and be blown by the fresh breeze. Meanwhile, I got started tidying up the bedraggled looking fruit trees, clipping and pruning to the best of my ability. Hope I've done it right!Next up was taking care of all those pesky gaps in the fence where the bantams get through to the field when they should be in the garden. I had plenty of willow whips cut from a neighbouring woodland, so these have now been cut to sensible lengths and sunk into the fround along the edge of the dodgey fence. At best, some will take root and help prop up the fence, at worst, the sticks will prevent the hens from wandering too far. The longer lengths of willow have been sunk well into the ground either side of the gate in the hope that they'll root and grow me a living arch that the honeysuckle will meander through in future years. That reminds me, I must check the Russina Vine that had started growing up the pergola that's over the greenhouse patio. Don't want it taking too firm a grip, as it's going to be used to train over the quail run to give it a more natural look. Need to make sure it's safe to use near cattle and sheep first. If not, it will be staying exactly where it is and hoping it plays nicely with the grape vine.The hens and ducks enjoyed a big bunch of kale and spinach beet, as there isn't much grass left for them by this time of year. They start the winter mornings off with a warm mash and then help themselves to corn in the afternoons. The quail are all looking quite perky, with the cockerels crowing and showing a great deal of interest in their hens. When I went in to top up their feeders, I was rewarded with half a dozen eggs from them. It's not many, I know, but for this time of year and allowing for the birds living outside, this was a welcome gift.The carrots are coming along nicely in their raised bed, so I thinned a few more out and fed these to Floppity bunny. Checking the cauliflower, I discovered that the one I thought would be next for dinner has frost damage. Likewise, the last of the outdoor cucumbers have succumbed to the sub-zero temperatures that have been hitting us periodically since mid-September. Don't think I'll grow as many cukes next year, probably 2 plants would be enough, planted a couple of weeks apart. Likewise with the courgettes.One of the raised beds in the furthest corner is needing manure dug into it so it's fed and ready for spring planting. I reckon it will be more fruit bushes going in there. The one next to that is next year's strawberry bed and then I'll have the third one for potatoes - I think! It's so difficult trying to decide what's best grown where and making sure I don't plant the same things in the same places for consecutive years. This year, the raised beds/square foot gardens at the front had potatoes in one side (now it has carrots and cabbages) and assorted calabrese and leeks in the other, with peas along the back. These will need to be dug over and fed before spring planting begins - hope my two asparagus plants survive the winter in there.Next task is to prune the grape vine and cape gooseberries to take them through the winter biut this job will need to wait gor another day. Dusk beats us again. So much to do, so little time to do it when days are so short and weather so unpredictable. Before we know it, we'll be back to planning the seed planting and incubating eggs for next year's egg layers.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "The increasing popularity of hen keeping", "date": "Thursday 11 November 2010", "text": "Hen Tales from Frugaldom ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Light Sussex with newly painted head﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿  I've just spoken to someone who lost quite a few birds to theft over the past year - three separate incidents. She is now using the spray-method as a deterent - see example photos. People are still flocking to buy ex-battery hens to keep as garden pets. These can be purchased from around 50p per bird when the battery farms are changing their stock. However, many of these newcomers to hen keeping are unaware of the fact that their 'rescued' birds can be moulting, then wrongly jump to the conclusion that ill-treatment has caused the bedraggled appearance and lack of daily eggs. In general, hens don't lay eggs during their moult. Egg laying also decreases each year. (What becomes of these rescued birds when the owners discover that setting up a hen-house and keeping the birds fed for the months they don't lay is something that possibly needs addressing.) Pure bred birds, such as Araucanas, can fetch over £150 for a trio (two hens and one unrelated cockerel) at auction, with hybrid hens selling at £15 to £35 each at point of lay (around 20 weeks old). Online sales of hatching eggs for some animals are permitted in the UK provided the seller offers domestic-only shipping within the UK and provided that the seller guarantees in the listing that these will be packaged safely and posted via next day delivery. In response to this, UK based auction website http://www.ebid.net has introduced a designated category for 'Poultry, Hatching and Incubation' items. ﻿﻿ Frugal way to deter thieves﻿﻿ An increased interest in hen keeping has succeeded in pushing up prices and with that, unfortunately, comes the criminal element. Poultry theft is becoming more and more common to the point that thieves are becoming selective - taking only hens and leaving any cockerels and chicks. Many of these thefts go unreported because owners don't want to waste valuable police time, but when you start speaking to breeders there are few who will openly invite strangers onto their premises. Several have resorted to spraying their hens with dye, marking their legs in an attempt to deter theft and aid identity if the birds happen to turn up at a public auction. Even when buying hatching eggs, some sellers are opting to post or deliver, some meet buyers in a public place. This again poses problems, as it allows less than scrupulous sellers to infiltrate online sales - buyers have no way of knowing the true origins of the eggs they are buying. The decline of local livestock markets has contributed greatly to the huge price fluctuations. Poultry sales are few and far between. Off the top of my head I can think of Carlisle, Lanark and Thainstone in Aberdeenshire, but none of these markets hold weekly sales. Poultry sales now tend to be combined with rare breed sales, again attracting premium prices. Another example of how popular poultry keeping has become is that Wigtown Agricultural Show introduced new poultry classes om 2010. The poultry marquee proved to be such a huge success that many were comparing it in terms of the Royal Highland Show, rather than a local county show. (Wigtown, which is Scotland's national book town, has a population of under 1000.) Some responses from various friends and colleagues: \"Start up costs were higher than I expected, feed costs are cheaper... my £6.50 bag feed lasts 4 - 5 weeks and we are averaging 14 eggs a week, so probably just breaking even compared with shop bought eggs. Chicken watching is, on the other hand, priceless!\" \"My hens pay their own keep from sales of surplus eggs and chicks. Breakfast here isnt just free range, it's free.\" \"My son has 6 in his back garden and his 'second string' is making flat packed hen houses for a local breeder.\" \"Hen keeping is on the increase in all sorts of places. My neighbour asked me this very afternoon if I was getting some... His dad is getting a couple, he lives round the corner from me in suburbia.\" \"It is becoming more important to me to know where my food is coming from, this is a very big reason why I am taking my allotment on. Food straight from the garden or an egg from your own hen is much tastier...\" \"I could sit and watch my hens all day. They don't just cluck and lay eggs, they provide me with hours of entertainment and that's very therapeutic.\" \"I breed hens for eggs and meat, it's not very cost effective because they keep getting stolen!\" \"I thought 'freerange' meant hens ranging free. When I discovered what it really meant, I was convinced that my garden hens must lay much happier eggs.\" \"Why keep garden hens? Lifestyle, practicing the good life, hoping to have a bigger concern in the future.\" \"I like the idea of fresh eggs - hens make very nice 'productive' pets to have - good to teach children about food and where it comes from and from a cost point of view - 'real' eggs are much nicer and are expensive - so having hens at home makes it more economical... Not very easy here - we had to get the hens imported from the mainland and had to wait for them.\" Some great answers to some basic questions about keeping garden hens. Many thanks to those who responded so quickly."},

Again, see 'Local Hero' for an idea of what life is really like here. But I'm convinced we are subjected to what's commonly known as 'buzzing'. By this, I mean that the farm appears to be used as some sort of target during tactical training exercises, so we often get fast flying fighter jets whizzing overhead, occasionally so low that the heat from the after burners can be felt as they rattle everything around us, send poultry into a feathery flap and scatter sheep and cows in all directions. Today seems to have been one such an exercise - or else the pilots just think it's fun to give me palpitations!Hearing louder noise than normal, I raced to the front window to see this coming at me! I was convinced the helicopter was landing, as it nose dipped and swung round in circles metres above the startled cows! Hens and ducks all ran for cover when the oversized, noisy birds passed right overhead - 2 of them - followed by a few jets whizzing over at a more sensible altitude. If only I'd had the camera at the ready when one of the helicopters was practically on the ground! Excitement, or what? Never a dull moment with the military around, that's for sure. Neighbour was out watching, too, so we just HAD to down tools and stop for a cuppa. In the meantime, amidst all the noise and excitement, I was trying to have a serious telephone conversaion with a journalist researching back yard hen keeping! Please disregard any comments doubting the sanity of the proprietor of Frugaldom in the unfortunate event that it makes it into print. It's not really that crazy about here on 'normal' days... I don't think?Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/It was daybreak just after 7am this morning and I woke to a white, frosted wonderland of frozen earth and water buckets that defied any attempts to thaw them. At least the mud can't be a problem in this weather, unless you trip over the ruts or stub your toe. I love when it's this cold and everything looks clean, gleaming in its hard frosted coating. The thermometer was reading -6C but there was a promise of sunshine. Temperature had risen to almost -5C by 7.30am.By 9.45am, the flock was fed, hair washed & dried, stove lit, coal and logs in for the day and neighbour waiting in the kitchen for our monthly trip to the local LETS meeting in town. By then, the sun was streaming down, melting yesterday's flood water and softening the mud. Town was quite busy for a Wednesday and the meeting produced half a dozen budding traders. My duck eggs traded out the way and I came home with some little lavender bags to add in as extra Christmas gifts for family.Back home again and the postman has been, delivering me a silicone muffin tray and two beautiful, handmade pot holders - a gift from a frugal friend over in East Lothian. (Thank you, these are very much appreciated.)Soup now warming on 'George' for lunch with homemade bread - staple lunchtime diet for the forseeable future -and then it's back to the keyboard for some serious web work. Except the sun is beckoning me outdoors to do some garden tidying. Perhaps I'll set aside the web work and go out to play. Then again, I have a new muffin tray and would quite like to try making toffee muffins...Whatever I decide, I know there will be far less housework done than there should be, but should I mind about this? In Frugaldom, it's a case of take us as you find us. The stove is always lit and the kettle is always on, so a hot cuppa is something that's always available.Now we have a mystery on our hands. H has just been out collecting eggs and has discovered almost a dozen quail eggs hiding in the back of a wooden broody hen box! Not such a mystery, you might think, but it is when you consider that the box is in the garden and the quail are all in a run. Now beginning to wonder if we have an escapee quail hen living loose in the field adjoining the garden and coming back to lay. Curiouser and curiouser, as Alice would say.Most of the hens and ducks are now sunbathing beneath the hedge in the front garden. Soak up those rays, girlies, we'll be needing more eggs for lemon curd making this weekend.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "The Storm Still Rages...", "date": "Monday 8 November 2010", "text": "The rain, hail and high winds are persisting and, after the overnight deluge, the fields around the house are flooding and draining into the garden. It's 7.30am and still too dark and too wet to even contemplate donning the waterproofs to go and let the hens or ducks out to wander about the place. I've already lit the stove to take the chilly dampness off the air.There's now just enough light to make out a band of water lying across the back field, surrounding a row of miserable looking sheep, some of them actually standing knee deep in the flooding. Not quite sure what that's all about, as they could easily move a few steps onto the grass. I'll put it down to sheep's stupidity. Afterall, a creature that can roll onto it's back then get stuck and die cannot be the brightest. Some of the lucky ones, mind you, manage to roll down the hill, legs flailing, like giant wooly snowballs. It's very funny to watch, even funnier when there really is snow on the ground, as one can only imagine the consequences of it sticking to them as they make their less than gracefull decent, tumbling down the slope.Anything outdoors is off the menu for today, I just hope we don't need more logs bringing inside, as I doubt very much if these will have escaped the continuing torrential rain.Meter reading morning - we'll see what difference adding the storage heaters to the weekly electricity costs has made. All three of them are set on low, so the number of occasions that they actually came on over the past week was minimal. All things considered, we're definitely spending far less feeding the meter than last year and recycling 50p pallets as firewood isn't too much of a drain on resources, especially when it means being able to cook on 'George', our hungry little pot belly pig/stove.Edited in - By 8am (now) I've been out, let everything out to wander about and got drenched. The winds are gusting with enough force to blow the ducks around the corner but they're persisting in trying to swim and bathe in the puddles on what's left of our lawn. Haven't seen it as wet as this for some time and there's no signs of it stopping. With the A75 having been closed on two separate occasions over the past fortnight owing to flooding, it's not looking too good for this week again. Add to this the snow that was lying on the Galloway Hills from yesterday and the combination makes for a stark warning for what could be a really bad winter. I just hope that we're sufficiently prepared.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},

Temperature on the windowsill thermometer was reading -2C and everything was white with the touch of  frost. It's lovely out when it's like this but just not cold enough for long enough to freeze﻿ the mudpit that was previously the garden. I'd just finished feeding the feathered friends when the sky changed to this deep crimson and purple, as the clouds rolled in to bring yet another burst of rain over Frugaldom. Don't you just love the Scottish weather?There's a loaf baking in the breadmaker and George is blazing away, warming the house. Scruffy is stretched out in front of the stove looking more like a misplaced draught excluder than a cat and Floppity is content to dig imaginery holes in the bottom of her cage in an attempt to bury her food dish beneath her bedding - daft rabbit! The others are asleep, giving the illusion of tranquility. In actual fact, the finches twitter incessantly, the ducks quack so loudly that it echos down the chimney and the cockerels never stop trying to out-crow one another. There's an echoing 'moo' resounding down the chimney now and dear Scruffy has woken up and decided that it's fun to climb up the bird cage! Never mistake life in the country for a relaxing, peaceful lifestyle - there's always a tractor just round the next bend and, on week days, don't forget we have an assortment of fast flying jets buzzing overhead with as little as 100ft between then and us! ﻿If anyone ever asks what life in rural Scotland is really like, I recommend watching 'Local Hero'. Never contemplate a move from the town or city to here without first having familiarised yourself with this film! It makes it all the more interesting when you've actually been to Pennen, the village on the northeast coast of Scotland where much of the filming took place. I took H a run out there a few years ago after he first watched the movie and he was thrilled to discover that it really does look like that, the hotel really is there and he was able to phone home from that very telephone box. All that was missing was the backdrop of Aurora Borealis. I think I've talked myself into watching the DVD again. Let's face it, there's practically no chance of seeing the TV - we've no signal during adverse weather conditions! And please, nobody else suggest that I try watching programmes online because it just isn't going to happen. Yes, I have heard of broadband but, unfortunately, the best connection that the BT network can provide is HALF a megabyte that disconnects every time a car drives past or someone phones. :)"},
{"title": "Back to how frugal can frugal living be? And a new 8% interest rate!", "date": "Friday 5 November 2010", "text": "The past week has been pretty miserable, weatherwise, so nothing has been done in the garden other than picking an assortment of brassica leaves, kale and the odd remaining raspberry leaves that get fed to the Frugaldom livestock. Floppity loves the carrot thinnings, she munches her way through them half a dozen at a time then has a raspberry leaf with some mint for dessert.We currently have 7 'ducks': Joey, Monica and Phoebe, Spot and Tiny and then there's Pingu and Pongo, who both turned out to be boys! But 4 duck eggs per day will be enough for our household, even allowing for the baking, so that should leave all the hen eggs for selling and trading.With there being only 8 weeks left of 2010, I've been attempting, over the year, to completely neutralise all my extra spends and managed not too badly, so far. But this week's feeding order has slightly tipped the scales. I have a few pounds cashback on its way to me, but it looks like it will fall short. I think I need some egg sales rather than trades. So, lemon curd for trading, surplus eggs to be sold for cash. I wonder if I could make lemon curd on 'George'?The blue cuckoo silkies have started to lay and we've had 10 eggs from the four pullets over the past 3 days. This is perfect timing for the November LETS meeting, which is on Wednesday in Newton Stewart. However, H's car is going into the garage on the Tuesday, so fingers crossed that it's just a simple, quick and easy problem to fix. (Engine seems to be missing like there's dirt in the carb or fuel pipe or something.)Rubber chicken is stretching a little further as it now feeds the cat after we've had our main roast dinner and the usual assortment of curries, stir fries, pies and soup. With only having one small freezer and a son who stockpiles cooked chicken (he buys it himself, as it's part of his body-building 'diet') I now find that I can buy only one chicken at a time and can't replace it until everything made from it has been used up. That normally includes several cartons of broth, but this is great during the colder months. Apart from that, I can easily trade out the soup if there's no space in the freezer. But what to do about Christmas dinner is a completely different matter - no storage space for a turkey! Mulling that problem over now.My kitchen table is covered in bags of pasta, lentils, split yellow and split green peas. I had tried not to buy any more pasta of any description, thinking I'd be able to make all my own, but that was before son set off on his epic bodybuilding journey, one that involves eating all the eggs if he gets to them first! It was a fight for the solitary blue egg that got laid one day last week! Kids! They certainly don't get any easier once they grow up and, with current housing prices the way they are, there's not much hope of mine affording a place of his own any time soon. (The cunning plan is to help him on his way within the next year or two, savings permitting, but he's drifting away from any semblance of routine saving.)George has been fired up to take the chill off the place, heat some water and then cook the dinner. I think I'd prefer it to be -7C, dry and frosty outside rather than 7C, wet and muddy! Whilst the ducks may love it, the hens hate it! Anyway, soup of the day isn't chicken, it's tinned tomato! Difficult as it is to comprehend, it costs far less to buy a tin than make something similar, especially when Sainsbury's own Basics brand, costing just 17p, feeds 2 of us and tastes delicious when served with a wedge of fresh, homemade bread. Then I get the paper label for adding to the kindling and a tin for recycling, which has to help keep several people in jobs somewhere.It never ceases to amaze me how little we really need to spend in the supermarkets nowadays. They didn't have all these bargains when I was first married and trying to run a household with the mortgage rates at 15%, the Poll Tax costing three times what the rates had previously been and no such thing as child tax credit! If it did exist in the late eighties, I hadn't heard about it. Really, today's generation of new parents just don't know how easy they have things! (You can tell I'm a grandparent, but please note that I'm a very young one! :) )Yesterday's log delivery was all stacked as best it could be, although the bulk of it had to go into the disused garage to protect it from the monsoon weather we're having at the moment. At least when George is lit I can hang the washing on the kitchen pulley to dry it that way. anything beats switching on anything electrical that isn't really needed.Now, my final dilemma of the week. Where to grow my savings so there's enough for a seriously rainy day. I'd normally drop any surplus into my ISA account but, with things the way they are - BoE base rate kept at 0.5% and reports of Ireland needing bailed out soon - it begs the question of how safe our money really is when it's supposedly kept, \"as safe as the Bank of England.\" :?  Without taking a gamble, what does the common, everyday frugaleur do with their spare cash? First Direct have a 'great' new 8% offer, but it would mean switching accounts and then locking away the savings. Is it really worth the hassle if I could need cash in a hurry? Check it out and let me know what you think. Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/This soapbox screed is a result of having been reading about parents who need to bribe their children to look at books. I can understand why many children of today choose not to read, afterall, why should they? Everything they need can be found on screen. So, why not teach them to read on screen? It's words they need, not pictures. (Or should that be text and not graphics?) I need a frugal programmer to put together a few ideas but, in the meantime, I'll muddle my way through a second version of something did over 10 years ago. It will be outdated, but that won't matter - updates will soon come along - it will be frugal and simple, it might eveb interest some kids.Have you got what it takes to make a difference? Frugal entrepreneurs, or 'frugaleurs', as I prefer to call them, aren't out to make millions, they're out to make a meaningful difference. If the £millions arrive then it's just an added bonus.Who says we need a huge cash investment to set up, establish and/or run a successful business? Even if it's classed as a lifestyle business, we each have the freedom to choose our own lifestyle, be it grand or frugal. I like the good life! I enjoy homegrown veg, freshly made lemon curd, seasonal game, homemade champagne and quail eggs, even if that makes my lifestyle seem more like the high life than the good life. In actual fact, it's a frugal life. But we can't just look at our own selfish lives, we need to look at the bigger picture. Without knowledge, there can be little progress, yet knowledge is based on education and learning. How can parents teach their kids anything when they're too busy out earning 'a living'? Stepping back and taking a panoramic view shows what I can only describe as a 'magic eye' picture. In one glimpse, the picture is about money and power but a bit of a tilt reveals the children of the future are the mainstay of this wacky global society that we call life on earth. 21st Century Britain - known the world over as having been Great, yet we still have problems with unemployment, illiteracy, poor health and debt. What a great example to set anyone. Does it make you a success if you can earn, read, write, count and be free from debt? It's certainly an achievement of some description.Whilst living well within our means, we can accumulate a healthy nest egg, one that enables us to hatch all sorts of plans for the future. The business of earning our own income is no different - we have freedom of choice to pursue our chosen dreams, even if we have to generate our wealth and happiness from a virtual stand still. With a bit of careful planning, a constant stream of number cunching and a clear understanding of the differences between needs and wants, anyone can run their own, self-sustaining business and help support those around them. It's the single-mindedness to pursue personal riches that makes one stand out from another: money + knowledge + people = power.Are you going for corporate glory or are you happy with personal achievement? What if money was removed from the equation? Does it really tip the balance because you are without it? Is it a simple case that those with it would conspire against you? Find out for yourselves.Simple living. Think about it... the hierarchy still exists.

{"title": "What Happens in Frugaldom When the Internet is Down?", "date": "Wednesday 3 November 2010", "text": "Once again, we had an interuption to the Broadband service here, but I've just been informed that the head office of a local company was also affected - in Manchester! Makes me wonder what, on earth or elsewhere, is going on with things.So, no Internet = no working online, so what does a frugaleur do then? That's right, stock up on winter food supplies by lighting the logburner and hiding out in the kitchen for a couple of hours. Roasting a chicken is so much more fun when you just stick it in a roasting tin with some herbs and let it cook slowly atop the stove. Once that lid's in place, there's nothing escaping that succulent bird!Then there was the clootie dumpling that got boiled for 4 hours atop the stove on Monday. This stores really well in the fridge, or it can be sliced and frozen. Come to think of it, you could probably freeze the entire dumpling, but there's never a whole one left for the freezer in this household. Keeping the log burner fired up enough to cook anything over a prolonged period is hard work! George, afterall, is just a tiny multifuel stove, but he could probably consume a full recycled pallet in a day. At 50p per pallet, it's worth it for a warm house! Dumpling was served with custard in the Frugaldom household today.Then I needed to bake some choc chip cookies, as the biscuit tin was empty. Managed to bake two trays of them using my favourite recipe. These are everyone's favourite biscuits here, so it's probably just as well the choc chips were on special offer when I stocked up with them. I've used supermarket's own basic brand of ordinary chocolate and it does work, but not quite as well as the proper cooking choc chips.Still no Internet, cue the opening of a box of garlic dough balls mix - I got 5 boxes for 99p with a recent Approved Food order to try them - and the mixing and making began again. I was amazed at how simple these were to make! Just a case of adding a bit of olive oil and some water and doing exactly as it says on the pack. I split and rolled the dough into 12 balls and baked them in a sponge tray, so no chance of them spreading out and going all ways if things went wrong. That was almost the last of my cookathon for today, as the Internet came back on just as the rolls were baking. Two minutes was all it took to melt some butter and mix in the garlic & herbs. Once poured over the top, these were ready for eating. They're sitting on a plate by the stove keeping warm and will be eaten soon, along with the roast chicken. Last, but not least, give us our daily bread. I'd already stuck the mix into the breadmaker for today's loaf. I've started making a small crusty loaf every other day, rather than a large loaf that tends to get hacked into door stop wedges and scoffed far too quickly! Once again, the bread mix was a bargain at £1.49 for 3.5KG, so a small loaf works out at just 14.9p If I allow for delivery, a scoop of wheatgerm and the electricity required to bake the loaf, I estimate less than 25p. A far cry from £1+ for similar from the supermarket!Now You Know what happens in Frugaldom when the Internet goes down. I hate to think what everyone else gets up to when the winter months are upon us. Best be prepared for a rural baby boom next year if BT continues having all these problems, especially when the digital TV signal is every bit as bad, if not, WORSE! Trust me, if your kids are of an age, encourage them to watch DVDs and keep to a rigorous exercise regime.

{"title": "Frugal Investments for the Future", "date": "Wednesday 3 November 2010", "text": "We've been discussing the inevitable question of, 'what if...?' and come to  a rather surprising conclusion. Being a frugaleur means minimising overheads and  general expenditure whilst establishing a clear distinction between needs  and wants, enabling us to do as much as possible with as little as possible. The  list of necessities for modern day living has to include hard cash because  society can neither function nor progress without it. So, what if you were  rich?   What is 'rich'? I don't mean you live in a large, mortgage or rent  free house with a luxury car, a few acres of land, no outstanding debts and  upwards of  £100k pa salary, I mean really rich, to the  extent that your interest payments on savings alone amount to hundreds of  thousands of pounds every year. Being a frugaleur means I don't actually know  anybody who is this rich, but the question still remains, what if...?   On a bog standard, 1.5% interest rate, you could easily expect £1,000 per  month per million after tax. On your current income and lifestyle combination,  how many millions would you need in order to live off the current interest?  Let's say we won £50 million on the lottery - that's tax free - and decide  to live off the interest. What would you do with your £50,000 every  month, bearing in mind that, as long as you don't touch your capital, that 50k  is going to be heading your way every month for the rest of your days  and then to those who inherit? (Not sure on the inheritance tax aspect of this  scenario, I'll assume that there would need to be about 40% of the capital  paid out in tax before it was passed on to the family, so they might only get  £30,000 per month.)   I'm stumped! And therein lies the problem of becoming a frugal millionaire  - personal spending just isn't our 'thing'. Personally, I reckon I'd  need to turn to securing a sustainable and environmentally friendly future for  those around me - save the forests, help clean up the mess and invest in  others' futures by way of clean energy, safe drinking water and healthy food. In  the best interests of all, helping others to help themselves to a healthy  lifestyle seems like a good idea. But now I'm asking myself the  question - how many really rich people care enough to provide what's  needed without it bringing them more money every month? Mr Bannatyne, I take my  hat off to you because you've ploughed on relentlessly to provide  leisure & fitness opportunities for all who can afford it and care  facilities for the elderly. All you need now is the facility to provide  prospective parents with the ability to invest in their procreational activities  and you have the big three covered - birth, life, death - or perhaps that's  a gap in the market that needs filling by some budding entrepreneurs who  convince you of their ability to follow through on their ambitions in the  Dragons' Den?    What would I do? I guess I'd start by investing in someone else. What  would you do?   Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.com"},
{"title": "'Frugal' doesn't make it free, but it does make it much more affordable...", "date": "Sunday 31 October 2010", "text": "Frugaldom Challenge on eBid Online AuctionsI remember joining eBid online auctions around 1998/1999, over a decade ago! Then came the forums, which I rejoined under the new name of NYK Media, in 2000. At that point, I hadn't even considered where it could lead, why I joined or what I would do with such an account, but it seemed like a good idea. As you'll have already guessed, the primary reason for 'getting involved' was that it was FREE, not even as much as a listing fee. eBay had sprung up around the same time, but eBid offered the opportunity to set up shop free of charge with a UK based outfit. As a result, Racing Book Shop continues to run successfully and is fully integrated with the online auctions.Back then, we'd had a bit of a clear out and there were few charity shops near us. OK, to be honest, there were NO charity shops anywhere within easy reach and I still, to this day, hate binning anything that could have a remote possibility for reuse at any point in the distant future. The phrases, 'waste not, want not' and 'make do and mend,' spring to mind and, having always been used to functioning on a very tight budget, albeit for an assortment of rather eccentric reasons, my mind was always of the opinion that this little, UK based site would germinate into something great. It's been about 12 years since eBid first appeared on our screens and, despite all odds, IT HAS SURVIVED. There have been many changes along the way, many site overhauls, refurbished forums, an ever-expanding global network of members and an ever-increasing number of categories, stores and items listed. The 'wanted' section disappeared along the way a few years back, but so many other free additions came along that the service was barely missed. However, it still lacks something - the ability to make people rich. Where eBay took the bull by the horns, grabbed every possible investment opportunity and exploded into a worldwide market place governed by shareholders, eBid still remains on a tight rein, harnessed by the powers that be - Gary and Mark and a handful of small investors. Most 'frugaleurs' bought into both camps, I know I did - becoming a seller on both sites and a shareholder in eBay. We've had some good times - I made a fair bit of money from my eBay shares, getting out at the right time, in my opinion, and holding the profit for future investments. That ultimate, golden opportunity of investment hasn't, yet, presented itself, but I'm patient when it comes to that sort of thing. And, at the end of the day, my aim is not to become rich, it's to become contented - any extra cash generated will simply be a bonus. :)Making ends meet with enough left over to pop it into the bank or into a pension or shares portfolio is a great idea, but the stock market hasn't got the same appeal as it once had. So what now? What do people want? How will freelancers and the home-based self-employed, such as us, earn our crust in the future? I guess diversification has to be the obvious answer. Everyone has an income of some description but it's what we do (or don't do) with it that's the crux of any financial problem. But how badly do people want something and how rigorous is their search to find the very best deal? In my experience, laziness or boredom creeps into the equation and folks settle for what they perceive to be a 'good buy' rather than continue their search for the ultimate bargain. So here is your chance to securing yourself an ULTIMATE BARGAIN.Just announced in this month's eBid newsletter, there will now be buddy point auctions starting every Monday. These auctions involve NO CASH. You bid with points that can be earned for free via eBid. In the past, we have 'bought' many such items, the best bargains being the Nintendo DS, digital camera and, more recently, an ebook reader. But to keep on buying, means to keep on  earning points, so that's where you all come in - my points score is currently standing at 50.683 For every new person who signs up for a FREE membership, I can increase this by 1 point and for every extra point I earn, I can attempt to 'buy' one of the exciting eBid buddy point auctions. Where does that benefit anyone else, I hear you all ask? Well, for every item, be it a laptop, a camera or a printer, that I 'win', I will list it as an eBid auction item with a starting price of just 99p + postage  & packaging. As an eBid member, you'll have the chance to buy the item at a knock down cash price. So, here goes.... JOIN ME HERE and I'll begin bidding for the Fujifilm FinePix S1500 10MP digital camera and then the Canon PIXMA MX870 Wireless Office All-in-One Printer   from today, 31st October 2010.  You can watch the current auctions HERE and HERE I'll update this blog post with my maximum number of points as they increase so you can see my top bid.Current points total = 50.683First bid = 38Current bid = 50I can't go any further on this one without your help, so please CLICK HERE to help with the buddy points balance, thank you. Of course, with the promise of new Buddy Point auctions every Monday, who knows what we might win (or not) in November. :)I don't work for eBid, eBid works for me.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Frugalising the cost of that basic essential - home insurance!", "date": "Monday 25 October 2010", "text": "Frugaldom recently received its reminder letter that the house insurance is due for renewal in a month. The renewal quote wasn't all that good, so I guess they don't expect too much by way of loyalty. Time to ditch the Co-op, despite their basic contents quote amounting to only £45 and their added Co-op dividends points. As a frugaleur I CAN do better than that. Cue a rummage through the cashback sites. As usual, www.topcashback.co.uk has proven to be the supreme leader for me.TCB offers to pay you 50p just to do an insurance quote comparison via 'comparethemarket', so that's what I did. It threw up about a dozen choices, the first few all around the £45 mark, so I took a note of those named and closed the search. It's sometimes better to clear the cookies from your machine at this point, to avoid any confusion with the tracking. I forgot to do so but luck seems to have been on my side - phew! A further search of all financial services & insurance companies linked to TCB showed 'Budget Insurance' was offering £35 cashback for a new policy, so I sat patiently and fed all the same details back into their site. Again, luck was on my side! It threw up the worldly sum of £44.63 and, seeing as I had already 'compared the market', I could, theoretically, deduct the 50p cashback that had already been earned. Looking good for a contents insurance quote - £44.13 - so I took my chances and paid the policy up front using my debit card. It saved wasting precious money on extra credit card or monthly installments charges!That was last night. This morning, I checked all the details online then called the company to have the automatic renewal clause removed - it appears in the small print, so be careful about these irritating conditions; they cost nothing to remove if you spot them soon enough. Coincidentally, I HAD ticked the box on the application for 'no automatic renewal' but it seems to have failed to register. Anyway, their customer services department was quick and easy to access and I was able to understand the accent on the other end of the phone - a blessing in itself, as I hate feeling like some sort of racist having to ask a foreigner to repeat everything. As it turns out, my budget insurance deal is with none other than Lloyds TSB, so I was quite pleased about that, too.Now, I have just checked my Topcashback account and can confirm that the £35 cashback from 'Budget' and the 50p cashback from 'Comparethemarket' has tracked and both are now pending payment. I won't be able to claim this for a few months but it is still there waiting for me, ensuring that the contents of Frugaldom, sparse as they may be, are fully covered for yet another year when the current policy runs out next month. And all for the princely sum of £9.13 and a little bit of researching time. It by no way comes close to the 2008/9 policy, but I've accepted that those days have now gone. That year, my policy cost £47.50 but the cashback amounted to £70.70, so the company actually PAID ME £23.20 to insure my contents. That's been my best financial services bargain yet!I cannot rate Topcashback highly enough. No frugaleur should be without free membership. To date, it has neeted me an amazing £504.73 in cyberdosh and nobody can afford to sneeze at that! Especially when that cyberdosh can be transferred as REAL CASH directly to your bank account. :)Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/Beautiful start to the day with clear skies and the promise of some sunshine, but it's still reading MINUS 6C on the thermometer, the hosepipe is frozen solid and the water buckets all have a thick layer of ice over them. Still, they weren't frozen solid, which is the main thing. I guess that means the temperature is just dropping for a few hours in the morning.    Being in a frost pocket means we do tend to have more frost, we do tend to be a couple of degrees cooler than the surrounding areas and we do take longet to thaw out after a freeze, but that's just the way it is. With thick layers of shavings in all the nest boxes, the birds seem to be fairing well, all things considered. Even the quail, a naturaly mogratory bird, appear to be thriving in their new shelter and outdoor run.This morning, I was blessed with a single duck egg and one solitary blue egg from the only lavender Araucana that's currently laying. Let's hope it's just the start of some winter supplies and not a mere blip.The square foot garden is frozen solid, its crispy white greenery looking ready to snap rather than burst into life producing winter veg. I'm glad we ate the first of the cauliflowers and the carrots are growing, but it's difficult to imagine anything growing at this tme of year. The moles, however, are still very active, as can easily be told by the increasing number of soil hills scattered about the garden! Take my word for it, these solar powered sonic mole & rodent repellents DO NOT WORK. They are complete and utter waste of money.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Forestry sell off! What's the betting it's all gone before we get the chance?", "date": "Sunday 24 October 2010", "text": "RT @TelegraphNews - Ministers plan huge sell-off of Britain's forests   http://bit.ly/cRMthQ    Conveniently, we'll see this done in massive swathes, sold off in packages  than no 'normal' individual like you or I will ever be able to afford  off our own backs. Owning land has been a lifetime ambition of mine but, as each  year passes, the increase in prices far outstrip the increase in savings.   I remember one of the first lots of land we viewed, when they were  breaking up the old National Coal Board. There were thosands of acres being sold  at around £40 per acre. For the rough grazing land, there were grants for  tree planting (still are) and all manner of land diversification. But the lots  were vast - pockets of land measuring hundreds of acres each. Not manageable  pieces suitable for smallholding. (50 acres or under.)   There was also the selling off of all the actual smallholdings, when we  would have dearly LOVED to have purchased on directly from the Ministry of  Agriculture. Lovely little stone cottages with adjoining fields of just a few  acres, some changing hands for less than £15,000 - at a time when we could raise  mo more than £10,000.   Then there was a huge shift in the Scottish islands, at which point you  could buy a well-maintained 3-bedroom cottage with 35 - 50 acres  for around £50,000. I think, by then, we were able to raise about  £40,000   Now here I am again, in the exact same position, only 30 years  further along the road. I'm living on the edge of Britain's largest  forest, (Galloway Forest, just in case you didn't know), KNOWING there are  swathes of land about to be sold, but not being silly enough to get overly  excited by it all!    As we all should know, forestry and woodland carries no inheritance  tax liability and, as we all should also know, there are literally billions of  pounds of rich folks' money circulating throughout a myriad of tax  avoidance schemes - they MIGHT be able to kill two birds with one stone,  here!   Sadly, my long-term predictions, about which I wrote many years ago, shall  possibly be realised. Scotland will slowly lose its oil & gas drilling  rights, its coal mining, steel making and ship building industries, food  manufacturing will dwindle, agriculture and forestry works will slowly vanish  and we'll lose our financial and electronics industries. When London  expands to the extent that it has taken up over one third of England, there'll  be them and us - the north will be the playing fields of the wealthy south and  we'll be marketed like one massive holiday resort.    Take my word for it, do your homework, count your savings and GET YOURSELF  SOME LAND before it runs out! If it means lumping your savings in with  others, get yourselves sorted out into some sort of Limited Company or  registered organisation, but don't miss what could be the final opportunity to  stake your claim on your native country.   Our futures are based on global economies for fuel, food, medicine,  even water, depending on where you currently live. Communications networks rule  the airwaves and are the lifeblood of almost every industry. This  self-same Government that is bringing about the break up and sell off  of our forests has already pledged to bring broadband to the rural areas... is  the penny dropping, yet?    Buying into this multi-national ownership of all that is necessary in order  to sustain life is great (if you can afford it), but it won't feed and clothe  you if /when it all goes wrong and you aren't part of the right  machine.    One more soapbox ready for chopping for firewood. I'm flad they're made  from recycled pallets costng only 50p each - it means I can heat my house for  £3.50 per week.     Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.co.uk"},
{"title": "The value of money.", "date": "Saturday 23 October 2010", "text": "Having attempted to listen to the dreaded 'spending review' , given  up, downloaded it in its entirety and then got bored reading it, I am still  not in any way surprised by the state of the nation's financial affairs.  Spending £1.20 in every pound 'earned' is still a bit of an eye-opener, though,  showing the allegedly 'true' extent of the country's financial crisis. But  what is 'truth' worth these days?   I guess boredom is why so many things come as such a surprise to  so many - our brains switch off unless the topic interests us! With the  prospect of demonstrating unions, a major global war being fought (and lost, in  my humble opinion) online and the Olympic Games looming, I took a quick look at  the salaries for a couple of those Olympic jobs. The Bureau of  Investigative Journalists ( http://thebureauinvestigates.com/ )  is a great source of info! Here are two names that stood out pretty clearly -  earning over HALF A MILLION POUNDS between them! I haven't dared look to see  what the bid process cost the nation. Apparently, this is why we pay our  taxes.   Howard Shiplee £344,000 Director of Construction,  Olympic Delivery  Authority. Jeremy Beeton £227,500 Director General, Government Olympic Executive,  Department for Culture, Media & Sport.   I haven't been following any news on costs incurred by hosting the Olympic  Games but I did wonder how the recent Government spending cuts would affect  things. What interested me more was the lack of public debate or discussion on  the Defence budget other than to bleat a bit about the scrapping of the Ark  Royal and the building of the two new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and  HMS Prince of Wales. But I haven't heard much mention of HMS Astute, which  has run aground off the coast of Skye before even making it into full  service. £3.5 BILLION pounds of nuclear submarine, stuck not far from the  Skye Bridge near a lighthouse. At least the crew can amuse  themselves monitoring all the mobile calls being made from the island  to the national press, no doubt beaming images of said vessel with them!  (Gives a whole new meaning to 'sub-editor'!) Built for stealth, this  sub may have been, but it's hardly a great example of the Government's  austerity measures when one of your best stealth assets is sticking out the  water like a sore thumb! Apparently, this is why we pay our taxes.   Getting it right is never going to be easy. To be honest, I reckon it's the  trying that counts more. Everyone must know, to some degree, that nobody will  ever get everything right. It's money, more than anything, that drives society.  How much does it cost for loyalty and honesty? How much more to keep it when  under threat of losing it? If someone came along and offered you £10,000,000 to  divulge certain information, how tempted would you be?    In today's society of instant, high speed (for many) Internet access and  all the social networking sites, how much FREE information can be gathered? It  isn't too difficult to spot the gullible, ill-educated or just plain ignorant  among us, so, for many, money is beginning to lose its  shine. Knowledge is power and, according to popular belief, \"The  more you know, the less you show\", isn't that what they say? My frugal take on  that tends to be 'the less I spend, the more I can  afford' , but money in the bank doesn't provide you with the  security it once did. Low interest rates, the economy in ruins and our best  defence strategy being folks sat online monitoring virtual communications  is hardly something to write home about, is it?    So what comes next? A bidding war for leaked information versus  disinformation? Seems to me that the Paranoid Times could be dragged off the  shelf, dusted down and relaunched. We could have one side of the coin  published there and the other published in 'Now You Know' and make the next  Frugaleur project the Alpha and Omega of the modern media circus. And  do you know what? Barring a huge investment in time, the entire project could  cost NOTHING. How frugal an enterprise could that be?   Join us in the fun, frugal forum atwww.frugaldom.co.uk"},
{"title": "The Doon of May - a fantastic project in the making.", "date": "Thursday 21 October 2010", "text": "Just recently, we've been spending some time at the Doon of May. It consists of 175 acres of mixed forest and woodlands surrounded by a traditional, dry stone dyke. One side is bordered by Mochrum Loch, but it's what's within the Doon of May that fascinates me: there's an iron age hill fort!﻿Last weekend, whilst the sun was shining and the day was warm, we headed across there and followed the track to the old fort. Telltale signs still remain from this year's beltane event, which included dancing around a traditional maypole. The hill fort is completely overgrown but the autumn weather is quickly resulting in the bracken to dying back. Wellies on (you never know what snakes may be hiding amongst the undergrowth of Galloway), cameras in hand, we set off to climb the fort and see what views it had to offer from the top. It was well worth it!  ﻿Doon of May is located between Kirkcowan and Port William. Travelling from Newton Stewart direction means a fairly lengthy 15 mile drive, much of it along single track through Mochrum Estate. You can tell by the cattle grids what to expect, as sheep and cattle graze the surrounding countryside, wandering wherever they like. This includes the road, so please drive slowly and carefully and don't risk getting out of the car with your camera if you're between a cow and her calf. ﻿Likewise, don't wander around with your dogs, as the livestock see them as predators if they get too close. All that aside, it's a lovely drive. I can only imagine how great it would be on horseback if we were guaranteed there were no tactical low flying exercises incorporating fast military jets and helicopters.  The old hill fort is about 20 minutes walk from the main gates. With luck, there will be someone about to point you in the right direction. If not, be careful not to get lost. for the benefit of those who may not get the chance to visit this place, the view from the top is quite spectacular. You can easily pick out the Mull of Galloway with its lighthouse and, on a clear day, you can see across to Ireland. I'm told that being up there after dark gives you the orange glow of the streetlamps that light up Belfast.﻿The Doon of May is privately owned but set up to operate as a base for workers' co-operatives interested in reforestation, food production, wildlife preservation and an exciting array of woodland crafts. I plan on learning a great deal more about Iron Age settlements and the lifestyles back then but also have a keen interest in cultivating willow for sculpting, basket-weaving and, ultimately, as a carbon neutral fuel. Add to this the fact that we enjoy growing fruit, I can see great potential for becoming much more involved in this project in the longterm. Forest art is something else that interests us, and there's already some of that to be found within the forest. These are just a few of the photos I took last weekend. More will follow if the weather holds for this weekend, when we'll take a look at how we can get some sort of working co-operative together and get path clearing, planting, cultivating, hedging, ditching, dyking and crafting. We need to seek the best possible way to help take the project forward. I'm confident that a few fellow members of GallowayLETS will be interested, especially as it's more about skills sharing and investment of time rather than hard cash. Cree trading to get jobs done sounds alright to me. The best methods of funding future projects can be dealt with at a later date.Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/﻿Got soaked by the rain this morning when going to feed the hens & ducks. If only I had a goose that laid golden eggs to make it all worthwhile! Instead, what do I have? I have a motley crew of moulting specimens of Gallus Domesticus, in a variety of shapes and sizes, all scratching their way around my garden, none, bar one, laying me any eggs. Even the quail seem to have stopped laying. Yesterday's final egg count amounted to a duck egg, a hen egg and a single quail egg - dinner for 3, nonetheless.  -5C followed by wind and rain with ever fewer daylight hours is not a combination condusive to good freerange egg production. I wonder if my feathered friends ever stop to ponder the origins of their meals or if they just eat whenever they please with no regard for their futures? I suspect the latter. One thing for sure is this - there won't be any lemon curd making being done this week, although I'm tempted to make a few metres of pasta to dry and have in store. Despite soaring grain prices, local flour prices are down! Odd, or what?Onwards and upwards - no point in allowing the current economic climate to grind us down. Another quick review of personal and/or business finances is always a handy exercise. I'm glad to say that for every pound of income, expenditure here doesn't exceed 70p, so there's still a bit of room to manoeuvre if things get really tight. (Unlike the Government that's inherited a nationwide 'business model' that seems to be costing them £1.20 of every £1 'earned'. MEGA-OUCH! )What do people want? It's that age old question with no definitive answer. We all know that we need water, food, clothing, shelter, but a huge part of society needs more - they need to define their own lives by adorning them with extras, be they physical, factual or fantasy. These wants are a normal part of human nature - an innate need to succeed, so we work to earn to afford. The 'ability versus inability' to earn our own monetary income is a conflict that splits our society, in my opinion. For this reason, I think those who can should help those who can't in whatever way possible. We can adopt pets, farm animals, children from poverty-stricken nations, trees, vineyards... the list is endless, but I have never seen the opportunity to 'adopt a drop-out'. Perhaps this is the way forward... turning more and more of the normal, everyday people like you and me into the equivalent of secret millionaires. It's not millions of pounds that we need to help support our families, friends, neighbours, communities or, even, our countries, our skills and available man-hours are every bit as valuable! I realise that costs have to be met somewhere, but a penny saved is a penny earned. It's time to decide on the next project...Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "As the day unfolds, it's number-crunching all the way!", "date": "Wednesday 20 October 2010", "text": "I do have the much talked about 'Spending Review' on TV, but keep getting lost in the squabbles and grumbling. From what I understand, with my very limited knowledge of national economics, there's a huge debt hanging over our once-deemed 'great nation' and no simple way of paying that off without taking a long and hard look at the national budget. Without getting into politics, I think it's pretty obvious that spending at the previous rates cannot be sustained unless the generated income can keep up with it. If it was a household budget, we'd be pulling our hair out by now. Housing, feeding and clothing the entire family (including pets & livestock) in a safe and healthy environment are our main concerns, ensuring that each of our human charges learns to carry out these basic skills in a law-abiding manner in order to perpetuate the process. If we can help support others around us, all the better. What, exactly, is so difficult about that? Bad household budgeting is not so far removed from the political mess that now seems to be bogging down the entire country. The Government's duty should be to oversee the smooth, safe, secure and solvent running of our combined national needs, they SHOULD lead by example! They haven't!So, what can we all do to help alleviate this massive financial burden that has engulfed us? For a start, we can keep our own households in order so that there's less reliance on the State. It's the only way the Government can provide us with a safe and healthy environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper. (Please note that my reference to less reliance on the State also encompasses the ludicrous sums of money claimed, rightly or wrongly, by those at the top.) Running up billions of pounds of debt whilst also bailing out institutions whose very nature should dictate that they know how to handle money has just gone too far. We, the non civil servants, are the private sector. We are being told that we are capable of creating our own jobs, so that is the best we can do. That's why I think the head of the household is the person who balances the books. If you can afford a house cleaner, window cleaner, gardener, nanny or any other help, you are helping to create and maintain jobs. If you can provide goods, skills or services of any desciption to others, you are helping to create and maintain jobs. If you can live within your means, regardless of how little or how much you have, you are helping to create and maintain jobs. There may be unemployment but there is no lack of opportunity - we just need to get creative about how we define the word, 'job'. If you want the good life, make that your job. Self sufficiency, nowadays, means providing for yourself (and others) in all necessities, including the money we spend. Self sufficiency is a job.And on this note, I shall step off my recycled soap box and chop it up to use it for firewood. At worst, it will provide a temporary source of warmth and a means by which to cook a meal here in Frugaldom.PS - If anyone would like to donate their old wooden soapboxes, please feel free to do so. As a member of GallowayLETS, I shall happily traded you some Crees, bater or exchange for some homemade soup.  :)Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/Good morning from a very frosty and icy Frugaldom! As you can see from the photograph, we have rather chilly temperatures again with a layer of ice over water buckets and hosepipes frozen. We have managed to get down to -5C, although the angle of the thermometer makes it look like -6C. I took this photo  around 8am, so I'm not too sure how cold it got between then and last night. I know it got a bit cold!I'm so glad the poultry 'feeding station' was given priority treatment yesterday, as it meant only a few feet to move buckets for fresh water this morning. The quail seem to be fairing OK in their new open plan run, despite the cold snap, but I'll add a thick layer of straw to the shavings on their indoor platform so they have an extra layer of insulation before the weather really takes a turn for the worst. I'll just need to hope that they have the sense to go inside for shelter!Indoors feels quite warm this morning - even more so now that George has been lit - so there were no indications of what awaited me outdoors, barring the condensation on the bedroom and livingroom windows. Once again, I cannot recommend a multifuel stove, like George, our pot bellied 'pig', highly enough. Without him, I reckon we'd already have needed all the storage heaters on to prevent freezing.I guess today will be the day that we'll hear exactly what austerity measures our new Government will make. For us, I think most have already been taken, incorporated into Frugaldom living over the past few years. Good luck to all! From the media hype, it seems we're all going to need it. Losing RAF bases won't help matters north of here but WE WILL ALL SURVIVE! This, I have great faith in declaring as truth. There's no firing squad involved, just a push for communities to become more supportive of one another and take responsibility for their own households in as far as is humanly possible. It's just a pity that the communities that usually end up being hit worst are ones that do still have a bit of that solidarity spirit. I doubt very much if 'The City' will notice much difference. But then again, I doubt very much if a disjointed town or city, where one neighbour doesn't know another, would have the same initial reaction in coming together to swap their skills and pool their resources. Not that I'm a cynic of any description. :)Join us in the fun, frugal forum athttp://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Evening Round-up and an E-Mail Experiment", "date": "Tuesday 19 October 2010", "text": "Temperature has dropped again, skies are clear, moon will soon be full.  'George' was relit this evening to give the place another blast of heat, just in  case the frost arrives - it's looking highly likely!   At long last, Frugaldom has the 'feeding station' almost completed for  the feathered friends. All their food & water dishes have been moved inside  a 3m square run, which has been covered in a layer of woodchips for extra  drainage. There's no gate, so the birds are free to come and go as they please,  but better still, it's adjacent to the house, meaning  no more trekking around the garden and sliding in mud at the crack of  dawn on cold, wet mornings. I'm planning on planting a fast  growing willow hedge around this run to help provide some extra  shelter for the daft birds; they never seem to have the sense to go back inside  their houses to keep warm & dry when the weather gets bad, so I may as well  grow them a frugal shelter. The first lot of withies has  already been cut and stripped, waiting to be planted.   Hopefully this post will appear correctly on the blog. It's the first time  I've tried using the email2blog facility, but I'm finding all these new 'techie  bits' most interesting. Let's just hope that everything goes to plan and the  Frugaldom scribbles don't end up elsewhere uninvited.   Don't forget that you can visit us at http://www.frugaldom.com where we have  forums for discussing all aspects of frugal living, household  budgetting, microholding and frugal business. Feel free to follow  the blog, if nothing else, and leave your comments so I know if I'm getting  things right (or wrong, as the case may be).For almost two years, we have lived here wondering about the peculiar weather patterns we seem to get. We were made aware of the fact that the farm sits in a frost pocket - this part is obvious, when we're scraping ice from windscreens and nearby Newton Stewart is basking in sunshine. Most days, we are battered by swirling winds that are actually rather fun to watch, especially if the neighbours have their washig hanging out at the same time. The vortex is at its best during line drying washing. Mine will be horizontal in one direction and next door's will he horizontal in an entirely different direction. Likewise the curling smoke from newly kindled fires. But winter brings a different, eerie phenomenon. This morning saw the first occurance of this.Above my head was slate grey, a few spots of rain reminded me not to expect any more Indian summer weather and, yet, looking around the horizon, we had a panoramic view of scarlet streaked skies. I'm not sure about you, but we were always taught that, \"a red sky in the morning is a shepherd's warning,\" so I grabbed the camera before the heavens opened, checking the thermometer on the way back indoors again. It was a heady 4C, so not a precursor to snow, at least. Not yet, anyway. I've posted the photos to show what spectacular skies we get around here but bare in mind - IT WAS RAINING ON MY HEAD as I took these photos around 7.45am this morning. I haven't quite sussed out how to edit the photos into the appropriate places, but you'll get the picture. To all intents and purposes, scanning the horizon around Frugaldom gives the illusion of a fine, Autumnal day with the promise of some sunshine. There was even a band of blue between the panoramic pink and the heavy grey above my head. Just another of the anomalies that inhabit this part of the country. Our tiny 'patch' has a 3C temperature difference between here and the road end. There was NO DUCK EGG this morning! The extent of my search produced nothing more than a solitary blue Araucana egg and one single quail egg. Still, it's better than no eggs at all.Now, approximately one hour after coming back inside from feeding hens, ducks & quail and taking the above photographs, we have a beautiful blue sky with sunshine escaping past the band of fluffy white clouds. I wouldn't be surprised if the temperature soared to 20C by this afternoon, but would be equally non-surprised if it plummetted to -1C and cloaked the entire hillside in snow. The joys of living in Scotland, don't you just love it?"},
{"title": "Meet 'George', the pot belly stove.", "date": "Monday 18 October 2010", "text": "LOG BURNERS OR MULTIFUEL STOVESFalling behind with the blog, so the New Year's resolutions for 2011 will be to keep up to date! Hopefully, I can incorporate the blog into the website and forums whilst integrating Facebook and Twitter. I don't understand all this modern technology and haven't quite got the gist of social networking, but I get the point of maintaining the diary and keeping up communications with the 'real' world.In August, we eventually got around to investing in a woodburner. It meant making a bit of a dent in the 'rainy day' savings, as it meant purchasing the appropropriate flue liner and flue pipes, plus fireboar and fitting costs but by doing much of the work ourselves, with the help of a knowledgeable friend, we were able to have the job completed by September, including building a second log store by recycling some old pallets.﻿﻿ (The logburner is a Country  cost £99 inc delivery and it was bought via eBay.)With a 'cold snap' warning from weather forecasters, we'll be making the most of the new log burner in an effort to reduce electricity consumption. Living in a fairly rural location means living without the luxuries of mains gas, dependable power supplies, public transport or, even, shops within walking distance. That's why stockpiling those bargains is an essential when it comes to ensuring there's enough food in store for us and any livestock. Temperatures here, despite us being in the southwest of Scotland, have already plummeted below zero twice during late September, with many more frosty mornings over the past fortnight. In between times, we had soaring temperatures reaching near tropical conditions, so we shouldn't be surprised at these climate extremes, especially being located in a frost pocket. It does make growing fruit and veg a bit more of a challenge but 2010 produced quite healthy and varied crops from the Frugaldom garden. I think the funniest thing to happen recently was the arrival of the Scottish Power meter reader. I suspect that they suspected foul play, as our electricity use has dropped dramatically since installing the stove.Now, we're planning ahead for 2011. We're now exploring the possibilities for rural enterprise development within 175 acres of nearby forestry and woodland. It's a site of special scientific interest as well as home to an ancient historical 'monument' by way of an Iron Age hill fort. If nature's on our side, future plans include willow planting, edible hedging, orchard planting and reclaiming whatever we can from the edge of the forest for rearing some livestock, while helping preserve the local wildlife. It would be fantastic to see something along the lines of a replica round house being constructed near the foot of the hill fort.The Frugaldom fowl are slowly completing their moulting processes, although we aren't getting many eggs just yet. We've had the first of the blue eggs from the lavender Araucanas and one of the ducks has started to lay again. Meanwhile, a new quail run has been built that now houses 15 hens and 6 cockerels - next year's foundation breeding stock that will form the basis of the Frugaldom Freerange Quail Eggs project. The birds are as freerange as is possible for quail. As migratory birds, they need to be kept within secure enclosures, but they have constant access to the outside plus a relatively large indoor area.So much going on, so many challenges and so many jobs to be done before winter really sets in for the rest of the year. The cupboards are filled with whatever long-life food bargains we could source, the shelves are filled with homemade jams, jellies and other preserves, there's plenty of rhubarb and elderflower Champagne-style wine, the freezer is full of the summer garden produce and the winter veggies have all been planted. It may sound organised, but we're still racing against time to complete hen & duck housing repairs and to get all the woodchips laid before the back yard turns into a mud bath. LETS trading has been fantastic this year. Regardless of what I 'buy', it has no real impact on the finances as no cash changes hands. Frugal bartering is a 'must have' opportunity for anyone trying to live and build a lifestyle business on a very tight budget. Trade it, swap it, barter for it, give and receive freely - community spirit is alive and well in Galloway. My recent 'acquisitions' - some electric fencing, grass roller, firewood and the woodchips - will testify to that.Follow Frugaldom on Twitter for the latests news and announcements. You can also join us in the Moneysavingexpert.com forums, where we've set the challenge to live for a year on £4,000. I've no reason to doubt it can be done, as the same challenge has been completed for the past several years whilst building up a financial safety net, 'just in case'.Back soon with more updates about life in Frugaldom and any progress we make with the forestry project."},

{"title": "Frugaldom News", "date": "Saturday 6 March 2010", "text": "Most exciting news for this weekend, so far, is that the mini webcam arrived safely yesterday and has been installed on the laptop and mounted on the side of the chick brooding box. I still haven't fathomed out how to set up live streaming video so, for now, we just have photographs automatically uploading to the site every 2 minutes. The chick fliks can be seen on Frugalcam HERE. We're now at day 8 of the quail incubation, so I've just over a week to prepare for any eventual chick hatching. The homemade egg turner is continuing to function as required and the water level is being maintained by using my wacky funnel-flexi straw contraption, which has been brilliant, so far. Only once have I had to open the incubator during the past week and that was to rearrange the eggs so those around the edges could be switched with those in the centre, just in case there's a temperature difference. I'll be so annoyed if none of the eggs hatch after all this attention they've been receiving.The three chicks that hatched out on the 25th/26th February are all doing well (as per frugalcam) and will be moving into a larger brooding box this weekend. Outdoors, the hens and ducks are laying well, now giving us up to 10 eggs a day, including a blue egg from the first of the Araucanas to start laying. having split up the purebreeds from the free rangers, I now have eggs being set aside for hatching. The Pekins and Silkies all seem to be laying and I have no need to doubt fertility, having just hatched the test eggs. In the garden, the greenhouse has been swept clean and all the pots ready for planting up seeds. The ground is still pretty frozen in places, so there won't be anything getting planted in there just yet, but the fruit trees and bushes are all beginning to bud. The garlic is up about 5cm and I did have a lovely crop of parsley gettig through - until the ducks ate that. Mint is beginning to sprout and there may even be a little bit of life in some strawberry plants that I thought the hens had killed off completely. Under the big buckets, rhubarb has definitely started to grow and just last week, a friend arrived with a mushroom growing kit for me. :)There's not a great deal I can do at this time of year other than digging and mulching wherever there's a thawed patch. Keeping on top of the duck devastation and hen escapades is an on-going battle of wits and wire mesh. The 5 male quail have now been rehoused into outdoor quarters but are refusing to use the chicken coop at nights. I can't say I'm surprised, but I thought they may, at least, have tried going up the ramp into the house. Bailey the pheasant is staying out all day and night now, preferring to wander around the edge of the fence. Yesterday, we had three red-legged partridges sprinting across the field, so it's nice to see they've survived the cold spell. We may be lucky enough to see some babies this year. I'd love to go back to breeding my ornamental quail - Californian, Gambels, Mountain, Blue Scaled etc - but self-sufficientish living means feeding the household comes first, even if the ornamental birds could fetch a fair few pounds per pair when selling the surplus.That's about it for this week's frugal round up. My biggest spend was £5.80 for a new webcam and my most receent cooking achievement was last night's Scotch eggs made form our own hens' eggs, homemade breadcrumbs and homegrown parsley. Very tasty, indeed!Stop off for a visit at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "3 out of 3, 100% hatch success! :)", "date": "Friday 26 February 2010", "text": "See the whole hatch on the chickwatch page - 3 new additions for the Frugaldom garden this summer.I'm considering investing in a new webcam so all the Frugaldom friends and family can see these little chappies. H managed to get an old one raked out from the attic today and then discovered it wasn't compatible with my version of windows, so it became today's item for eBid. If it's any good to anyone, it's listed at £1 no reserve. Check out Kensington VideoCAM on eBid. Either that or you can just take a look at the list of bargains I currently have for sale - every penny counts in the quest for frugal living and a self sufficientish lifestyle. eBid earns me chicken feed. :)Today I made my first lot of soft cheese and it tastes lovely. As a first timer, I used a carton of unbranded natural yoghurt and left it straining all day through a jelly bag and sieve then mixed in a few dried herbs and some ctushed garlic. It's now in the fridge after being sampled by all and getting the thumbs up! I used a couple of tablespoonsful of the yoghurt to start off a litre of homemade yoghurt and have also kept another couple of tablespoonsful in a carton in the freezer for future use. Friend/neighbour will be here tomorrow morning to see how I did following her instructions for both. Now I need to go and decant the (hopefully) yoghurt from my flask and get it stirred and then into the fridge overnight.Keep on frugaling! http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},

It's also our first 2nd generation chick for Frugaldom. :)Eggs begin hatchingHere comes our first Silkie chickIt's up and about already, watching the camera through the viewing panel!Hopefully, this first one will hurry along the second one and encourage the third egg to hatch. I'd love it to hatch because I'm not 100% sure which of the hens laid it, we just assumed it was another Silkie. If it hatches, I won't know until I count it's toes, as Silkies have 5 toes whereas the others all have only 4.Chickwatch in full swing at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/ tonight - egg 3 just pipped! Yeah!Today has been an exciting one so far. First of all, after listing my first item in the decluttering stakes on eBid, I have already attracted a bidder, so that'll be another £1 for the 'EEK' (Everything Else Kitty) that normally gets swallowed up paying for chicken and duck feed.On a completely different subject, look at this!This is one of the 3 eggs I have in my mini-incubator. After selling one of the incubators, I decided to test a second one before listing it for sale on eBid, so have been incubating 3 eggs from my Pekin and Silkie hens. At 5pm tonight, the second egg pipped and both chicks are chirping to one another from inside their eggs! I have the camera at the ready and am updating my 'chickwatch' page on the website at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/ but I've only just discovered that I can also uplod the photographs here, too. Watch this space.My decluttering site, where I'm trying to earn a few pounds extra to keep the feathered friend happy, healthy and fed is at http://www.frugarments.co.uk/ so named because I'm going to be listing all the garments I no longer need along with anything else that's surplus to requirement. I've set myself a very realistic target of 3 items per day to be listed in my eBid stores, so don't miss the bargains. Here's what's listed so far.Back to chickwatch now, hoping to have 2 new babies by tomorrow morning. :) As soon as anything hatches, be assured there'll be photographs available online both here and on the Frugaldom site."},
{"title": "It's been snowing again!", "date": "Wednesday 24 February 2010", "text": "Last week was one of those weeks that the temperature just seemed to keep dropping. We'd have glorious clear blue skies streaked with red, pink and mauve at dawn and dusk then the black skies would glitter with stars with not a wisp of cloud to keep the chill out of Frugaldom. We were starting to feel warm when the temperature rose to -3C! But then the winds began, the snow clouds whirled around te edge of our weird vortex and then the snow came thick and fast. Thankfully, it's almost gone again but I'm still glad that we chose last Thursday to stock up on supplies.My mini orchard tree count will increase to 12 when the ground thaws enough to let me plant the latest acquisitions - 2 morello cherry trees and a Bramley apple tree, a frugalicious bargain buy at only £3.99 each from our nearest Aldi store! I bought 4 of these Aldi fruit trees a year ago in the same offer and they all look to be surviving so far, so let's hope we're here long enough to see the fruits of our labour (pardon the pun).On Saturday 6th February, I set 6 eggs into one of the small, homemade incubators to test fertility. 3 were from our purebred birds - Silkies and Pekins - and 3 from the free rangers who roam the garden along with the Silkie trio. Only the three purebreed eggs are fertile. Last night, I gave these three eggs their final turn before topping up the water dish to increase the humidity and closing up the incubator in anticipation of a hatch this weekend. This could be anytime from Friday if we're lucky enough to have any of them hatch!This year's plan is to increase residual income from home to raise enough to buy, amongst other things, a fully automated incubator for hatching quail eggs. Last year, I managed to hatch out only 6 quails, one of which died within 24 hours or so of hatching. The other 5 are all males! My theory of temperature affecting the sex of the chicks is still holding true, regardless of what science says! If there's a tiny dip in the overall incubation temperature, chances are I get more males than females. With a slightly raised temperature, the results are reveresed. With this lot, the eggs would have cooled quite a bit during power cuts. Anyhow, I need to focus on raising residual income for funding what I call the 'EEK'. (Everything Else Kitty). This has to pay for everything else that isn't a basic household expense, so comprises things like livestock care, garden stuff and anything extra into a longterm savings account with life assurance attached, so the kids don't get lumbered with funeral costs when the time comes. Sobering thoughts, but I'd rather die happy than die a debtor and cost my family a small fortune they may not have at the time. Let's face it, they ain't going to inherit a mansion when we rent a cottage in Frugaldom! :)Procrastination must stop! OK, I have uploaded my first experimental listing of this current challenge to eBid online auctions to make a proper start on turning everything surplus to requirement into cash to help fund the Frugaldom project. I've been with eBid for almost 10 years and have spates of listing. I do get a few sales along the way, but nothing serious. Now, however, the time has come to get serious. I have absolutely no intentions of returning to mainstream employment after being home based for so long, so eBid it is. (Plus all my other regular haunts for some extra savings, winnings etc.)  Northern Exposure was one of my favourite TV series of the 90's, so when I managed to get the entire box set on DVD, my lone copy of Series 1 became surplus to requirement. If I can get £1 for it, it's £1 less I need to find to help feed the chicks - I'm selling my surplus for chicken feed! :)There are now 6 tiny tomato seedlings growing from the pots on the kitchen windowsill plus 3 lots of the 5 assorted herbs doing well. In the greenhouse, I have mixed salad leaves beginning to sprout. This is a new lot after the ducks managed to get in at the tray planted end of last year. I managed to rescue one seedling from that, which is now growing in a pot on the windowsill alongside the tomatoes. There's one chilli pepper on a last year's pepper plant and that about sums up the extent of edible growing for now. 21 new fruit bushes have been planted outdoors and the 3 new fruit trees are soaking in a bucket of water in the greenhouse. The newly extended square foot garden hasn't thawed for several weeks, so nothing more has been done to that. The hens and ducks are managing to provide us with enough eggs for ourselves and for selling a few each week. I'm now hoping my 3 Pekin hens, Fonzie (lemon cuckoo), Bernice (blue) and Mrs Splashy (lavender splash) will all start laying. The cockerel, Mr Chirpy, is wheaten coloured, so I haven't a clue what colours to expect when these start breeding. I'll be selling all the surplus fertile eggs and hope to try selling these on eBid as well.Indoors, baking and batch cooking have been the mainstay of kitchen life. I made a start on attempting my first rag rug and I listed my first DVD of the year on eBid. Everything is being documented on site at http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/ and we now have several threads and discussion forums going to cover most of what I'm trying to accomplish here. I welcome all constructive comments and/or criticism and hope there are many more people out there following the frugal and debt free way of living. Now I am going to investigate the Amazon links at the side of this page to see what that's all about - if there's a few pence to be made there, I'll be on it. :)"},

{"title": "The price of cheese!", "date": "Tuesday 16 February 2010", "text": "We LOVE cheese! Sadly, as we whittle down our grocery budget more and more, cheese is something that becomes a very luxurious foodstuff. So we do manage to have some when needed, I arrange a LETS (Local Exchange Trading Scheme) trade with a friend who frequents places like Costco, where a 5kg block of mature cheddar costs about £20. It's so easy for us all to compare the prices on sites like MySupermarket, but the resulting savings are only beneficial to those of us who live within easy travelling distance of these big supermarkets. We don't. Our nearest town is only 5 miles away and it does now have Sainsburys, but the store doesn't stock many of the 'Basics' products, so we can't take advantage of such moneysavers.Anyhow, I see by the supermarket comparisons that the best price for mature cheddar is currently around £5 per kilo whilst on special offer, so I'm delighted with my current 20% saving. I just cut the cheese into smaller blocks of around 0.5 kilo and freeze them until needed. It does tend to make the cheese crumbly but as I grate mine for most things, this isn't a problem. Grating before freezing is an option when I have enough space in my freezer, but then it tends to get eaten faster, as lazy son hates slicing cheese. Most times, he'd prefer to do without rather than have to go to all the bother of cutting it for himself. He's a bit like that with bread, too! Mind you, at the rate we eat cheese, I could probably get through 5 blocks/£100 worth in any given year!Back on the porridge trail, I've updated a few articles relating to the porridge breakfasts. We eat porridge almost every day from late autumn right through until spring. In Scotland, that can mean  October to late May! It's safest to say 6 months of the year could be porridge weather, so budget for at least £73 to last those 6 months in breakfasts. We Scots aren't mean, we just enjoy very basic meals. :)http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "What a glorious day!", "date": "Saturday 13 February 2010", "text": "It was a clear and bright morning, the sun shone and warmed the greenhouse up to 20C, but there was a brisk breeze that smelt of snow! In the field, we saw the first lamb of the year! We did a bit of general garden maintenance, which basically comprises clearing up the devastation caused by our feathered friends on a daily basis, then I hung out a washing, set the breadmaker to bake the day's loaf and then we set off towards the forest.Despite the sunshine, the forest was still frosty around the edges, it lay like patches of snow, glistening white in the tiny spots where the sun penetrated the treetops. We stopped to photograph the scenery, the birds, the woodlands and the Galloway Hills on the horizon, where snow still lay.Within the deep, dark depths of the forest, we gathered a basketful of fallen cones, which I dry and use for kindling the fire. A baskeful lasts me about a fortnight, so each forest forage is productive. We ocassionaly bring the odd stick or branch home but aren't allowed to gather firewood from this particular forest. I stood for a bit watching a deer cross the scrubby land to the stream then stop to drink before returning to the safety of the forest. It is such a peaceful place, yet, in the distance, I could hear gun shots ringing out across the hills. I wonder what they were shooting? Pigeons? Deer? More likely ducks or geese at this time of year.Back home and the photos have been uploaded to computers, a few cropped down for the Frugaldom website and dinner was pheasant pie, again, this time served with cous cous & veg.Now tell me again that this frugal lifestyle is, \"sub-standard living and self-imposed poverty\" so I can remind all that this lifestyle is the one I'd choose anyday! I have no interest in the 9 to 5 when this glorious development known as the Internet and worldwide web can provide us with everything else that we need.http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},
{"title": "Further frugal conundrums", "date": "Friday 12 February 2010", "text": "I'd to end up making a second batch of pastry for pie making this afternoon because I had under-estimated the amount of pie filling that I'd end up making! By the time I had the meat, gravy and mixed veg all ready, there was enough for 4 pies, each with a pretty cut out pastry birds on top. We ate one for dinner with chips and it was only then that it dawned on me; I can't freeze the others because I had defrosted the cooked meat to make the pies in the first place! So, Friday night in Frugaldom was pheasant pie night. Funnily enough, Saturday night and Sunday mights may prove to be the same, although I'm hopeful of being able to find good homes for the surplus pies by way of fellow LETS buddies. What a time for the new neighbours to become vegetarians - I hope it was nothing to do with my piemaking?The fruit loaf making was almost a success - I managed to mix the big batch of ingredients in my winemaking bucket then crammed 4 large loaves into the oven. They took their time in my horrible grill combi 'hot box' but I can confirm that they taste OK. I found this out when transferring them between the tins and the wire racks - I almost dropped one of the loaves when the parchment paper tore! Making a frantic grab for the loaf before it plummeted floorwards gave me a great opportunity to end up with a handful! I reckon about 90% of it got saved and only 20% eaten. You can work out for yourselves how much is cooling on the rack.Next up were the 2 trays of coconut macaroons and I STILL have half a dozen egg whites left after making them! Popped the trays into the oven, the macaroons cooked quite evenly, turning a faint golden brown before being removed. I carefully lifted one to sample, as one does, only to discover that the dratted parchment paper had baked into the bottom of the cakes! Can you tell that I'm not used to using this stuff? Am I supposed to grease it up first? I thought that the whole point of using it was to stop stuff sticking! It never crossed my mind that the actual paper would stick! I guess we'll be shaving parchment from the bases of the macaroons as I sure as fate won't be ditching them - they taste fine once they've been picked clean of paper shreds and coconut is far too expensive a product to risk wasting.Onwards and upwards, or perhaps that should be bedwards! Enough cooking for one day, it's the weekend! Dawn awaits me with the cry of the cockerels and the incessant quacking that signifies breakfast time in Ducksville!http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/How bad are we? How unfrugal are we? Not only did we polish off the last of the homemade loaf at lunchtime with a tin of beans between 2 of us, we then proceeded to scoff a carton of yoghurt each. A couple of hours later, we still found space for a mid afternoon snack! It's ridiculous!I know someone who'll laugh when I say what that snack was but the last of the fruit loaf needed using up and pouring custard over it seemed like a bright idea. In my defence, it was frugal cheap custard of the 7p per packet variety, but it was still a non-essential portion of food consumed for no real reason other than to use up the last of some fruit cake.I'm now sitting here wondering to myself if I should go and bake some fruit loaves and make the most of the oven being on to make a couple of trays of coconut macaroons just so I can use up the egg whites that were saved from lemon curd making for Tuesday's LETS trading. That way, I'd be more inclined to mix up some pastry and get a pie in the oven for dinner. But then I may have enough meat (it's pheasant) to pad it out with gravy and mixed vegetables to make 2 pies! As you'll have guessed, this is not condusive to emptying the freezer, as whatever I decide to do now or later, it'll result in at least 3 fruit loaves and a game pie surplus to immediate requirement and needing stored in the freezer. No point costing it all out for the Frugaldom grocery budget because I swapped 3 jars of lemon curd for 4 pheasants, the hens laid the eggs for making the lemon curd and the ducks laid the eggs for the cake making, so it all gets a bit confusing and drives me quackers! LOL Welcome to my wacky world.http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"},

I did, however, fill up the log store as soon as the snow cleared enough for the logman to reach us. A single track farm road + snow & ice = no commercial deliveries.http://www.frugaldom.co.uk/"}
