{"title": "Happy New Year! Welcome 2024! Please don't disappoint us", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2024", "text": "I have been feeling out of words to write recently. Thinking about closing the blog sometimes but, I have been blogging for so long that, I cannot bring myself to do it.Anyway, here is what has been happening in my neck of the woods.My SIS and BIL were supposed to come to Istanbul for celebrating the New Year but, SIS got COVID and they could not come. My uncle is visiting so, we had a nice dinner and did our own thing the rest of the night.My bestie in the US is a bit overwhelmed these days with so much going on in her life, her husband, her daughter and other things, she asked me if I could go help her a bit. So, I am going to the US next week and will return late February. I am still planning to go in late Spring again because, my SIS wants to go too. We will see how it all plays out.SIS is ready to pull the trigger on her retirement but, she just doesn't know when to do it. She is determined to not be working at the bank by her birthday this year, which is in April. Not a long time to go.I have been concentrating on my health, fitness and weight loss for the last 4 months and for the first time in my life, I have been consistent. I found my inspiration in K-Pop believe it or not. Who knew?It is a long story so, I will leave that out but, I am doing rather well. Just had a recent check-up and found out that my insulin resistance is getting better and the doc told me, it may be possible to get off the med if I continue this path. Also, my cholesterol is at a normal level due to tons of exercise. Fatty liver is getting better too. I have been pleasantly surprised to see so many positive gains in my medical report. Now, I know I can do this. I am at a point in my life that I only want to be happy and content so, I will keep on doing things that keep me happy. No new year resolutions because, I have set goals before the year end and doing well so, all is good. Closed the books on last year and financially, I have done well. Budgeting carefully always helps and some unexpected expenses did not really hurt because I made some money through my part-time consulting although, I am not going to be taking more projects this year due to planned travel. I still need to tweak 2024 budget a bit though.With my travel date approaching fast, I looked through my clothes and purged some items which no longer fit well. This way, I also know what to get from the US. I need mostly tops and some exercise gear. When I come back, I am going to work with a Personal Trainer at a Gym close by. Cardio is easy on my own but, I want to strengthen my back and arms. As we get older, we need a stronger upper body. It is easy to hurt oneself without proper instruction.I hope 2024 brings much joy, contentment, health and happiness to you all. I am leaving you with a wonderful romantic song of my favorite band. It is a bit softer than their normal vibe but, they are experimenting with a lot of genres. There are English captions for Korean parts."},

Will probably post more after the New Year's.Wishing you a wonderful, happy, healthy and prosperous 2024 with all your loved ones...Here is a fun Christmas Song Video by another Korean Group: Stray Kids They write and produce all their songs and this one below pretty much sums up what they had to sacrifice to make a future for themselves. The youngest is 22 and the oldest is 26. They debuted in 2018. This much cuteness and talent should be illegal. Lol!They collaborated with a well known singer and song writer LiSA of Japan."},
{"title": "Just when thinking there is nothing happening...", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2023", "text": "On Sunday, I felt that my left arm was aching and there was also a tingling sensation. On top of that I was feeling as if something was squeezing my heart. For a while, I decided to ignore it but, then all sorts of weird thoughts started filling my mind.SIS is retiring come next year. This means we will be able to see each other more, travel and have tons of fun. If I die due to a heart attack, that would be such a bummer. I will not know what the heck happened to me but, SIS will be heartbroken and sad. Also, there are so much I want to do. New songs to listen to, new destinations to travel to and all sorts of fun things to do.Besides, I have been improving my health lately and I couldn't understand why I was feeling what I felt? Then I think, I started feeling a slight panic attack as well. I took a shower, packed a small backpack with a couple of underwear, nightgowns and my daily meds and drove to the ER. I was relieved when I checked in. After all, it is much safer to have a heart attack at a hospital right?I reached out to a High School friend who lives 15 minutes from where I live. Gave her my sister's phone numbers just in case and promised to update her. She wanted to come to the hospital right away but, I stopped her before I learned what was going on. Anyhow, they gave me an EKG, took my BP and drew some blood. The doctor told me not to worry because the EKG was fine and my BP was lower than usual. Then, the blood tests came and the doctor assured me there was no indication that I could be having a heart problem. My CRP was elevated and he thinks may be I was having a slight infection but there was no need to do anything just yet. He also encouraged me to keep exercising.I was relieved and came back home. I am still thinking of seeing a cardiologist soon. And I was thinking there was nothing new or interesting going on in my life. They say to be careful what we wish for. I think, we need to be careful about all our thoughts too."},
{"title": "Lost Mojo", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2023", "text": "Lately, I have lost my mojo to blog. Don't know why but, perhaps due to lack of interesting things to write about.The headhunting project started and then, the customer decided to put it on hold for the time being. Honestly, I am not surprised because, the position is somewhat vague. It feels like the position was created for someone whom the company did not want to lose at one point. Now that he has left, they probably thought he needed to be replaced and then started having second thoughts. The company also seems to be going through some form of re-organization. I think it is better for them to think thoroughly about this.My days are pretty much the same. I am exercising regularly lately and listening to tons of new music I was not familiar with. K-Pop is my new interest and I started following and loving many young Korean artists. I have also watched a few Korean rom-coms and they are hilarious. They are as good as cheesy Hallmark movies.Here is a sample of what I have been listening. These young men are so talented. I am thinking they are making their parents proud. This tiny concert was during COVID. They are already famous internationally but, I recently became aware of them. 3 of the members are now in the military for the 18 month compulsory military service in South Korea. The rest will soon be enlisting too. So, we will not be seeing their new work until the end of 2025. I hope, they continue to make music together after serving. They have solo careers too."},
{"title": "Projects projects", "date": "Friday, November 3, 2023", "text": "Once upon a time, I had bought a cute Christmas themed fabric panel while in the US. It had been sitting among my hobby pile forever. I have decided to finally finish it so that, I can hang it up. I sew the backing and filled it with some polyester filling. I put small knots in certain places to keep the filling in place. It is not finished yet. I need to go out and find a stick so that I can hang it up. I will share the finished product hopefully soon.I also have another fabric panel that is Fall themed. I was going to work on it too but, my remaining backing fabric was not long enough. Bummer. I need to purchase some fabric to get that done.Long time readers know that I sometimes take on headhunting projects for technical positions. I was not planning to take another project but, my friend who owns the company called me for a very specific C- level position which will be reporting to a CEO whom I have known from a previous job as a colleague. I thought about it for a whole day before I accepted it. During the past 10 months, I had two pleasant, one highly irritating project. Luckily, that project has ended well after a lot of back and forth as well. So, please wish me luck with this new one.I need to keep busy during the cold months so that, I can stay away from food. Boredom is the worst enemy of a healthy life.This weekend, I want to tackle two kitchen cupboards and my kitchen towels. Need to get rid of some stuff and re-organize.It is time for a steaming cup of Linden Tea. Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend."},
{"title": "The Chickpea Recipe", "date": "Tuesday, October 31, 2023", "text": "I had promised to share the recipe of the chickpeas if it turned out to be tasty. I loved it. It is a Vegan recipe so, a broad number of people may enjoy it.It is normally a very hot dish but, I cannot tolerate too much heat and I modified the recipe. So, here are the ingredients:4 cups of boiled chickpeas (you can use canned but I soaked them and boiled them)2 cups of chopped peppers (any kind you like, you can also mix hot peppers)1 cup of thinly sliced onions3-4 big cloves of garlic1 large diced tomato1/3 cup olive oilSalt/Pepper/Red pepper flakesYou mix these all up in a baking pan. Use a large pan and spread the mixture evenly.Heat your oven to 390 F and put the pan in for 45 minutes. Every 15 minutes mix the ingredients well.This is a main dish and I served it with salad. In Southeastern Turkiye, people wrap this in pita or tortilla type bread and have it for breakfast. I think that is too many carbs so, I had it for dinner with salad.I used sweet red and green peppers but, added red pepper flakes to make it a bit hot. It is a perfect Fall dish. I finally put all the bags of the extra clothing I decided to purge, in my trunk so, next time I take my car out, those will go into a donation box. There is a pile of laundry that needs to be folded and put away. and a small pile of papers I need to sort through and I also need to straighten out my bathroom and the kitchen a little bit. So, these are today's chores. Hoping that it will be a productive date for everyone."},
{"title": "Settling In", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2023", "text": "Today, I took care of some bills and banking business. Then I put away my beach things, and started swapping out warmer clothes and summer clothes. Was able to purge a few things here and there which felt good.I also filled my pill boxes, and started a shopping list. Tonight I am going to try a chick pea dish I have heard so much about. If it turns out yummy, I promise to share the recipe.I have been having too much red meat recently, so I want to stay away from it for a while. I want to get some fish but, knowing that on Saturday, it will be very crowded everywhere, I am not sure whether I want to go to my favorite fish monger tomorrow. I also want to buy a whole chicken next week to roast. That yields a good amount of meals for me. The weather is getting chilly and may be it is time for a nice chicken soup. I have some veggie scraps in the freezer and using them up sounds like a good idea. After all, this is the season for chillies, chowders and hearty soups, right?I sorted through lots of paperwork and tossed most of the pile I had as well. The central heating hasn't kicked in yet so, drying laundry is crazy during these days. It will take a while to get rid of the laundry I have. I has washed everything in my suitcase in Ankara so, that made a big dent in the laundry pile but, still there is a lot to wash.This has been a productive day."},
{"title": "Guess What?", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2023", "text": "All went well as I have planned today. So, I decided to head home at 3 p.m. It took me four and a half hours and luckily the traffic approaching Istanbul was not as bad as I expected.So, I am now home as I type this post. As soon as I walked in, I opened the windows to let the fresh air in. It is a bit chilly in the apartment. That what's throw blankets are for, right?It is now past midnight here so, I better go to sleep. My sleep cycle is better than it used to be nowadays so, I do not want to go back to my old ways.Hope, everyone has had or is having a productive day. Take care!"},
{"title": "Before Going Home", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2023", "text": "On Monday, the dishwasher was taken by the service guys. They were right on time so, that was a nice surprise. I then went to meet my babyhood friends and had Chinese Food. Came home and watched the last episode of our TV show with my American friend M.Yesterday, I took my car to have my winter tires put on. This year I had to buy a full set of regular tires and winter tires. However, I knew these expenses were going to be incurred this year. Therefore, they were budgeted. I then went to get a cup of tea and a napoleon to treat myself. I was so close to Anıtkabir so, I have decided to visit the mausoleum of the founder of Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. This coming Sunday, November 29th is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the country as a democratic republic. I paid my respects and went to the museum in the complex. I feel so good about having visited Anıtkabir.Today, I visited a friend who had a hernia surgery a couple of weeks ago. We chatted happily for a couple hours and when I noticed that she was getting tired, I took my leave.I had a late lunch and came home, packed my suitcase and put it in my trunk. If I can finish my business with the real estate dealer early enough, I can just leave to go home to Istanbul. It is a highway and it only takes about 4 hours to drive. Why wait till Friday?The dishwasher will be delivered early in the morning. After that, I will go to the bank and then to the real estate dealer. Wish me luck for smooth sailing tomorrow.In about an hour M and I will be watching the first episode of the final season of The Sinner on Netflix.Hope, everybody is having a nice hump day."},
{"title": "Back in Ankara", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2023", "text": "It has almost been a whole month since I had posted. I was having a good time and was dead tired at the end of each day. Besides, every day was almost the same as the day before. Go to the beach, swim, have coffee, read book, swim, read book, swim, go home, have dinner, hit the pillow latest by 10:30. Rinse and repeat. It was so relaxing. It was around 80 degrees Fahrenheit the whole time. Perfect! The water was also awesome. It started to get a little cooler on the last few days and that is expected.A couple of times, uncle and I went on his little boat and that was fantastic too.The last day of my vacation was Friday and that was not so great though. As I was on my way to the beach one last time, I saw an engine warning light on my dashboard. Luckily, I was not too far from a Ford Service. I brought the car to them and they diagnosed the problem quickly. I was going to have my car serviced for 90K kilometers so, they did that too. I borrowed my uncle's car to go to the beach. As I was getting ready to go back to collect my car, a bee decided to sting me. Ouch! The area is still read, warm, swollen and itchy. Anyway, I made it to Ankara yesterday and here I am typing a new post.I have a few errands to run this week in Ankara and I am hoping to go back home on Friday. I miss my home and it has been too long to be away from home.Tomorrow the dish washer is going to be serviced. Since it is still in warranty, there will be no out of pocket costs. The only problem is, they will need to take it away for a couple of days because the salt dispenser needs to be replaced.I had recently decided to buy two small lots of land within 30 minutes of the Ankara home as an investment. The area is still under development and it will be a few years before anyone can build on it but, it sounded like a good investment and the price was right. One of my childhood friends also bought two lots. We are next to each other and her brother bought the two lots right behind me.I do not think, I will build anything there. I will most likely sell the land when the price is right but, who knows? I had made a down payment for the lots and on Thursday, I will pay the rest of the money. I also have some banking and investment decisions to make this week. Majority of my money is where my sister works but, she is planning to retire in 2024 so, I will re-distribute my money into different accounts and banks. Today, I need to rest because the 7 hour drive yesterday was quite tiring. Hope, everyone is having a restful weekend."},
{"title": "In Ankara", "date": "Friday, September 29, 2023", "text": "My friend and I went for our vacation and came back to Ankara. We had a real good time. The island was beautiful with cool water, nice breeze and fresh air. I slept like a baby every single day.The hotel at Gokceada Petrino, was wonderful. They have only 8 rooms in an old stone building. It was tastefully furnished and impeccably clean. The owners were attentive to every detail and were so welcoming. Definitely would go back.Every morning we had fresh and breads and pastries, olives, cheese, a selection of homemade jams, tomatoes, cucumbers and eggs made to order. You will see a video of a crazy good surfer we saw at our favorite beach below.After Gokceada, we went to Assos. More on that later.Gokceada (Imbros) after sunsetGift store Mostly Handmade ItemsPetrino Hotel LOVELY!Our Daily Breakfast Hope to post more pictures soon. I had a HBP attack for a few days after we came to Ankara. Still recovering. Nowadays, I am trying to get together with a bunch of friends and having a good time.I will resume posting more frequently after I return home in Istanbul."},
{"title": "Getting Ready", "date": "Friday, September 8, 2023", "text": "I love to travel but, I do not like packing and unpacking at all. I am trying to pack the least amount of things possible.I was going to start packing tomorrow but, I need to attend a funeral at noon so, I started today. A High School buddy of mine lost her mom and the service is not too far from where I live. It is not an unexpected loss but, still losing a parent is extremely hard.As I age, the hardest part of packing has become my pills. I take 6 pills every day for, HBP, Vertigo and allergies. I also need to bring additional meds just in case. Gokceada is not a heavily populated and touristic place. It is one of the very few natural beauties we have left. There is just a small town center. No loud beach clubs or anything like that.  I also take my pulse-oximeter, my blood pressure monitor, a bunch of masks, a small first aid kit. Yes, a small bag just for health supplies.It is getting chilly so, I think, I need to pack a sweater and a light jacket. Once, I go down to Antalya, it will probably be much warmer than Gokceada.On Sunday, before I go to pick up my friend from the train station, I will change my sheets and put my comforter in a duvet cover. By the time I come back home, I am thinking, it will be pretty cool in Istanbul.There is so much to do. Wishing everyone a relaxing and nice weekend."},
{"title": "Finally!", "date": "Thursday, September 7, 2023", "text": "I finally got my behind off the armchair and purged my wardrobe today. I still had a bunch of jackets and few pants that I do not think I will be needing anymore. I kept 3 jackets and 3 pairs of tailored pants and purged the rest. A few blouses also made it to the donate group. I tried every single thing, I am parting with. I then, got on my treadmill and walked for 35 minutes listening to the Rocky IV soundtrack. After the walk and shower, I felt like I wiped off Ivan Drago like Rocky. One more purging session is due when I come back from vacation end of October. There are 4 boxes of winter clothing and some summer clothes I am wearing now, that will be purged.And, here are some more Edinburgh pictures:Dolly the First Cloned SheepMonument of Sir Walter ScottHolyrood Palace"},

I need to catch up on reading my favorite blogs.I do not know what happened to August but, September is here, the weather is somewhat milder and this is the beginning of my favorite season.Next Sunday, I am going on vacation with a very old friend, the one with whom I had a month long vacation 2 years ago. This time it will be a lot shorter. After that, I will go see my uncle and hit the beach down in Antalya for a few weeks.We are going to an island Gokceada (Imbros) for 5 days. It is located in Northern Aegean Sea. On Sunday September 10th, we shall drive to Gelibolu (Gallipoli) and stay there for one night. Early in the morning on Monday, we will get on the ferry to Gokceada. That whole area has great historical significance for us, the Turks. Some events led to the fall of the Ottoman Empire and birth of the Republic of Turkiye. On the way back from the island, we may decide to stay in the area for a couple of days but, we have not planned that yet.Here is a map of our drive to Gelibolu, I have highlighted the border with Greece in red."},

{"title": "Back Home ", "date": "Monday, July 31, 2023", "text": "It was a wonderful but, a very tiring trip because of all the walking I had done. I am getting older and I think, I should enjoy travel more since it looks like it is going to be harder as I age. Honestly, given my current condition, I do not see myself traveling much after 70. So, in these 14 years ahead of me, I should travel more to the places I really want to see.Here are some do's and don'ts in Edinburgh1. Take the City Sightseeing tour on the first day of your visit and purchase only the Green Line. You really do not need the Red Line and the Purple Line. I did them all in 48 hours and saw that, it wasn't necessary.2. Use the Lothian buses. I loaded the app on my cell phone and it was great. They have what they call Tap Tap Cap which is an inexpensive option to travel around the city. 3. If you want to go see the Royal Yacht Britannia, you can take the tram or a Lothian Bus. No need for the Purple tour. If you haven't watched The Crown, I would recommend you to watch the few episodes Britannia was shown and talked about especially the Queen's bidding farewell to her beloved yacht before visiting.4. I think, Maid of Forth is an overrated tour. I did it but, if I hadn't, it would not be a loss. Couldn't see any puffins. Bummer. It was interesting to see three bridges built in 3 different centuries though. 5. I chose not to drive but, now I think, I could have driven to places like The Kelpies, The Stirling Castle and Inverness etc. I will do it next time. I stayed in the City but, I could have stayed a little out of the City, took the buses in and drive out to the places above. Next time. 6. Even in July, it was cold and it rained almost every day but, the showers were short so, they weren't joy killers at all. I had a cotton sweater and a lightweight winter jacket with me and I am glad I had them. And yes you need an umbrella and a raincoat. 7. The Holyrood Palace is a great place to see. The gardens are awesome.8. Didn't go up the Edinburgh Castle or Arthur's Seat or Calton Hill. If you are young and have good knees, by all means do it.9. Most museums were free so, enjoy as many as you like.10. Try haggis. It is quite tasty in fact.11. Can't drink hard liquor so, I had no whisky and gin tastings but, I heard, they are really good.12. Bring really comfy shoes. I love my New Balance 990s and I could not have survived this trip without them. I walked between 10K and 15K steps every day. I am also glad I brought some Voltaren with me to rub my tendons after a nice shower each day. If you forget it, it is available OTC by the name of Voltrol or something?13. I used Expedia to book my flight and hotel as a package and it worked well. The direct flight from Istanbul to Edinburgh on Turkish Airlines takes about 4 hours. 14.A lot of friends asked me why I did not join a tour. Here is the reason: I am notoriously independent. I just can't deal with other people on vacation except for my SIS and BIL and a couple of friends. They know me well and even when on vacation together they know when I need my space and do my thing. If tours are your thing, I am sure there is a lot of value in joining one.15. Took a day trip to Glasgow. The University of Glasgow was breathtaking. It is a must see in my opinion.16. I stayed at YOTEL Edinburgh in a Premium Queen Suit. It was tiny but enough for one. For two, it may be overcrowded. They also have a design problem with shower stall. Each time you shower, water finds it's way out of the stall. It is annoying. I had seen this in the comments but, I thought that it would have been fixed. Not. I will be posting pictures soon.Good to be back home and take a long nice shower in my own bathroom."},
{"title": "Edinburgh Part 1", "date": "Monday, July 24, 2023", "text": "I arrived in Edinburgh yesterday. My flight was delayed for an hour but, it was not so bad. Took the tram to Princes Street stop and walked to my hotel in 10 minutes. Honestly, I walked longer at the Istanbul Airport which is monstrously big. I was exhausted by the time I reached my gate.After checking in, I took a short shower and walked to a nearby pub for dinner. I got in bed around 8:30 and watched some TV. I do not know when I fell asleep but, I haven't slept so well, may be in the last 5 years.I bought a 48 hour Hop-on Hop-off tour ticket and rode on all three buses. I visited the Royal Yacht Britannia. If you have watched The Crown, you may remember how upset the late Queen was when Britannia had to be decommisioned. I must say, I would be upset too. It is an elegant boat with humble furnishings. Has a cottage like feel. There were luxury things too of course but, I guess nothing beats taking your Rolls Royce and Land Rover with you on the boat. Tomorrow I will visit some museums and Royal Botanical Gardens on my sightseeing tour routes. Luckily it did not rain today but, I can't be sure about tomorrow. Let's hope, it will be a good day. After the heat wave in Istanbul, the cool weather felt good. I wore a sweater and a light winter jacket. Early in the morning, I wished I had packed a scarf and even a pair of gloves. Lol!Here are some pictures from today: Top picture is the Castle of Edinburgh. The Rolls is one that has been on the Britannia. Bottom picture is the late Queen's bedroom on Britannia."},
{"title": "Don't want to cook!", "date": "Friday, July 14, 2023", "text": "It is so hot today. Did not go out.I also don't want to cook. I have been eating salads and wraps lately but, I'm running out of ingredients so, I will have to go shopping tomorrow. I like to buy fresh produce from the farmer's market since everything lasts a lot longer compared to the grocery store. After that, I still need to hit a grocery store for yogurt and some spices.I haven't been buying any meat products and trying to use up whatever I have in the freezer. My goal was to finish all the chicken and fish before next Sunday but, I do not think I will be able to. That's OK.Just soaked some chick peas for tomorrow's salad. I like beans in my salads. They add texture and make salads more filling. One of my favorite combinations is iceberg lettuce, arugula, goat cheese, chick peas and apples but, I always use whatever I have on hand.I arranged the linen and towel drawers in the guest room because they were practically overflowing. I am not getting rid of the excess because, it would be a waste. I will just keep them elsewhere. There are some ideas of the minimalists and guru de-clutterers I do not agree with; one of them is getting rid of perfectly usable items. Wishing everyone a nice and comfortably cool weekend."},
{"title": "Guests came and went", "date": "Tuesday, July 11, 2023", "text": "I had a good time with my buddies during the last two days. It was a nice visit.Today, I started laundry after they left. Other than putting the guest bed back together (it's a trundle bed) and doing laundry, I did not do much else. The cool days are over and the weather is hot now. I have been ignoring my walks lately due to the heat but, mornings are quiet manageable still. So, I am hoping to go walking tomorrow morning.I have leftovers for tomorrow so, no cooking for me. However, I may want to tackle some clothing items and part with them. Nowadays, whenever I come across something that I do not need or use, I get rid of it immediately. It can be a small item, or a large one. Tackling bigger de-cluttering projects is all good but, if I find something that is not needed, why not get rid of it at once? The other day, I was initially happy to find two hair clips but, as soon as I tried putting them on, I realized that they are very uncomfortable and actually hurt my scalp. Tossed them right away. My friend has many hobbies and one of them is jewelry making. I gave her some items I no longer wear. She can use the beads and the hardware and etc. She will also fix a broken silver necklace I like a lot. I got rid of things that I do not use but, I know that they went to someone who will use them. Hope, everyone is having a good week. Take care!"},
{"title": "Home is Guest Ready", "date": "Sunday, July 9, 2023", "text": "It has already been an exhausting weekend. Tidied up my home, vacuumed the floors, made the guest bed, cleaned my kitchen, bought groceries and stockpiled a bit. The Government of course upped the Value Added Tax on everything to try to get out of the stupid economic crisis they drove us into. Paper products and personal hygiene products will get more expensive. So, I added more TP, paper towels, tissues, toothbrushes, shampoo and body wash, toothpaste and dental floss to my stash. It is hard to find storage spaces for stockpiling in an apartment. Therefore, I de-cluttered a bit and found a sensible home for everything. This effort made me clean and organize my vanity drawers in the bathroom. I will attack the upper cabinets and mirror cabinet next week. Today, I emptied the dishwasher, mopped the floors, cleaned the bathrooms and took a shower. Then I found an easy crackle cookie recipe and made the dough which is resting in the fridge as of now. I think, I will save some of the dough in the freezer for later use. I am expecting my friends to show up for dinner but, if they come early, the cookies will be ready for tea time.I have recently been hooked to Frugal Fit Mom and A to Zen Life Channels on YouTube. Christine and Marissa are totally different characters but, I like them both.  If you are looking for shopping tricks, easy and inexpensive meals, budget slashing ideas, Frugal Fit Mom is a good source. If you are curious about de-cluttering, attempting minimalism (your way) and watching something that gives you peace, Marissa is one of the best.Do you have any favorite YouTube Channels to recommend?"},
{"title": "Fridge Cleaning Day", "date": "Thursday, July 6, 2023", "text": "I decided to clean my fridge today. I always wait for a time when the fridge is near empty which is usually before or after a vacation but, right before a vacation, cleaning the fridge is the last thing on my mind. When I come back to an empty fridge, I want to go and buy food so, apparently the best time is now. I am satisfied with the work I have done. Although, I have been very good about buying and consuming what is necessary lately, I ended up tossing two lemons and one tomato which had successfully hidden from me. I also realized that, I forgot that I had an extra container of yogurt and bought another one so, I am going to use them before they go bad.On Sunday a good friend of mine and her husband are coming to stay for a couple of nights so, I must dust, run the vacuum cleaner, make their bed and clean up the bathroom before they arrive. They are both former co-workers of mine. I will make dinner as well. May be Chicken Francese with pasta and salad? Easy and tasty. I have tons of lemons to use up. I may have enough chicken but, I will have to check out my freezer. I always marinade my chicken in portion sizes. Lately, I have used a soy based marinade and that doesn't go well for Chicken Francese. I am thinking of making a marble cake to go with coffee or tea as well. I am not much of a baker but, the recipe I have is pretty easy. Or, I may end up ditching that idea and buy some ice cream instead. Using the oven these days doesn't sound so appealing.I have been having some trouble with my new computer or rather the MS Office. I have an Excel Sheet for my budget, important info, trip planning and Net Worth calculations that I have been using forever. For some stupid reason the new Excel keeps saying there are circular references and messing my calculations. I think, I have finally corrected everything but, I don't get why this happened. I do not feel good when I cannot find the reason for something. Is my fix a band aid for an important problem or was it just a glitch? I need to know.Decided to get ready for my trip in Scotland. I am making notes for transportation to and from the airport, public transportation, food to eat, places to see and etc. I think, the first two days, I will do the Hop-on, Hop-off Bus Tour to get an understanding of the city and see the major attractions. I am prepared to walk a lot but, I do not like uphill walking. I need to find out where and when to walk or to use public transportation. I am going to park my car at the airport when I leave. There is a 7-day membership which is a good deal in closed parking. It will be like 7 days+1 day. I wish I were able too book a flight from the smaller and closer airport in Istanbul but, that wasn't meant to be.I cannot believe we are almost half way through the summer. It has been rainy and cool such a long time that, I really did not feel like it was already summer. Crazy."},

I guess if you're living in the American Continent, it is very difficult to see storks. A quick Internet search told me that there is only one kind of stork in America and it is called the wood stork and that bird hangs out in Georgia, South and North Carolina.In our case, here is the migratory route of our storks. The blue oval is Turkiye (or Turkey) and the navy triangle is where I usually hang out. So, you see I am right on their way. It is hard to miss them during Spring and Fall.And here is a fun fact about one particular stork who has befriended a fisherman and who has her/his? own Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaren_(stork)Yaren means buddy/comrade/friend in Turkish. This is the 11th year Yaren came to visit Fisherman Adem. He named his little boat after Yaren. Here is a picture:"},

I know, believing such a thing is kind of stupid but, I swear it works for me. May be just because I already like to travel. Lol!Anyhow, I saw flocks and flocks of storks this year and now a couple of people are trying to talk me into long vacations in the UK and in the US respectively. A month or more in each case. I do not think either of them is sensible when our currency is now so much weaker than anytime before. I have missed my beach vacation early this year so, I want to go stay with my uncle which is a very economical vacation.2 weeks in London may be something I wanna do but, I am very hesitant about a whole month in the US early 2024. I see no value in it. She wants to go to Florida in February and I can go to my friend M's later on but, how much fun can it be in March in NY State? So, I must gently let down this person and also, hide the London trip from her. I am still contemplating about what to do. Any ideas about how I can handle this situation?"},
{"title": "Mini Vacation and Home, Sweet Home", "date": "Saturday, July 1, 2023", "text": "My dad's cousin F invited me over to her older sister's little farm. I was reluctant to go at first because the farm is in this little town where our summer house used to be. Mom loved it and she always regretted selling the summer home. Besides, during our last trip with her, we had stopped by the town and she had told me I had made her very happy because she missed the place so much. So, yeah. I wasn't sure whether I should go but I caved and went. I spent 6 days there.I had a good time. The place is like a botanical garden. All sorts of flowers and trees. And bugs. I had a lovely time enjoying the beautiful flowers and the bugs had wonderful meals off of me. I picked cucumbers, peppers, raspberries for our meals. F's sister S gave me zucchinis, eggs and a ton of fresh grape leaves. I do not know how to brine the grape leaves but, she told me to just blanch about a dozen at a time and roll them up and then freeze. I processed them yesterday and I think, I have enough grape leaves to last me all winter. I stuffed some of the larger ones with a rice mixture and they were divine.We had a family dinner with their brother E and his wife. Those three siblings can't get along with each other. It was tense but, I guess they behaved themselves in my presence. They are in their 60's and 70's! I am so glad I have a good relationship with my SIS. I am also glad to be back home. Having used to living alone, I need my space, lots of space. I have been doing laundry since yesterday. I am on my 5th load and there are 2 more to go. Tonight's dinner is chicken and salad. I am trying to use up all the meat products in my freezer before I purchase any more. I need to buy coffee, dried mint leaves and Vitamin D and some fresh veggies on Monday. I should check my spices. I may be running out of cumin too."},

I have some peppers, zucchini and tomatoes that I need to use up. I will sautee them as soon as I post this.The weather is still cool therefore, I am thinking of making a chili later this week. I do not add sour cream (very hard to find in this country) or cheese (to make it less caloric) to my chili but, I think, it is tasty enough all by itself. I am not a big fruit eater but, I did buy one of those small watermelons and 2 pounds of sweet cherries last week. The watermelon looks great and tastes more like cucumber. Bummer!The tart cherries are not out yet but, as soon as they come out, I want to freeze a significant amount because they help lowering my uric acid level. Another good reason to empty the freezer. I can buy them frozen but the price on frozen tart cherries is ridiculuous. I'd rather freeze enough for a few months at least. If I had space for an extra freezer, I would certanly freeze a year's worth.It's pouring outside so, I'm going to need to walk on the treadmill."},

I talked to my American friend M while I was resting. She is going through some rough time due to health issues in her immediate family. I walked some more and had a cup of coffee before I came home. I know, it's not frugal. I should have made the cofee at home but, what's done is done.As soon as I got home, I jumped in the shower and it felt so good. After I post this, I will go dress myself and prepare dinner. I decided today should be a vegetarian day so, I am going to make myself a bowl with wild rice, lentils, carrots and greens. Tomorrow, there will be salmon and sweet potatoes for dinner. Last night, I woke up to the noise of the thunder. It rained a lot during the night.  This year, the weather has been quiet weird.

It was an expensive trip but, I will not need laundry detergent, dish soap, liquid hand soap, hand soap, diswashing tablets, toilet paper and napkins for at least till the end of the year if not more. I have enough fish and chicken in the freezer at least for a month. I would like to stretch them till July 23rd if I can.I am planning to take a carry-on backpack to my trip in Scotland. I will stay in the same hotel room for 7 days, so I will pack very lightly. I am not planning to purchase any souvenirs or gifts. Today, the cleaning lady came and my home smells fresh. I will keep it tidy, I promise."},
{"title": "Birthday Week", "date": "Wednesday, June 7, 2023", "text": "On Monday, I finally got my new tires installed. I am going to have to buy new winter tires come Fall. Oh joy! This year has been an expensive one so far but, all were necessary expenses. Also, next year, I will have none of these expenses. New tires last at least 4 years, car inspection comes around every two years, a laptop lasts me usually about 7-8 years if not more. I also needed to go to the safety deposit box that I share with my SIS. The bank is right in the middle of the city center in Ankara. I have fond memories of the neighborhood so, I strolled around a bit and found that it no longer is the place I remember. There used to be nice shops, restaurants, amazing bookstores that I loved as a kid. Every Saturday, mom and I had a routine of doing our shopping, having lunch and then buying books for me. It was lively but, not as crowded as it is now. Besides people were much nicer. Nowadays people walk right at you or jump in front of you entering a place. Young people and men are no longer as gentle as my generation used to be. After that, I went to visit my BIL's dad. Each time I see him, I observe that he is getting older and more frail. I hit the road around 10 a.m. and it took me 7 hours to drive to Izmir. I stopped only twice to get a cup of coffee and use the bathroom. I made sandwiches and 8-10 fresh apricots so, I did not have to eat at the overpriced and mediocre places on the road. As I was driving, I cried a little thinking about our travels with mom. Having her death anniversary on my birthday is hard but not as hard as it used to be so, I guess I have healed a lot since her passing three years ago.As soon as I got to my sister's home, I took a nice shower and felt fresh. They took me to a nice restaurant by the seashore for my 56th birthday and the weather was great. As I type this, my phone is charging and they are at work. I need to get a new cable for the charger so, I will just go to the nice mall nearby and may be sit at a cafe for a while. I slept in today and then watched some Turkish reality show. I do not know why I am hooked to these stupid shows. There was this disgusting woman who wants her son back from the claws of this \"tramp\" who lives in Izmir. She says they were probably doing drugs and even selling them. She also said that her son was not a mentally stable person and even blamed the young girl's dad, saying things like her son was being held captive due to brainwashing and drugs. She seems to be very religious and she does not like the fact that, her son no longer fasts during Ramadan or go to the mosque. WTF!? He is an adult. He can decide for himself. The guy turned out to be a very level headed 24 year old, who graduated Computer Engineering in 2020. He has a solid job as a software engineer and is sharing an apartment with two other guys. He is dating this nice girl who is described as a witch and a tramp by his mom. She is also a university graduate with a steady job. They have become friends 7 years ago and then they decided they wanted to date. They are not even talking marriage yet or living together. They could have and that would be quite normal. He submitted official medical reports to prove that he is not on any drugs. He said that he had a lot of anxiety issues because his mom does not want him to live his own life. She was saying things like, he was hers because she gave birth to him and that they should live together. What kind of a sick mind is that? She does not believe the official medical documents and is going to go to the court to seek legal guardianship of her son because she thinks he is mentally challenged. What a wicked witch! Most of us are not grateful enough to recognize how important it is to be born into a regular, normal family. Thank you Mom and Dad for being great parents, insisting on a good education, letting us shape our own careers and loving us unconditionally. SIS and I are so grateful."},
{"title": "Relief in a Weird Way", "date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2023", "text": "I have been struggling to fill a position for one of our current customers for a while now. The requirements are hard to meet and not a lot of people want to change their jobs when the economy is so unstable. Can't say, I blame them. Yesterday, I sent the Customer a report for a new potential candidate and lined up 3 more to intervew this week. However, yesterday night, I had this weird feeling that this position may be done away with because as I thought about the current organization structure of the company, I somehow thought adding another person to the head count seemed a little too much. They just opened a new office in Dubai and I am thinking, that must have cost a pretty penny. Lo and behold, today I received an e-mail telling me that the position is postponed for at least 6 months. I am sort of relieved but also, frustrated that we worked really hard to find the right candidates for the job. Oh well... Not a big deal for me but, the owner of our company who is a long time friend may be upset over this because, she had been complaining that the business was too slow lately. On another note, I went to see a dermatologist yesterday because of a red rash on my skin on the left side of my waist. I ovserved it for a while and then used a cortisone cream but that caused the rash to get bumpier and bigger. The doctor told me it must be a fungal infection and prescribed a cream for it. If it does not start to get any better in a week, I should go see her again so that they can biopsy it. Yikes! I am hoping that, it is indeed a fungal infection. Getting old is such a joy, isn't it? Always a new trouble.Tomorrow, I am going to Ankara for a week or so. My 56th birthday is coming up on June 6 which also marks the 3rd anniversary of mom's passing. I can't believe it has already been three years. I still miss her so much that it hurts. She was my rock and best travel buddy. I remember one day as we were watching a trashy reality show on TV, she was sort of pestering me to get up and re-organize my closet which really needed it. I told her stop presurring me or else, I would run away from home like the stupid teen on the show we were watching. She said: \"That would be quiet idiotic, wouldn't it? This is your home. Where are you running to?\" We had a good laugh and joked about how she would go on the show to find her 50+ daughter who ran away from her own home just because her mom wanted her to tidy up her closet.Nowadays, my closet is almost always in order because I purged so much. My sister has a theory that, when people pass, parts of their souls go into their loved ones and that is how they live forever. Ever since mom passed, I started doing certain things her way and keeping a tidier home. So does my uncle. My SIS may have a point after all.Gotta go and straighten out some things."},

I walked 6000 steps and walked on the treadmill to make it to my goal.I did not want to cook today so, I just had leftovers for lunch and fixed a sandwich for dinner. My snack was yogurt with pineapple. Did not drink enough water. Shame on me.My American friend M called and we had a long chat and then watched another episode of Designated Survivor. She and I are avid watchers of police procedurals and shows involving spooks. We both have worked for the Defense Industry may years ago and know a thing or two about how security agencies work so, we pick out the ridiculuous things and make fun of them as we watch these shows. I told her that when she retires this year, may be we should become YouTubers who take a show and critique it and point out all the b...s..t. May be we can even be hired later on by big production companies to consult the writers. Why not, right? Lol.Tomorrow I have to go see my dentist who is also a High School buddy.

Istanbul is really humid and when it is cold on top of that, line drying the clothes takes too long. I will use mom's trick and open my bedroom and guest bedroom windows which are on the opposite ends of that area. This creates a draft and when the clothes are hung in between, they dry faster.I am going to take out the sewing machine and try my hand on some simple projects this week. I applied for apprenticeship at Kim's over at Out My Window. She accepted me (I think) so, next time I am in the US, I will have a Master to teach me to sew and make alterations. I have a dentist appointment on Wednesday and I am going to take my car to inspection on Thursday.

I need my walking muscles when I go to Edinburgh late July. I understand, the best way to see the city is by walking but, it is a hilly place.

I went into the hospital at 8:40 a.m. and came out at 2:30 p.m. Ugh!A nurse weighed me, measured my BP and drew 5 tubes of blood. Then I got an abdominal sonogram, and a chest X-Ray. After these I was given a small cup for pee and a smaller tube for the other thing. Ewwww! I hate to do these in a hospital bathroom. Then, they gave me a voucher for breakfast since by the time these were all done, I was famished. After breakfast, I went to see a GP who referred me to an Internist because my bad cholesterol (LDL) is elevated. Of course, the Internist wants to put me on statins. I argued a bit with him because, I honestly don't want to add another med to the stash I am swallowing every day. So, he ordered a couple of tests to check my carotids and something else. Those will have to be done on Sunday. Since some of the tests required a few more days, I will see the doctor who is in charge of the physical on Saturday. I am not happy about this.I saw a dietician and I will probably work with him to lose some weight and manage my cholesterol. I will work on my diet and exercise for three months and then, we shall repeat the cholesterol tests to reach a final decision on the statins.Then I went to see a cardiologist who gave me an ultrasound himself and who told me everything looked good but, the cholesterol needs to be worked on.The final doctor I had to see was the most dreaded gynecologist because, the exam hurts me too much. I'd rather go to the dentist (who happens to be a HS buddy of mine). She said all was fine. I have two miomas but she said they were nothing to be worried about. The pap test will come back in a week or 10 days or so.I then went to the bank to get a document I need for the UK visa application. I want to got to Scotland this summer. After that, I went grocery shopping and by the time I got home, I was totally wiped out. Took of all my clothes put them in the hamper and jumped in the shower for the second time today.

The weather is similar to what you would see in Washington D.C. area every season. I would prefer to visit Istanbul between Mid-April and Mid-June and then, after Mid-September till the end of October. April showers are common so, it would be advisable to be prepared.If you want to stop in Istanbul during a cruise, don't. It is impossible to see much during one day. I would recommend picking a cruise that ends in Istanbul and you can stay here for a few days before you hop on a plane to go back home. You need at least 3-4 days to take in the city. It is too big and the traffic is usually very congested.Needless to say, I would love to meet all of my fellow bloggers who make the trip. I love showing people around and making sure they do not fall into any tourist traps.There are many non-stop flights to major US destinations by Turkish Airlines. If you do not mind layovers, Istanbul is a big hub and the flight options are many. So, if you have a certain membership with any airline, I am sure you can find deals.A direct flight to NYC from Istanbul is around 10 hours.Istanbul has been a melting pot of civilizations and there are so many historical sites to see, great museums to visit, many beautiful sights to see. Istanbul ties together Asian and European Continents by Bosphorus channel between the Black Sea and Marmara Sea (an inner Turkish Sea). There are nice boat rides on the Bosphorus but even commuter boats are wonderful to see beautiful old palaces and mansions right on water.The national currency TL is very weak against hard currencies such as USD, Euros and GBP so, it is the perfect time to visit these days. You get a bigger bang of your buck. That sucks for us but alas...Here is a map of Turkey where you can see major cities. I live inIstanbul, SIS lives in Izmir and Uncle lives in Antalya. We also have a place in Ankara which is the Capital City of Turkey. You may notice that the country is actually two peninsulas. The bigger one is called Asia Minor but more commonly Anatolia which sits on the Asian Continent. The smaller is called Thrace and it sits on the European Continent. Our coastline is approximately 5,000 miles so there are plenty of beaches. The Mediterrenean Coast is the warmest and has a long beach season. The country is about the size of Texas in the US. It is bigger than any of the European Countries in terms of land and perhaps population too.Sorry that this has turned into a Geography Lesson. Take care!"},

I do not believe in paranormal stuff but, this felt so real.I don't know if it was me missing her so much or her visiting me at that moment. I am extremely busy these days and not feeling up to writing much but, I try to keep up with your blogs.The spring is finally here after several days of constant rain.Wishing everyone a nice week."},
{"title": "Sold!", "date": "Tuesday, March 28, 2023", "text": "This is a long story, so if you are keen on reading, I would suggest you go get a drink.Long time readers may remember that, we had a family home in Konya inherited by mom and two uncles. My grandpa was given the land in 1955, by a family member who owed grandpa some money. Grandpa planted trees, grapevines and used the land as a garden till he retired. He built a house in 1971 and my grandparents moved there. Grandpa loved gardening and enjoyed his place for 30 years till he passed away. My sister and I spent lots of time there every summer and we enjoyed it too.After both my grandparents passed, uncle had a hard time keeping up with it. The house needed repairs and maintenance, the garden needed tons of attention or money and he was depressed due to his parents' passing and his business failing. My mom did not want it to be sold and both her brothers complied with her wishes. They tried renting it at one point but, that did not work out either. At the end, uncle used it as an office before he had to shut down his business.ALthough, the property was at a very good spot, nobody was willing to buy it in Konya because, it had been sold to grandpa's relative by a religious foundation back in the day. Konya is a pretty conservative city. \"Religious\" people frown upon these types of lands and they would not want to purchase them. It is rather stupid because, the foundation decided to sell the place to buy income generating property for the foundation in the city center. They bought stores and rented them. The sale was all legal and in the registry and taxes were paid and all that. Nothing fishy.All these years whenever someone showed interest in this property, it was always a low baller citing that it was a previously foundation owned property. Mom and her siblings did not sell the property at \"a dead donkey price\" (a local saying). I suspect that, grandpa's relative bought this place from the foundation and when he found out that, it was not a wise investment, he gave it to grandpa as opposed to paying him money. Grandpa did not care because he never intended to sell.When my uncle's business troubles got worse, I had purchased his share so that we could keep it in the family as mom wanted us to. Then, my other uncle passed and his family asked me if I would be willing to buy their shares also and I did.  When mom passed, mom's share was divided between me and SIS. I ended up owning 5/6th and SIS 1/6th of the whole property. I honestly had no hope that it would sell some day because of the religious foundation issues and conservative people (who would love to buy it for real cheap). That was why I never put it up for sale. It has been broken into several times. The roof needed replacing, the whole house needed tons of expensive repairs if we ever wanted to use it again. The thing is, nobody in my family, intended to live in Konya anymore. After my grandparents passed, we did not have any reason to go there. Uncle, who lived there his entire life, now loves living in Antalya by the Mediterrenean Sea and is happy where he is. SIS and BIL are planning to move back to Ankara when they retire, possibly within the year. I am also planning to move to Ankara although I love my home and Istanbul for fear of the earthquake.Since last year, there were some potential buyers asking about the place but, we did not have a decent enough offer as always. By pure chance, SIS met someone through one of her colleagues who worked in Konya and that gentleman told us that, our place actually was one of the few places left in the area and it has become a favorable spot and it should sell for rather a lot of money beyond what we would even imagine. We knew that, the house needed to be taken down and rebuilt but, apparently the land itself has become very valuable. That was great news. We then realized that the offers we had been receiving were from people who knew that and who wanted to buy our place at a low price for bigger profit.There is a real estate agency right next door and they had been asking me about it too. Finally, I told them I wanted X amount of money and they could try selling it for that amount till the end of March. The first potential buyer agreed to pay the asking price but, he retrieved his offer again citing the previous ownership by the foundation. Then, couple of weeks ago, the real estate agent called me that, there was a new potential buyer and that he accepted the asking price. They asked me to go to Konya to sign an agreement to sell by the end of March. The buyer was selling his property elsewhere and was trying to gather the money. He wanted to pay in cash and did not want to take on a mortgage. I signed a contract and got a non-refundable down payment. I still did not believe we would be able to close the deal.Guess what? Last Friday, we closed the deal. The money is now sitting in my bank account ready for me to buy a place in Ankara even after I give my SIS her share and give my cousins some extra money because I did sell at a premium as opposed to what I paid them few years ago. At the time, the place was not worth much. SIS told me to buy a place first before paying anybody including herself and asked me not to sell the Istanbul home. She said, they would be selling their Izmir home when they retire within the year and that I can have the proceeds from that home. She says my apartment in Istanbul is at a safer zone and is a safe building and that it would be a waste to sell it which I agree with (but I am so afraid of the earthquake that, even that I think I would be safe, I do not think I can handle the horrendous shaking). When I pass, my SIS is my sole heir so, we will not even exchange the deeds after their home in Izmir sells.The nice young gentleman who ended up buying the place, bought it as an investment for his wife's business who is a dentist. They want to build a small dental clinic and they think, the location is ideal for them. I met the wife too and they are really decent and kind people. The guy is an Air Force pilot. They kept saying we would be always welcome to drop by anytime we would be in the vicinity. I got a bit emotional at one point as I signed off on the dee transfer because, I have great childhood memories visiting my grandparents every summer and the dentist lady's eyes welled up too. She hugged me and repeated that I and the family would be always welcome to visit. They plan to be done with the building in 18 months. I wish them all the best. That land served it's purpose and brought joy to us as a family for years and now it's time to serve others.I am so glad, I was able to sell the property and a big weight is off my shoulders. I was already financially independent but, this provides an extra cushion. The last few weeks were stressful but, the outcome was so worth it."},
{"title": "Life goes on", "date": "Monday, March 27, 2023", "text": "As the whole country was shocked and terrified by the strong earthquakes that destroyed a huge area (imagine an area from NYC to Charlotte, NC), it was hard to live normally let alone write about it.The first few weeks, I lived in true horror and could not sleep, could not function properly at all. I felt so helpless as I watched the news about the survivors, their problems and the stupid government's incompetence. I wanted to contribute as much as I could but, when you do not trust anybody, it is very hard. And as suspected, some of the money they collected cannot be accounted for. They are evil. There will be elections on May 14th and I am hoping to get rid of these idiots. Otherwise, we shall be doomed. Especially women and children. The current government is teaming up with fundemantalist Islamists and some of them are no better than Taliban. I volunteered to work during the elections so, the ballot boxes can be protected and vote counting will be properly done. There afre many volunteers like I am and we want to make sure democracy prevails.Another stress factor for me lately was the fact that, Istanbul is also in line for a major earthquake that repeats itself every 250 years or so and time has long been up. I panicked about this and started thinking of ways to immediately move to Ankara. I already have insomnia problems and the added stress was just too much to deal with. After a while, I started to feel better and think somewhat rationally but, a surprising incident helped me tremendously, to gather my thoughts and plan the future. I will write about that in my next post. Wishing everyone a great week."},

I truly appreciate your love for my country. I understand you want to contribute and I can recommend you two organizations I trust \"Ahbap\" and \"AKUT\" Unfortunately, I do not trust even the Red Crescent in my country anymore. I think the cheapest way to contribute is by Credit Card. It needs to be authorized for International Transactions. They also have International Fund Transfer Information on their sites.

{"title": "Finally!... Snow", "date": "Sunday, February 5, 2023", "text": "The long anticipated cold weather and snow is finally here. It has been raining for the last couple of days and today, I finally saw some snow. It is supposed to snow till Thursday but, we'll see. It's very windy today. These cold fronts usually come from Ukraine and Russia, or the Balkans and Europe. We need snow for the farmers, and for our water supply. So, all is good.Tomorrow, the schools will be opening after a two week long winter break but, may be not. The governor likes to decide at the very last moment to announce whether there will be school or not.I am supposed to go to my dad's cousin tomorrow. We shall see a show called Fire of Anatolia. I had seen it when they first came out many years ago. They have toured in 106 countries since then and they are pretty good. They tell the story of all the civilizations settled in Anatolia with dance. Anatolia is the Asian part of Turkey, We are basically sitting on two continents , two peninsulas connected with three bridges, one tunnel for passenger vehicles and one tunnel for the Metro line. Anatolia has been a cradle of civilizations for thousands of years. Money has been invented here, the first written contract in history has been signed here, people settled and formed cities and then, massive civilizations. I had a frugal win this weekend. I have a Poang Chair from IKEA in my bedroom. The cushion is red and has bleach stains on it. My curtains and my bedspread are pale blue so, the red really doesn't go with my bedroom.I was about to shell out USD 50 to replace the cushion but, I really didn't want to, so, I looked around my apartment and found a Cream colored thin, cotton blanket. 4 safety pins later, I now have a cream colored chair which goes perfectly with my bedroom. The chair is more of an accessory than something I actually use. I had bought it when I had a second apartment while I was working and just don't want to let it go. My freezer is now full again after eating everything that was in it. I will be eating out of it for a while. Time for dinner which is pre-made and waiting for me in the fridge. Hope, it was a good weekend."},

I am sure that's not a problem for any native speaker of the language because, they will use their own words. I started learning English with a British method and British books (Longman) when I was 11. Then I went to College which was founded by Americans where the course material was from the US by American writers. When I worked for a multinational in NY, I was exposed to a good deal of New York, Brooklyn (yeah that's different) and Boston accents thanks to my colleagues. Would you believe I was once called a \"Damn Yankee\" when I was traveling in the Southern US? (I turned around and cursed in Turkish. Haha!)Anyhow, whatever you call that thing that mostly women carry around all the time starts to weigh a ton, I am sure you all know, it is time to empty the whole thing and organize.I emptied the contents of my purse (I usually use this word) and as always could not believe how much junk found it's way into it.I cleaned the whole thing inside out with wet wipes and got rid of the junk and now I feel better.Also, I took out my warmer sweaters because it is freezing these days. It actually snowed a little last night. Yay! We need more snow for sure. Cooking in bulk and freezing a few dishes help a lot. No cooking this week. I may need a few fresh veggies by the end of the week.Lately I found this YouTuber, Nicole She has figured out the important things in life fairly early and I agree with pretty much everything she says. If you have time, check her out. She is crazy cool.Upstairs neighbors must have visitors again tonight.

What I have is medium eggs at this time.Today, I decided to run my stick vacuum through the apartment. If I do this, every two or three days, I can keep my apartment dust free between cleaning lady visits. I keep clean surfaces now that I have decluttered significantly so, dusting is a breeze. A quick run around the apartment with a microfiber cloth does the job in about 10 minutes.In the past, I loved to display all sorts of knick knacks. Now, no more. Clean and clear surfaces are so much easier to maintain and gives me peace.My lentil sprouting experiment was a success. I think, I will be sprouting them fairly regularly from now on.My sourdough starter experiement was a bust and I also did not like the idea of discarding significant amounts of it. Such a waste. (Edit: I found out that the discards could actually be used but, I don't want to bake so much). So, I found another recipe with no discards.I am now trying this one and so far, it seems to be going well.  I am hoping to bake my first loaf sometime this week. Jack is funny and cute. He seems to have mastered bread making. For the next three or four days or so, I do not need to worry about cooking. This means my kitchen will stay neat for a while.Here is a frugal win: Despite the fact that Istanbul's tap water is supposedly potable, I get water delivered and I used to boil pasta and veggies, cook, make coffee and tea, with this delivered water. I usually get two 5 gallon/19 liters bottle every week. I decided to purchase a Brita water pitcher. Yes, there is an upfront cost and there are the filters one needs to purchase but, still when I did the math, it made a lot of sense. So, now I am drinking the water that I purchase and using the filtered water for all other purposes. Wishing everyone a great week! Here is one of my favorite oldies:"},

I mean who can keep all their jars in military order? Some of those organized pantries look like you need to stand at attention and then salute them. No, thanks.It's not like I have a large family with a huge pantry with lots of stockpiling items and 100+ jars of homecanned food. I have one large and deep kitchen drawer dedicated to pantry items and a small 4-tier shelf on my balcony which I got during the pandemic to store some extra canned veggies and tomato products along with canned fish. So, I emptied the pantry drawer and cleaned it out. Then I checked the expiration dates of everything in it. I found the last of red kidney beans which have expired. I soaked them to make vegetarian chili. I also found some rolled oats that expired last year this month and they still smell good. I do not know if I should use them. What do you think? I was able to re-claim some space on my counter too so, it's a happy day.I am now thinking why human mind is wired to be tempted?

I provide lunch for her because, she comes around 10 a.m. and leaves by 5 p.m. I made Chicken Francese served over pasta and she enjoyed it. After lunch, I left for IKEA. It is literally 15 minutes from where I live. There are a total of 3 IKEA stores in Istanbul and two are close to me.I was looking for suitable containers to store flour and a silicone baking mat. I found the containers but, they were out of the baking mats. I also found these shoe bags and grabbed three of them to use while traveling. I used to use old grocery bags and they were rather flimsy and throwing them out each time after use was filling the landfills with plastic. Nowadays, I am using re-usable bags for groceries. These shoe bags look sturdy and they are washable. Today, I got rid of the paint cans left from the painting of the house in June. There weren't much paint left in any of them anyway.I also got rid of an old broom and dust pan which were in poor condition. I have a small dust pan and a brush and those are enough for I barely use them. I also tossed some old papers such as expired insurance policies, services that have been cancelled, etc. These days almost everything is digital. I am down to three binders where I keep necessary papers. Before I returned home, I also went to the Farmers Market briefly to get just a few veggies to tie me over till next Friday.I currently have two \"experiments\" going on right now. The lentils are sprouting. I can probably put them in my salad in a few days. I also started a sourdough starter. I had failed on this one in the past but, we'll see.I had an interview at 5:30 p.m. Another candidate for the current customer. So, all in all it was a productive day.Wishing everyone a good weekend."},

I am so sorry for Sam and wish her peace and comfort during this extremely hard time. The unexpected  passing of fellow blogger Kim's husband, her reader Hilogene's husband and now Sam's husband made me decide to finally take action about my will. I am so sorry for all the ladies and they are always in my thoughts these days. My dad had passed suddenly when he was only 54 and I know how hard it is to deal with such a loss. Wishing them strength, peace and comfort.For a long time, I have been thinking about how I could guarantee the well being of my loved ones after I pass. In this country, the law is pretty clear cut and I always thought, one could not exclude anybody who is a rightful heir. I found out that this was partially true. Say if you have two kids and you want to leave your estate to only one of them, the excluded kid is entitled to take the matter to court and at a minimum he/she will be eligible for 15% of the entire estate. In some cases, they can even get half as they should have.In my case, I have no kids. I have a sister, an uncle and three cousins from my two late uncles. I am estranged from one of them and I certainly do not want my belongings to go to her. I have been told I can make a will, get two people to witness it and have it notarized. However, I do need some more information and guidance because my uncle's business went bankrupt and in case he inherits something of value, he may end up losing it altogether. Also, my sister and one of my cousins is married. I want only my cousins to benefit from my estate, nobody else. I do not have a problem with BIL and I am sure, if both SIS and I pass before him, he will certainly take care of my uncle and my two cousins. He is an only child so, there are no complications on his end except for the fact that, his dad is still alive. I found a lawyer through a friend of mine and hopefully I am going to set up an appointment this week or the next to sit down and ask my questions and also how I should structure my will.I made a family tree and am preparing my questions so that, I can use the time efficiently.This is a morbid and cold subject but, it needs to be taken care of sooner than later.Wishing everyone a peaceful week, long and healthy lives with their loved ones."},

A pack of smoked salmon jumped into my cart without me noticing. That will top at least three salads. The meat, butter and the tortillas will go into the freezer. Thankfully, I have enough space now to make this work. I had beans in the freezer so, tomorrow's dinner will possibly be burritos. I checked the expiration dates on my canned goods and found some that will expire this year, so I pulled them together and placed them on the upper shelf. Every January, I check my spice cabinet to see if anything needs to be tossed an replenished. I will do that one of these days.Tonight's dinner will be fish and salad. The fish is thawed in the fridge and ready to be popped in the oven with a bit of olive oil. I had shredded whatever was left of the iceberg lettuce and the cabbage. So, it is going to be so easy to put together a salad. I also have cauliflower that I had boiled. I mash it up, add lemon juice, olive oil and salt to it. This is the only form of cauliflower that I like.Here is my list for tomorrow's Farmers Market:- Broccoli- Avocados- Cabbage/Bell Peppers/Zucchini/Chard whichever looks better and fresh (to stuff)- Red Beets- Arugula- Radishes- Onions- Parsley and green peppers for my version of a tabbouleh- In case I do not get a cabbage to stuff, Brussel SproutsPlus any other veggies or greens that catch my eye.  I may also get some fruit. My favorite is Satsuma Mandarins but, I think their season is over now. I do not like the other kinds. We'll see.Then I will check out my fishmonger to see if I would like anything. It is warmer than usual and fresh fish is not great when the weather is so mild. Gotta go and pay my semi-annual car taxes on both cars and wire the money to a contractor in Antalya who is working on repairs of the apartment complex.

I think, next time, I will not bother with that. The sliced tomatoes I froze were better. I am planning on making a veggie lasagna next week. One bag of tomato puree can go into that.I do miss my old small freezer which had to go during the kitchen renovation. It is a dark, cloudy day today so, I think a hot cocoa is necessary to lift my mood up."},

She was always the rock.I put some bed linens that I have brought from mom's last time I was in Ankara and I realized they were ironed.

I still feel blue today.I threw myself into some tasks to shake the feeling.I cleaned my medicine drawer. here are the before and after pictures:Then I decided to bake a bread. Bobbie had suggested this website: Jenny Can Cook for a No Knead Bread. Never made that bread but, today I made this Honey Wheat Bread and the Homemade Tortillas.The Honey Wheat Bread turned out to be awesome! It is so tasty. Back in 1996, I went to Killington, VT and there was a restaurant called The Grist Mill which no longer exists. They had served this wonderful bread with my dinner and I asked the waitress what it was because it was so good. She told me it was their honey braid bread and brought me another roll wrapped in a napkin to take home for breakfast the next day. Such a nice gesture. This bread reminded me of that bread I had at The Grist Mill.I need to practice more for the tortillas. I am not an expert on rolling dough. They were a bit shapeless and thicker than they should be but, tasted fine. There are a bunch of breads that I want to try from this site. Thank you Bobbie for recommending it."},
{"title": "It is time to....", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2023", "text": "It is time to de-clutter because for some reason, I feel de-cluttering vibes in the air. Whenever a space is overflowing with stuff, be it a drawer, or a closet, we know, it is time to de-clutter. Today, I was thinking why wait? Why not get rid of something that we notice right away?Each time I open one of my kitchen drawers, I see this huge bowl which I never use. It just sits there holding pantry staples making it hard to see the items and it also restricts the space. I do not remember why I bought it.There is a 6 piece set of shish (for kebap making) which came with my oven. It has been seven years and they have not been used once. They just take up space.I have this wonderfully made, real top quality leather briefcase since 1997. I loved it when I bought it but, since it weighs a ton, I haven't used it in years. Brand new skis. Never been used. Every year I promise myself, I will get rid of them but, never do. Of course there are also the clothing items with tags still on. They make me cringe with guilt. There is this toaster gifted to me that sits in one of my kitchen drawers just taking up space. I have a toaster oven which I love and use almost every day.I decided that mindful purchasing and constant de-cluttering is the way to go. When you have to take the whole closet down to de-clutter, it becomes such an overwhelming chore that, I almost always avoid it for as long as possible.So, with this mindset, today I took out the bowl, the leather bag, the shish set, a few clothing items I have not worn in more than a year and piled them up by the door. I found a lot of hangers that I do not need. Set aside 5 extra hangers and I am parting with the rest. I will offer the toaster to the guys who work for the apartment complex. I know they have an area where they have meals and breaks during the day and the toaster may be useful for them.I have taken the skis out and took a few pictures of them. As I type this, they are listed on Facebook Marketplace.Thinking back, I think I am in a great place in terms of de-cluttering as opposed to last year but, I know I can do even more. I will be tackling one space or two every day and get rid of unnecessary stuff. Tomorrow I will be targeting my medicine drawer. It has been a while I went through that and I am sure there are expired meds. I found a bunch of old and unopened tennis balls. I will offer them to the people who play tennis right by me when I go out. If they are not good, they can toss them away.Severing sentimental attachments is the worst. It makes me feel guilty getting rid of something I associate with my mom for instance but then, I tell myself it is the time I spent with her and the good memories that count. Stuff is meaningless. Even she is gone, so why hold on to things. With that said, I still cling to several things and am not ready to part with them just yet.Today, as I was making my bed, I noticed a few drops of blood on my bed sheet and pillow. Don't know if my nose bled or if I had a cut or something. All I could think was LAUNDRY! Again? Just ot rid of it. Instead of dumping them in the hamper, I threw them in the washer. Now, I gotta go and fix dinner. Pumpking soup and salad are on the menu tonight."},

Her silence made me worried about her well being because, this was not normal. Even if she did not want to meet the customer, she should have at least texted to say so.It turned out that she had to leave town on an emergency, involving hospitalization of her mother. I am sorry that her mother is sick but, also relieved that she is well. I texted the customer letting them know about the situation and that they were also sorry for her and said they would interview her whenever she becomes available.I went to Bank F to open an investment account and met a very nice customer rep. The process took about a half hour. While we waited for a few authorizations, she offered me coffee and we chatted a bit.I have a busy day ahead of me tomorrow with both my part-time jobs. I will not be home for most of the day so, no cooking.Need to remember to pull out an eggplant dish and a chicken breast in marinade from the freezer tomorrow night for the weekend. I will probably make either a tomato or pumpkin soup too. I have lots of salad fixings so, I should be fine. I got rid of all the laundry but, it isn't actually possible is it? As soon as you are done, you start to fill it up again. It's OK. I do not mind it really.My BFF from the US, M, and I are watching Treason on Netflix these days. We are avid followers of spy/detective/murder mystery type of stuff and we notice a lot of things that does not make sense and the first twoepisodes, there were a lot of those but, now the subject has become interesting. Too bad, it is a mini series. One of my favorite British actors, Ciaran Hinds is a villain. I don't like it when my favorites are bad guys. I suggested M, we should start watching Wednesday after this.Hope everybody is having or has had a good day."},

I interviewed a young woman and recommended her to our Customer. They agreed to interview her right away which is great, right? So, I called the candidate and she did not answer her phone. OK, she is busy. No problem. I waited and waited but, she never returned my call so, I sent her a WhatsApp message. She read it, no answer. I asked my young colleague to call her since I was going to be busy today. She called. No answer. I sent another message telling her that we had been trying to reach her and hoped everything was OK with her. She read the message. No answer. Another colleague called her. No answer. I finally decided to send her an e-mail thinking that may be her phone has been stolen or something. If we receive no answer, I will wait till the evening tomorrow and let the company know that she is not getting back to us. I do not know whether I should be worried about her health or safety. Is it ignorance? Can it be? I have no idea. Just so strange.Today, I had two different bank experiences for the same transaction. I am sure I have mentioned that I keep some of my foreign currency in safety deposit boxes because I do not trust the Government. I had two safety deposit boxes at two different banks on two different continents. They are not too expensive to have and until today, they have served their purpose.I have been contemplating to get rid of them for a while now, because a big earthquake is expected in Istanbul. So, I had moved most of my money and gold coins to a safety deposit box in Ankara and both my SIS and I can access that which makes it mor econvenient and sensible.Last week, the customer rep of one of the banks that I work with called and offered an investment opportunity. I researched it and it made sense, so I decided to add the amounts I had in the SDBs to my account and invest. It also provided me the reason to go and close the two SDBs.So, I went to Bank A, took a number, waited for about 5 minutes for a bank person to take me downstairs. I then had to sign a couple of papers and I was out of there in 15 minutes tops.I then when to Bank Z, and was told I had to wait for about 40 minutes because they had specific times that they served SDB customers. I asked them where they posted this information and the teller said \"On the SDB entrance\" you know the big ass steel door which you can only see when they take you downstairs. I sighed and did not say anything. After all, I am not going to deal with them again. I would understand it if the branch was crowded but it wasn't. So, I missed the opportunity to go to Bank F and sign up for the investment today. I have to go there tomorrow. Oh, well..."},

Dinner will be a big salad with some shredded chicken.Although the cabbage I bought was pretty small, I think I can make some cabbage rolls so, I separated about 10-12 outer leaves and washed them. Took out the chopped meat from the freezer. I shredded half of the remainin cabbage to use in a healthy version of slaw or just add to my salads.I have loads and loads of laundry to do. My drying rack is not sufficient for this big job. Yesterday's cleaning rags are already occupying the lower rack as you can see.I usually put two lines between the doors in the corridor at my home. My mom had come up with this trick and she even tied the hooks to my door hinges herself. Here is what the contraption looks like:I use this to air dry bed linens and large towels. When I am done, I just take the rope out and the hooks remain behind the doors.I would like the convenience of a dryer but, I neither have the space nor the electrical circuitry. My washer is also  one of the small versions available because of space restrictions. It can wash a load of 6 kg. which is about 13.2 lb. Since I live alone, that is quite sufficient.I have started my fourth load and I think I have enough dryer rack space for kitchen towels too but then, I am done for the day. This is why I mostly never accumulate laundry. I do a load or two whenever there is enough to wash. Tomorrow I have errands to run during the day and when I get home in the afternoon, I may be able to finish the laundry."},

Here is a picture of my mini haul.I am hoping that these, along with my pantry and fridge contents will tie me over till next Friday. The orange juice was an impulse purchase but, I couldn't help it. The guy squeezed it right in front of me and it is so good. The string cheese is for breakfast and for snacking. I cut up the chicken breasts and put them in a lemon marinade. Portion sizes are being frozen at the moment. I have also made the French Onion Soup. Yay! Tonight's dinner was soup and salad.I think the Farmers Market open on Fridays is the best. I will use what is already on hand till next Friday. Today I received my new yearly homeowner's insurance policy in mail and I could not believe my eyes so, I asked the insurance guy what is going on. Apparently the Government has tripled something that makes insurance this expensive. Absolutely ridiculuous!I really do hope that the house in Konya will be sold this year. Tired of spending money for nothing.Tomorrow I will go back to exercising which I have stopped a while ago. Hopefully. Wish me luck!"},

Every day, there are farmers markets in some neighborhoods in our cities. The closest one to me is on Sundays. I do not like that because, it is impossible to park and is usually very crowded. I prefer a couple of others, one on Mondays and another on Fridays. They usually take up a few side streets in the neighborhood and everybody knows those streets will be closed on certain days. These markets have a lot of vendors and their produce is much fresher than the grocery stores.After my grocery run, I will go to our office to work for a couple of hours. On my way back, I will quickly grab some chicken/turkey and fish. I am hoping to clean up and prepare my fresh produce once I come home. If stored properly, nothing will be wasted. I also would like to finally make the French Onion Soup I have been craving. Uncle was not too keen on it so, I did not make it earlier. Let's see if I will be able to do all this.The last two nights, I have slept rather poorly. Do not know what is wrong. I blame the heat so, I shut off the heater in my bedroom. Central heating is efficient generally but, for people who do not like heat much, it is an unnecessary expense.Wishing everyone a great week!"},
{"title": "Yogurt, Bread and Sprouts", "date": "Saturday, January 7, 2023", "text": "I have been contemplating about making my own yogurt, baking a few loaves of bread at a time to freeze and grow some sprouts. I made the first two but, never grew sprouts before.I can get raw milk, and make my own yogurt like grandma used to do. I boil the milk on low heat for a long while stirring frequently. I like to mix 2 parts cow's milk and 1 part buffalo milk for a rich creamy yogurt. I use a small container of organic yogurt as a starter. This probably does not save me any money but, I like to do it. Sometimes the yogurt does not turn out to be great. In that case, I turn it into cheese. It's never wasted.I want to control the ingredients of my bread. I still need to make the bread Bobbie recommended. Didn't have time to do it while I had a house guest.I came across some videos about growing sprouts and micro greens and it looks like fun. They are supposed to be very nutritious. The best thing is that they do not need sun. I can grow them in my balcony. I think, I will start with lentils because I already have green lentils on hand.Does anybody grow sprouts at home?I tried making kimchi. It turned out fine. I think. However, I do not like it. So, for gut health, I would rather drink kefir and eat probiotic yogurt. I've decided fermented veggies are not my thing. Good to know my palate. I will try not to waste the kimchi. I will rinse small portions of it and add to my stir fried veggie dishes whenever I make them. As much as I love my uncle, being around him makes me eat in a very unhealthy manner. He normally does not eat like that when he is alone and nor do I. When he is with company, every day becomes a feasting day for him. So, I am glad, he is leaving on Monday and I promised myself to eat only healthy things and in moderation till I go to visit him in May. Also, I am used to living alone so much that, I miss having my apartment to myself. It has almost been over a month since we co-habited at first in Ankara and then in Istanbul. Not that he is a difficult guest but a guest nonetheless. He is also missing his apartment and his toys back home along with warm weather in Antalya. To give you an idea, right now, it is 1℃ in Ankara, 8℃ in Istanbul and 14℃ in Antalya where he lives.Hoping that you are all having a great weekend!"},

Uncle and I have been enjoying rich food lately so, I should get back on track with healthy eating and exercising. He is leaving on Monday. I am setting myself a goal of eating fish and chicken only till my physical. No red and fatty meat. I will also be eating lentils, beans and chick peas with lots of fresh greens. Also, decided to limit my carb consumption and see how that goes. I have also been spending a bit too much. So, from 10th of January till the end of February, I am limiting my purchases to fresh produce, dairy and water only. I will pay the regular bills, the cleaning lady, pay for my physical and fill my gas tank once during this time. No clothing items, toiletries, impulse buys and etc.Whenever I challenge myself like this, something always comes up and I end up spending money. We'll see how this one will go.Earlier, I had mentioned that I was watching some YouTube channels. I would like to share them here:- https://www.youtube.com/@AcreHomestead Becky is a young mom. She likes to plant veggies, can her garden harvest and preserve all sorts of food. She is a very positve young woman. I like to watch her videos.- https://www.youtube.com/@TheOutsiderCabin Father and son built a cabin in the woods. Unfortunately the dad passed last year. Their building process is fun to watch.- https://www.youtube.com/@ImprovedHealth I like to do exercises with this lady. She is very cool and not talkative. She has exercises for older people or people who are starting again.- https://www.youtube.com/@country_life_vlog This is a blog from Azerbaijan. There is barely any talk but, I am so hooked to watching them. They keep a very clean farm. They also have a small cabin in the mountains. What they cook is similar to what we have at home but, the lady makes enormous amounts at a time. They also can and preserve food. Very interesting to me. Rarely they talk a little and I can pick up a few words because Azerbaijani is a form of Turkic languages like ours. I have never been there but, my friends who have visited the country tell me that, you can understand each other despite talking in different versions of Turkish. Wishing everybody a nice and warm weekend."},

We celebrate the New Year so, SIS and BIL will be here on Saturday. Uncle and I are cooking. The menu includes Oven Roasted Chicken, stuffing (American Style), gravy, rice pilaf with chestnuts, red beans in olive oil, Russian Salad and Circassian Chicken (it is a paste made with chicken pieces, tons of walnuts, breadcrumbs and fat free chicken stock). I have soda, iced tea, wine and raki to drink. Dessert will be Cinnabon style cinnamon rolls as opposed to the usual chocolate cake. Now on to my story about the cleaning lady. When COVID hit and when we got stuck at home, my cleaning lady stopped coming. She was working full time back then and she was able to come every two weeks only on Sundays before the pandemic.During all this time, she got back together with her ass...le husband, got pregnant and had a baby. She is no longer working full time so, she said she can come to help me since the baby is now 8 months old and her mother can take care of her. She does not go anywhere else to clean and I know she needs some pocket money.As much as I would like her to come every week, it is not affordable now that I am semi-retired so, we agreed that she will come every two weeks. I gave her a New Year's bonus to spend on her girls and she was thrilled about it. She has a tough life and not all of it is her choice or her fault. I am hoping things will get better and she will soon be able to ditch her husband for good. I spoke to the cleaning lady's aunt today to wish her a Happy New Year. She used to be my former cleaning lady. She told me she is having some health issues and I want to help her out if I can. So, after the New Year's I will go visit her to see what is going on with her. She is a very sweet person.Yesterday, uncle and I went to this Museum. We had a very good time. Spent almost 6 hours and last night my legs ached so much that I had to get up to take a pain killer.There was a special exhibit of world dolls and it was a lot of fun. They even had a special Barbie section and a scary doll section with Chucky, his bride and others. Lol.My favorite sections are classical cars, boats and old trains."},

Last year, S, an old colleague and a long time friend of mine served me that in a shot glass along with a cup of Turkish Coffee and I absolutely loved it.

Uncle took care of winter tires and a small fix.

{"title": "Cleaning Done ", "date": "Sunday, December 4, 2022", "text": "I am going to Ankara tomorrow for a couple of weeks and I will bring uncle back with me so, I needed to clean up my apartment. It took me three days to clean the entire apartment in between interviews and other errands. My windows are filthy and they need to be washed so badly. I couldn't get to that this time but, when I come back, I will clean the windows in every room. Not all at once but at least one room a day.Every time I clean the apartment, I promise myself to run the chargeable vacuum every day and stay on top of dusting but, that never happens. I wish I could do it.Whenever I have to go to Ankara, I end up bringing the contents of my fridge with me. This time, I got smarter and used up pretty much all that I had. Dinner was kind of odd things thrown together but tasty and satisfying. Tomorrow, I will have breakfast at home before I hit the road. Got some leftover potatoes and I can scramble eggs. I will fill my Stanley coffee thermos and work on it on my way. Was thinking of stopping by the Starbucks on the way to  Ankara but, then I realized I needed to consume the potatoes unless I want to drag them with me. Also, Starbucks have become ridiculuosly expensive over here. Absolutely crazy. I do have some money on my Starbucks app (not enough to buy coffee) and I need to spend it before I get rid of the app. Totally unnecessary. Their regular coffee is roasted too dark that I sometimes think it is burnt. Now I need to arrange my meds, put together my computer bag and decide what to take with me to Ankara. It is colder and dryer than Istanbul. I do not want to take too much stuff with me. I have already put the keys to the Ankara apartment in my purse. It would be a disaster to drive for 4 hours and then look for a locksmith on a Sunday. As soon as I get there, I will turn on the heat and just go grocery shopping. My sister asked the cleaning lady to come on Wednesday. She has breakfast and lunch and uncle and I will be staying for at least 10 days so, we need food.Here is a question: Do you ever get obsessed with something for a while and then move on to something else? I was obsessed with audiobooks for several weeks up until last month. Now I am obsessed with YouTube Channels on frugality, home cooking and simple living. I still listen to audiobooks but, mainly to fall asleep.All these things that I watch make me want to declutter more and more at home. I think my number one goal in 2023 will be that. I have done a lot this year but, I know for sure there is more that can be parted with.Hope you are having a nice weekend."},
{"title": "Phewww!", "date": "Friday, December 2, 2022", "text": "I have a very nice Dunlop Treadmill. I got it from a friend for free and I occasionally use it, mostly in winter. It is in my guest bedroom. Today, as I was dusting, I noticed that it wasn't working. What? Bummer. It is an old model and who knows how to get it serviced. I have no documents for it. I plugged it in and out a few times to no avail. I was quite bummed about it. Mixed thoughts occupied my mind for a good half hour. Get rid of it? Try a repair service? Surely, a threadmill is not something I would spend my hard earned money on. It was nice to have a gently used one for free. Real nice and sturdy ones like I have are too expensive. Then I noticed that the safety magnetthingamagic was not in it's usual place. I took it out of the cup holder and put it on it's specific spot. And voila! It is totally working fine. You cannot imagine how happy I was. To celebrate, I will start walking on it a few days a week. Covid pulled me down and made me very weak and lazy and it's time I start to exercise again.

{"title": "Closed the books on November", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2022", "text": "At the end of each month, I update my cash flow file and go over my budget. Nerdy, I know but, that is who I am. I am also currently tweaking next year's budget and financial goals. I have a bad feeling about the economy and the upcoming elections so, I am setting aside a much larger EF than I normally do. I will also be keeping some extra cash at home. Recently I have stumbled across some YouTube Envelope Budgeting videos. Some of them were really very detailed and had several envelopes for not only expenses but, also several challenges, additional savings and etc. I enjoyed watching how some people can be so diligent and organized. I wish I lived in a low inflation country i.e. less than 10%.In a country like mine, you want every single penny work hard for you. There are some hybrid bank accounts which pay a lower interest than a regular savings account but these give you the interest on a daily basis. So, withdrawals on any given day is fine. I like to keep my money in the bank and use my credit card for most of my needs and I always pay it in full. I do not ever remember not paying the full amount on the credit card. I have one mortgage on the Antalya home but since the interest rate is fixed, in this high inflation days, it gets to be a smaller burden every time my pension and my side gig salary is raised. I have 25 months to go. I can pay it now and be done with it but, it does not make financial sense. You may say that I am a pretty terrible bank customer.Savings interest rates are around 14%-22% depending on the bank and the amount of your savings. The bank where I keep my Sinking Fund/EF (I will explain in a minute) is recently offering 19% interest rate. Their regular savings account is 20% which is less than some other banks I work with. I keep my Sinking Fund/EF in this one but, use my sister's bank which offers a better rate for regular savings accounts. You may think these interest rates are awesome but, the official inflation rate is over 80% and the government is lying about it being much lower. And, against every economic theory, the president believes if the Central Bank lowers the interest rates, the inflation will go away. So, the offical interest rate is 9%. What can I say? When a d.... runs your country, anything is possible.I remember sharing that I keep my entire nest egg in USDs, Euros, Gold coins and a small amount of TL. Unlike the US, the stock market is extremely volatile and not deep enough in here. We do not have many of the retirement tools my American friends have. It is really hard to keep an eye on your money and not let inflation eat most of it. However, no matter what you do, you do lose some of it due to inflation and low interest rates. Now, why do I have one account for both my sinking fund and emergency fund? Well, simply because, the bank allows you to set up only one account that pays the daily interest which is actually called the nightly interest :)Also, my EF is rather small. It does not have enough to cover for 3-6-12 months of living expenses. Why? Because, I am retired with a couple of part-time gigs only. So, I have a pension and some variable income. Unless a real big thing happens like war or the country collapsing, I will have my pension every month. Therefore, keeping a big EF does not make sense anymore. My EF is there only for extra healthcare costs, some big appliance replacement or an unexpected car break down and such. I am eligible for the social security healthcare which covers a fraction of private hospital visits. I have additional health insurance to cover surgeries, hospital stays and some imaging requirements. Even so, there are out of pocket costs. For instance I took my Covid test at a private hospital and it was totally out of pocket. I could have gone to a state hospital, stay in line for a long time in the middle of sick people and it would have been for free. Sometimes our choices cost us and it's OK. In this climate of economic fog and unpredictability, I am trying to do my best and still make the best of life since I am long past the mid point of my life span. Gotta go and start cleaning. Beware dust bunnies! Here I come fully armed with all sorts of equipment. Resistance is futile!"},

For us, it sounded like they were making a big deal of something miniscule. While I was working full time, I would eat out most of the time and cooking was just a hobby which pleased me.First, due to the pandemic and nowadays, due to the crazy inflation rate over here in this country, eating out has become more of a treat than a normal thing.I like to cook and I had been making and enjoying a good variety of food from scratch until very recently.Lately, I have been having difficulty to name what to make for lunch and dinner. I made a dent in the freezer meals last week but, then I found myself having the same conundrum as my mom and grandma.: Name a dish! I feel stuck. Where is my muse?Yesterday, I honestly couldn't decide on what to get for protein. The cuts of meat at the store that I went to did not appeal to me. I recently ate all the frozen roast chicken that I had made few weeks ago. Had meat patties I made while I was sick. I have two avocados and some string beans in my fridge. Fajitas may be? Grean bean casserole and chicken?  I can soak chick peas to add to my salads. I think I must get some meat tomorrow. And fish too. Sigh..."},

I was going to get tested again today but, a few friends who had Covid before, told me to hold it for another few days. Apparently, although they felt fine, even a week after the manadatory isolation period was over, they still tested positive.It is not like, I have to go, so I just postponed my trip. Of course, now I need more groceries. Oh well...Wishing everyone a happy and healthy week!"},
{"title": "First Day Out", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2022", "text": "I have been home for 9 consecutive days due to COVID and today I finally went out. I was supposed to do a bunch of things but I changed my plans. I will take a COVID test on Monday and if it is negative, I will go to Ankara. I need to get my tires changed and stored for the winter. The weather is warm enough nowadays but, I am sure there will be snow on the mountain pass on my way. Better do it now than later.I also need to bring the gifts I brought for my cousins from the US. There is a huge bunch of yarn I found at mom's apartment. I can't knit well. I was hoping to learn and get better at it but, I lack the patience. I wll bring them to my cousin who crochets (or crochetes?) real well. If she doesn't like the yarn, I am sure she can find someone to give them to. My sister asked me to take her car that they keep in Ankara for Inspection and also to get the cleanng lady so that the apartments can be cleaned thoroughly. There is an inspection station on the way to the cemetery so, I will do that and visit mom and dad on the same day. I miss my parents so much these days. I have been having dreams with mom lately. Good dreams in which we are either traveling or laughing at something together. So, today I went out, got some cash from an ATM and hit the farmer's market just to buy a few things I need till next Tuesday. I also hit the grocery store for a few things and came back home. My legs wanted to walk but, I felt tired rather quickly. I guess, I need to start exercising lightly and start building up my strength.It felt good to be out in the fresh air. I think I will go out for a short, slow walk tomorrow in the neighborhood.Wishing everyone a nice and relaxing weekend.I just put the groceries which need to be refrigerated in the fridge. I will attend to the rest after I type this, finish my coffee and relax a little bit. Then, I will fold and put away some laundry.It is 65℉ today so, I was comfortable with a cotton sweater and a vest."},

As of yesterday, my self-isolation period is over. I still have some nasal congestion but, I feel a lot better now. I am going to get tested on Monday.I do have some cabin fever but, I decided to go out for the first time after testing positive, on Friday. Need to get cash first and then head to the open farmers market to buy fresh vegetables and salad greens. They last so much longer than the grocery bought ones. I am also thinking of hitting the fish market after that. It shows heavy rain showers on Friday but, once the hourly forecast becomes available, I am sure I can manage to buy my fresh vegetables and fruits. This reminds me that I need to check out my fridge and use up whatever is on hand. The fridge needs a good and thorough cleaning but, I am not sure if I am up for it yet. A quick clean up will have to suffice.I changed my sheets and did 4 loads of laundry and hung them so, my energy is up significantly. I think, I will do some much needed cleaning on Monday. Nothing fancy. Just dust, vacuum and mop. No windows or balcony. I keep my bathroom clean whether I'm sick or well.Cooking from scratch and eating at home has a side effect of having to run the dishwasher on a daily basis. I also handwash my good knives, salad spinner, French Press and some kitchen gadgets and yet, it is so hard to keep up with the dishes piling up in the sink which I hate. And don't get me started on having to wipe the countertops and the stove sveral times a day. If I don't do this, it gets out of hand so quickly.I had a portion of chicken francese in the freezer and I had that for lunch over some linguine. Tonight's dinner will be some meat patties served with steamed broccoli salad. I steam the broccoli just a little and dump them in cold water. I then make a salad dressing with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and garlic. I pour this over the broccoli. Yummy and healthy.Hope everyone is well and healthy. That's all that matters."},

I have no sense of smell, I get tired easily and I have some nasal congestion but, other than those, I am OK. I took a COVID test the Monday before last and it came back negative. However, I lost my sense of smell the following Wednesday. I kept postponing a COVID test because I pretty much knew at that point that I had it. On my family's insistence, I took another COVID test and that came back positive as expected.I am sorry since I have not been following blogs and writing answers to comments on my previous post. First few days, I was sick like I had a major bout of regular flu so, I slept a lot and just watched TV.The apartment needs a good dusting, vacuuming and mopping but, I get tired easily and I do not feel like tackling that job. I took my Dyson out so that I can spot vacuum when I have to. I ordered groceries from two separate stores because none carried everything that I needed. However, I am still short on some things since, by the time they started filling my order, they were out of some stuff. Whatever, nothing I can't live without.I hope, once the isolation period is over, I will test negative and my sense of smell will be back.Wishing everyone a healthy and happy Holiday Season!"},

I decided to have a vegetarian meal and soaked some green lentils. Thankfully, they do not need to be soaked overnight. Tomorrow night, I think, a big salad for dinner will suffice since, the salad greens need to be consumed. May be Thursday is a good day to make the pot pie and the bread. SIS and BIL's friend is doing better. I don't know when she is going to start the chemo. Must be soon I guess. Today, the management office sent our monthly bill and I was shocked to see my hot water line. It was seven times more than what I usually get. I immediately called them to have them check my meter again.  Of course, they made a mistake. I am glad, I check my bills carefully. Hope, you are having a good week."},
{"title": "Busy Weekend", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2022", "text": "SIS and BIL came past midnight on Friday. Despite the fatigue, they woke up early in the morning and went to see their friend who was going to have surgery. SIS and BIL are friends with this couple since they went to the banking school together. They are really nice people who always showed up to support us when we had health issues and deaths in the family over the past 27 years.Their friend F (the wife) was so pleased to see them before she was taken to the operating room. SIS and BIL came back and we had brunch at their favorite place right where I live. Then we decided to go in a couple of stores before we checked to see if the surgery was over. As soon as we went in the first store, M (the husband) called to say that the surgery was almost over but, it was worse than the doctor had expected. They even had to take 80% of her intestines and gave her a colostomy which hopefully will be temporary. I realized that they were anxious to go back to the hospital to support M so, I suggested that we should all go.I got to meet F's older sister who was a nervous wreck. We bonded immediately being older sisters and I tried to comfort her a bit. We spent quiet a while at the hospital so that F's big sister could go in the ICU for a few minutes to see her sister. We had coffee and another couple joined us for a while longer.It was even past dinner time when we finally came out of the hospital so, I took SIS and BIL to a very nice fish restaurant dating back to my birth year, 1967. I had never taken them there before because, they rarely come to Istanbul and also, it is on the European side far from my home. As always, it was awesome.This morning, I let them sleep in a little, while I prepared breakfast. We all chilled after breakfast and around 2.p.m.  they left for the hospital yet again to see their friend M before they hit the road. As I am typing this, they probably have another hour to drive.I finally popped my roaster in the oven late in the afternoon and had a nice dinner. The bird yielded enough meat for two nice meals, two sandwiches, a chicken pot pie and some breast meat for chicken salad. The carcass is on the stove for stock. I am having a repeat of today's dinner tomorrow and chicken pot pie on Tuesday and leftover CPP on Wednesday. Too many chicken dinners in a row but it's OK.I am going to wash the bed sheets and towels my SIS and BIL used, tomorrow. I also need to run the vacuum again.I have been contemplating about buying a robot vac but, I am not sure. Does anybody have one? If you do, what kind/brand do you have and do you like it?"},

She is one of the kindest people I know. We used to be co-workers back in the 90's and remained friends all these years. She is an avid knitter and I love her color and design choices. Today my BFF in the US (I am gonna call her M), is going to have an eyelid surgery. She told me she would be in and out of the hospital today. In a few hours, I will call her to see how she is feeling. Today is pretty windy but, I have chores to take care of. So, as soon as I type this, I am jumping in my car. Tonight's dinner will be a big salad with the last of the steak I bought last week. I am planning to go to the farmers market on Friday so, I will be eating out of my freezer till then. I am planning to make hot wings for tomorrow night with roasted sweet potatoes. I am also planning to make bread tomorrow following a recipe on a website that Bobbie, one of my commenters, recommended. That website has plenty of recipes I may want to try."},
{"title": "Things I can't understand", "date": "Sunday, October 9, 2022", "text": "I think, I am a bit too sensitive when it comes to family. Having lost my dad when I was only 27 and then having lost mom on my birthday two years ago were the most traumatic events of my life. There is not a single day that I do not think about them. I dote on my SIS, her husband and deeply care about Uncle and my two cousins. Their health and well being are important to me.I sometimes envy my peers whose parents are still alive. Yes, I know some of them are struggling with their care and their ailments but, I still do envy them.I have talked about an old couple who were my mom and dad's friends from my childhood neighborhood on this blog before. Whenever I am in Ankara, I always go visit, take the lady out to run errands and when I'm home, I call them regularly to see how they are doing. The gentleman is bed ridden. They had lost their older son and their younger son lives in the UK. He had a heart problem, the doctors put a couple of stents in his arteries and he told his parents that the doctor forbade him to travel. Mom had stents put in and we traveled like crazy so, I did not quite get that.  Besides, he is a musician and he plays at bars and clubs. This was almost two years ago and the pandemic also made it hard to travel so, he could never come visit his parents during this time. Or, so we thought. I just recently found out that he and his wife did come to Turkey for a vacation a month or so ago and did not tell his family. Apparently, since his parents live in the suburbs, it is inconvenient for him to go visit them without a car but, he had no problems visiting some vacation spots during his visit.I hope, his parents never find out about this because they will be so heartbroken. I do not get this. I have known these people all my life and his parents were as attentive and as dedicated as my parents were. We grew up in the same neighborhood. Went to similar schools if not the same. I know for a fact that, his parents never laid a hand on either of the two brothers and were always loving parents.I understand some people may have been mistreated or even abused when they were children and if they do not treat their families well when they become adults, I can symphatise with that. In fact, there was this one neighbor who used to beat the crap out of his son in our apartment building and my mom had to intervene and save the boy from his father on several occasions. That guy turned out to be a very decent man and has a wonderful family of his own. And surprisingly, he treated his parents with respect despite his dad's oddities.The world is a weird place and people are just odd I guess.Today, I set things straight in my home, baked a bread with this recipe which I found through Acre Homestead on YouTube. I watch the owner of the channel preserve, prepare, bake and garden with awe. I don't have to worry about meals till Friday so, I will take the opportunity to clean my home, go see my eye doctor and get together with a friend this week. My SIS and BIL are coming to visit over the weekend. They are best friends with this couple and the young woman will have an important surgery on Tuesday. They have always been there for my SIS and BIL with every hardship they had so, it is important for them to come visit as well.I hope everyone is having a nice weekend."},
{"title": "Must be getting old...", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2022", "text": "Today I decided to do some shopping and cook up a few dishes so that, I will not have to think about cooking during the coming 4-5 days.I bought two steaks, some chopped meat, tomatoes, peppers, string beans and a quarter of a cabbage. Cabbages were GI-GAN-TIC! I am glad they were also selling quarters and halves. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.As soon as I got home, I attacked the cabbage. Separated enough leaves to stuff and roll for dinner. Chopped some finely for cole slaw and chopped the rest to cook. I also chopped enough onions for all the recipes.I prepared my meat and rice mixture and stuffed the cabbage rolls and started cooking this for dinner. Then I stuffed the tomatoes and peppers and also put them on the stove. I prepared the green beans , took out some previously cooked chopped meat from the freezer, sauteed some onions, added a spoonful of tomato paste and put them all together in the pressure cooker. It was time for dinner and by that time the cabbage rolls were done. I sat down and OMG! it was the worst cabbage rolls I have ever eaten! Guess what? I forgot to add salt to the meat mixture and forgot to add oil. I ate them anyway but now I know my tomatoes and peppers will be terrible too. Sigh... I guess I will need to salt them when I am eating them.When the beans were cooked and the pressure cooker became available I cooked the rest of the cabbage with some rice, sauteed onions and a generous amount of crushed red pepper. At least that turned out to have enough oil and salt. Anyway, I now have enough food for the next few days. Mission is somewhat accomplished."},
{"title": "Ordinary but sad Monday....", "date": "Monday, October 3, 2022", "text": "I have been devastated by the news about a man who was 10 years my junior from my High School. He was a guitar player and a soloist working at this club/bar for years. Last Saturday night, he had been ambushed by three men bearing broken glasses. Why? Because, he did not know the words to a song requested by these killers. Unfortunately, he died within hours leaving beahind a 5 year old little girl. I am so sorry about this. It is a rare occasion that I shed tears after people I do not personally know but this time, I just cannot hold back the tears. The Alumni of my HS are furious. The Police arrested the three guys and we are skeptical that justice will be served because two of them work for a Government Ministry and one works for a prominent Defence Contractor. These people possibly will be protected by the supporters of this current atrocious government. Laws do not apply to them. We shall see.So, I guess, we should be thankful for every single day that we are breathing and our loved ones are fine. Life goes on, so today I went to IKEA for a couple of things I needed. I did not buy anything that was cute and totally unnecessary. For a moment I was tempted to buy some tea lights but, then remembered, I still have a bunch of them somewhere.I went into the grocery store, got fish for tomorrow night's dinner, went to the Pharmacy because they owed me a couple of meds from last week and got back my jeans which needed hemming from the tailor.I had been considering to empty out my sideboard to see if there were anything that I could get rid of and yes! I found three nesting bowls which need to washed by hand, a cheeseboard, a picture frame and an old manual blood pressure monitor that no longer works. I got rid of them immediately. I also found a bunch of tablecloths which do not fit my two tables. I asked my SIS and Uncle to send me the measurements of their tables before I give them away. And sure enough, I found the tea lights.I have quite a stash of  kitchen towels and linens I bought from the US during my travels. Needless to say, they are all sunflower themed. The ones being currently used are still in good shape so, these will be put back on the shelves till they will be needed. I used to display lots of pictures of my family but, lately I decided that I do not want to look at them. There are more deceased people than living. For the moment, they upset me so, I have boxed them up and put them away till I feel differently."},

The Pharmacy is in the same building so, I was able to get my meds. I then walked into the small grocery store and got hamburger patties. I could have just bought the meat and made my own patties but, honestly a little convenience felt right. I actually wish there were more convenience foods or ready made meals like in the US. I am craving pot stickers but, I have to make them from scratch. One of these days I will try it. Asian food is very expensive here in this country. I made a vegetable soup with some chicken stock. I had some leftover rice and had a bowl of that for lunch. For dinner, I made a cheeseburger with oven fried sweet potatoes. Honestly, just the burger would be enough. I have another bun to make another burger tomorrow.How many times do you wipe your kitchen counters every day? I swear, I lost count. My mom had warned me about the black countertops but, of course, I did not listen. I still have about half of the big bag of mixed veggies in the freezer. It is taking up a lot of precious space. I don't think I will buy such a big bag again. I am still sorting through my clothes. It is taking more time than usual because I still get a bit dizzy.Hopefully, I will feel 100% by the beginning of next week and will be able to dust, vacuum and mop the floors. Windows need washing too but, they will have to wait. Wishing everyone a nice and relaxing weekend."},

I then calmed myself down and finally the world stopped spinning gradually. I took my pillow and went to the recliner. I took a pill that helps and fell asleep till late morning. Today, I am spending most of my time in the recliner and walking like a badly constructed robot when I have to prepare food or go to the bathroom. Sigh...Hope everyone is having a better day than I am."},
{"title": "When you think long and hard enough...", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2022", "text": "Lately, I have been thinking about getting rid of old comforters and buying new ones. I am also pretty tired of the sheet sets that I have. I kept checking a few online stores to see what they had. Sizes are pretty standard with the exception of IKEA comforters. I have two thin ones which are perfect to use these days but, the standard duvet covers are too big for them. I was thinking of getting IKEA covers but, it just dawned on me that, mom probably had those. She also had a bunch of bed linens still in their packages. So, I have decided to swap some of my bed linens with the ones in the Ankara home. I shall ask my sister if that is OK with her but, I am sure it is. Mom had plenty of comforters too. So, next time I am in Ankara, I will check those out as well before I buy anything new. I usually make quick decisions but, this time it took me a long time and I arrived at a frugal solution.My house guest gifted me a TV blanket but told me to exchange it with whatever I would like. She gave me the gift card. I have TV blankets coming out of my ears so, I will exchange it for something else that I need. I have also been contemplating about signing up for YouTube Premium for a while. I finally decided that it is worthwhile to do so, because the frequency and length of commercials were getting ridiculuous. I like to listen to audio books, old radio shows in bed so, it made a lot of sense to sign up for it. I signed up for the whole year saving me two months.I have decided to make a chicken and veggie casserole and an Asian imitation soup tomorrow. I will also go out for a long walk in the neighborhood (I hope). On Wednesday I will work half a day for the medical association I consult for.I am being lazy when I am on my own so, I should make a list of chores and exercise.

On Thursday we got together with two College mates. One lives in the US. She is originally from Pakistan. It had been 32 years since I had seen her but, we found tons to talk about. We met around 3 p.m. and by the time we said goodbye, it was 9 p.m. My friend left on Friday.After dropping her off at the train station, I went to a farmers market and bought some tomatoes and eggplants. I have run the tomatoes through my food processor and froze them. I had bought 6 big eggplants and halved them. I brushed them with olive oil and baked them. I am going to stuff them with sauteed chopped meat and freeze them for easy meals in winter. I hope, I can fit everything. My small freezer section is almost full. That is all my prepping for the winter.I washed all the bed linens and put the guest room back in order.I found some frozen cheese in the freezer and since I wanted to make room, I baked a pizza for dinner. I love my homemade version better than all the commercial pizzas. There is some leftover for tomorrow or the next day.I also have tons of salad fixings I need to use up and lots of frozen chicken I had roasted the week before. So, this week's meal plan is \"use what you have, don't let anything go bad\".Today I walked to the nearest grocery store since I was running out of salt, red pepper flakes, bread and milk. I could smell the Fall in the air and the low temperatures make it very pleasant these days after several weeks of scorching hot weather.Wishing everyone a nice week."},

The guy who was the pretend EJ was actually pretty good so, we enjoyed the songs. I am not going to name the other band but, they were singing Queen songs. They were so out of tone that it gave me hope for a career in the music world. It looks like even I can sing in a band touring the country. Despite being tone deaf that is.... It was absolute torture. M is a great Queen fan and she knows all the songs. At one point, we found ourselves looking at each other with eyes out of sockets trying to figure out what song they were playing. When we hear the lyrics, we were like: Really!!??We left early because I told my friends we should not wait to hear how they butcher Bohemian Rhapsody which they hadn't sang yet. In any case, we had a good time laughing.The other concert was at Bethelwoods. I always thought the Woodstock concerts of 1968 took place in Woodstock, VT. I know, silly me but, I was only 1 year old back in '68. It was the real CHICAGO! I like their music very much and the band was great. Before CHICAGO, Brian Wilson took the stage. It was a bit sad to see him using a walker but on the other hand, it was nice to hear some Beach Boys songs.Here are some pictures. All my video files are larger than what Blogger allows.

It was my favorite job and I had learnt tons of stuff and had the privilege of working with really intelligent and kind people. Sure we had our differences from time to time but, overall it was a great experience for all, that shaped our careers and put us on our paths.One of the ladies had to leave early since she needed to catch a plane for a business trip. There were two more guys to join us but, one was sick and the other could not make it. I had dinner with him and another colleague from the same company last week.We told stories from former projects and laughed a lot. I was sometimes in conflict with one of the guys because we had different perspectives but, now we are good friends because as we talked about our unique views, we now understand each other better.It rained really hard at one point but, we had a roof over our heads with the sides all open so, I was comfortable. If the dinner had been held indoors, I wouldn't go.Today, I am determined to finish laundry, hang the guest room curtains, make it ready for when my friend comes to visit, sort out my meds to see if I need more, On Monday I need to do a little shopping for gifts. I will try to take as little as possible with me.

{"title": "Things taken for granted...", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2022", "text": "Not having my washing machine working for just 2-3 days got me thinking that there are so many things that are taken for granted.My grandmother on mom's side almost always had washing machines in her married life. She was born in 1920, graduated College in 1942. She was a very frugal lady but, she loved technology and so did her husband, my grandpa. They always had a car which was a very big deal at the time in Turkey. She always had a couple of pressure cookers, a fridge, an oven and a washing machine when most people in her generation didn't. She loved her appliances and took great care of them. When they got their first washing machine, a lot of people never knew such a thing even existed. Unfortunately, I do not have the info as to what that machine was but, her second was very similar to this, but bigger:I do not know why she kept that machine but, she did, all her life. I do not remember her using anything but, an automatic Bosch front loader. She bought that machine in 1967 when I was born and back then, automatic front loading machines were unheard of in Turkey. Nor were they sold. My grandpa was an Air Force Officer so, he bought that machine from Germany directly.When I was very little, I remember that, mom had a washing lady coming home every week but that probably lasted only a couple of years. Then she got this machine:She would hook up a hose to fill the machine. It is rather simple or rather primitive and far from being practical but, beats hand washing any day.Mom didn't have a dishwasher till I was 23. She used to soap up and scrub the dishes and I would run them under water after every dinner. When I went to the US back in 1990, my company furnished apartment came with a dishwasher which I fell in love with so, I sent money back home to dad to buy her a dishwasher from me on Mother's Day. Dad had a kid in private school and was paying for an apartment so, it was not in their budget at the time.The only person in our family with a dryer is my SIS. Mom and I could certainly afford one but, our apartments did not have the space and wiring for it. Mine still doesn't.  Even today, dryers are still not as popular as they are in the US mostly due to lack of space.  I have a drying rack and when I wash my sheets, I put a line in the corridor to the back rooms. Today, as I was making a list of detergents I am running out of, these thoughts occupied my mind and I wanted to share them.There is so much we take for granted. If you look back in history, those kings and queens were very poor when compared to us. They lacked electricity and lacked everything that comes with it. They did not have proper heating in those glorious castles and palaces. Heck, they didn't even have toilets! This went on for centuries. Our comfort levels made a Quantum Leap in the last 100 years. What appliances do you remember from your childhoods?

There are home related lists, packing lists, document lists, gift lists...I am glad that Covid testing has been lifted off both by the US and the German Government. I am flying on Lufthansa with a stopover in Frankfurt. The idea of getting a Covid test within 24 hours of my flight was sort of nerve-racking. I will be wearing an N95 mask through my journey anyway and I am sort of self-quaranteening myself  till my journey. I will meet with former colleagues for dinner but, we shall be outside. (Am I sure? I better send a text to the friend who is organizing it to see if it is outdoors or not).Luckily, the washing machine is fixed. It was such an easy fix that I am embarassed for not having tried it. I had seen some YouTube videos with taking the back cover off and taking pieces apart. I was afraid to do those but the guy who came opened a very easy place and pulled the clogging stuff. 2 minutes! Now the washer is running empty as per his recommendation before I start doing laundry. My bedroom curtains and clothing items are on top of the list. I need to sort the laundry which I had piled up in my guest room so, I can prioritize the wash.I pulled a small package of navy beans I had frozen. Tonight, there will be rice and beans. I think, there will be some leftovers for a Mexican style wrap tomorrow. I am trying to use up what's on hand rather than buying groceries. I do not want to throw away anything so, I will be extremely cautious if I need to buy anything.At the moment my home looks very neat and tidy. I do not think I will be putting the accesories back in place. Let them stay in their boxes. I am so glad I pulled the trigger and had my home painted. Here are the before and after pictures of the repairs:"},

I washed mom's old prayer rug to donate but it fell apart during the wash cycle.  Hopefully, tomorrow my machine will be fixed. It is an 11 year old Samsung. I have tons of laundry including all my curtains. I have been gradually putting things in place since Saturday. There is still a slight odor because of the door frames. The paint they use on those could not be water based. Therefore, it is stinky. I placed baking soda and vinegar in plates in all the rooms but, so far, they are not working as much as I thought they would.Today, I took dad's cousin F to a small town where she used to have a small farm which she had to sell because of her stepson. She needed to run an errand. Then, we visited two vineyards. I bought 4 bottles, she got 30 bottles. That part of the family can drink. I dropped her off at her apartment and came home. Tonight is the first night I will be staying at home since the paint started. I am going to cover my windows with paper tonight. Hopefully, tomorrow I will be able to wash the curtains and hang them up.It has been quiet busy lately and I have only 9 days left to go on my vacation. Usually, I would be excited in anticipation of that but, I am so tired. On Thursday, I will be having dinner with a bunch of former colleagues. After that, I will not be socializing. I will be packing and resting till my flight.Lately we have been having thunder showers and hail storms. Since I will be gone for over 45 days, I want to park my car in a closed garage. F has an agreement with a hotel near her apartment and she negotiated on my behalf with the parking garage manager. They gave me a good price and I shall be leaving my car there and take a cab to the airport.Gotta go and cover my windows.Hope you are having a great week!"},

The paint was lighter than I expected but, it looks really good. They suggested to apply a coat of varnish on the doors which I accepted. It will all be done by today afternoon. I will go and air the apartment on Friday.The cleaning lady I wanted to hire for the job was only available on Saturday but, she suggested to bring another person with her. Although my home will be ready on Saturday, I will go back on Monday night. Dad's cousin F has some errands to run and I will help her with them.Last night we went to the Opera, Falstaff by Verdi. It was OK, but I'm not a fan of the opera except for some well known ones like Carmen, Aida, Il Travotore, La Traviata and etc. I'm more a classial concert person. However, I was glad to see the renewed opera house. Modern, clean building with lots of space for coffee shops, libraries, and exhibits. F is getting her second cataracts procedure as I type this.  Tomorrow night we shall go and stay at her late mom's apartment. She will meet up with friends during the weekend and so will I.  I will also supervise the cleaning.This year the weather is really strange. We are getting lots of thunderstorms, hailstorms and it gets cool within a matter of minutes. Some days are extremely windy, some days it is too hot and too humid. I think, every 5 years or so, this happens.Wishing everyone smooth sailing."},
{"title": "Fresh Paint", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2022", "text": "Two painters came yesterday right on time and started to repair the areas that needed patching up. They worked from 9:00 a.m. till 5 p.m. I left them plenty of paper cups, a water heater, instant coffee, tea bags and soft drinks. I also send them lunch every day. Yesterday every part of my body was aching but, I did a pretty decent job, putting away everything. The painters appreciated that. They could immediately start covering things with plastic sheets and taping them. When I took down the frames on the walls, I realized that it was really the time for painting. I also took down the curtains and stuffed them in big garbage bags. Once the initial cleaning is done, I will wash them and hang them. So, I asked for two days of cleaning from the contractor. The first day will be just for general cleaning and washing the windows, the second will be detailed as I put everything back where they belong. I just spoke to the two painters and they said they will be able to finish latest by Thursday. I wasn't expecting that because the contractor had told me it would take till next week. I hope, they are doing a good job and not cutting corners to get to a new job.  On the other hand, the contractor might have given me a longer estimate just because he knows me well. He had re-done my bathroom and my kitchen. Anyway, if something is not right, he will fix it for me. It will just be another headache though. Come on T'pol! Think positive!I think I will have a few days to relax, enjoy my freshly painted and cleaned home before I pack my bags for my trip to the US on the 29th. Nice!Meanwhile, saving money and frugality are not on my agenda this month. I am spending quite a bit of money for extra gas, parking, food etc.  I will go back to my frugal self come September. Hope everyone is enjoying nice summer days."},

It has been a long time since these were bothering me. I was able to hide the worst two behind my curtains. It took a long time to figure out how to fix them.  After the fix, I have been told to wait a year to see if there will be more water damage. When the year was up, the pandemic hit and the paint job has been postponed.The painters are coming tomorrow. They will cover everything with plastic and then, start scraping the areas that need to be fixed. I am moving to dad's cousin tomorrow night.Please wish me luck!"},

I don't know if they hear me or not but, I told them anyway. I can't believe it's been two years since mom's passing.Then I dropped my cousin's bags and had coffee with her and her mother.I met an old co-worker who is also a good friend in the afternoon and we spent some time together. My childhood friend with whom I had a long vacation last year took me out to dinner for my birthday and by the time I got home it was 10:30 p.m. and my suitcases were still unpacked. I could not get up early today so, I hit the road after 2:30 p.m. Lots of thundershowers and wind on the way and as I was halfway through, I realized that I forgot my phone charger in Ankara. Dumb!The tunnel was closed due to road repairs so, I had to deal with more and slower traffic. As soon as I arrived in Istanbul, I ran to the nearest mall to get a new charger. I also did my grocery shopping. Walked in my apartment at 9:30 p.m. Phewww!I am so tired but, also glad to be home. I have a busy half week ahead of me. Then, the painting will start."},

We saw some beautiful sights and enjoyed the cooler air.Tomorrow is my last beach day. It is getting hot here which means, the water is getting too warm for my liking and the beach gets more crowded making it hard to read a book in peace. I am hitting the road on Friday. On the way to Ankara, I will visit a HS buddy who is a Professor at a Dental School in a smaller city. I always have coffee with him whenever I pass that city. He said he will have more time on Friday so, we will have lunch.SIS and BIL will be coming to Ankara too. I left my Saturday and Sunday morning open to be able to spend time with them. They usually hit the road in the afternoon and when they leave, I will go and have coffee with an old friend (an ex-boyfriend actually) and his wife. Monday is my birthday. I will go to the cemetery and then have dinner with a childhood friend. I am returning to Istanbul on Tuesday. I feel like a very confused migrating bird.

{"title": "Weekend Surprise", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2022", "text": "SIS and BIL decided to surprise us on Friday night and came to Antalya for the weekend. It was 2 a.m. when they made it. So, I went to my PT early in the morning yesterday and came home around 10:30 a.m. We all had breakfast at a nearby place and the three of us went to the beach. As usual uncle did not join us because he never dips his toes in the water \"this early\" in the season. You may think he goes swimming every day in August but, you would be mistaken. He just does not care for it anymore.We had a nice dinner at a place we all like. This morning we got up around 10 a.m. and had breakfast at home. SIS and BIL went to the beach and I am doing laundry. It is a very hot day and my tendinitis does not allow me to go to the pebble beach which I dislike anyway. I am sitting in the middle of all the open windows as I am typing this. There is A/C but, my family dislikes it and it bothers them. If uncle goes out as well, I will surely turn it on till they come home. Uncle just took out his guitar and started to exercise so, I guess no A/C today. Thankfully there is a breeze.My last day of  PT is Tuesday. I must say it has worked wonderfully but now, I know I have a chronic condition so, I will be most careful and wear only the best shoes and keep on doing the exercises. I am getting ready to go back to Ankara next Friday. SIS and BIL will be there too. They have some doctor's appointments and I think SIS wants to celebrate my bday which I would just rather forget. Having lost mom on the very same day still upsets me and I do not know whether I will ever get over that. I spoke to my dad's cousin. She just came back from the US visiting her niece who graduated from University of Michigan. As we were talking, I told her about the paint job at my apartment in June and she told me about her upcoming cataracts surgeries so, we decided that I should stay at her apartment during the painting. I will take her to the surgeries and help her while she is recovering. In the meantime, my apartment will be painted. I was looking for a hotel for 4-5 days but, this will help me save some money. Hopefully, I will be flying on the 29th. 5 days after I come back, my BFF will fly over to spend 10 days with me. Initially, we were thinking to fly together but her wedding anniversary got in the way. I doubt that her husband would mind but, I guess she does. This summer is surely a busy one. Who said retirement is boring?"},

The water is crisp and cold so, the locals do not go to the beaches much yet. Russian, Ukrainian, Canadian, German and British tourists and I have no problems dipping in the cold water. The only difference between us is the fact that, I hide under the shade of two beach umbrellas covered in sunscreen when they are basically frying themselves. Yesterday, it felt like summer for the first time. No breeze to ccol off so, I felt the heat and went in the water several times.I brought 5 books with me and I am about to finish the 5th one. I need at least two more books before I go back so, I will look at what my uncle has. He doesn't like novels so, I may not find anything I will enjoy. I have read the first 3 books of the Kurt Wallander series by Henning Mankell, a Swedish writer. I enjoyed them very much and then noticed a series on Netflix called the Young Wallander based on the character created by H. Mankell. I think, I will buy the rest of the books in that series.My tendinitis is getting better. I want to get gifts for my physical therapist, the doctor and the lady at the entrance to the hospital. They are really sweet and attentive. I just do not know what to get. I have the whole week to figure it out. I have 8 more days of PT. When I am in the US, I will buy myself two pairs of New Balance 993s. They are the best for my feet despite being expensive. I think, I will wear them 98% of the time to keep my orthopedic problems at bay. I have been told, my tendinitis has become a chronic condition so, I should keep doing my exercises and applying ice after every long walk. My SIS jokes that mom and dad produced offspring with mechanical and software problems. I tend to agree with her. Thankfully, our processors are so far OK.I am trying to figure out what each of us need so that I can buy them in the US. I like to come back with gifts for my family but these days, USD has become so expensive against TL that I need to choose my gifts wisely. I am afraid this may be my last trip to the US. I hope, we shall see better days if we can get rid of this asshole of a government.Today there was no PT and I decided to stay home and sleep in. I am doing my exercises and resting my feet on ice every two hours. I will also look at my financial situation and see what bills need to be paid before June. Most of the regular bills are on autopay so, it is a matter of keeping enough cash on the two accounts I use.Hope, everyone had a relaxing weekend. Wishing all a good and productive week!"},

I would like to go to Ankara on June 3rd, till June 7th. Then I will go back home. I texted the contractor reminding that I would like them to start the paint job on the week of 13th of June. In two weeks, I should be done with everything at home so that, I can start my US vacation peacefully.  May be I can finish purging the last couple of areas before painting starts. Today, I cleaned up the counter tops and cabinets of uncle's kitchen. He is generally clean but, a bit lax about thorough cleaning.I have decided on a few projects in this apartment to make it more homey than a bachelor apartment. That will require me coming here for a few weeks and sending uncle off to either my place or Ankara or may be both. I am thinking some time in April-May next year. My sister had mentioned that she wanted to do a few things as well. I also need to find a cleaning lady for him who lives nearby. If someone comes every three weeks, that will be just fine.As for help for me in Istanbul; during the painting, I will try the new cleaning lady whom my old one has recommended and if I like her, I will ask her to come regularly starting in the Fall. I really need someone every two or three weeks. More would be an unnecessary expense in these ultra expensive economic times. With that said, I am sure the cleaning ladies need jobs and the ability to feed their kids so, it is sort of a social duty too if one can afford it.A friend of mine just came back from the US. She found it extremely expensive not only due to the weakness of our money but also due to the inflation in the US. I am not going on a shopping excursion this time. I will only buy what we all truly need and what is too expensive here in Turkey. I need an extra pair of NB 990s and new jeans, uncle needs a couple of cargo shorts. I will ask my SIS and BIL what they need. SIS possibly needs a pair of new jeans too. We need long jeans which are hard to come by in our sizes over here. I have been wearing Lane Bryant jeans and have found them comfortable and durable. My tendon already started feeling better. The doctor gave me a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pill once a day for 10 days. I keep my foot elevated while I am sitting and keep applying ice for 15 minutes several times a day. The PT takes about an hour. I hope to be healed fully in a month. We'll see.Hope everyone had a relaxing weekend and wish everybody a great week ahead."},

Hopefully, I will recover before I hop on the plane to go to the US.My cousin left last Thursday. She had a great time. The water was cold and it was windy but, she still enjoyed the beach.My theraphy sessions are at 10:00 a.m. every day except Sunday so, after the PT, I am planning to go to the beach.I haven't been able to keep up with my favorite blogs lately.

I had left some beach stuff last year so, all will be gathered and packed in a larger suitcase that my SIS brought. I sent all foodstuffs to BIL's dad. This way I will not have to take them with me. Cannot stand wasting or throwing away food.We spent a good deal of time with my SIS and BIL and it was nice and filled with laughter. After they left, I called some relatives, my mom and dad's cousins. I do want to keep in touch with them but, each phone call is so depressing. They are getting old and there are serious health issues in their families. It feels like the extended family is all falling apart. So upsetting. We also talk about mom and dad of course and how early they passed away and I get teary eyed while trying to keep it from my voice. Not happy celebratory phone calls for a holiday... Well, I guess it is how life is.Gotta go and find something to cheer myself up. There are two more cousins of dad's to call but, I shall leave that for later."},

I am thinking Avengers: Infinity War. We have two more days as a family and then they will go back home on the last day of the holiday. My cousin and I are leaving the day after.

She will give them to her brother. Now that, my car and trunk are almost empty, tomorrow may be a good day to have the car washed. I need to check the weather report because, I hate it when I have my car washed and it rains the next day.I also asked my SIS today, to contact the plummer in the Ankara apartment complex since we were having some trouble with a couple of things. A super nice guy showed up right on time and quickly fixed both issues. My SIS and BIL will be coming tomorrow for the Ramadan Feast. We will get to spend some time together but, they will have things to do separately as well. I have no plans till Wednesday when I hit the road again.

I jumped in the car this morning and got them. Isn't it a simple clean look? There are only 8 things in display. So much easier to dust.I ran the vacuum and mopped the floors yesterday but, honestly, if I weren't too tired, I could have done a much better job. The contractor came and delivered the paint to be used in mid-June. I wanted to get the paint a.s.a.p because, the prices keep going up.I have been trying to eat out of the freezer and fridge lately and I must admit, I did a good job this time. Only a small cauliflower, two carrots and a container of yogurt is left and I am taking them with me. Tonight's dinner is pizza, to use up the last bit of the cheese and the tomato sauce.I took out most of the things I will put in my suitcase with the exception of my meds, computer, cables and etc. After I type and post this, I will go and pack. I want to have a relaxed dinner and night knowing that all is done.My uncle told me to get tablecloths for the table on his balcony. I asked him the dimensions and he had no clue. Lol! Why are men like this? I told him to measure it and get back to me. I took out two from my stash which do not fit my table. I guess mom had bought them for me but, they are rectangular and my table is round, oval when opened. They do not fit my table open or closed. I am hoping, they will fit his table. If not, I will get him new ones. I think, I will leave some of my beach stuff in Antalya this time. On Thursday, I will have my winter tires changed, pick up my new glasses and hopefully get my car washed. On Friday, I will do a little shopping since SIS and BIL will be coming for the Ramadan Feast which starts on Sunday. The day after the holiday, my cousin and I will be heading for Antalya. Uncle will be having her two nieces one from his late sister's side, other from his late brother's. Cousin will fly back home on the 12th."},

I opened the box for the door and I found out that there are no hinges. Yup! They sell a door without it's hinges and none of the people warned me about it. On top of that, they are all out of hinges. I have checked stocks of all IKEA stores and none of them has hinges in stock. How stupid is this? So, my project will remain unfinished just because of a stupid supply chain issue. UGH!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since I have only two more days before I go on my vacation, I am trying to get the house clean.I am done re-organizing my bedroom and the guest room. After I post this, I will go clean up the bathroom cabinets. I have tossed few more items as I was re-arranging the closets. I found a lot of hangers from the dry cleaners by me. I am taking them to the guy who owns the place. Since I do not work, I rarely need dry cleaning nowadays but, every hanger is a cost to him. So, I am thinking he will be glad to get 25 free hangers. Another thing re-cycled and re-used. BTW, the hangers are not the wire type ones. They are mostly plastic. So, this will be a tiny help for the landfills.My sister and I were talking about doing some improvement at my uncle's home this year. I mentioned that I had a bunch of extra sheets that I no longer want and she told me to bring them to Ankara and give them to her FIL's caregiver. My trunk is already full before I even put my own suitcase in there.Today, I need to be done with the TV bench and the bathroom cabinets, make my packing list.Tomorrow, I need to dust, wash the windows from the inside and pack everything that I would like to take with me first to Ankara, then to Antalya. On Tuesday, I will run the big vacuum cleaner all around the house, mop the floors and clean the fridge. So far, my quest to purge was successful thanks to my readers who cheered and motivated me. Once I am done with the cleaning, I will post some pictures. Yesterday I had to go to some hospital at the other end of the city for my part time gig with the medical association. On the way back, I dropped by my friend who owns the headhunting business. I gave her the air mattress and the laptop she had given me. I had given up using that long time ago because, it has a slow mouse. I could not fix that problem and it was driving me crazy. My old beloved laptop is still fine.I ended up staying for dinner and I had a nice time with her and her husband. For now, I am done with ethe work but, I will go back to pick up a couple of positions in the Fall. Fall and Winter are good times to work. Although annoying, that gig gives me a purpose and a bit of money.Last evening, I received a text from one of my High School friends saying that another friend was in town and they would be having breakfast at the restaurant run by the Culinary Arts Academy of  Istanbul at the Sakip Sabanci Museum. They were able to get a reservation for 9 a.m. and asked me if I wanted to join them. I happily accepted. Two more friends joined us and the five of us had a great time. After days of purging and working hard, these two get togethers were a welcome change of pace. It was a beautiful day, partly cloudy but nice.I rushed home by noon time to meet the contractor for the paint job estimate. He is a nice guy and it was nice to meet him again. He had done a great job when I redid my bathroom and kitchen. In the afternoon, I only did a load of laundry, shifted just a few things around and napped. So, not much was accomplished today. Tomorrow, I am starting the big clean-up. I have decided to wash the windows only from the inside because, I will not be home for a long time and I am sure it will rain several times making a mess with all the pollen.I am not done with the TV bench yet. I have figured out a way to hide the cables better so, I will do some minimal dismantling. Decided to go to Ankara on Wednesday. I made dinner and used up all the chopped meat in the freezer. I have leftovers for tomorrow too. I think, I will be able to use up all that can go bad before I leave. If I can't, they are coming with me.Hope everyone is having a great spring weekend."},

I am sure, I can let go some more but, the reclaimed spaces yesterday was sufficient and I was tired. Honestly, I could not remember some of the books and want to read them again. SIS thought he had my dad's matchbox collection but, no, I have that. I told her I could give the collection to her and she agreed. I will take that to Ankara and leave it there for her.Today the apartment looks worse but I know, I am getting there.The trip to the other IKEA went well and I got everything I thought I needed. Today I started putting the new TV bench together. It looks like I needed 6 legs but I bought 4. I gotta go back to get two more. No big deal. Putting together this unit is easy because there are no drawers, just two doors and shelves.I re-arranged and changed places of a few things. I am pretty happy with the bookcases. I want to clean the two back rooms and the bathroom thoroughly over the weekend. I do not think I have enough time to deal with the buffet/sideboard. However, that is going to be relatively easy. The contractor will come to give me an estimate on the paint job and we shall decide on a date in June.I am waiting for the guys to come and pick up the old TV unit. If they do not show up till 5 p.m., I will just push it outside my door and leave it there. Because, I have to go to IKEA to get those legs.I took a short break to write these.

I always have to come running back.  I started taking my phone with me everywhere at home just because, I know it will if I don't. And here is another one: Whenever I am on the phone with someone, someone or sometimes more than one person tries calling me. I can hear the call in the background. Then I will have to call back. Why do people have to call me at the same time? Is it just me? Or does anyone have the same problem?Today I attacked the bookcases. First I carried the magazine holders to my car as I had planned. That cleared two shelves. It has always been my dream to have things grouped and stored properly. Today, I finally managed that with certain things. My travel books, cookbooks and personal finance books are all grouped together. I will pull all travel items like baggage tags, travel pillows, locks and etc and put them in one box. I also pulled all my photo albums, photos that are in boxes and envelopes together and put them in one huge box. I would've loved to digitize them and get rid of the physical ones but, the scanner I bought was not great in scanning printed pictures. It did work wonders with the dia-positives though.I set aside quiet a few books that I would like to give away. I am also giving an air mattres that I never used, to a friend. Her daughter is going to Med school in Belgium and she has a very small apartment. My friend had mentioned that the air mattress she had for guests was no longer in usable condition. Remembering that I asked her if she still needed one and she has happily accepted. I am glad some of my things are finding their way to people who will actually use them.I cancelled the IKEA order because it looked like they would not be able to deliver. There are two IKEAs not too far from me. The one closest did not carry most of the parts but, today I decided to check the other and they show everything I need in stock. As soon as I finish this post I will go get the TV bench. Then, I will finish what I have started today. I am hoping to be done by all purging by Friday. I will deep clean my home before I leave for vacation. Hope you are having a nice and productive day!"},

I do not care the weather is still miserable. In my book Spring has sprung so, the warm clothes are now in their storage boxes. It took me close to an hour to do it all. Happy camper over here!- Sewed some loose buttons before storing the items for winter.- Put my kitchen in order (which lasts only a few hours)- Tossed a few bottles of expired cosmetics. Bathroom cabinets are down at the bottom of my list but, since I saw them, I just got rid of them.- Finally, I made myself a screwdriver and it was a bit heavy on the screw side of it. Lol! Feeling relaxed and a bit tipsy because, I normally do not drink anything heavier than red wine and an occasional beer.Here is a picture of the bed with everything dumped on it:Tomorrow, I am attacking a box and the books. Will also carry all the magazine holders to my car. This way, when I am done with the books, I will be done with the whole library.I also need to take an inventory of the food at home. I am planning to leave on Wednesday or Thursday next week so, I have to make sure I use up all that I got. I do not like to drag a bag of groceries along with my suitcases to Ankara. It was a busy and productive day. Take care!"},

They did not have most of the items to assemble my TV unit. The funniest thing is that same parts can be ordered online, to be shipped within two days (if you believe that). I guess all three stores and the online store manage their own iventory and do not transfer parts to each other.. Interesting.I ordered the parts online and hopefully, they will be here some time this week.The shoes are dropped at the nearest charity box. I haven't started with the books yet. I will start with clothes first but I am sure, there is not much to donate after the big purge last year. At least I will put away some warm clothes. Tomorrow, I will meet with the guy who will take the CDs and that will be a relief.I did not get much done today. The weather affects my mood I guess. Hoever, I did identify more than 3 things to purge. Hope, the weather gets better.Have a great week everyone!"},
{"title": "Keep on purging", "date": "Sunday, April 17, 2022", "text": "It was time to say goodbye to a 32 year old Walkman I had been holding on to for who knows why. Along with that, a bunch of casettes, an old camera, some old phone chargers, cables that I no longer need and an old phone found their way in a bag which will be taken to the electronics re-cycle box tomorrw by yours truly.I also got rid of receipts, some junk that was taking up space, a pair of ski pants and two tablecloths.A friend of a friend who collects music CDs will take my CDs. I am going to have to take them to him because, he does not have a car but, luckily he lives not too far from me.Also, I reached out to a childhood friend and asked him if would like to take my father's History magazines back from the 60's and 70's. I had them forever and never lifted a cover. He is getting his PhD on History and he is a collector. I do not have a sentimental attachment to those. I have dad' model ships, matchbox collection and some ceramics he painted and best of all fond memories. So, if a history enthusiast will read the magazines or use them as references, I will be happy and this will save me two shelves of my library.I will sort through the books again and will donate the ones I do not wish to keep. I am thinking at least two more shelves to free. I contacted my contractor for the apartment to be painted in June. He will come some time next week to give me an estimate. I will not wash the curtains before the paint job.I am glad I started decluttering and purging. A fresh coat of paint will be the cherry on top when I am done. It sounds like a lot but honestly, I did not spend hours on this. It was a relaxing and productive weekend. I hope to get up early tomorrow and go to IKEA for the new TV bench. Can't wait to get rid of the old one especially now that it looks empty. Haha!HAPPY EASTER to those who celebrate!"},
{"title": "Purge Purge Purge!", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2022", "text": "As of today, all the stuff in the picture I posted yesterday are gone.The ironing board and some other decorative items are also gone.There are some items that will indefinitely stay with me and here are some examples:My dad had put together the model ships on display here. So, they will forever be with me along with the framed puzzles mom made. Also, I am a big fan of sunflowers so, everything I own with sunflowers are not going anywhere.I called the manager of the apartment complex and asked his help for things that can be of use to someone. Here are the pictures of things that are gone in addition to the picture I posted yesterday:The wooden boat was already broken so, that went into re-cycling. Shoes in the blue bag will be placed in a donation box a block away. The infamous ironing board is gone.along with the glass bowl and the weird flowery decorative item. There was a vase that came with it which houses my sunflowers. That stays.I walked to the two tennis courts by me and checked out if there was a tennis instructor. Luckily, there was a guy giving tennis lessons and I asked him if he would like two rackets for free. He happily accepted and I walked back to the apartment, brought the rackets to him and there! Two more items! Whohooo! Now I gotta find a skiing instructor.As you can see there are no rugs on the floors in my apartment.. Thanks to my allergies, I had to get rid of them few years ago. Makes cleaning so much easier (if I get to doing it). It looks like I will be able to get rid of the big TV unit and get something small and more practical/useful. So, that is next on my list. However, I have to find the replacement first. This has been on my mind forever. I looked up IKEA and there is a reasonable-ish TV bench that I liked. Tomorrow, I may go to IKEA to pick it up. It is an easy unit for me to put together. There are inexpensive alternatives elsewhere but, the colors don't go with my living room. I feel very liberated. My friend M said, it must have felt like burning the bras. Lol! Very revolutionary indeed. I gotta tell you that this purging business is messy. Things get scattered around. So, I will be cleaning the closet at the entrance today and now that I have freed some shelves from shoe boxes, I may make use of those shelves to put away things that have been taking space in my living room. A pair of dumbbells, my med bag, a box that houses three drawers where I keep my stationary and printer paper comes to mind.Gotta go and take care of the closet."},
{"title": "Facebook Marketplace? Not a chance!", "date": "Friday, April 15, 2022", "text": "Thank you all for supporting me in my quest to make my home a more livable place with lots of breathing room.After yesterday's post and after receiving encouraging comments from you, I immediately started my \"purging three things a day\" project, started gathering stuff that caught my eye and listed a mini music set on Facebook Marketplace. I took pictures of the set and posted it saying that it is only available for pick-up from a certain point (definitely not my apartment complex) in my area.8 or 9 people showed interest and one said he wanted to come pick it up right away but asked for a discount. I said if the set did not sell at full price till tonight, I would consider his offer. Then, something compelled me to check out this guy's profile and I just ended up blocking him. Fanatical religious fundamentalism is something I stay clear of. I went to my Facebook settings and upped my security. Someone else said, he will pick up the set at the place I specified today and upon checking his profile, I am selling it to him. And no more marketplace for me again! (But of course, as I write this that guy decided to make it 5:30 p.m. instead of our agreed upon time. Ugh! If he doesn't show up then, I am just putting this darn set in the re-cycling area)..I need to find donation boxes and places rather than deal with people I do not know.As for the guy who is going to pick up my music set, I am meeting him by the mini mall by me, right in front of my Pharmacy where everybody knows me since 2004. There is another exit so, I will make sure, I cannot be followed. May be I am being too much of a chicken but you never know.Yesterday, I took out some of the stuff in the below picture that I would like to part with:Two old wallets, a porcelain box for trinkets, an ash tray and 4 egg holders I never use. A ceramic creamer. A vase and it's ceramic base. 4 Turkish coffee cups. It was a set of 6 and I almost never drink Turkish Coffee at home. I kept two and will be donating the four. Mom had given me those so, that is why I am keeping the two. A mug given to me by a friend with whom I have stopped talking. 2 elephants gifted by the same friend. A small angel doll collecting dust. 3 raki glasses. I rarely drink the stuff. It was a set of 6 and I am keeping 3 in case my family comes to visit and drink raki. Uncle did, when he was here. The small vase with the valentine bear was a gift from an ex and I do not know why I kept it. I wish we had a Goodwill like place. The donation places here usually take practical items. So, decorative items may go to waste.After I post this, I will fish out the shoes I will be donating. I think I have also found three more decorative items taking up too much space and collecting dust. Will post their pictures later to share my commitment you.Once again, thank you for supporting me! Have a great weekend!"},

I swear despite all the purging I keep doing, I still have too much STUFF! I packed some of my stuff and put them away but, even when everything has a place, my living room still looks cluttered. It's driving me insane. I started thinking of having my apartment painted this summer but, just the thought of moving stuff around makes me dizzy.It is also difficult to clean small areas with so much stuff. And for the sentimental ties I have with the said stuff is just so stupid. I have lost people that I loved. Getting rid of things should be easy right? Yet, I have this huge problem of parting with things. WHY?I am so mad at myself today. I have an ironing board that hasn't been used in over two years. I should just get rid of it. I have a small tabletop one that can be hung in the closet and if I absolutely need to iron something, that should be enough. The big one is disguised between a closet and the curtains and each time, I go there to vacuum, I curse the darn thing. I still couldn't get rid of the CDs and VCDs and even casettes! Ugh! The small music set is still taking up space. I have tons of yarn that I cannot possibly do something with. There are still lots of purses that I cannot part with. I need to go through those again.I also still have too many shoes. That's fairly easy to sort out because all are in individual transparent plastic shoe boxes. May be I should start there.And knick knacks everywhere...I can go on and on.Off I go to put laundry away...Sigh..."},
{"title": "Ugh! The prices of fresh produce...", "date": "Tuesday, April 12, 2022", "text": "Today, I went out for grocery shopping and I just could not believe my eyes when I saw the fresh produce prices. Honestly, I could not bring myself to buy iceberg lettuce and broccoli. I bought spinach roots. Spinach is sold as a whole, leaf only and roots only here. I love spinach roots so, I cut them up and washed them thoroughly as soon as I came home. Cooked it with sauteed onions, sauteed chopped meat, a medium sliced carrot, a handful of rice in tomato sauce. I have this with plain yogurt and it tastes heavenly. You can make it without the meat and serve it cold but, I like the hot dish better. It is going to be today's dinner with leftover salad from my lunch. I am sure there will be at least two more portions for the next few days.I bought two bunches of chard. I will make rolls with a meat and rice stuffing with some of it and the rest will be sauteed with onions. I also serve this with yogurt or use it as a savory pastry filling or sometimes crack an egg on it for breakfast. I think, some of it will become a pastry filling and I will have the rest with yogurt. I bought Turkish style phyllo dough. 3 of them makes a nice size pie. I will probably freeze half of the pie for later. Need to use up some cheese so, that will go into the pie as well.Here is a short video of what I intend to make. It is not in English but, just watching it you will see how easy it is. If there is a Middle Eastern, Greek or Armenian store near you, I am sure you can find this type of phyllo dough. I will use three just like in the video. The filling is a mixture of Turkish White Cheese and chopped parsley but, you can use feta, cottage cheese or, whatever you like as a filling. I will use sauteed chard and cheese as I mentioned.I think the meat in the freezer will be sufficient till I am back on the road.I hope summer will bring the prices down. Tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers were ridiculuously expensive. I never realized how tired I got during the last couple of weeks. I slept at least 3 hours on the train, came home, dozed off in front of the TV and slept through the night.Wishing everyone a nice week!"},

After Ramadan Feast, I want to head to Antalya. I will probably stay till June 7th or 8th. The idea of going to the US in July started to grow on me. Although, now it is more expensive than ever, I think, I should be able to do it on the income I will have generated by then through just one of my part-time jobs. I used to buy lots of  brand name clothing items for SIS, BIL and Uncle but, looking at their wardrobes, let alone needing anything, they have excess. Last time I really went overboard on shopping for them. This time, just a couple of well worth items will be sufficient as gifts.I think, I will fly with Turkish Airlines this time. They have 4 direct flights to NY every day and they allow 2 suitcases for free per person. Less expensive flights have one stop and they allow only one suitcase. I always pay excess baggage so, the price matches the direct flight. I also like to break the trip to stretch my legs but, with the pandemic still very effective, I think it is better to fly direct. ----------------------After I wrote the above my BFF M, whom I will be visiting in the US, called me and we watched the final episode of  The Night Manager. I told her that I started looking up airfare and she said she wants to come visit for a week or so too. So, we are going to try to see if she can come with me on my return trip and spend a week here in Turkey. Yay! That would be awesome!Off I go to check airfare."},

Her name means, sincere, warm hearted and kind (and it rhymes with my name). I am not telling this because she is my sister but, everyone says she is living up to her name.She is also a smart and quick witted person. It is always fun to be with her except when it is not. Lol! We used to have arguments in the past like all siblings has but, we never not talked to each other. That was our number one principle. During the past 10-15 years we do not argue anymore except for when I want to cuddle and kiss her sort of like Elmyra showing love. Lol! She calls me Elmyra when I do that. She has the warmest and kindest heart that I know. I am very lucky to have her. Especially since our mom died, when I become sad, stressed or depressed, she talks to me like she is the older sister. That makes me laugh and pull myself together.Love her to the moon and back, several times over.HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY SIS! May your life be long, filled with health, laughter and joy!"},
{"title": "New Glasses and a Windfall", "date": "Thursday, April 7, 2022", "text": "Uncle and I went to order our new prescription glasses today. Two pairs for him to read, and one pair to use day long. It took him less than half an hour to try frames and get his measurements taken. I ordered a pair of progressive/multi-focal glasses. It took me more than an hour. Haha! Also, his glasses are ready whereas, mine will be ready in about 10 days. I will get them when I am in Ankara at the end of the month. Also his three glasses cost a quarter of what mine costs. Sigh... Anyway, since this was in the budget, I do not care all that much. However, I am getting a small windfall. Yay! Remember the client we had who made us work for weeks on end and who refused all the candidates? We had stopped working for them but, my friend, who is the owner of the business had billed them at 30% per the contract. I wasn't counting on them paying it. I even told my friend that they would probaby not pay. Well, I was wrong. So, the amount of money coming my way is going to cover the cost of the glasses. Isn't that great?We also visited my cousins at their shop for a while. My older cousin is very tired due to taking care of everything and she needs a vacation. I asked her to come with me to visit uncle early May. I will drive her to Antalya and after a week, she can fly back. They can keep the shop closed for a week. My younger cousin has MS and slightly disabled. Their mother is not too old but, her health has always been a problem.Yesterday, I was getting ready to meet two old friends when Aunt C (the old lady who was my parents' friend) called me. She told me she fell and banged her back on the kitchen cabinet door and asked me if I could take her to a hospital. I canceled my plans with my friends and rushed to take her to an ER. Since I am not familiar with the hospitals in her area, I took her to a place she wanted and the moment we walked in, I regretted that. An X-Ray and a tomography later, they told us she needed to see a surgeon and told us to wait. She had broken two ribs; one slightly displaced, the other intact. We waited for like 2 hours and found out that the surgeon was actually on leave. I called another hospital and made an urgent appointment with the surgeon there. I had the staff put the X-Ray and tomography results on a CD and took her to the other hospital where, unfortunately my mom had passed. Aunt C told me initially she was going to ask me to take her to the same hospital but decided against it because, she knew it was the hospital where mom died. Such a sweetheart. Well, we had to wait for the surgeon for over an hour because, he was in surgery and it was a complicated one. The surgeon prescribed some meds, told her what type of movements she needed to avoid. After that, I took her home. They told us it will be a bit painful recovery in about two months.SIS and BIL are coming to Ankara tomorow late at night. It is also SIS' birthday. She is turning 46.  We did not know they were coming so, it is a nice surprise. I guess they also need to take BIL's dad to a doctor. It has been awfully busy since I came to Ankara. Tomorrow, I will go to the cemetery and take the day off. No plans with anyone. I am sure we will dine out on Saturday as a family. I am also meeting friends in the afternoon."},
{"title": "Uncle's Check-Up", "date": "Tuesday, April 5, 2022", "text": "Today, Uncle and I went to the hospital for his check-up appointment at 8:30 in the morning.He first spoke to the check-up doctor who starts the process. He had his blood drawn, got a chest X-Ray, a full abdominal ultrasound, an Echocardiogram, an EKG and gave a urine and stool sample. Then we had a 2 hour lunch break before he started to see the specialists. By the time we came back from lunch, most of the test results were back so, he went in to talk to a cardiologist, a urologist, and a gastroenterologist. Everything is perfect except for Vitamin D deficiency. He will see the check-up doctor tomorrow again. I am sure he will prescribe some.After that we both went to my eye doctor. He needs two prescription glasses, one for reading, another for watching TV and driving and such. The doctor did not recommend him multi-focals because he never had glasses till now and that it would be difficult for him to adjust to them. It turned out that I needed a new prescription too. My myopia recedes by age. It has been 3 years since I got my current glasses and my lenses were a bit scratched in time so, getting a new pair will be nice. I was anticipating this so, there is money for a new pair of glasses in my budget. So, all is well but, we came home around 4 p.m. and boy, are we tired! I am glad he is in excellent health at 63.I am glad I went with him because, I am very familiar with that specific hospital and we kept running between different floors, different clinics and etc. He said, my presence made it easier for him. Tomorrow, he will meet up with the check-up doctor but, I will not go. I had done some laundry and on seeing that his undershirts were worn out, I had bought him some but, he said it would be better if they were a size up. On the way back from the hospital, I managed to exchange them too. If I hadn't thought about that, he would probably have worn the same old undershirts till the end of time. In the past, mom used to take care of such things."},

I realized there was quiet a lot of pollen stuck on my car. Too bad it can't be washed off till I come back from Ankara.I tried packing very lightly so, it took some time trying different outfits. I did not need to wear any business clothes in the last two years so, it was a bit difficult to decide on things to wear. For three days, I am taking two jackets, one black and one navy pair of pants. Tops were easier to pick. I am taking one cabin size suitcase and a backpack. My purse goes into the backpack.I will take a cab to the train station. Going home from Ankara station to the apartment is tricky. I will need a cab and a metro ride. I do not understand why they built the train station without any connection to the metro line. Some genius must be behind that decision. I need to participate in meetings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (half days). Monday I am meeting a friend, Tuesday, I am taking my uncle to his check-up, Wednesday, meeting with two friends. I haven't planned the rest of the time. Will try to make the best of it.I am a bit scared because of the meetings. They will be held at a huge congress center but still, I will not take off my N95 mask.

Yesterday she called me to say another cousin on her mom's side and his girlfriend would be joining us. We went to this nice Italian Restaurant and sat outside. The weather was mild and there were heaters. Good food, great wine and lots of laughter and fun stories later, the cousin and his GF left. We went to the apartment and had tea. It was almost midnight before I left.Driving home at night, coming from a pleasant evening, I felt soooooo very happy! Since we were outside, we did not wear masks. Prior to the pandemic, I used to go out all the time with friends and it was just a very normal thing to do. Last year, I did dine out with friends and my family in the summer but, coming back home at night, driving on the bridge that connects the two continents and having to park the car outside since there were no spots left inside the gated parking lot, felt just so different and welcome. I cannot tell you enough HOW MUCH I MISSED THAT! It brought back tons of good memories. It felt so real!? All those little things we take for granted... When they are taken away from us, we understand the value of each. Don't we?I guess the feeling is partly due to the fact that it has been a long winter. Thankfully, during the last two days there was definitely Spring in the air. The weather report says it will be over 60 degrees Fahrenheit all week long. Yay!I promised myself enjoy many days outdoors as long as the weather permits this year. I will go out every.single.day!Oh BTW, dad's cousin's art deco apartment building was built in 1893. The roof tiles were imported from France, Marseilles to be exact. The roof had to be renewed in 1989 so, those tiles lasted just shy of 100 years. They kept a few of them and placed them under new tiles."},

I usually fall asleep very late and get up very late. This surely kills almost half of the day when others are functional.Despite the fact that I avoid meetings in the morning like the plague, sometimes I can't. Today was one of those days and I got up at 9 a.m. (I know, for most people even that is late). Had an interview with a very pleasant young men at 10 o'clock. He turned out to be way overqualified, well compensated and proud of what he is doing at his current job. I learn so much from the candidates I interview. This is the only good thing about this headhunting job.My assistant, one of our young employees, had written three reports to be submitted to the Client on the previously interviewed candidates. I read them and made some adjustments although, I must say she is getting pretty good at this. I know she is honestly trying very hard and even asking her peers to read what she has written before sending them to me. She is a really nice young woman about 24 or 25. Her mother passed away when she was just 10. So unfortunate! If we have time I always make a point of chatting with her a while after we hang up with the candidates.I sent the updated reports to the Client and then read a long contract for my other semi-volunteer job, sent my comments and I was done for the day workwise. I answer e-mails any time I see something in my inboxes and do not consider them work at all.Then I looked at my watch and it was not even 1 p.m. yet. Wow! Early Bird does get the worm. I wish, I could repair my broken sleeping cycle. Tried everything. I even gave up electronic gadgets after 9 p.m. I shall keep on trying.I spoke to my dad's cousin and she invited me over for dinner on Saturday. She told me I should stay overnight because, she wants to drink and chat. I do not like sleepovers much but, I like her a lot. So, I accepted her offer. She lives at an Art Deco Style historical building. Her apartment is on the top floor and has a panoramic view of the Bosphorus. Crazy expensive place. There is also a Russian restaurant since 1943 in the same building. I tried to find out when the building was built but, couldn't find anything online. I shall ask her."},

I hope, the new guys keep on providing good service.I also decided not to terminate the other service till the contract is up because, the lump sum penalty fee is almost the same as what I would pay in total till December. Yesterday's nice(r) weather is nowhere to be found. I went out briefly to get a surge protector strip and it was freezing outside.Today, I had a funny conversation on the phone with my sister that went like this:SIS - Oh, btw, please stop telling me you love me everyday.- But, why?- Because I already know you do.- You sure?- Of course, I am sure!

For the next three days, there will be salad and grilled fish or chicken for dinner. Easy and healthy! Today, I also picked two jars of peanut butter but, as I was trying to put them in my grocery bag, dropped one. It was a glass jar. Talk about food waste. I picked it up carefully, wrapped it up and tossed it in the garbage. Ugh! I was rushing because someone pulled behind me and waiting for my spot. Why do I care I don't know. There were plenty of spots so, if someone decided to wait for me, they could have waited for as long as I needed. Decided to get back to keeping a food journal. It was helping me a lot so, better get back on track.Today it is in mid 40's and not but freezing cold anymore. All the snow melted. They say we may expect some more snow in a week or so but, I am sure, it will be nothing. Looking out, it is nice to see a clear blue sky and sunlight for a change.The peonies I bought thrived on the balcony. They look lovely and last a long time. From now on, they will be my go to flowers.My Internet provider has been driving me crazy lately so, I decided to pull the trigger and get Fiber Internet from another provider. The installation will be tomorrow. After that, I will cancel the other service. There will be a penalty but at this point, I do not care. I called them several times saying that some of my devices could no longer connect to the internet but, they kept saying averything was fine with their service and may be my devices had problems. Well, they don't because, they connect to other services. So, today I called them up to learn the penalty and you should have been on the phone with me. Ugh! The call center agent kept speaking non-stop saying things like they could also offer Fiber, that they did not want to lose me, blah blah blah! I kept saying, \"please, I have made up my mind, just tell me the penalty for termination\" several times. Finally, I got the answer I wanted. It is almost the same amount of money if I kept the service till the end of the term so, may be I will have them run parallel instead of giving them all the money at once.If they had showed the same effort to escalate my case to a technical person, I am sure, it would've been just fine. I am so fed up with this company. The only account I will have remaining with them will be the TV service in Antalya. Uncle has problems with that too but, they cannot/ will not solve them. As soon as the contract is up, I will change that as well. For now, it is not a big issue. Wishing everyone a nice week!"},
{"title": "To Snow or Not To Snow", "date": "Friday, March 18, 2022", "text": "I don't know what the snowmakers up in the sky are thinking. It goes dark all of a sudden and snow starts coming down like crazy and in 20 minutes it stops, the sky clears, the snow melts. Then it starts snowing again. This cycle kept repeating all day long. They predict snow all through the weekend but, I do not think, it will stay on the ground the way it looks. I had two interviews today and I will be sending the reports on these candidates to the customer. I called another person and she outright refused it saying that she knew the workplace and the boss. She said, she would be open to other opportunities. I liked her candor and she sounded like a pleasant person.So, this weekend, I will try to see if I can find anymore candidates. If not, I am ready to throw the towel. The cabbage rolls turned out real tasty. I serve them with plain yogurt. I have three more servings left. I will freeze two servings for later. I will make another dish with the remaining cabbage. Although it was a rather small one, you can get so many meals out of one, may be even too many. Lol! Well, they say eat veggies and fruits in season and I am doing that. Luckily, it freezes well.SIS and BIL are on their way to Ankara. They will check on BIL's dad. His regular caregiver is thankfully back from her country. Now that the bedridden patient has passed, she will not have much to do around the apartment. She is a kind hearted, hard working lady and she took care of BIL's mom so well. I am sure it was a very difficult and depressing job for her. On an entirely different note, I am a big fan of the Star Trek Franchise (can you tell?) and having watched the final episode of Season 4 of ST: Discovery, I don't think I can ever forgive the writers of this show. They have so much material, incredible technical advancements, such interesting characters and yet they always manage to turn it into a big, outrageously romantic or rather mushy drama. I think this show is the worst of the whole franchise. I don't know their ratings but, if it does not come back for a 5th season, I will not be surprised. With STD for an abbreviation, I shouldn't have expected more I guess.Wishing everyone a nice weekend. I know some fellow bloggers out there have already started enjoying early days of Spring. I am looking forward to it too."},
{"title": "Hump Day", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2022", "text": "Today, I had two interviews but, I am not sure about the candidates.  Tomorrow, I will try some more candidates and try to set up interviews. I feel like I am reaching the end of the talent pool that I can access.  I looked back and saw that I have found 200+ possible candidates, eliminated more than half and registered 101 candidates on our tool, eliminated 20+ after reviewing CVs, called 70+ to see if they are interested, half of them declined, interviewed about 24-25, sent 14 to the customer and had 1 (Yes One!) hired. A person who actually enjoys working as a headhunter must be envious of Sisyphus. Ugh!The companies think that everybody will come running to work for them and the candidates think, they should be paid top dollar. Anyhow, today I walked to the nearest Mall and returned an item to Decathlon. While I was at the Mall, I grabbed a couple of bottles of body wash, some dental floss, wet wipes that I use to clean the toilet, toothpaste and a couple of other small items I needed. On the way home, I quickly went tinto the grocery store, grabbed salad greens, a celery stalk, a small cabbage and chopped meat. I will make cabbage rolls stuffed with a meat, onion and rice mixture. Never made that before so, wish me luck. I hope, I watched enough YouTube videos. My grandmas used to make cabbage rolls with the meat stuffing and a rice only stuffing which is served cold. May be I will do the same.I think, I will not need another grocery run till the 31st when I will be leaving for Ankara except for vegetables and salad fixings.Uncle had a gout attack recently and I can tell he freaked out due to so much pain. He cut all his alcohol consumption and foods that have high purine content. I took the opportunity to convince him for a full check-up. I will take him to my eye doctor as well. Yay me! He avoids doctors like the plagues and he is a Pharmacist. Go figure!The hump day is almost over for me. Stay safe and healthy!"},

However, I will stick the roaster in the oven and go exercise before I return to doing what I need to get done.A roaster means many meals so, I like to have one every once in a while. I think I will make mashed potatoes to go with it. Had a very light lunch of leeks cooked in olive oil.I am deliberately not buying bread these days because bread is my kryptonite. It is still very cold here but most of the snow melted away. They say, we should be expecting one last snowstorm before the Spring arrives. I will go to Ankara late March for my part-time consultancy gig with the medical association. While I am there, I may stay and spend some time with friends. Initially, I was thinking of going to Ankara, staying there for a month and then going to Antalya for 6-7 weeks but that will be a very long time from home and if I finally pull the trigger to go visit my BFF in the US in July, that's even longer.So, I will go for work, stay a bit longer, come back and go to Antalya later on. I also need to do the math on my gas consumption for those long drives. I know everyone has been affected by the gas prices but noone has been as affected as we are. During the last two months gas doubled in price over here. Yes! You read it right. Doubled!May be I will go to Izmir to see my SIS and BIL and go to Antalya from there. Just can't decide yet.Hope everyone is having a good week."},

Blizzard, open skies, snow starts melting, a strong wind brings clouds, rinse and repeat.The Mayor keep urging people not to go out if it is not absolutely necessary and since I like him, I do what he says. Snow aside, it is very cold outside due to the cold front coming our way from Siberia. They say it is going to get worse over the weekend. I am cooking my every meal from scratch, tidying up small areas, reading, taking care of small repairs to avoid cabin fever. I haven't been exercising so, today my treadmill will be happy to see me again.I am also listening to old radio shows on YouTube. Recently, I got hooked to the Paul Temple series from BBC.Since I have retired, I started appreciating and feeling sorry for homemakers, SAHMs. Housework is such a bore. All my life I worked and had cleaning ladies, I ate out or ordered food most of the time. Now that, I am too chicken to get a cleaning lady due to COVID and that I am retired, I am home all the time and I am bored. If the virus weren't around I could have at least socialized with people, go out more often etc.AND THEN, I suddenly remember that there is a war not too far from me and people are dying or desperately trying to save their loved ones and the winters are worse over there. So, I am shutting my mouth and dragging myself to the treadmill. This is a time to count blessings, not whine."},
{"title": "Snow Prediction", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2022", "text": "They say a big snowstorm is coming our way on Wednesday and it will possibly be the worst since 1987. I wasn't living in Istanbul back then so, I do not know what to expect. I did my grocery shopping and ordered water.During grocery shopping today I noticed that, people were shopping like crazy not only because of the snow prediction but, because of sky-rocketing prices. These days the sunflower oil price has been increasing and I saw people bulk buying sunflower oil. They were buying multiples of 3 liter- 5 litre bottles and cans. For a split second, even I considered grabbing a 2 liter bottle but, then I reminded myself that I never use sunflower oil. Lol! Must be psychological. Glad I did not buy it. I use olive oil and butter exclusively. Nothing else. I try not to eat much bread so, I bought a package of whole wheat tortillas. I freeze them and they do not take up much space. My arm is still bothering me although, it is much better now. So, I did not buy too much stuff and used my shopping bag trolley. I also have a foldable utility cart that I can use. I have no idea why I do not use them and lift heavy bags. I needed to send two packages but, I totally forgot so, hopefully I will do that tomorrow before the snow."},
{"title": "Stocking up on food and Miscellaneous Ramblings", "date": "Friday, March 4, 2022", "text": "The other day, I was commenting on One Family One Income's post on Doomsday Prep that if either party used nuclear weapons, due to our proximity, I wouldn't have much longer to live and that I wasn't stocking up on food much. I honestly do not know stocking up on food would be beneficial but, just in case the supply chain may be broken at some point in the near future due to the war and rapidly increasing prices, I decided to replenish at least what I have already consumed and then some. So, I ordered some dry beans, lentils and chick peas. Also bought some canned tuna and some other canned fish. Other than that, I do not know what else to buy or how much. I do not want to end up with 3 years worth of legumes/pulses and canned fish. I do not consume much flour or sugar but still, may be I could buy a little extra. Powdered milk may be something to keep on hand although I normally never use it. I guess if the supply chain stays intact, I may use it in baking before it expires and gets wasted. I buy 19 liter (5 gallon) bottles of water at home. I always have an extra bottle and as soon as I finish one, I order a new one. Should I get extra bottles? How many? Should I get 1.5 liter bottles? Again how many? I hate uncertainty.I am thinking that keeping some extra cash on hand may be useful too. Ugh! I hate politics, wars and people who feed on them. Now seems to be a great time for an alien invasion for unity of world nations but, where are those darn aliens? Oh yes, they are a lot more intelligent than us and cannot be bothered with the stupidity of humans. They probably wouldn't care to eat us because we are feeding ourselves so poorly.Today was a rainy and cold day so, although I intended to go out, I decided to stay put. Then I checked the weather report and for the next 5 days, it will always be rainy and around 3-5 ℃ (37-40 ℉). So, the spring I smelled in the air was in my brain, not in the air.The Government lifted the requirement of wearing masks outside. They say if the space is well ventiated indoors, masks will not be mandatory. How will anyone know whether a specific place is well ventilated or not? Ha?They also lifted the use of the code that you needed to provide to enter banks, malls and such. Such stupidity! I do not care. I will keep on wearing a mask and staying away from people. I am just so worried about my SIS. Working at a bank, with a chronic autoimmune condition... Sigh...I must have slept on my left arm I guess. It wasn't so bad in the morning but, now it is killing me. I cannot lift it over my head. I applied some sort of ointment but then, I realized that stuff expired in 2018. Ugh! I thought I had cleaned out the medicine drawer."},
{"title": "Rice and Beans and Good News!", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2022", "text": "Today, I just could not decide what to eat and finally decided to make rice and beans. I had frozen fresh navy beans in the freezer so I took them out and soaked them briefly in hot water. I had purchased them fresh and shelled them myself late August so they do not need to be soaked overnight.I chopped onions and sauteed that with some olive oil and salt. I added tomato sauce and the rinsed beans and put them in my pressure cooker. It took 30 minutes to cook.I only use a specific kind of rice from northwest of Turkey. I soak the rice in hot water for about a half hour and rinse it really really well. I melt butter, add hot water, add the rice and a bit salt and simmer that with the lid on till all the water is gone. For each one cup of rice, I use one and a half cup of water. That is my most basic rice pilaf. I may use grated ripe tomatoes or stock sometimes. I may add chick peas, chicken pieces and currants.Leftovers are for Friday. I do not like eating the same thing two days in a row.Today was a lazy day but, I did tidy up certain areas and a couple of drawers and did a load of laundry. Tomorrow, I will change my sheets and wash them. The good news is that one of my candidates accepted the job offer and will be starting her new position in April. Yay!Now, I need to find one just like her and their boss. Ugh! Her peer will have his first interview tomorrow. Hope, all goes well."},
{"title": "End of February", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2022", "text": "With a war that erupted not too far from Turkey, I am expecting more economic turbulence. I made my calculations and updated my Net Worth (only liquid assets) today and closed the books on February.I decided to purchase some more Euros since, I am already heavily invested in USD.  All my income and expenses are in Turkish Liras. Now my Liquid Net Worth consists of:TL 15%USD 63%Euros 8%Gold 14% (physical cold coins)I doubled the amount of Euros I have but, that is still the smallest portion of my basket. I have been pressuring my SIS and BIL to have a more balanced basket of savings because theirs was too heavy on Turkish Liras. Finally, today, they pulled the trigger and what they have now looks like this:TL 18%USD 38%Euros 17%Gold 27% (physical cold coins)You may find this a lot different than what you invest in. I know there are lots of other instruments out there but, unfortunately, I do not trust those in this country. Stock Market is easily manipulated over here due to it's shallow nature. There are funds offered by several institutions but, again I've got trust issues. I invest in some funds and they are included in my TL portfolio but, the fund ratio in that portfolio is very small. In a turbulent area where there can be civil unrest, war, refugees and etc. gold is always the king and that is why we always include it in our baskets. Local currency is very weak and hard currencies provide stability and help preservation of purchasing power.As for other end of month subjects: I ate a lot during the last few weeks out of my freezer and claimed  tons of space. I am almost out of all meat with the exception of a steak and a serving of fish. I am planning a grocery run tomorrow. Need to make a list and stick to it.I am planning to do the following tomorrow:- Pack and ship two sets of documents- Grocery shopping- Returning an item to Decathlon Gas prices have never been this outrageous so, I plan my outings very carefully these days.I hope this Russian occupation of Ukraine ends soon. People over there are getting killed for no reason, their lives are interrupted and they live in fear over there. It is also affecting gas prices, wheat prices and everything else as if, we did not have enough economic issues."},

Who needs two dust pans in a small apartment? I also fished out tons of bubble wrap. I am sure mom had saved them. They were neatly packed together. I will use most of that to pack and put away my picture frames, knick knacks on display. Thanks Mom!I need to miss those things and want a fresher and less cluttered look for a while.I feel lighter today. This cleaning and purging has a positive effect on my mood so, I will keep going with other parts of my home.I have tons of CDs and a CD player that I do not use anymore. I do not know what to do with them. Spotify changed everything. Didn't it? I want to give them to someone who can actually use it. May be I should post them on FB Marketplace for a small amount of money and depending on who wants them, I may gift them for free. Like a college student may be? Any ideas dear blogosphere friends?Today after I tidy up and deal with putting the laundry away, I will bake a carrot cake for the first time in my life. I have lots of carrots and walnuts on hand that I must use up soon. Need to go hunt for a simple yet highly praised recipe online. Hope, everyone is having a good weekend!"},
{"title": "Change of Perspective", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2022", "text": "I have a small balcony outside my kitchen. There are glass panels which you can push aside to use it as an open balcony. Lately, it had been cluttered and was getting on my nerves. I cannot say I liked it very much even when it was organized. Many people eat at their tables in their balconies (on their balconies? Which preposition?) during warm months but, that never has been my thing except when mom was visiting. She loved the balcony and the hydrangeas right in front of it. The hydrangeas do not bloom every year. They are kind of moody.The other day, I have realized that, due to not being thoroughly cleaned in more than two years (no cleaning lady remember?), there was a build up of some black matter on the walls, ceiling and on the floor behind the plastic cabinet where I store cleaning gadgets, supplies and my tool box. I suspected it could be mold or just a build-up of air pollution. Istanbul is very humid so, I decided to err on the side of caution and treat those surfaces with mold cleaner.I went to the hardware store and found two different kinds of sprays. One is to treat moldy surfaces, the other to avoid mold. I also bought a hose to connect to my kitchen faucet to wash the floors properly. I want to elevate the plastic cabinet so, I am thinking of going back to the store to buy a flat piece of wood and install 4 wheels on it. I will place the cabinet on that contraption for easy pulling and pushing.As I have been dealing with the balcony, I was thinking of contacting a couple of contractors to see if I can get rid of the old glass panels and get new ones installed plus a new coat of paint. Armed with a safety goggle, an N95 Mask (a staple nowadays), gloves and a headscarf, I sprayed the nasty smelling mold remover to the black areas. After waiting a little bit, I used two different brushes and lots of warm water to wash down the chemical. The result was quiet amazing. Now, the area I have cleaned looks better than the rest of  the surfaces. I will wash the rest of the surfaces with soapy water. Since there is external paint, I can wash the walls. I still have about half a day's work to do but, once I am done, I believe it will look good as new. So, the cleaning totally changed my perspective. I do not think I need to get new glass panels or a new paint job at least for another couple of years. I will also clean and re-organize inside the cabinet, purge unnecessary stuff and make sure everything can be contained in the cabinet. I have a small table where 2 can dine during warmer months. Mom loved having meals there. If the hydrangeas decide to bloom, it is really georgeous in the summer.I bought peonies and once I am done with the balcony, I will place them and my hyacinths on the table. I promised myself to keep my balcony clean and organized from now on. For me, it is reclaimed space and I will make sure it becomes an enjoyable, relaxing part of my home."},
{"title": "An Adventure Many Winters Ago", "date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2022", "text": "I have lived in the US between 1990 and 1993 due to a Turkish-American joint project. The company provided  apartments for me and my colleagues during that time. We ran into some end-of-run issues with our Project and I was sent back to the US early Fall in 1995. Since we did not know how long I was gonna be there then, they put me up at a well known chain hotel in Tarrytown, NY instead of an apartment.Living at a hotel for a prolonged time is boring but, the hotel was a very good one with a very friendly staff and had a pool with glass windows all around the pool area and the Gym. While I stayed there, I also visited my BFF and my other good friend over the weekends and I was having a great time since, I love the Holiday season in the US.My BFF, her husband and I were going skiing on some weekends. We wanted to go to Killington, VT on the first weekend of January but, they had to cancel due to something that came up. I decided to go alone because, I wasn't sure when I was going to return back home and wanted to make the best of the skiing season. My BFF thought that was a bad idea to go alone but, I did not change my plans.Internet was not a thing back then so, I looked up a Ski Guide I got from the Princeton Ski Shop. I used to love that store. I remember being heartbroken when they closed. I found a Ski Lodge and booked it for Staurday night.I jumped in my car around 5 a.m. in the morning on Saturday. There was no snow in NY so, I was hoping that there would be lots of snow on the mountain. The road conditions were perfect and I reached the Ski Lodge around 10 a.m. and checked it out to see, if it was a safe and nice place. Upon deciding that it was a decent place, I checked in, changed into ski clothing and hit the slopes. I was happy to see that it was snowing. I enrolled in a class in the afternoon so that, I would be skiing with a group of people and would be hitting the higher and longer slopes.Snow conditions were great, lots of packed powder and the instructor turned out to be an ex USAF officer who served at Incirlik Base in Turkey. He kept riding the chair lifts with me and we chatted away. He was a real nice guy. After the lifts were closed, I went back to the lodge, had a shower and decided to check out some stores (yeah I still have the knick knacks) in Killington and dine at a restaurant called The Grist Mill back then. My plan was to ski all morning on Sunday and hit the road after lunch. After all, it would be a 4-5 hour drive, right?I woke up early on Sunday, had a great breakfast at the Lodge, checked out and hit the slopes. It was snowing so much that upper lifts had to be closed around 11 a.m. Getting wet and cold, I went inside to get a cup of something hot. The TV was on and I saw that, at least 3 feet of snow was expected in upstate NY area and that it had already been snowing for hours. On seeing this news, I immediately changed my clothes and hit the road. 30 minutes into my drive, I knew that it was a big big mistake but, 29 year old me decided to keep on driving. I have never seen so much snow in my life after that. It took me 11 hours to get back to the hotel and I swear I did not see the asphalt during my trip.  All radio stations were urging people to seek refuge at schools and churches and there were only a handful of cars on the road. A few times, I considered taking and exit and finding a school or church but, I could not risk it thinking that sticking with the Taconic State Parkway was my safest bet. There used to be a gas station right on Taconic that you could pull into from either side of the road. I went in and bought a cup of coffee and a muffin and inquired about the road conditions. The guy at the cash register thought I was nuts to be driving all the way from Vermont. He gave me a free chocolate bar. Lol!I finally made it to the intersection of Route 119 going towards the hotel and saw that there was a heap of snow blocking the exit due to the gigantic snow ploughs trying to clear 119. I got out of the car and checked out the snow heap. The alternate route would take me another half hour and I was shaking after driving for so long. I looked at the car and then at the heap and decided that I could manage to get over or go through it. I backed up a bit and then, put the pedal to the metal and very luckily managed to get on Route 119 and went to the hotel. It would have been real fun, if I had gotten stuck there. I only took my wallet with me going to the hotel room because I had zero strength to gather my bags and skiis. I found several messages from both of my friends urging me to call them as soon as I got to the hotel, no matter what the time was. No cell phones back then. So, I called them to say I made it back safely and got lovingly yelled at. Lol!We got snowed in for two days. That blizzard made history and if you want to check it out, here is Blizzard of 96 on Wikipedia.Today, I would never do that. I was a lot more daring (read stupid) when I was young. I used to go down to NYC at night all by myself, stroll around in the Village, have dinner, go to a bar with live music and had no fear. I never realized how risky that was or rather, I did not care. I guess when one is young, she/he thinks they are invincible. With that said, I still take vacations and drive long distances all by myself both in and out of the country and most of my friends don't do that alone. Looking back, since it ended well, I am glad, I had that adventure."},

It is declared a new construction site. )- Re-filled two weeks worth of pill boxes- Put away my clean and folded clothes that I had washed in Ankara- Installed the printer software properly on my computer- Put away all the paperwork related with Client B who decided to stop the hiring process. (I am so glad! I wanted to drop them before they wanted to drop us. The candidates they liked refused their offer which was below average salaries prevailing in the market. They started with unrealistic expectations and we had told them that. Oh well... My friend sent them an invoice for our effort as mentioned in the contract but, I do not think they will pay. Honestly, I do not care. If they pay, that will be a surprise).- Found and tossed more old receipts, invoices, notes and etc.- Cleared my dinner table. Now it looks like a proper dinner table. - Cleaned my kitchen. (Since I was in a rush to get to Ankara, I had left the kitchen in disarray. I put things in order there. Unfortunately, I ended up tossing away a whole head of iceberg lettuce and about a generous serving of veggie soup).I think, I felt the Spring in the air today and although March can be real cold, I know nice, warm days are just around the corner.Tonight, I am grilling a slice of salmon for dinner. Steamed broccoli will accompany that. I mix lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic and salt to make a light sauce to go on the broccoli. May be I will open a bottle of wine too.I bought a package of Brussel Sprouts enough for about three servings. I see simple meals served with veggies and salads this week.I am so proud of myself today. It is time to do some laundry and chill the rest of the day.

She intended to visit her son going to Medical School in Istanbul. I gladly said yes and we made arrangements to leave around 10:30 a.m. today, stopping at the elderly couple who were my parents' friends, to help the lady with her shopping as usual.As I was almost leaving to pick her up today, she called me and told me that she would not be able to make it because, her father's caregiver was not feeling well. So, I went to visit Aunt C and Uncle O by myself. I took Aunt C shopping and then I fixed her phone. Somehow, she lost all her contact list, whatsapp and facebook apps. While I was at Aunt C's, the superintendent rang the door bell saying that the next door neighbor was not responding to neither her kids' calls nor the door bell. He had a set of keys to her apartment but, he was scared to go in by himself. He opened the door and I walked in to a very neat and tidy but empty home. The cell phone was charging and there was no sign of the old lady. Before I left for the road, Aunt C wanted to ring her door bell again and I did. A very sweet 84 year old lady answered the door saying that she had gone to the hairdresser's to get a cut and color. Apparently, she left home in a rush forgetting to take her phone and it was too late when she realized that she left her phone home.I stopped coloring my hair last year when I was 54 and here is this lively 84 year young woman getting her hair colored in the middle of a pandemic. Shame on me! Lol!Then I left for Istanbul. There are two mountain passes on my way and it started snowing when I approached the first one and then, it kept snowing all the way to the other. After the second pass, it kept snowing for another 10 minutes or so and then it turned into rain. When I finally came to Istanbul, it was all clear blue skies. It was a pleasant drive with beautiful snowy view.I rested a bit when I came home, had dinner, emptied and put away my suitcase and now I want to take a long shower followed by drenching myself in moisturizers. Ankara is so darn dry that, my skin feels like sandpaper and it is itchy.Wishing everyone a very nice and relaxing weekend!Here is a picture and a video of my trip.

{"title": "FOCUS", "date": "Monday, February 14, 2022", "text": "This week's theme is \"Focus\" for me. Before I jump to that, let me tell you about the family status right now.First, I must say BIL has recovered and we all are at the Ankara apartment. This is a pretty big place and SIS still sleeps in a separate room. Today, they went out to run some errands and start some bureucracy regarding his mom's passing. He is an only child and according to our law, he and his dad inherit everything. His dad 1/4th and him, 3/4. He has his dad's POA so, he can handle everything without having to drag his dad around.SIS will go back to Izmir this weekend, BIL will probably stay for another week.They are both fed up with their draining work environment due to poor management. They are considering early retirement but, I made some calculations for them last night (yeah I like to crunch numbers over and over till they cannot be crunched anymore) and it is unlikely for them to retire before March 2025 which is not that far off. BIL seems especially drained and these few weeks he stayed away from the workplace, he got quiet detached. His father is still in a shock despite the fact that, his mom was bed ridden during the last ten years and she could not communicate at all. The caregiver will continue to look after him because, he cannot be left alone anymore. He is turning 84 this month.As for \"Focus\", I have decided to focus on my part-time work this week. I am hoping to go back home Thursday or Friday, depending on the weather and the roads. Before then, I want to line up some strong potential candidates to interview.I have two clients and both required 3 different positions each. I think, I will be able to fill two positions at client B this week. The other position will perhaps be filled by themselves. However, if they can't, I have candidates ready to be submitted. They were reluctant to modify their pay level but, it seems they are now offering this person they have found, quiet a high salary. He works at a prominent company so, it is highly likely that he will decline their offer. They had rejected my candidates on paper just because, they were asking for more money. Now that things have changed, I will be able to send my candidates. Even if they do hire their person, I will be very happy because, I really disliked their approach so far and would like to be done with them. As for client A, my candidate to replace the one who rejected their offer, had an interview this morning with the boss. If it went well, she will go through an assesment. Now I have two more positions to fill. I hope to be done by the end of April and not take on anymore business in the summer. So, you see why I need to focus.Wishing everyone a very nice week and a HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!"},

We were never indoors and it was a windy, bitter cold day with ice on the ground.I am still at my friend's home but my BIL is tested today and we will know if he is negative in a few hours. If not, I am going back home tomorrow. If he is, I will move to our apartment. SIS is also still at her friends'. I found my friend quiet depressed. She has digestive problems and feeling miserable.  She also has some family problems.Tried lifting her spirits up but, she is is not there at all. They have a trip coming up late February as a family. I am hoping that it will help her. Yesterday, I managed to take her out a bit and we had coffee. Today, I want to meet up with my sister and I offered her to come with us. They know each other well and my SIS is the kind of person who can cheer anyone up instantly if she wants to. Yet, my friend declined the offer today. May be she needs time for herself.BIL is actually relieved that his mom suffers no longer. Let's hope he is recovered fully."},

She has been in a vegetative state for most of the last 10 years and I know her suffering is over now. So, in a way, her death is a blessing. My BIL is an only child  and he was very close to his mom. It was torture for him to see his mom as an invalid for so long, yet he misses her badly.The funeral is tomorrow. My sister jumped on the first plane she could find and I drove over to Ankara. Since, BIL has COVID, we are both staying at our friends' homes.SIS, her bestie and I will deal with the bureucracy which is really not a big deal and BIL will bring his father to the funeral. The father possibly has COVID too and they actually should not be outside. They will keep their distance from everyone and pay their respects one last time. I did not have the heart to stop them or even saying something about that. Besides, the funerals are held in open space not inside.Uncle wanted to come but, we stopped him. BIL insisted that he should not come because, it is a much longer drive and his driving skills aren't what they used to be especially in the dark. There are snowy passes over the mountains and there really is nothing he can do to comfort BIL.His mom was a very sweet lady and she treated my SIS as a daughter rather than a daughter-in-law. She and mom became good friends too. I only have good memories with her. Hope, she will rest in Peace. Goodbye Aunt S..."},

This morning, I asked if she accepted and sent back the offer. She said she talked to her manager and her manager told her, they will be giving her a promotion in April.She said her salary will exceed what our customer offered her so, she will be declining the offer. I understand that people want to maximize their income and that they have anxieties about the future and all that. When she first declined the offer, she should not have come back to us, saying that she wanted to take it after further consideration. That's what upsets me.She used us. May be I should accept the fact that, this is quiet all right, and Niccolo Machiavelli said so back in 16th Century. My friend, who is the owner of the company wants to talk to this candidate once again and I see no reason in doing that. I have zero interest in spending even a minute more of my life for a lost cause.OK! There. I feel better already.Over the weekend, I sorted thru things, purged, threw away, set aside to donate some stuff and that made me real good. I also sorted through the medicine drawer and tossed a lot of things which have expired long time ago. This activity uplifted my mood so, I will continue in other parts of my home. Hope, everybody has a great week. I will forget about how crappy mine started.Onwards and upwards!"},

My sister did some online shopping for him and a few friends of theirs will be taking him some homemade soup and food. He seems to be all set. He told me he has been watching the Winter Olympics.I hope, he got a real mild case of it and will test negative soon. He probably got the Omicron because, he did not lose his sense of smell. His dog nose!Today is a beautiful day with a clear blue sky. It is 7℃ (45℉). I opened the windows and the fresh air makes me feel really good.I am in a purging mood so, I took a box and now am gathering things that I feel I do not need or want anymore. Will put the box by the recycling area. I have also found several boxes of business cards in my name for 3-4 companies I have worked for. I cut them up along with some loyalty cards that I do not need anymore. Everything is on my cell phone nowadays. Getting rid of some old paperwork as well as no longer needed training documentation, notes and etc. \"One day, may be they will come handy\" stuff as I call them. I decided they haven't come lately in such a long time that, I do not think they ever will.The other day I bought a sturdy cardboard box at IKEA. I will store knick knacks, things on display on the TV unit and in other places that look cluttered. Most of them have some sentimental value so, I am not getting rid of them for good. I plan to store them in a closet. May be this will give me the opportunity to finally get rid of the TV unit and get a new one. We'll see. I think I bought it in 1998. Few years ago, I painted it with chalk paint and it looks OKish. However, I am so tired of having it for so many years. I have not budgeted my part-time income from the headhunting business. So, when I get paid (meaning if all goes well and the candidates are hired), I have decided to gift myself a robot vacuum cleaner and set aside a budget for a brand new computer. I do not intend to buy a new computer till this one kicks the bucket but, earmarking a certain amount will be nice considering that my current laptop is 5 years old.I also have been thinking about my durable goods lately. My fridge and dishwasher were bought back in 2004 and my washing machine, in 2011. The stove top and the oven are pretty new. 5 years old or so. Everything is in perfect working order right now and these are durable goods, so they must last a long time although, nowadays they are not as well built as they used to be. Checking the current prices for these (yikes!), I decided to allocate a small amount in my budget every month, to come up with an emergency fund just for the durables. Or I may use the income from the headhunting job if all goes well.Had an egg salad sandwich on a roll for lunch and will be having a piece of salmon, brussel sprouts and a salad for dinner. The eggs wre supposedly medium sized but, I think they came from young chicks because they were pretty small. Probably the second time in my life that I ate three eggs. I soaked some chick peas and will be cooking them later on to make hummus, use on salads and etc. I also made a small pot of veggie soup.You see, this is a day of thinking and making decisions, plans, cooking and purging. I guess I am at Spring Cleaning 101 phase. How is your weekend so far?My BIL has been in Ankara since last Sunday to take care of his folks. The caregiver needs to go to her home country for a while and there is a temp caregiver now. He also needed to sell a piece of land on behalf of his father.He had taken the caregiver to some Government offices for some bureaucracy and saw her off on Wednesday. Today, he hears from her saying that her COVID test she had to take in her home country turned out positive. He was telling me the story while coughing and he also said he was running a slight fever. He thought it must be a cold or something. I asked him if he had taken a COVID test and he said no, because he was supposed to go back home on Sunday and I lost it!I said \"Are you nuts? What if you have the damn virus? You will board a plane full of passengers and go home to your wife who has a chronic condition? You are going to the hospital right this moment and getting tested!\" I then called my sister and told her if he tests positive, she will not be going to Ankara to care for him because, she is vulnerable and that I will be going instead. Yeah, I pulled rank... We'll see if she will obey the orders though... She said she was an adult and stuff like that but, I ended the conversation by saying that if she manages to die before I do, due to some sillyness and ignorance like this, I will jump off a roof and follow her around till eternity yacking away all these stupid stuff. Here is a risk she will not want to take I think.The apartment in Ankara is quiet large and I can isolate BIL in their bedroom which has a bathroom. I can put a TV table right outside his door and serve him his meals. Then my sister says, she has ridden in the car with a guy working for him who just got tested positive. I asked her if she was wearing an N95 mask and she said \"no, just a regular surgical mask\". I lost it again! Now, I am worried if she has caught the darn virus.... Sigh...While we were talking on the phone, my BIL went to the hospital where they gave him an IV to bring his temperature down because, by the time he reached the hospital, he was running a serious fever. They also gave him a tomography and two different COVID tests one being the quick test. Thankfully, his lungs are clean but, guess what? He tested positive!He is feeling good and he asked none of us to go to Ankara as long as he feels fine. I am OK with that. I wonder what was going to happen, if I hadn't made him go get tested. He probably would have visited his folks to say goodbye and infect them as well. Normally, they are level headed people but...So, now COVİD hit my family too and I will be worried sick till he tests negative."},

I have been trying to fill a position for the last 8 weeks or so. The Customer is a technology company and my candidate was a highly competent technical lady. She has passed all the interviews with flying colors but, thit the wall in the assesment. The position is a technical managerial position and apparently her management skills were not sufficient. Anyway, the boss wanted to work with her so, he went out of his way to make this deal happen.Meanwhile, an economic crisis happened in December and the inflation rate sky-rocketed quickly. Everybody lost their minds and people started changing jobs for extraordinary pay levels in technology. Then, companies started offering high increases in pay levels to stop their employees from leaving their jobs.Today, finally the Customer prepared it's offer to my candidate and she refused it! I tried to show her that the offer was indeed a good one but, she wouldn't budge. She made a counter offer that has been rejected by the Customer. My efforts? Down the drain! Ugh!I decided to bury my sorrow in pizza and dozed off after dinner. Carbs you know...I woke up to my phone ringing and realized that the caller was the candidate! She told me, she considered the offer again and talked to her husband and decided to take it! Say what? How childish is this? How unprofessional? Instead of flatly refusing the offer and making a ridiculuous counter offer, ask for a day to consider it. Discuss it with whoever you want to discuss it with. This is not child's play. I told her, I will relay the info to my friend who is the owner of the business. She has a friendly relationship with the boss who wanted to hire this candidate.My friend called the boss and told him that \"we\" tried to change the candidate's mind and that she would take the offer. If I were the boss, I would not although I do hope, they will because, this way I can be paid, too. Otherwise, it is back to square one. If she gets hired, I am sure there will be some bitter feelings towards her at least for a while. What do you say dear blogosphere friends?"},

(The \"official\" inflation rate is 20something% but, it really is well over 40% ). There is an incremental pricing scheme. Luckily, it looks like I am not exceeding the first increment.Today, I read that the first increment was increased due to the high number of complaints. I guess they will find something else to rob people. Sigh... Have I ever told you how I hate the current government? They have totally screwed the economy.

The third Pharmacy told me they had a lot of that particular medicine so, I jumped in the car and went there. I bought 10 boxes which will last me 200 days. I paid out of pocket because, this particular med was never put on my medical record and therefore Social Security does not pay for it. I would have fixed the issue but then COVID hit and I have always been buying this one out of pocket. When I go to Ankara end of March, I will go see this doctor and ask him to put this on my medical record. It's about time, I stop paying the full amount. Normally, I should be paying just 10 or 20 %, I am not sure.I know these types of pills are not sold OTC in the US.

I actually passed the hour mark by 20 minutes and the apartment is not looking as bad as it was. However, I think, I need another hour and a half go at this before starting to deep clean each room. I promised myself that, by the end of the week,  I will have cleaned the apartment thoroughly.

Lol!We, as a nation enjoy some salty drinks; the most popular being \"Ayran\" and the other \"Salgam Suyu\". Ayran is easy to make. Plain yogurt, salt and water. You add salt first and gradually add water making it a homogeneous thickish mixture. It should not be lumpy. I prefer this over any other drink. The other is trickier to make. You need the right kind of turnips, red beets and purple carrots. You clean and cut up the root veggies, put them in a jar, add a handful of chickpeas and bulgur wheat and pour over salty water. Salt should not have iodine in it. I used rock salt sold for pickling. Every day you need to \"burp\" it, till it's done. Usually it takes three weeks.I had never made this before, so, I decided to give it a go. We'll see, how it will turn out. I was out of bulgur. I am going to buy some tomorrow and add to my jar.Whenever I am in the US, I buy Classic V8 and that is another salty drink I love.I will also make sauerkraut with red cabbage. This is also another first for me. After the open produce market, I went to the fish market and picked up two slices of salmon, a slice of swordfish and half a kilo of mackerel. Swordfish will be dinner tomorrow. The rest will go into the freezer. I was so hungry, I had a fish sandwich and a Salgam Suyu at the fish market so, I decided against having fish for today's dinner.Do you like pickles and fermented veggies?  How about fish? I forgot to take pictures so, here are some sample pictures I found online. Mind you, it was extremely crowded today. I acted fast and got out of the produce market at once although, it is open. Just covered on top."},

I did a pretty decent job.I had started knitting myself a sleeveless house sweater but, I decided I needed smaller sized knitting needles. I had brought all of mom's needles so, it was easy to find the size I needed. I am not a great knitter but, having inherited tons of yarns from mom, I feel compelled to do something with them. I found a simple pattern and I am knitting the sweater with that.Lately, I have not been weighing myself because of having eaten way too much while I was with my SIS, BIL and uncle but today, I decided that enough is enough. Yes, sadly, I have gained close to three pounds but, that is much better than I suspected. I need to go back to exercising.

Who knows how long it has been since my windows were washed, and when everything was pulled and cleaned underneath (beds, washer, dishwasher, refrigerator)? There are nooks and crannies which require kneeling down which is something I am no longer able to do. My oven definitely needs to be cleaned thoroughly. What if I do one room a day?

I love my SIS to the moon and back but, it is kind of stressful to be there for more than a few days. I love to cook for them but BIL has the most sensitive nose as if he had been a dog in a previous life. They have a very traditional palate and that means one needs to sautee onions for almost everything we cook. He can't stand the smell of onions so, I was mostly doing the cooking earlier in the day and then airing the whole apartment all day while working. They like a limited number of things and my SIS makes it extra difficult by asking for Mom's Pizza and BIL's Mom's chocolate cake. I make very decent pizza but, it is so much different than Mom's. She used to make a thick though and used sauteed minced meat or white cheese (think feta without the smell) as main toppings. Well, thankfully, I have survived both challenges. Uncle is going to be here till next week but, after he leaves, I do not think, I will be cooking anything for a while. Salads and sandwiches only, thank you very much!The Aegean coast is known for the Mediterrenean cuisine and they use tons of greens we do not even get to see in other cities. Some of those greens are picked from the valleys and mountains. As we were touring around Izmir, I quickly ran into a farmers market and  bought a mixture of greens to sautee, of course with onions, and the guy told me there were 10 different things in it. I have had that in restaurants but, I was happy to buy it and make it myself. I brought that back home with me. I also bought a couple of other things like artichoke hearts, green, fresh fava beans. I cooked the hearts and left some for SIS and BIL. This week will be a pleasant change for my tummy heavy on the veggies and leafy greens.Another quite busy week ahead of me!

He is a Pharmacisit and he also had a medical company for quite a while dealing with cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons. I still made an appointment to see a cardiologist just for peace of mind.I went in yesterday and the Doc doesn't think it is serious either but, on Monday they will hook me up with a holter monitor for 24 hours. Due to my age, the menapause, BP, Type 2 Diabetes and my mom's history with heart vessel stents, he also told me it would be wise to have a tomography sometime but, there is no rush for it.Today, I am taking it easy. I have two dolls my dad's uncle brought from France in early 70's. My grandma sew and knitted outfits for them. They sit on a shelf in my library. I realized that, they have gotten rather dusty and dirty. So, I gave both my girls a bath and washed their outfits. I also started knitting myself a sleeveless sweater with the yarn mom bought but never got to knit. Never tried that before. When I get to the harder parts of it, I will put them away to take them to a friend of mine who can help me with the arms and the neck.I have dinner already planned. Except for the panko dipped chicken pieces which will go in the oven along with sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash, everything is ready. I am planning to make a veggie soup with the squash. I have other veggie bits to add to the soup.Hope everybody is having a relaxing weekend."},

I should have come home on Saturday or Sunday.Today, I went to visit the elderly couple who used to be my parents' good friends from our old neighborhood in the morning. The lady likes to vent a little bit from time to time and she does not have the opportunity to do so because, nowadays noone wants to visit elderly people due to COVID. I never took of my mask and kept my distance during the half hour I spent there. I took her to a quick grocery run and hit the road. As usual, I made good time up until the last 30 Km. Then, it was bumper to bumper slow traffic. As I was watching TV and relaxing, I dosed off. I must have been exhausted.I have two loads of laundry I must put away before uncle gets here tomorrow. I also need to make the guest bed tonight.Tomorrow, I will quickly dust and vacuum the floors before I go to the airport to pick him up.I bought two tickets to the NASA Space Adventure Exhibition on Friday. I do not know if he will enjoy it but, nerdy side of me surely will. Haha!I have not been able to read many of my favorite blogs lately so, I must catch up on them soon. Oh! BTW, I am officially on the payroll of the association as a part-time consultant as of today."},
{"title": "Feelings Associated with Certain Times of the Year", "date": "Sunday, December 12, 2021", "text": "When I was a kid, we celebrated the New Year by decorating our home (no tree though, Dad didn't approve because we were not Christian) and exchanging gifts. Mom would cook special dishes and we always had chocolate cake right at midnight.  Early December, I remember being excited with anticipation of the coming New Year, gifts and family time. January 1st, has always been a bittersweet day for me because, well what is left to look forward to now? And then, one day, sometimes even as early as March, I would go outside and smell a difference in the air, feel some warmth and I would be filled with joy for the arrival of Spring. I would start looking forward to ditching the bulky clothes and spending more time outside. Once Spring rolled around and my allergies started bothering me, all I could look for was Summer Break which meant going somewhere by the sea or to my Grands on my Mom's side or both. That was the best! Spending time at Grandparents and going to the seaside was just awesome.Once, August appeared on the horizon, I would be ready to go back to school and see my friends again.  The first days of school were always exciting and interesting with meeting new teachers. We would try to find out about them from other students who knew them and would talk about what would be the hardest subject that year. Two weeks into the school year, things used to become routine.Then one day possibly in early October, I would just go outside and again smell the change in the air and be excited that Fall was on it's way. Fall has always been my favorite season. I remember walking in Kizilay, one of the longest avenues of Ankara during a Fall afternoon smelling wet fallen leaves after a short rain shower. I can still feel that experienceWe celebrated birthdays but, never made a big deal out of them. Usually practical gifts and cake. Sometimes, a small number of close friends too.There were and still are two religious holidays celebrated nationwide but, honestly I really did not care for them. Their dates change every year due to the lunar calendar. Mom would always buy us new shoes and outfits before those holidays and some kids would be so looking forward to that but, I have never cared for clothing items much. During those 3-4 day religious holidays, we would get together with the family, eat way too much and visit other family members but, when you are a child and when they make you run around fetching things and setting the table, serving the visitors and helping the adults, it is not much fun. Is it? Now that I do not believe in or practice any religion, those days are just vacation days. Besides, my family is very small these days.We also have secular National holidays (April 23rd, May 19th, August 30th and October 29th) to celebrate and I love them but, they are usually just a day ,unless they come right before or after a weekend. One day, in 1989, I found myself all grown up and changing my first job. I would be starting my new job on January 2nd and they would be sending me to New York for 6 months (turned out to be three years and a half) in March. That year I did not have the January 1st blues, trust me.I started my new job on January 2nd and as soon as I walked in, they turned me around and put me in a company car with a driver to go apply for my US visa. When I asked what was the rush, they told me I would be flying to NYC that coming Sunday, January 7th. What? It was supposed to be March. I called my Dad and he was tongue tied. I then called my Mom. She was as cool as a cucumber as they say and she told me she would take a day off to do some shopping for me and start packing my suitcase. What happened that week is a post in itself but, let's skip that for now.When I spent over three years in the US, I fell in love with all the events and holidays such as St. Patrick's, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas (not a fan of Valentine's Day. Lol!) Even though, I am living in my own country for almost 30 years now, I still get filled with joy during the Holidays and there are so many milestones in a given year making me feel this way.Some can argue that the holidays in the US are a symbol of consumerism but, I do not care.  I love how people are so happy and willing to decorate for every occassion and celebrate. Starting with Halloween, it is such a festive and happy time. As I type these, Christmas Music is playing in the background and I am kicking myself for forgetting to buy some hot chocolate mix. I am so in the mood for the Holidays. Uncle and I will be joining my SIS and BIL for the New Year and will spend some time together. To me, it is all about having a good time either with family or friends because, I do not remember most of the gifts I have been given but, I always do fondly remember how I felt on a certain occasion."},

It is no longer a possibility but rather a reality because, we mutually agreed on working together. I am actually excited about this.On my other part-time job, there is good news too. The Client loved today's candidate. It was a great interview and the young woman totally impressed the HR Manager and the Head of the Group but, we are still at the beginning of this process. There are two upper level managers and an assesment to go through. Also, they need to agree on the salary and benefits.

I consider them my nieces and am so proud of them. My friend and her husband are both Electronic Engineers and they have been amazing parents all through their kids' lives.We reminisced about old days and laughed a lot. I am glad we both had the time. Later in the afternoon, I attended an interview of one of my short list candidates with the Client. He was very talkative and had told me all about his projects in detail, during our one-on-one but, today, he was a different man. I do not know. I would assume, one would sit down and prepare for an interview, list down the points to talk about, some successful projects and her/his contribution. Apparently, not. So, this one was a bust. I will call the next candidate and tell her how to prepare for this interview. Sigh...I will be meeting babyhood friends tomorrow. Hope, everyone has a nice week!"},

Lol! I should lise a bunch of weight before I go and visit them. So, far, the list includes Zucchini Quiche, Lasagna, Cinnamon Rolls, Cig Borek and Homemade Pizza. 4 Cinnabon Stores opened in Istanbul so, I may actually buy Cinnabon and take it to Izmir rather than making them.

{"title": "New Heater", "date": "Saturday, December 4, 2021", "text": "Today, the contractor's workers arrived right on time at 9:30 a.m. and set to work. They had to overcome some difficulties due to the limited space behind the kitchen cabinets but, they did a stellar job and did a nice cleaning so that, tomorrow,  the cleaning lady will have to deal with just a bit of dust. They were very nice men too. So, I bought them lunch and also tipped them. They so deserved it. After they left around 2:30 p.m., I called their boss and thanked him too and praised his workers. He too was pleased. He told me, they will schedule the gas company visit for project approval on Friday and the authorized support crew to do one last control and start the warranty on Saturday for me.While the work was in progress, the window guys came to install a vent on one of the windows as a requirement of the gas company. The windows are double-glass so, it was a bit tricky but, they also did a good job and cleaned up after themselves.I had shut off the old heater last night and during the installation we kept opening and closing the windows and balcony doors so, the apartment got real chilly. I turned on the heater and napped for an hour or two under a blanket. Now, it is warm and real nice.My BFF who lives in upstate New York and I just watched another episode of Spooks and I am almost ready to go to bed. The 8 hour time difference is a bit hard to manage but, so far, we have been doing well.I have scheduled a few get togethers with old friends next week and I have a bit of a work to do too. Today, I washed uncle's bed cover and shams in his room. The cleaning lady will change his sheets which I will wash and put away before I leave. I asked him if he wanted a warmer comforter on his bed and he said no. I guess, he will not be coming to Ankara during the cold weather. Uncle will be coming to Istanbul to stay for a while before the New Year's and, we shall go to Izmir to spend the New Year with my SIS and BIL. After that, he will possibly fly back to Antalya and I will drive back to Istanbul.This is going to be a busy month. Hope, everyone is enjoying the first weekend of the last month in 2021. Time flies by, doesn't it?"},
{"title": "December Goals", "date": "Friday, December 3, 2021", "text": "A few days ago, I weighed myself and realized that I had gained 2 pounds! What! I shouldn't have been surprised though. I was not exercising as much as I used to and I was eating more carbs than I should.I must lose those pounds and if possible some more before our New Year's family dinner. I also need to exercise at least 5 days a week. I am positive I will be able to lose those 2 pounds quickly.I also keep telling myself I should track my grocery expenses for a whole month to see where my money is going but, I have never been able to do it properly. Now that all prices are sharply rising due to poor economic management of the country.So, my health and my grocery spending are my top priorities this month. Even though, it is just 3 days into the month, I am happy to report that I have exercised every day this month. I also went back to journaling my meals on an app. This helps me a lot to stay focused. I grocery shopped today and kept the receipt. I will add a sheet to my budget Excel file and start making a price list as I note the cost lof each item there.I remember having read that it takes anywhere between 2-8 months to form a new habit. I must track my exercise and journaling till they become real habits. Now, gotta go and deal with the kitchen. Some spaces need to be cleared, so that the contractor can do his thing without obstacles. My SIS and BIL owe me big time. Lol! I told them they will have to buy me an expensive dinner and my BIL said, they would need to gift me the whole restaurant. Lol! It is a hassle but, who else could deal with this? They work crazy hours and barely have time to take a couple of weeks off each year for vacation. The MIL and FIL are very sickly. Every month, they come to visit them. Besides, I love my SIS to the moon and back. There is nothing  I can't do for her."},
{"title": "The Deed is Done... The Heater on Saturday", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2021", "text": "Yesterday, I drove to Konya with my friend who has been given the power of attorney for the sale of the share. We set out at 7 a.m. and by 11:30, it was all done! I got my deed. We then went to see the property and see if the grates were properly installed. As I was taking pictures of the grates, a young man stepped out of the new building next door and inquired whether we will be making renovations or sell it. I told him that we have no idea of how much it is worth and that since I live out of town, I haven't inquired about it yet. We exchanged numbers and he told me he will inquire about the value and let me know. Apparently, he may be interested in buying the property. Once I hear from him, I will inquire about the property value through different sources too.My friend and I had lunch and I asked her if she wanted to see some of the historic places She wanted to go see Mevlana Museum. Mevlana was a 13th Century Sufi mystic and poet originally from Persia. He is mostly known as Rumi . His followers founded the Order of the Whirling Dervishes which is an interesting ceremony for many. It just triggers my vertigo. The Museum is next to the cemetery where my grandpa was buried. I told her, I would rather go visit grandpa. So, we split and did our own thing. We made it back home before 6 p.m.The heater will be installed on Saturday. I asked my SIS to call the cleaning lady for Sunday or Monday. The Gas Company will come to approve the project next Friday and hopefully, I will be able to go home to Istanbul over next weekend.Meanwhile, I realized that I have gained 2 pounds. It is because I am not exercising enough these days and have been eating more carbs than usual. So, I am going back to my exercise routine right after I finish typing and posting this. I ate a two egg omelette with cheese, shredded zucchini and dill weed for lunch. Dinner is going to be smoked salmon and avocado/arugula salad with a little flat bread. I gotta go exercise and then, work a little bit now."},
{"title": "The Heater Saga Continues", "date": "Tuesday, November 30, 2021", "text": "Today, a very nice gentleman came to give me an estimate on the heater. Apparently, since 2008, regulations have been changed so, there is a little bit extra work that needs to be done. They will install new piping for the water that will be generated by the combi boiler (I keep referring to it as the heater but, that is what it is). A new type of gas valve needs to be installed both for the gas cooktop and for the new combi boiler. He gave me three options for my SIS and BIL to choose from. I also inquired about the price of the online controlling system. It would be nice to be able to heat the apartment before any of us come back here in the winter, through our cell phones. Armed with all the necessary info, I sent a detailed message to both of them. Once they decide what they would like to purchase, I will order it. I have been told, it will take about 3 hours on Friday or on Saturday. Then, the Natural Gas provider company will come and approve the installation next Friday. This is a company I have dealt with before. I think, 3-4 years ago, we bought mom's combi boiler from them. They have been in this business for quite some time so, I am hoping, they will do a decent job.I am so thankful for the Central Heating at my apartment complex. Tomorrow, my friend and I are going to complete the deed transfer transaction if all goes well. Now that, I am stuck here till the end of next week, I went grocery shopping. I will fix breakfast sandwiches for the road tomorrow and take a thermos full of hot water and some tea bags plus, instant coffee. I know, I know instant coffee is not the real thing. Just for the road trip since, it is going to be cold. There is a Fast Train between the two cities and many people prefer that nowadays so, there are no decent coffee stops on the way. All rural, with small villages, quiet a boring road.I was planning to go to the cemetery today but, it is a rainy day, so I will do that next week.On Sunday night, I sent the short list of candidates to the Client. I expected a \"thank you, we will look at them and let you know\" kind of a short message. At least to acknowledge receipt of the mail right? No, nada! It is so sad to see even the smallest bits of decency are vanishing. Is it that hard?"},
{"title": "Why? Why? Why?", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2021", "text": "I came to Ankara yesterday to deal with the piece of property which I have mentioned in a previous post.Due to COVID, now all applications are online which is a great opportunity..... Well.... Only, if the system works. The application was delayed until 5:30 p.m. which means, we cannot go to Konya and handle the in person part of the process which is signing paperwork, tomorrow.One day delay no problem, right? I am not upset about that. Not muchanyway but,..........Bigger problem is that, when I arrived yesterday, I turned on the heater and it started leaking. SIS and BIL called a service provider to fix it but, apparently they have called an unauthorized company, or rather a scammer. So, a fast \"service\" and a bunch of money later, the thing is still leaking. I only realized that the guys were scammers after they left.  Sİnce the heater kept leaking, I got suspicious and remembered that I did not see the logo of the product on their work gear and decided to check the authorized service providers and voila! I should have been smarter about this but, 5 hours of driving on 4 hours of sleep does that to you.So, I called an authorized service provider today. They came, looked at the heater and told me it would be expensive to fix it. I relayed the information to SIS and BIL. They decided to purchase a new heater. Fine... But, that also means, I cannot leave Ankara when I am done with my own thing. The present heater is leaking and until a new heater is installed, there is no way for me to go. Thinking that I would be here only biriefly, I haven't brought much stuff. Looks like I have several light loads of laundry ahead of me.Now, my SIS and BIL were here three weeks in September. and then they were here couple of weeks ago. Uncle was here for about 10 days or so recently. So, why does the darn heater decide to kick the bucket when I am here? Couldn't he (it must be a man) break down while others were here? Arrrgh!I am glad, I brought the food items that could spoil. At least, when I go back home, I will not have to deal with rotten vegetables and moded cheese.Hope, you are having a better day..."},
{"title": "Thoughts on Retirement, Part Time Work and Change", "date": "Saturday, November 27, 2021", "text": "I am afraid this will be a long post. So, if you do not have the time, you're welcome to skip it. However, I will appreciate all the input or advice you may have to offer on my thought process below.Most of you may know, I am retired and I do like to be retired but, it is also kind of boring.  Even so, until recently, I wasn't really willing to take on work even part-time. However, the recent developments in the country made me think harder about this.I have saved a nice nest egg to complement my retirement income but, with what's hapening in the country lately, I am concerned that we are headed to a hyper inflation period. Nobody understands why the current government is taking the country to an economical doom. It is a complicated story so, I am not going to dive into the details of it but, the economy is a mess. Here is a simple piece of info to show you how bad things have become:USD 1= 1.91 TL end of 2011USD 1 = 3.52 TL end of 2016USD 1 = 12.08 TL last Friday and this happened within a few months. It used to be around 7 or 8 TL earlier in the year.My nest egg consists of  USD (60%), TL(22%), Gold and a small amount of Euros. So, I can say that, my nest egg increased in value with the increase of USD but, that does not mean much. I never want to dip into the non-TL part of my nest egg until after the age of 70 or better yet 75. I have been supplementing my pension with mostly the interest I was earning on the TL portion of it. This year, I had to dip into the principal but, not significantly.The president of the country (the p is not capital intentionally just to show how much I \"like\" him) is the kind of person capable of doing anything just to stay in power. He is creating a big divide between the  people which may lead to civil unrest so that he can declare a State of Emergency to avoid general elections in 2023. If that does not happen, he is prepared to take the country to war with one of the neighboring countries. That could also be a reason for a State of Emergency. This is how bad the situation is.Part of the reason why I am so concerned about the future is that, our family is small but, other than my SIS and BIL, the rest are not well of and their lives may become harder down the line. They may need some financial assistance (although it is extremely hard to convince them to accept such help). Besides, there are already some health issues in the family. I sincerely hope and wish, we shall never need to spend loads of money for health reasons. I would rather have us use it for good days. So, I am seeing my money sort of like an insurance for the whole family in the long run too. This does not mean that I will not spend my hard earned money on myself. I still would like to travel, enjoy vacations and family get togethers. I guess, I was able to give you dear readers (who has loads of patience to read this)  a summary of my situation. So, you see the thought of additional income has all of a sudden become \"interesting\" while I still do not want to go back to working full time.Some of you may know that, I was complaining that I was sucked into a part-time IT Recruitment job, I had a bad experience  with last time and decided not to continue doing it early this year. The owner of the company is a friend and she practically begged me to consider it once again a month ago. I accepted one project that requires finding two senior level positions and laid down my rules and my friend  agreed to them. So far, the job did not make me stressed yet. We are at the verge of submitting our Short List to the Client. It can go downhill from here like last time or it can go smoothly. I have diligently selected the candidates to be submitted so, I am hoping for a smooth sail. We'll see. If this project is successful, I will receive a nice chunk of money that will enable me not to touch my nest egg or rather the interest generated by the TL portion of it next year. My initial motivation was to just do this one project and call it quits. I just realized, it doesn't have to be that way. My friend assured me, I can take on as little work as I like and doing one project at a time is not all that time consuming. So, may be it is now a good idea to keep on doing it for a while at my own pace.Recently, I have also been approached by a medical association, a non profit organization whose President is the husband of a High School mate. They needed someone business minded to oversee their operation on a part-time basis. We had a meeting a week or so ago and he and a couple of other doctors told me about their organization in detail. I like how involved they are in their field and how much more can be done. Their only problem is that they cannot pay me much. Instead of saying \"no\", I thought about what I would be willing to do for them at that payment level. The pay is almost symbolic but, with the economy tanking badly, a regular additional income might not be so bad after all. Right? Besides, I think this is the kind of thing that will make me feel good about myself.I have always wanted to volunteer for a nice cause but, I am not as selfless as the people who throw themselves fully into the cause they believe in without expecting anything in return. I am sure, I have mentioned about being a bit selfish before. So, I figured I could do this on a half-paid, half volunteer basis. This morning, the President of the organization called me and I told him  how we can make this work. I cannot be available as much as they want due to the small pay but, I can act as a consultant and we can  tackle a a couple of projects at a time on my terms. I can participate in their management meetings and offer them guidance, ways to improve certain processes and generally my experience as a consultant who has a business background. I will also help them deal with international relations. They need someone with language skills to build bridges between sister organizations in other parts of the world. I can do that.The President wants to work with me so, he will take this to the Board and let me know what the they say. So, this still may or may not happen. Either way, I am cool with it.I know I was very reluctant to work initially, but, adapting to change is a must in life. I also consider it a true skill to cope with change. I will still be the boss of most of my time. Besides, I am not using all this spare time in a productive manner anyway. Perhaps if I lived in a peaceful part of the world, it would have been different. They say geography is your fate. I guess it is true. So, what do you think Dear Readers?"},

I put them up in the Cloud and gave the link to my family.Few days ago, when my sister was looking  at some pictures from our parents' engagement party she called me and said \"Do you realize, in those pictures our grandma on our dad's side was two years year younger than you are now and our other grandma was two years younger than I am now?\" Wow! They looked so elegant, so matronly and for the life of me, I could not imagine myself and my sister posing like that. A fun fact is that uncle was a 7 year old boy in those engagement party pictures. Lol!I have never been married and although my sister is married, she does not have kids. I guess that is part of the reason why we do not realize our ages. We do not have kids and grandkids in our lives as most of our friends do. Our lives are not much different than what they used to be when we were in our twenties or thirties. May be, it is also the way people dress nowadays. Jeans, T-Shirts and sneakers are our go to attire. Back in the 60's and 70's, people dressed differently.Meanwhile here is the truth: We are aging! Wow! We have health problems. We no longer enjoy certain things we used to enjoy when we were younger like loud music, cramped restaurants and bars (pre-COVID of course). I am going to turn 55 next year and my sister will turn 48. We have both quit coloring our hair. My sister's hair is all gray. My temples are all gray and the rest of my hair is still a dark brown with a few gray strands. SIS now needs reading glasses. I always had glasses because I have myopia since I was 8.When did all this happen?"},
{"title": "A Quick Trip Next Week", "date": "Monday, November 22, 2021", "text": "Finally, the 5 year wait is up for me to take over 1/3 of the house in Konya. To make a long story short, the house was left to my mom and two uncles by their parents. When my younger uncle was having trouble with his business, I wanted to take over his share but, someone told me that if he sells to a family member, it could be questioned during the liquidation of his business. So, a friend of mine took his share over. No money exchanged hands, the property sales tax was paid by yours truly. If my friend had sold me that share within the 5 years following the sale, she would have had to pay a ridiculuous income tax so, we decided to wait. As of last month, she is exempt from that tax. Therefore, I can now \"buy\" this share. Again, there will not be any money exchange, just the property sales tax.So, this coming Sunday, I will be going to Ankara. My friend gave power of attorney for the sale of \"her\" share to another friend of mine who will come with me to Konya. It will be a day trip from Ankara, just three hours each way. When the transaction is completed, I will own 5/6 of the house and my SIS owns the remaining 1/6th. We both inherited mom's share and with this transaction, I will have purchased everybody else's shares. My late uncle's family (older uncle) wanted to sell their share a few years ago and I had bought it.The house is in shambles and there is no way we would like to spend money to make it liveable again. So, it will be sold one day. We haven't put it up for sale yet. Uncle looked for a few real estate agents while he was there but, I would not put it up for sale during the winter anyway. Some people keep breaking into the house so, there were a couple of broken windows and the doors and windows need reinforcements. Uncle hired a guy to put up basic grates and replace the broken windows. There was still some stuff in the house such as office desks, chairs and what not. Uncle also hired a junk dealer to come and clean those up. Once the grates are installed, at least it will not be broken into. Who knows if they are dealing or doing drugs in there. I am not sure if these will be all done when I go next week.I have been gradually cleaning up kitchen cupboards/cabinets and drawers so, I just did not feel like cooking today. I had leftover chili and a pancake for lunch. Dinner was a piece of grilled salmon and some chips with a bottle of beer. I do not consume much alcohol anymore but, today I wanted to have a small bottle of beer. When I was younger, I could handle alcohol better. Especially after menopause, not so much. I am not moving as much as I want to because, my sleep is quite out of whack and I feel miserable during the day. I must go to bed around 11 o'clock whether I fall asleep or not. Starting tonight, I will do that.As for work, I have my short list ready to be submitted to the client. I must write 5 short reports. No big deal. I have been very diligent in selecting the candidates. Only 6-7 people out of about 90. I am just hoping that they will hire at least one. They are looking for 2.Hope, everyone has a nice week!"},
{"title": "Holiday Season for Me and My Family", "date": "Saturday, November 20, 2021", "text": "This is my favorite time of the year in the US. Last time I was there, I made sure I spent the entire Holiday Season. I came back home after the New Year. Here in Turkey, Halloween is an imported occasion and only a handful people celebrate it and I am sure most of the population don't even know about it. Thanksgiving is obviously not a thing over here as well.Most of the population is Muslim so, no Christmas celebration either but, we do love the decorations so, you can see Christmas decorations for celebration of the New Year starting in December. Many people frown upon this, saying that this is a Christian celebration but, people who enjoy the celebration of the New Year and the decorations, do not care about their opinion. Lol!I like to decorate my home a little. So did Mom and so does SIS. I have a lot of small decorative items I bought from the US and here in Turkey. I do not decorate a tree because, honestly, I am lazy and my apartment is not even big enough for all the stuff I already own. This year I will be visiting my sister for the New Year so, I doubt I will decorate at all. May be only a few pieces on the entertainment center and on my family room windows.I love the Thanksgiving food, a nicely roasted turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, sweet potatoes and a pumpkin pie. Even when I am by myself, I roast a whole turkey but, my family prefers roasted chicken. So, this year I will be making that for them. My sister told me she wants only the roasted chicken, the gravy and the stuffing from my Thanksgiving menu. The rest of the dishes will be food everybody likes. Circassian chicken (shredded chicken, finely chopped walnuts, bread crumbs, fat free chicken stock), Russian salad (mayo, diced cucumber pickles, diced carrots, potatoes, peas), rice stuffed grape leaves (she will buy those). I do not know if she will make or buy the dessert. They are not fans of pies so, I am thinking she will make a chocolate cake mom used to love. Or she may want me to make cinnamon rolls. (I told her Cinnabon opened three stores in Istanbul and TGIF is also back. She now wants to come visit me).I may make my menu after the New Year when I get back home. Lol! We'll see.I miss the season in the US but, darn COVID and darn Government (USD has doubled up against TL since my last trip), a trip to the US is not possible this year. May be next year. Who knows?Thankfully, my BFF who lives upstate NY and I talk thru WhatsApp almost every day and we watch crime dramas together online. So, although I miss being there, I do not miss her because we are in touch all the time. She started this tradition right after my mom's passing and we kept it up. Now, she has some family concerns and I am trying to be there for her. Being 5000 miles apart is not an obstacle to be besties. We have known each other since 1990 and back then, she was like a big sister to me when I was having trouble with my ex-boyfriend whom she still \"lovingly\" calls Shithead.When we met, we immediately clicked. I am also good friends with her husband who is a lot older than I am. They are truly wonderful people. We have traveled together, they came to visit me, went skiing in NY and in Canada, or just stayed home and watched movies during all these years. I love to cook for them. True friends can be anywhere. Right? I just sent them a small Thaksgiving gift for the whole family to enjoy. She always has her whole family for Thanksgiving and her niece handles Christmas. I know the rest of her family well and we are also friendly too. After I got bitten by her nephew's dog, they told me I officially became part of the family, because the little devil bit everybody. Lol!I better post this and go to bed before midnight for once. Hope, everyone is having a nice and relaxing weekend."},
{"title": "Gray Sky, Windy, Dark Day", "date": "Thursday, November 18, 2021", "text": "Today is one of those boring dark Fall days. When sun is out, it is always cheerful and nice.My freezer and fridge are well stocked. I do not think, I will need to buy anything till the end of the month except for yogurt and may be some fresh veggies.I had bought couple of bunches of spinach a few days ago and I am washing it. Have I ever told you I hate washing fresh spinach (and purslane too). Waste of so much water. It is sold in pre-washed packages too but, I like the root part as well so, I always buy fresh bunches. I will sautee it with a little onion, add a handful of rice and minced/chopped meat (pre-sauteed) and cook it with a little tomato sauce. I usually serve this with plain yogurt (garlic or not). Yum!My grocery store started offering a store brand frozen pizza. I wanted to give it a shot. So, when saw that they were BOGOF, I decided to give it a shot. At such a low price it was worth it. I put one in the freezer and heated the other. It turned out to be very decent pizza but, next time I make it, I will add some sauce and cheese to the edges. Even then, at this price, I think it is worth it. My sister and her husband are in Antalya at a big resort hotel. The bank gathers all branch managers and senior managers every year for a conference. Last year, they did not do it due to COVID. I called them to ask how they were doing and as I understand that the management does not stuff them in boring meetings all day. They have free time till Friday morning and then, the General Manager is going to deliver a speech and they will check out in the afternoon. Apparently, the bank wants them to have free time, mingle and get to know others that they do not come to contact with. Yesterday, they even swam! SIS said it was a so so day but, that never stops our family to jump in the sea. We all like cold water. Once, mom and I went to this beautiful island in the Northern Aegean Sea. It was mid-March and the outside temp was 18 degrees C, and 64 degrees F. I was the only one swimming as people bundled up in jackets and coats came to watch me swim. Lol! Mom even decided to try the next day but, when the water was knee deep, she turned back and told me I must have been real crazy. Guess, I was a sea creature in a past life. Uncle went back to Antalya so, the kids (we refer to SIS and BIL as kids although they are 47 and 49) will be staying with him Friday and Saturday nights. Hope, the weather will be nice over there so that they can enjoy another couple of beach days."},

The kind of day you need to be under wraps with some hot chocolate and a good book and a nap later on. I did nap before my 4th interview because I had very little sleep last night. No hot chocolate though...Yesterday I tried a Southern dish: Chicken and dumplings. I found the recipe online but, I did not like the dumplings when I made it. Need a better recipe. Any recommendations?My sister and BIL are doing fine thankfully. However, tomorrow they are heading to a resort hotel for a two-day conference. Their bank does this annually but, they did not have the conference last year due to COVID. I just do not understand what changed. I think it is reckless to gather hundreds of managers from different cities just for a stupid conference.SIS and BIL will be wearing N95 masks under regular surgical masks. Still, I am worried.My BFF's sister is hospitalized due to Influenza H, a form of bacterial menengitis. I am very friendly with her too. Hope, she recovers and gets back home soon. My BFF and I have been wondering how she could have contracted it with all COVID precautions such as masks, sanitizers etc. She went in for her annual health check and got a flu shot before this. Gotta go and prepare dinner now. Have a good one!"},

Went across the bridge to the European side and met my friends at this beautiful, huge park. We walked a total of 13K steps but, it was nice and leisurely. There is a nice cafe so,we grabbed some lunch and sat in the sun outside. Normally our group consists of 5 people but, this time it was just three of us.I am glad we got together. I left them a little before 5 p.m. and got stuck in traffic. Sigh... It took me an hour and a half to get back home. Decided to quickly run into the grocery store and get veggies and sandwich fixings. I was famished when I got home so, I made myself a nice sandwich and my belly is happy now.It looks like the electricity was not out for long. I checked the cup in the freezer and the coin is still on top of the frozen water. Hope, everyone has a nice weekend!"},
{"title": "Electricity and water out on the same day?", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2021", "text": "I saw the sign for upcoming repairs on water pipes at our apartment complex for tomorrow about a week ago and made a mental note to fill a few buckets for flushing the toilet and a couple of big bottles to wash my hands. The day before yesterday, the electricity company sent an SMS for some planned maintenance for tomorrow for about 5 hours! What!!!??? I am sure the maintenance crew needs electricity for the pipe repairs so, I do not know what kind of a day tomorrow will be. Most probably the pipes will have to wait another day or two. I have already filled  buckets and bottles but, my plan is to escape from home. I will be meeting up with friends to go on a long walk and spend the day outdoors. It is chilly but, I am sure, by layering up, I can be comfortable.I am hoping that the freezer will be OK and the electricity will be available earlier than scheduled.Today, I had one load of laundry to be taken care of so, while I had water, I started that and just heard the washer chime telling me it's done. Time to go and hang them up on the drying rack. Tonight's dinner will be leftover homemade hummus from the day before. It will be dinner with some crackers and tea. Lunch was a salad with smoked salmon and capers. My BFF in the US is a teacher. This year she is totally fed up with misbehaving kids and ignorant parents and is seriously considering to retire making this school year her last. She already has her plate full at home so, I cannot blame her. After I hang up the laundry, I will call her so that, we can watch another episode of Spooks. Hope, everyone is having a good day!"},
{"title": "Do I need.....? Forget it!", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2021", "text": "The other day, I have fished out my hats, gloves and scarves and decided to keep them by my entrance either on the small table or in the closet right there. Then I started to look for a cute box or basket online. As always, it hit me within a few minutes into my search. I have more stuff lying around in this apartment than I need. There is a basket full of unnecessary stuff in the bathroom. Everything in it was collecting dust and I had covered it instead of sorting through the contents and getting rid of them. Just dumb...I finally emptied the basket and lined it with a piece of quilt someone gave me. No backing, just the quilt. I think it was a piece she made attending a local quilting class. It wasn't serving any purpose, now, it is. My hats, scarves and gloves have a new place in the entrance closet. Perfect! On one hand, I try purging stuff, on the other, I am looking for new things to buy. Why? I keep thinking about my grandparents who did with a lot less than I do. Everywhere I look, I see excess. Why do I have so many tablecloths? Why do I have so many mugs and glasses and kitchenware I barely use? Yes, some of them were gifts but, why keep them if I am not using them?  In addition to my dilemma, the items I use most frequently are in poor shape. Scratches, small cracks and yet I cannot part with them. I have a Pyrex baking dish with a lid that I bought back in 1990 from a Shop Rite in Yonkers, NY. Can you imagine? One of these days, I will solve this problem.... I hope...I made some sort of a tabouli for lunch and had it wrapped in lettuce. I use lots of finely chopped fresh parsley and peppers (Italian or Cubanas will do).Having a bean salad for dinner. I have some arugula to use up. I will chop it and add it to the bean salad. This is my first vegetarian day this week. I have decided to eat vegetarian meals at least two days a week. I am thinking of making an egg salad for lunch tomorrow. Got yogurt soup for dinner. May be soup and cheese topped sliced bread in the toaster oven for dinner? Sounds good for now. ---------------------------------------------------------------------After I typed the above, I took a break and  just spoke to my sister and freaked out completely. A guy with whom she went on customer visits last week, was tested COVID positive today! He was vaccinated so, he did not feel sick at all. He lost his sense of smell yesterday and then he went to get tested. Now, my sister is sharing a bed with her husband, they went to visit her in-laws over the weekend and they flew both ways! They went to a cardiologists office with her FIL! My uncle and they stayed in the same apartment! For the next 10 days or so, I will be a nervous wreck. She never takes her mask off when she is with other people but still, I am extremely worried. She had three Sinovac vaccines. I am hoping that she will be protected. So will others too of course.I begged her to use one N95, one regular mask on top of that from now on."},
{"title": "Saturday ", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2021", "text": "Spoke to my SIS today. My uncle told them that he did not think her FIL was doing well. It has been a while since he saw the FIL and he can notice the difference better. He told my SIS and BIL to take him to a cardiologist. They did today. Apparently his heart is beating too slowly. The doctor is taking him off one of his medications gradually. They also told her about the Alzheimer's and the drug they are now giving him. I guess that was interfering with one of his heart medications. I am glad his heart was checked out because, I am sure he did not go to his cardiologist since March 2019. Mom and I used to drag him along with us so, he had to go every six months. That was the last time we all went together. After mom's passing, I did not go to any doctor due to COVID till I had a check-up in Istanbul this year and now, I have a doctor here.I told my SIS to get one of those small pulse-ox devices so that, the caregiver can check his pulse every day.I did a load of laundry today. It never ends, does it? I find myself loading and unloading the diswasher and doing laundry constantly. When I was working, the diswasher would only be used may be once a week. All those dinners out and take-outs did not do a favor to my body but, it sure was easier.Tonight I am going to fix myself a smoked salmon and avocado toast or roll because I have a giant avocado that I must consume. Half of it will be saved for tomorrow. May be a burrito or on top of a rice and bean bowl? I had a vegetable soup with a small slice of whole wheat bread for lunch. The weather was very nice today but, it has turned now. The wind brought many clouds and we now have a gray sky.  When my uncle was here, he ordered a new backpack online. It was big and sturdy and the price was excellent so, I decided to order one for myself in a different color. I found the same exact bag with a 10% higher price at the same online platform. Then I looked up a few other places and guess what? I found it 15% cheaper than even what my uncle paid for it. What the....? I checked the seller and it turned out to be the same exact seller. So, I ordered it and it arrived today. It is the same bag. So, this seller is pricing his products differently at different platforms? I guess it is because of the commission he has to pay is different. But, increasing the price by 10% in a week? That doesn't sound right.I am happy with my purchase. My old PUMA backpack is about to kick the bucket. It is also not as big as this one I just got. I love my old backpack and will keep on using that for lighter duties. Gotta go and fold some laundry and put away. Hope, everyone is having a great weekend."},
{"title": "On Sphagetti Squash", "date": "Friday, November 5, 2021", "text": "I baked the sphagetti squash yesterday. I cut it up lengthwise and brushed olive oil before sticking it into the oven. When it was done, I used two forks to scoop up the \"sphagetti\". I left it in the skin and added pasta sauce from the freezer and some shredded cheese on top. Back to the oven till the cheese browned. I enjoyed it and it turned out really yummy. I think, while they still have them, I will grab a couple more. I am planning to make a veggie soup so, the remaining half will go into that. Yesterday I picked up extra boxes of Barilla pasta on sale, although I do not eat much pasta these days, I am sure on some cold days I will want some. I also found really soft persimmons and bought some. They are too sweet and possibly high in calories but, they are my splurge for the week. At their peak, they are extremely soft and do not transport well. Luckily, they are grown in areas around in Istanbul as well as other parts in the country.I have been feeling and acting very lazy lately. Gotta get back to an active lifestyle. Hope everyone has a nice weekend!"},

Feels more like the Spring than the Fall.I then did a quick grocery run and came back home. This time, I went to a different store just to see their prices. Opened the app on my phone for my favorite store and compared prices. All brand name items were almost the same. The store brands are inexpensive when compared to my favorite but, honestly, I like my store. When the price is right, when there is a BOGO type of sale on items I frequently buy, I take advantage of that. Gotta get my act together and take care of some organizing around my home so that, I can ask the new cleaning lady to come and work her magic.I found a bunch of things that cannot be given to charity and I will be cutting them up for rags. Price of paper products are off the roof these days so, using rags may save a few cents. There are a few projects in my mind. On top of my list is taking down the contents of the kitchen cabinets and sorting through them. This has been in my mind for so long that I need to take action soon. It will not take a whole a lot of time but, you know, I am lazy when it comes to house chores. My oven needs a good cleaning too. I typed the above and left my post as a draft for a few hours. Then, my sister just called to tell me that her MIL's caregiver had to be taken to the hospital due to high BP. Her FIL has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's so, sometimes he gets confused. When my SIS found out that he is taking the caregiver to the hospital, she asked my uncle to go see what's going on. Poor uncle could not even prepare his dinner. He went to the hospital and took my sister's FIL back home and will stay with the caregiver till she can be taken home in a few hours. Good thing that he flew there today. I wish it were a normal thing for elders to go to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in this country like it is in many others. Unfortunately, it is something frowned upon by most of the population and I know my BIL will never even consider it. That is why they have the caregiver. Now she is sick too. I hope, she will get better soon and treated for BP and she will not want to leave to go back to her country. BIL's father refused to move to Izmir with them when the bank placed my SIS and BIL in Izmir 7-8 years ago. They are both branch managers at the bank and they cannot take a few days off here and there so, they keep going to Ankara every three weeks on the weekends to check on them. It is a hard life for them and I am concerned about my sister too since she already has an autoimmune disease. Tomorrow they will be flying to Ankara for the weekend late at night.I worry about them but, that doesn't solve anything. Sigh..."},

Tomorrow we will go on a boat ride on the Bosphorus if the weather permits. My cleaning lady called me to say she is pregnant and that she will not be able to work for a while.

{"title": "Summer stuff out, Winter stuff in", "date": "Sunday, October 31, 2021", "text": "I just took down my trustworthy IKEA organizers to swap my summer clothing with the winter ones. Clothing items that are hung in my closet never get touched. They will keep on staying where they are hung. While I was at it, I found two brand new sweaters I bought last year and could not wear due to my size, along with two t-shirts. One, a turtleneck, the other a basic T. I asked my uncle to try them on and they fit him perfectly. These things still had tags on. Now, they have found a new owner who can actually wear them. Perfect! Due to my size, I shop men's clothing and pick up unisex items. I took out my winter clothes. As I get older, I need a lot less than I used to. However, I am hoping to lose more weight and need more new clothes. Lol! With that said, I am happy to report that I have lost another 3 pounds since last time I reported my weight. I think Intermittent Fasting and metformin are helping me lose weight. When you eat only two meals a day, controlling the calories is easier. Besides, I am mindful of what I am eating. I like sweet treats like most people but, I stay away from processed and packaged ones. I also have decided to be choosy. For instance, you can get baklava even in grocery stores but, they are mediocre to me. In my opinion, there are only a couple of places that make it really well. So, unless the treat I am having is really something worthwhile and special to eat, I will not touch it. When I do, I eat half or even less of it than I would normally eat. I am not feeling deprived of anything really and I think, I will stick to this for life.Friday was a National Holiday, the 98th Anniversary of the foundation of the Republic of  Turkey so, uncle and I went out to see the celebrations. It was a nice and sunny day so, we even sat by the sea and had sandwiches for lunch. We walked around quiet a bit, 16K steps with small breaks and watched the parade. It took us a while, to get back home but, it was totally worth it.One his HS buddies invited uncle over for an early dinner so, I am going to drive him there in a couple of hours. Hope, everyone had a good weekend."},

Lo and behold I found my sphagetti squash! My uncle doesn't think he will like it so, I will cook it when he goes to Ankara. Lol! Uncle has been having a good time in Istanbul seeing his friends and walking around. Tomorrow we will go to a Big Cat Park. It has been his dream to hold and pet a big cat cub and he may get a chance to do it tomorrow but, we do not know yet. I had to work for a few hours today and have a meeting tomorrow morning.

{"title": "Question for One Family One Income", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2021", "text": "This post is meant for the writer of the One Family One Income so, the rest of you may skip reading this one. If you have any insight to offer on dual citizenship and taxes, please do comment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi!I remember you writing about filing tax forms for your sister living in Canada. I am assuming she has dual citizenship.A friend of mine and her son have dual citizenships too. They have both Turkish and American passports. They both live in Turkey and have always lived here. I understand until recently, they were not responsible for any tax forms or anything like that. Now, they have to file tax forms. So far, they have tried looking for someone to do this in Turkey on their behalf but, they have been unable to do so.On top of that, the son recently had a job offer. He has to establish his own company and he will probably be billed from the US. He will keep on living in Turkey and pay taxes here. He just doesn't understand why the person offering him the job is not just putting him on his payroll but ,rather asking him to establish his own company. I am assuming it is some kind of tax evasion in Turkey. Doesn't sound illegal.So, based on your knowledge, do you have any advice to offer? What are the tax ramifications for dual citizens? They are completely lost and so far haven't been able to find enough information to deal with this new situation. I told them to reach out to the US Consulate. However due to COVID-19, they are kind of slow to respond.I appreciate if you can make time to provide some insight or point them towards some online resources. Thanks!Today both uncle and I woke up pretty late around 11 a.m. in the morning. He is meeting with his best buddies from HS for an early and prolonged dinner, a Locksmith's Table.The preferred alcoholic beverage in this country is \"Rakı\" which is similar to the Lebanese Arak or the Greek Uzo. Usually, it is had over a long dinner with small dishes to sample, followed by fish and dessert. The small dishes served are generally called \"meze\". Hummus, Baba Ganoush, cold eggplant dishes, bean varieties in olive oil, cold served seafood, fried seafood, cold dips/spreads, olives and anything served to sample in small quantities can be called meze. Meze is accompanied by toasted bread, a nice piece of white cheese (similar to Feta but not as sharp) and melon. This meal is supposed to go on for several hours. The point is not to stuff yourself or drink a lot but, rather enjoy a long chat with the people you really care for as you nibble food and drink sips of rakı. This ritual is traditionally called \"Çilingir Sofrası\" / Locksmith's Table because, as you gradually drink and relax and as you are surrounded by the people you care for, you start pouring your heart out and the others offer their advice, support and cheer you up. The Locksmith apparently opens your heart. If you get too drunk or too upset, friends will pick you up and drop off at home. What is talked about at the Locksmith's Table stays at the table. More often though, these dinners are cheerful occasions where you get together with your friends, eat, drink and be merry. Here is a sample Locksmith's Table:I am not a big drinker of Rakı because alcohol actually doesn't agree with me much, especially in the summer. I prefer an occasional glass of wine or a bottle of beer.Tomorrow is supposed to be a rainy day and, I am going to make Penne a la Vodka (I am going to use Barilla Gnochetti actually) for dinner and open a bottle of red wine for us.One of my uncle's friends just picked him up even though I had offered to drive him. They will have their dinner at a nice restaurant by the Bosphorus, watching boats in and out of the harbor and seagulls accompanying the ferries. It is a bit chilly but, they will sit outside. Restaurants provide space heaters so, people can stay out.I am going out for a walk and will pick up a couple of items from the grocery store on my way back. Hope everyone has a nice weekend!"},

Why not? I just went over my finances and updated my Xcel sheets and transferred some money from Savings to Checking for some upcoming bills.After I finish writing, I will work a little bit. I have decided to jot down the hours I work. So, at the end of the project, I will compare my earnings against the total hours spent to see if what I am doing is justifiable or not.I have postponed the cleaning lady again this week because, Sunday will be a rainy day and uncle and I will probably be home. The apartment needs a good cleaning but, it will have to wait another week.When you read this, you may easily understand I am feeling \"meh!\" today.

I also told her that I would be willing to help her till  April and I would only take two positions at a time, not more and that she needs to find someone who is retired like me but, who still needs to earn money. I could not say a firm no but, at least I laid down my terms. I also told her that if I get stressed and mess up my blood pressure, I will drop this for good. She agreed and here we go again.For some stupid reason, yesterday I decided I needed new socks for the winter and got online to order some. Luckily, I could not find anything I liked. Then, it hit me. I went to check out my sock drawer and realized that it was overflowing. So, I took the drawer out, sorted through the socks and decided to purge half of it. I do not need any socks at all. There are brand new pairs that I cannot possibly wear out this winter. In the sock drawer, I found two pairs of leggings that can be worn under jeans in cold days. I was plannng to buy some sweatpants and I decided not to. The jeans and leggings will be just fine. Besides, I am losing weight. I do not need anything in my current size.Now I am thinking that I need underpants. Tomorrow's chore is to check out the underwear drawer. I am sure, there are many worn pairs that I need to toss and may be I need a few new pairs but, I doubt that.I should constantly remind myself that I do not need any clothing items including footwear.Here are  some more images from my vacation.

He does not have many friends over there, only a handful. Here in Istanbul, he has some beloved friends whom he does not get to see often and we can do fun things together as well. I think he will take the train to go to Ankara when he is done visiting me. He needs a change of pace for sure. In my spare room, I keep the bed with just a cover and a bunch of pillows on top so that, sometimes I can use it like a day bed or sort of like a sofa. Now I need to make the bed and fish out his pajamas he had left last time. Today, I finally managed to clear the stuff I dumped on my dinner table when I came back from vacation. I put on a new tablecloth with Fall colors and placed my fake sunflowers on it. I love homes that are decorated for every season but, I am too lazy to do it for my home. Just small stuff. I would like to get a big pot of mums. They remind me of my grandma on my mom's side. She had beautiful mums in her garden and she loved them.Last time I went to the endochrinologist, he put me on metformin for Type 2 diabetes. First few weeks, I felt a bit nauseous. Nowadays, I do not have much of an appetite. I am going to see him on Wednesday morning and will tell about this.Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the friend who insists I work with her. Wish me luck! I am prepared to tell her that I truly do not have any motivation for this and that she should find someone else who does, within a few months. For now, I will help her by taking only two positions to fill at a time and see how this goes. If it goes well, may be I will take on two more. If not, I will bow out for good. Meanwhile, she absolutely has to look for a long-term person. I do not intend to continue beyond early Spring, if that.When I sat down to think of this work subject, I have realized that it also brings memories of the extremely hard times during mom's hospitalization and passing. So, my reluctance is possibly because of that too. I was feeling way too depressed up until last May when I went for a long visit to my uncle in Antalya. Ever since, I have been OK but, nowadays, the rainy colder days and lack of sunlight are affecting my mood again. May be at the back of my mind, I am associating this work with mom's sickness and feeling responsible for not being with her at the time. If I were in Ankara, may be I would recognize that her health was not good, may be I could have taken her to a different doctor. All these make me choke up even as type them. I do not know... I hope, uncle's visit will lift my mood back up."},

After I came back home, I was ready to tackle my car service, my endochrinologist visit and the cleaning lady. I ended up postponing all three. I never realized how tired I was. I did spend some time in Ankara but, I barely put my bottom on the couch. Did tons of laundry, ran errands for my BIL's dad, and an old couple who used to be my parents' friends. So, this weekend I am taking it easy. Basically knitting and drinking tea and coffee. I have a few good books lined up too.If you recall I was doing a part-time headhunting gig and got extremely stressed and left. Well, my friend who owns the business called me a couple of weeks ago. She was very apologetic and she told me the idea I gave her turned out to be extremely helpful and she made a lot of money. She said she wanted to share some of it with me. I was so surprised and I wanted to say no but, she pressed on and she said she was soryy for the stress the job caused me and that it was partly her fault assigning me an impossible Customer. It turns aout they never hired anyone for the two positions I was trying to fill. To make a long story short, she paid me a nice sum of money and asked me if I would be willing to give it another go. I refused because, I have no need for this. However she pressed on and promised me I would select my own cases and that I would not do any of the stuff I was unwilling to do. So, this Monday, we will sit down and discuss this. The things she said about me made me feel good about myself but, I know she is in need of help like right away and that is why she has been so persistent. We'll see what I will finally decide on Monday. Honestly, I do not know if I want this.Have you watched The Christmas Chronicles: Part II? In that movie Mrs. Claus tells the hids about the origins of Santa being in Turkey. So, here are some images from St. Nicholas Museum in Demre, Antalya. I must have thought I was taking a picture. That is why one of the videos is so short. I thought I had taken better pictures but, it was the end of a tiring day so, not such a great job. If interested please check out the link above."},

Just too much to share. My goal was to not gain any weight during vacation and I have accomplished that. Yay me! My friend has a unhealthy relationship with food and she has been a yoyo dieter all her life. She loves food. However, her enthusiasm and love for food had the opposite effect on me. I did my best to keep myself in check, stayed away from desserts and ate food that was tasty. And.... Drum roll please! On top of not gaining any weight, I lost over 2 pounds. I am so glad. Now that I am home, I will keep on doing my IF thing because, it does work for me. I will also get back to walking which I had replaced with swimming during vacation.Anyway, here are some videos and an image taken at Kekova. We rented a huge boat just the two of us for about USD 45 for 3 hours and our captain took us to see all the nice swimming spots and over the sunken city of Dolchiste, a Lycian settlement ruined due to a severe earth quake. An island then formed and the city was rebuilt. It was a major trade spot in ancient times.The last picture is yours truly enjoying the water. It was absolutely fantastic."},

Opening and closing suitcases and bags get tiring after a while. We have had very good swim days and I ended up with a tan I never had before.Despite knowing each other for over 50 years, it was clear that my friend and I have different interests. Would I go with her again? Yes, but not for so long. A week should be sufficient. With that said, we still had a very nice time and made it back home safe and sound.Our first stop was a place owned and run by Central Bank of Turkey which my friend retired from. The place is only available to the people who are or have worked for the Central Bank. My father's organization had two places that we used to go to like this when I was young. Many Government organizations used to have such places the workforce to have a decent and low cost vacation when the Government was more of a social government. Most organizations were forced to shutting those places down by the more Capitalist Governments over time. Only a handful of organizations have been able to resist.Think of a simple resort with a limited selection of food, no alcohol (rolling my eyes at that), beautiful and well kept grounds and a sufficient beach. We stayed in a two bedroom unit and it was clean and comfortable. The first few pictures are from this place.Rooms and SuitesThe BeachOur Dinner View Head of Medusa anyone? @Apollon Temple in Didyma on our way to BodrumOur second stop was Bodrum, a favorite spot for vacationers local and foreign. We stayed at a hotel that was on top of a hill overlooking the Bodrum Bay. Below 2 pictures show our view from our hotel room.Bodrum has a very nice Castle and right in it, there is a beautiful underwater museum of archaelogy full of artifacts collected from under the sea. Here is a link for details about the following pictures. The ship below dates back to around 1024 BC. It is assumed to have set sail from Syria towards a glass factory somewhere unknown in the Byzantian Empire. Lots of amphoras, glass artifacts, broken glass and coins were found. Here is a video of Bodrum where we had beer and snacks on our first night. Look at the water and how clear it was.There are many more pictures and videos that I plan to post. Gotta go and sleep. Need to get up early to take my car for it's 60.000 Km.

I should be more diligent about this. So proud of myself because I did a good job even better than I expected from myself! Haha... I added more items on my future shopping list. I think, I will have to have a delivery and a personal shopping when I come back since the list is pretty long. Or may be not because, I am thinking of spending a few weekd in November at my sister's. We'll see.I also cleaned up my kitchen, changed my sheets and put a thin duvet on the bed. I am sure, it will be pretty cool when I get back home. It has significantly cooled down in Istanbul and Ankara but, I know, we shall have pretty good beach days down South. Today I felt the nice, crisp and fresh Fall weather. I do not think, I will be able to sit at home with all the windows open from now on. With Fall being my favorite season, no complaints though. Since I have cleaned up everything, dinner will be a cheese and bologna sandwich and two nectarines. I haven't eaten bologne in ages. Trying and doing a good job staying away from stuff like that.Just had a cup of coffee. Need to get back to packing. Now I am packing toiletries and medicines which to me is the worst bit. I almost always forget something and end up having to buy it. I think, I shall be done in about half an hour. There is a volleybal game I would like to watch at 6 p.m. While I watch it, I will give myself a mani and pedi. Then I will have my dinner and just realx before going to bed. I will hit the road when I wake up without the help of an alarm clock. It is a 4 hour drive all on highway to Ankara. I do not even stop most of the time.On Monday I will have dinner with the friend I am going on vacation with plus another childhood friend and her sister in law. On Tuesday, I may take my BIL for a late birthday dinner. His birthday was on the 2nd. Wednesday is the start of our vacation/road trip. Wish us luck and lots of good weather please.I do not think I will be able to blog during my vacation but, I promise to take tons of picture to share later on.

Since she does not have a blog and I do not have her e-mail address, the only way I can reach out to her is here through my blog.Today, I saw a wonderful news on Facebook. A group of British nationals living in the area decided to get together and purchased a number of sheep and goats to gift the villagers who lost their livestock in the fires. I am so touched by this. I thank them with all my heart on behalf of my people. See the pictures that were shared. Such a heart warming gesture!"},
{"title": "Busy busy busy....", "date": "Thursday, September 2, 2021", "text": "I am almost done packing. Now it is the small but, important stuff that needs to be packed.The best news is that I have received my passport from the US Consulate for my 4th 10 year visa. My last visa had expired in April. People were saying that it was taking a long time for new visas due to the pandemic working hours so, I had decided to wait. I checked the US Consulate Web site early August and found out that if the last visa had expired within the last 4 years, an appointment would not be necessary and that the whole process could be completed online. So, without thinking it through, I applied for it. They haven't asked for any additional paperwork other than my new passport and the old one on which the expired visa was stamped. Great! Easy peasy! Then I noticed that I would be leaving for Ankara soon and I panicked. I thought the administrative process might take a long time and that I would not be here when my passport was returned to me.Well, to make a long story short; I have my passport and my new visa. Yay! Not that I will be going to the US anytime soon but, who knows? Right?Tomorrow I will be completing my packing and will clean the fridge. I think, I will leave on Saturday. My BIL is in Ankara. He has arranged for a medical visit at home for his mom, took his father for a much neglected health check, got the medical reports extended, filed the paperwork for the Georgian caregiver of his folks and some other things that required attention. It is already a productive week for him. His medical leave will be ending on September 9th so, my friend, my BIL and I will be leaving for Izmir on the 8th.Trying to eat up the last of fresh stuff and whatever is on hand generates weird combinations. Today's dinner is decent though. I will use the last two eggs I have to make Menemen. To make it you need to finely slice peppers, dice tomatoes and sautee them in a bit of butter or olive oil and crack the eggs on it. Cover and let it cook a little bit depending on you how you like your eggs. I will leave them a bit soft so, I can dip some bread in it. I normally mix the eggs and pour on top of the sauteed veggies. Easy and healthy. OK it's time to go and hang the last bit of laundry. My friend told me that evenings are cool in Ankara and it will also be cool at the first place we shall be going. I decided to pack my fleece jacket and a pair of jeans."},
{"title": "A week of Planning and Packing", "date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2021", "text": "I will be hitting the road on the 6th to go to Ankara. That is our starting point for the big road trip ahead of us. This is the first time we shall be vacationing together with my pram (or stroller) buddy. Imagine knowing someone since you both have been literally infants. My sister left my BIL in Ankara yesterday and drove back to Izmir on her own. She did not want to take additional days off since her husband is just fine after his procedure. They had extracted 11 moles and only two turned out to be carcinomas. So, that is good. He is still on medical leave. While he has this time on hand, he will try to take care of some stuff related with his parents. When my friend and I are leaving for our vacation, we will take him with us to Izmir next week. It was our first stop anyway. We just decided to go one day earlier.So now, I have to come up with my packing list and start packing my stuff. The road trip will be long so, I am guessing I need lightweight, easily washable things that will not require any ironing. I always start my list with the medicines I must take and some optional stuff. I am still contemplating whether I should take one large suitcase, or two smaller ones. I am definitely taking my beloved backpack which I also use as my beach bag and a bag for shoes. My car is a Ford Escape so, if you are familiar with it, it does not have a very large trunk. Plus, we are both taking our folding chairs, a beach umbrella and a small folding table.It is hard to plan for such a long trip.Today, I took out the suitcases and the things I will be packing but, I had left most of my beach stuff back in Ankara. Some of the clothing items have been sitting in a drawer or a closet for a long time so, they were smelling a bit musty. I am putting them through a very quick cycle of 15 minutes just to freshen them up. Meanwhile, I have been consuming the meat products in my fridge and I can say, there will be nothing left. That means a big shopping trip when I come back. I have been noting pantry items that need to be purchased as well. From now on, I will try to keep only the healthier versions of pantry items. For instance, no more regular pasta, white rice or flour. I love pasta but, the regular kind is something I should not be consuming. I still have some on hand and once those are gone, they will be replaced with whole wheat pasta. That will be less tempting anyway. Before I leave I would like to clean my fridge. I can never clean it after I come back from a vacation. Lesson well learned. As for the freezer, there will only be the tomatoes and tomato sauces plus the beans left in it. All those were intended for the winter anyway. I decided against freezing more tomatoes. I will need the space for meats when I get back. Also, since I do not eat a lot of bread anymore, I need space for a loaf and some small whole wheat tortillas too. I used to have a separate under the counter freezer in the past but, when I re-did the kitchen, I had to part ways with it.Today, I took out the suitcases and the things I will be packing but, I had left most of my beach stuff back in Ankara. Some of the clothing items have been sitting in a drawer or a closet for a long time so, they were smelling a bit musty.

{"title": "Lazy Saturday", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2021", "text": "Today is a hot day. The breeze started to cool me down only around 4:30 p.m. Before that it was only making it warmer.I declared today a lazy day but, I also knew there were a few things to take care of. Since, I hate wasting food, I knew I had to cook some string beans, some eggplants and a forgotten zucchini. I sauteed onions in olive oil, added some chopped tomatoes and cooked the string beans in my pressure cooker. I like this cold but, it can also be eaten warmed up. I am going to pan fry the eggplants and the zucchini. I have already cubed them but, the eggplants are soaking in salty water to get rid of the bitter taste. This will also be a cold dish I think I will have this with garlic, yogurt sauce. These are for tomorrow. I should pull out a frozen steak for tomorrow from the freezer.Tonight, I am having Tom Kha Soup, some mushrooms (broiled in the toaster oven) and the remaining okra (in the oven too).So far, it has been a successful week in terms of eating out of the freezer. I have two steaks, two portions of frozen falafel and a bag of frozen okra left to be consumed before my trip. The falafel was too salty. I am not going to buy that brand again. As I go through stuff in my freezer and pantry, I am making a list of groceries that I should buy after I come back home. I have a little butter and a little olive oil left. I need to stretch the olive oil till I go on my vacation. I have 3 cans of olive oil, 2 lt each but just do not want to open one and then leave for 6 weeks. Not that it will go bad or anything, but, still...While I was cooking today, I dropped a bottle and broke it into a million pieces. Ugh! I hate cleaning up broken glass but, I had it coming. I should have just put the bottle back in it's place before tackling the veggies. Thankfully, it was empty. I better go get started with the eggplants. Hope, everyone is having a great weekend."},
{"title": "Small Victories!", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2021", "text": "I haven't been exercising as much as I should and wasn't paying attention to what I ate during the last 4 days. Sabotaging myself is an important issue of mine. Usually, I let go a lot longer than 4 days but, this time I decided to issue myself a warning and go back to tracking my food and exercise.I got up today and weighed myself. Guess what? I lost another couple of pounds. So, since May, I have lost a total of 18 pounds. I know, I know, some people lose this much in a month. Well, I can't. Actually, looking back to old records, I think, I kept losing and gaining the same 20 pounds over the course of last 6-7 years. So, if I break this and lose another 10 pounds, that will be a mid-size victory. The childhood friend with whom I am going on the roadtrip has a weight issue too. I hope, we will influence each other for the better and not for the worse. I hope, I will lose another 2 pounds in the next 13 days before we start our road trip. Today, I had smoked salmon, capers, a soft boiled egg, half an avocado on toasted rye bread for my first meal of the day. 650 calories in total. A small celebration :)I am going to have a salad for dinner with the remaining salmon (need to finish it up) and baked okra. BTW, thanks Anne for the okra recipe!I made Tom Kha Soup for tomorrow. I also have some cold chicken which I will put on my dinner salad. Today, I had bread, but most days I do not. Decreasing the amount of bread, pasta and rice I consume and having only two meals a day made a big difference. My poison is pasta. I love, love, love it. I will limit pasta to once a week and feel not deprived.I have been eating from my freezer lately. I do not want to leave any meat or cooked meals in it. Last week I bought some tomatoes. I sliced and froze some of them and put the rest through my food processor and scooped them into zippie bags. One year I made too much of this and ended up using them till August. This year I was cautious but I guess, I should make some more. Not too much but may be another 5 pounds or so."},
{"title": "Locks and Lock Freaks", "date": "Tuesday, August 24, 2021", "text": "I am the kind of person who locks her apartment door as soon as she gets home, as soon as something is delivered, as soon as it has to be opened for any reason. Mom and SIS called me the lockfreak because, you can hear each time I lock the door. It is loud. Cluck! Cluck! There is a deadlock and there is a normal lock.Well, yesterday around 9:30 p.m. as I was talking to the friend whom I visited today, I hear someone trying a key on my door! WTH? I told my friend to hold and loudly yelled \"Who is it? Why are you screwing with my door?\" The only people who have keys to my apartment are my SIS and uncle. So, I knew it couldn't be them. They know better to call before coming for a \"surprise\" visit.I went by the door and demanded who it was without opening it. It turned out to be a contractor who failed to deliver some items during the day. He had the keys to the other number 4 in the next building. I knew that apartment was sold and was going through some serious renovation. The guy was more freaked than I was. I told him it is the other building and he went away and apologized several times. I can see the other apartment from my windows so, I looked to see if he entered the empty apartment and turned on the lights. He did. So, he was not lying.The apartment complex I live in has 9 apartment buildings. There is a fence all around with cameras installed. Every floor has cameras and actually on my floor, the camera is installed right over my door. If someone wants to come visit or deliver something, she/he needs to go through the security guard who will call me to confirm if I am home and if I know this particular individual. Once he lets the person in, she/he will need to come to my building and ring my bell. I see who it is on the screen of the Intercom and buzz the person into the building. So, it is actually very safe. However, I guess the new owner of the other apartment gave the contractor not only the keys to her/his new apartment but also, the buzzer token all tenants use to come into the complex. This way, the security was bypassed. I did not have time to bring this issue up to the Management's attention today but, I will do so tomorrow. If my door was unlocked and if the person who meddled with my lock had sinister purposes, my apartment could be broken into. So, am I right to keep my door locked at all times or not? My SIS says, if the expected earthquake hits Istanbul, I may not be able unlock the door because it may get jammed. Well, I guess a steel door can be jammed in such a situation even if it is not locked. Yes, my door has wood panels on both sides but, it has a thick steel piece inside. The frame is also steel but painted a matching brown. When I first moved in, we did not have the fence or the cameras so, it was a necessary purchase.Uncle has a different argument. He says, if I fall at home or get into any sort of medical trouble, keeping the doors locked would make it harder for the emergency people to get to me. Well, I leave that to luck I guess.Yesterday, I went to an open fresh produce market. On a whim I bought 11 pounds of white beans in shells. I came home and once I started shelling, I realized that this is way too much for just one person. Once shelled, since the beans are fresh, they need to be frozen quickly because I cannot really dry them here in Istanbul due to humidity. So, sending some of it to my sister or uncle is out of the question. I am planning to visit a friend this afternoon. I guess, I will gift half of it to her. I also bought some big okra. I am going to make them as Anne over at Cooking and All That Jazz, suggested.I bought some San Marzano type tomatoes to dry in the oven. Again, due to the humidity here, I cannot sundry them. I will try a batch and if they turn out fine, I will dry the rest of them. If not, first to the food processor, then into zippie bags and then into the freezer they will go.Tomorrow will be a busy day."},

For some stupid reason, they never give me the best possible option for new customers and every two years I have to play this game. My current plan was 750 minutes, 3 GB Internet and 250 SMS. I asked them if I promised to stay with them for 2 years, what would be the best plan at a minimum cost and they gave me a few options. I checked their closest rival and they gave me several more options. I decided to get the 750 minutes, 8GB Internet and 500 SMS plan which was 30% less than what my current company offered. I know, after two years, I will be back to my current operator. Plain stupid but, if that's the game they want to play, I will.I do not need so much Internet on my phone since I am home most of the time but, if I can get 5GB more for a lesser price, that's fine with me. This way when I am on the road, I can stream Spotify more.I made the switch online and they will send me the SIM card via a courier service. As for the second part of the heading for this post, my childhood friend took the responsibility to look up places and share them with me to decide upon them and our travel calendar. She is doing a great job, reaching out to people to gather comments on the hotels we think we will like and all that. She is also making all the reservations. At some hotels, we will be sharing a room, at some others we will be staying at separate rooms. If the per night price is lower than a certain level, we opt for separate rooms. We will start from Ankara on the 9th of September and be back on the 5th of October. I am hoping that everything will go smoothly and that we will have a good time together."},
{"title": "What is the house chore you hate the most?", "date": "Thursday, August 19, 2021", "text": "I generally dislike all chores at home. Give me stuff to do outside and I will be happy to do all of them for you. Tell me to find and order a most extraordinary gizmo that is hard to find, no problem! I can run errands outside or search for stuff on the Internet all day long. I do what I have to do at home anyway but, my most hated chore is ironing. I hate ironing with a passion. Some people say it is quite therapeutic and I shake my head in disbelief. My mom ironed all bed linens, my grandma ironed even the underwear. I guess that part of their DNA never transferred to me.All those years when I was working, my cleaning lady did the ironing for me. 5 pairs of pants, 5 dress shirts or blouses if not more, every week. The only relationship I had with the iron and the ironing board was when she told me to go get a new one because the old one was dead.Now that I am not working, I really do not mind if my T-shirts are a little wrinkled. I wear soft cotton shorts or jeans and they never need ironing. With that said, I just found 4 pairs of cropped summer pants that I thought I had given away and they are miserably wrinkled. Ugh!I tried them on and they fit perfectly and they will be very good for the long road trip I will be taking with my childhood friend in September. I remembered that my mom and grandma always pulled the hard to iron items from the line when they were still slightly damp because it was easier to iron them. So, I will put them through a short wash cycle today and do the same. If they were hanging in the closet, they wouldn't be so wrinkled. Sigh... Note to self: ALWAYS hang the pants!I have also realized that, despite my best efforts of purging, there are still a lot of items I will most probably never wear again. However, I think, I will give them till next year. I am hoping to lose tons of weight by then so, it will be easier to part with them."},

You know, my big trip to the US, coming back home, mom's sickness and her passing, plus COVID-19. Last month, I have been contacted by the Istanbul Branch of the hospital I used to go to in Ankara ( I still go to my eye doctor there). They offered me a check-up plan. I asked them to send the specifics and I liked the coverage and the price but, it was just a week after my second vaccine so, I decided to postpone it a while.Today, I finally decided to bite the bullet or pull the trigger if you will, and contacted the Check-up Division to make an appointment for Wednesday. As I get older, I dread the results of these health checks. I hope, they will give me a clean bill of health. The only test I would like to have and that they are not giving is Vitamin D. I asked if I could order it as  an addition to their list and pay for it out-of-pocket and they said yes.So, by the end of the week, I will know where I stand medically. I know, think positive, right?"},
{"title": "Pumpkin Spice Latte Alternative", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2021", "text": "I was extremely enthusiastic about Pumpkin Spice Latte when I first heard of it years ago. However, one sip killed that. I do not like sugary hot drinks. I usually drink coffee black, sometimes with just a little hot milk. I have my tea without any lemon, sugar or milk. Also, a latte is too much milk, not enough coffee for me.As I have been trying to adopt healthier habits, I am becoming a bit more creative.Nowadays, I am trying the Intermittent Fasting because, it does sound logical to me. When I was younger and when I did not have any weight problems, I never had breakfast. I almost always started my day at lunch time and be done with eating by dinner time. Back then, I was not a fan of desserts either. So, going back to a similar life style made sense to me.I am eating between 12 noon and 8 p.m. now. I eat two meals a day and I do not snack most of the time. However, I need coffee in the morning. As I am typing this I am sipping my pumpkin spice black coffee. I have mixed ground cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger and I am adding a half teaspoonful of this mixture to my coffee. My coffee smells amazing bringing me the memories of beautiful New England falls I have experienced and it is healthy. Today there is a nice cool breeze which is another reminder of Fall and I love the sensation. I know there will be a few more hot days but, the weather is definitely turning.Just a small thing but, it made me happy during these hard times my entire country is going through. I think, if we forget finding small joys in life, it will become unbearable.I keep listening to dance songs all day and feel pretty uplifted."},

I was going to get rid of the part-time job that was sucking my energy and totally focus on myself, lose weight, get stronger and eat healthier. If you live in this country, the Government and the politics suck your life energy so, it is hard to concentrate only on one's self. Still, I have managed to lose 15 pounds since May, started to exercise more seriously and did well on the eating healthy department. I know 15 pounds seems not much in 4 months but, I could have easily gained more if I had caved in to depression. So, in my book, that is a win.The devastating fires and the other BS going on, I felt helpless and very depressed during the last few weeks but, I am trying very hard to bounce back by cutting down on the news and social media. With that said, nowadays going cold turkey on those is not possible.I started trying the 16/8 Intermittent fasting and it seems to be working for me for now. More on that later.I found a channel on YouTube that I subscribed to which is called Improved Health. With my weight and fitness level, I find it easier and fun to do the exercises on this channel. People who cannot even walk can do the sitting exercises. I think I had shared the below before but, here you go again:I also found out that listening to uplifting music (60's,70's,80's, 90's dance songs) helps me maintain a better mood throughout the day. So, I put Spotify to good use.My mom's passing last year had a big impact on my life and my grief period was a lot longer than most but, I think I made peace with her loss. She was in the hospital for 77 days and even if she came back, she would never be how she would want to be and I know, mom never wanted to be bed-ridden. So, I guess for her, moving on was a better option. I respect that. Yesterday was a bit hard since, it was her birthday.All in all, I am trying my best to keep healthy and focus on myself. Now, I gotta go and exercise."},

Not that you need proof but, here it is:Meanwhile, we are going through terrible times as a nation due to several fires in the vacation spots. It makes me angry, helpless and sad so, I do not want to further talk about this but, I am going to say I believe all these fires are sabotages. The current president knows he will not have a chance during the next elections in 2023. Therefore, I suspect they are trying to provoke a civil war so that elections may be postponed or banned altogether. They are claiming that these fires are being set by the Kurdish terrorists but, at this point I am not sure. They tell so many lies that, it is hard to know what is true anymore. There are other things too but, as I said, I just do not want to talk about it. I feel sick."},

Knowing myself, I felt I could one day easily give in to my foodie demons and binge on pizza, I have decided to come up with a healthier version. I sliced one eggplant and one zucchini lengthwise, brushed on some olive oil and minced garlic. Once the slices were cooked, the rest was easy. I sort of braided the slices and then spooned some sauce, put the pepperoni slices and cheese on top. I did not use too much cheese to make it lighter. Yes, I used the oven in this weather but, my kitchen is separate from my family room so, it just heated up the kitchen and it was pretty yummy. Definitely stopped the craving.Here is a picture of the finished product: (I know I should have taken it on a plate and made it look aesthetically pleasing but...)"},

However, one of them was dead on arrival. Bummer! I contacted the online platform and was told to send it to the brand owner. Knowing that their head office is located near IKEA which is 10 minutes from my home, I decided to take it myself. Today, I armed myself with the necessary paperwork and was ready for combat because, I thought they would try to fix it instead of exchanging it. They told me to wait for 10 minutes to check it out and they replaced it with a brand new one. I was expecting all sorts of trouble but, no, not this time. I am sooo happy.It has been very hot during the day lately and it looks like next week will be even hotter. So, I am mostly staying home. Today, I brought the standing fan into my living room and it helps quite a bit. I know the temperatures will get better after August 15th. They always do. There are hot days after that too but, once we hit mid-August, the weather starts to turn. Looking forward to the Fall and Winter.I did a quick grocery store run today before I came home. I have everything I need for the weekend and then some. I am going to need salad greens. What they had at the store looked sad so, I did not buy any. May be I will quickly go in and out of the farmers' market they have nearby on Saturdays but, I doubt it. We'll see.I have been reading this book by Jean-Christophe Grange named Lontano forever. I am determined to finish it tomorrow and get started on new books. It is too dark and twisted and I had been procrastinating. If you are familiar with this writer, you know what I mean.It is very hard to get enough exercise in this heat but, I am pushing myself. Tomorrow will be a better day I hope.Have a great weekend everyone!"},

I felt like I had been well rested so, after a late breakfast I headed outside. However, it was too hot to even sit in the shade and read. After a half hour of that, I looked up to see if there was an open fresh produce market (or a farmers' market) in the area I was in and luckily I found one within less than two miles.I bought fresh produce and then, headed to the grocery store for meat, cheese and few other things. Tomorrow, I am planning to make rice stuffed bell peppers in olive oil. This is a cold dish and honestly, I do not need anything warm these days. Here is a recipe in case you wonder what the rice stuffed bell peppers are like. Our bell peppers are much smaller with thin skin. When I am in the US, I make this with Cubana peppers for my friends. I also do not use dill weed or all spice and use waaaay less cinnamon. 3 teaspoons called in the online recipe can be overpowering. I use just half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon full of dried mint leaves which are usually found in health food stores in the US.Tonight, I am going to bed around 11 p.m. and see what happens. I so want to get back to a regular sleep routine. I do not like to live like a vampire.Have a great week!"},

She was running a fever and her digestive system was completely out of whack. I freaked out and was about to go to Ankara when she told me to stay put just in case it might be COVID-19. Oh boy! She has had the Chinese vaccine so, the effectivity is somewhat lower and she works at a bank and she has chronic liver condition and... and...and. My mind suddenly switched to overdrive and I was thinking of extreme scenarios.Then, I had a totally sleepless night, then I stopped exercising, then I slept during the day and fell of the \"watch what you're eating\" wagon. Today she felt better enough to go outside and visit her in laws. She thinks she possibly had some sort of a food poisoning. That was only one of my scenarios which I had quickly dismissed.I love my sister to the end of the galaxy and back. I cannot stand her getting sicker and weaker for whatever reason and I cannot even imagine outliving her. This is my biggest fear in life and even she catches a simple cold or tells me she has a headache, I become a mess. Even typing this, I feel terrible.Although I am not totally relaxed, since she felt better, I felt better too and went to the seaside. Bought a cup of coffee and went back to reading my book in the shade which I had been ignoring lately. I also exercised today and that made me feel better too. So, it was a nicer day.My dad was the biggest worrier in our family and he only lived up to my current age. I used to make fun of him and roll my eyes because he was such a worrier.

{"title": "Hot! Hot! Hot!", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2021", "text": "It's been hot and humid yesterday and so it is, today as well. I do not feel like even moving my fiinger. My apartment is usually cool and comfy but, these two days have been the exception. No wonder they call it the dog days of summer.This song keeps playing at the back of my mind ever since I got up today, so here, now it is your turn! Lol!Yesterday there were kids playing outside and they were so darn loud but, hey kids are kids right? However one of them was constantly screaming at everything. I initially thought he might have been a special needs child but, I observed them for a while and no, he seemed like just a loud kid. I hope he is not tone deaf. With that pair of lungs, he can be quite the vocalist to some band. This went on till noon and in the afternoon it started yet again. My parents never allowed us to go out before 4 p.m. in the afternoon in such hot weather. What are these parents thinking I do not know.Well I leaned by a window for a while to see what the kids were up to and saw that there were two mothers out there. One of them looked up and apologized for the kids being so loud and I seized the opportunity to say: Well, they are kids so, I guess that is normal but, can they be loud at the other side of the apartment complex for a while, just for a change?\" They kindly obliged. I mean there are other neighbors too! Thankfully, today is probably hotter than yesterday and noone is out early in the afternoon. It is peaceful. My BFF is on vacation with her family so, we are not able to watch anything these days. I started watching S.W.A.T and loved it. It is absolutely my kind of show. Besides, I love Shemar Moore. Mom and I used to watch Criminal Minds mostly because of him. Lol! The rest of the cast is pretty awesome too. Hope, everyone is having a nice Sunday."},
{"title": "Detox! Exercise, Habits and Other things...", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2021", "text": "I have been losing weight since May but I am now somewhat slowed down and lost my mojo a bit so, I decided that I needed a boost and signed up for a three day detox program. I had done this before and it does help my body to re-adjust and start to lose weight again.What I forgot was, this was a soup (!) detox. And we are living through the dog days of summer. Rolling my eyes at myself... Anyway, the first thing you have to drink in the morning is a cold smoothy so, that is not so bad but, then, there are 4 bottles of soups to drink and they make me sweat. Well, today is day two, so there is only one more day of torture. I do not feel hungry at all and the soups are tastewise, tolerable. My energy level is fine and I actually want to exercise which is great because, I am also trying to up the exercise I have been (or not been) getting. There are so many routines on YouTube to choose from that, not getting enough exercise or not finding something fun for thyself must be a sin. I especially enjoyed this one lately:I think, I am going to see if I can also do some beginner Yoga. There is a mat somewhere in the apartment that I need to dig out. As we get older, we lose a lot of flexibility and I am not flexible at all. My dentist friend whom I visited on the road to Ankara told me yoga helped him with his back tremendously. It took him two months to sit cross legged but, he persevered and he started to reap the rewards.I have already shed a bit more than 6 kilograms since May and I am hoping to have lost a total of 10 kgs by September 10th.If I have enough water and a good book or the Internet on hand, I can sit for hours and my uncle says that is a terrible thing. He says one must get up at least every half hour to do something else or blood cloths may become a potential risk. I have a cheap smart watch that I had bought years ago, a Xiaomi MiBand 2. I programmed it to remind me to get up every half hour during the day. I can't say, I get up every half hour yet but, I am trying.Uncle also says that, we should eat very slowly, putting the fork down with every bite and chew well. That's another weakness of mine that started in childhood. Rushed lunches while I worked kept the habit up and here we are... I am really trying to put my spoon or for down each time I use them but, sometimes it is hard to remember. My uncle told me to sit down to a well prepared dinner at the table instead of gobbling up whatever in front of the TV. He says a nicely prepped table is also appealing to the eye and makes a meal so much more enjoyable. Mindless eating he says, is a terrible thing. I hope to get there some day but, for now I still like my big tray sitting in front of the TV although I try to make it nice looking with small portions of a variety of mostly Mediterrenean style food. It is too hot (for me) to enjoy the outdoors these days but, I need to find a nice park where I can walk and sit while enjoying a book. However, over the weekend, ıstanbul becomes a zoo with everyone outside and it gets so crowded everywhere. Too much potential risk. I will go out on Monday, try to enjoy the outdoors for a hile and then do a grocery run to come back home. Till Monday, I will not need much although, I am completely out of tomatoes.As for the COVID-19, I read that the Delta variant is on the rise. With tourists pouring into the country and people not taking enough precautions, I am not surprised. I used to look up the statistics that the Minister of Health announces every night  but, I do not do that anymore. I doubt those numbers are reliable anyway. However, the doctor friends are telling us, we are in a better place as compared to last year and the vaccines are keeping people away from the ER. It is great, but, in my opinion this virus is not going anywhere soon and it is up to us, the individuals to protect ourselves. So, I will keep wearing a mask, socially distancing myself and paying attention to hygiene. I used to get the flu almost every year but, ever since the mask mandate is on, I did not get sick at all. So, now I know, respiratory diseases can be avoided by simple rules. The whole world may lift the mask mandate one day but, I think, I will be wearing one for much longer. What can I say? A born pessimist.Last night I slept rather well but, had the strangest dreams. In my dream I was giving one of my ex-bosses my father's old Peugeot 404 to keep it in his garage but, I was worried about his driving afterwards. Then I found myself sitting at a table with an ex-boyfriend (who had the most impact and who gave the worst heartache), his wife and some other people that I cannot remember. He and his wife were separated in the dream and I was acting rather cool towards everybody. What the...? This relationship started in 1990 and ended in 1993. I guess I never got over it although, I thought I did. I dated other people after him but, made the poorest choices and gave up on relationships altogether when I was just 32 years old. I am now 54 so, you do the math. Ahhh! Whatever...My watch says, it is time to get up and do something. I will fold laundry and hop on the treadmill for a while to please Mr. Miband. Lol!Hope, everyone has a very nice weekend, staying safe and healthy."},

The challenge is to keep it that way.I went to have brunch with some High School buddies. One of the ladies lives in Denmark with her Danish husband. She brought her brother who is a General Surgeon and her husband. I met the husband for the first time. He is a nice, somewhat shy man. The other lady moved to the US a few years ago and lives in Maryland. She is an architect and her husband is a Civil Engineer. There were two guys as well. One is in music industry and the other is also my University class mate. It was a hot day but, the breeze helped us stay comfy.It was nice to catch up with each other. Normally, more people get together during these gatherings but, due to the summer, most were away or otherwise engaged. I am glad we did this. I am hoping to see more friends during the week.After I came home, I decided to watch Wimbledon Men's Final but, dozed off. I do not care for either of the players but, that part I was able watch was good. Then my best friend in the US called and we watched another episode of The Gift which is a Turkish show on Netflix. Honestly, I do not like fantasy dramas but, we watch it for the sake of nice views of Istanbul and Gobekli Tepe. My friend enjoys to see all those places and keeps asking me whether they are closer to where I live or could we go see them if she comes over. I had taken some Istanbul photos a few years ago. Found them while arranging my pictures. So, here are some of them:The castle was built between 1451-1452 before the Siege of Constantinople (now Istanbul) by Mehmet the Conqueror. There is a sister castle across the Bosphorus. They were built to control and block the entrance and exit of Byzantian Ships. Ortakoy MosqueRumelian CastleBosphorus Bridge"},

Who knew things could get so dusty even inside a closet. I found and finally listed my two tennis rackets on FB for free. The grips on both of them decayed and got really yucky. I took them out but, they are still in bad shape because the inner grips are also decayed. I put the info on the listing. I wonder who will want them. I need to list the skis too. They are only collecting dust. Early Fall, I should give them away.I found a bunch of old documents about an apartment I bought in 1991 and sold in 1994. Why did I keep them? All sorts of payment stubs, correspondences, etc. Happily tossed them. I think I am 1/3 done with the project. The cleaning lady is coming on Sunday so, I must be finished with the closet tomorrow. My sister finally got transferred to a branch 10 minutes from her home. Poor kid had been driving an hour and a half both ways every day for the last 5 years so, this will be a nice break for her. She thinks this will be her last branch before retirement. The bank may offer her an early retirement in a few years. She is up for retirement in 2027 but, the banks will be decreasing the number of branches in the coming years as online banking is getting more popular and keeping branches is getting expensive. Even people who were reluctant to use online banking had to use it during the pandemic and got used to it. Unless I have to get into my safety deposit box, I never go to a bank branch. With the pandemic, I found myself using less cash, more credit/debit cards. I withdrew cash from an ATM today just because I pay the cleaning lady and the water delivery guys cash.I am sure SIS is relieved. She had been expecting this transfer and was stressing as to why it was not happening. As the cleaning lady will be here on Sunday, I just asked my friends what is the going rate for cleaning these days. If I asked the cleaning lady, she would not tell me anything and would leave it up to me because she is actually not a cleaning lady. She works as a receptionist/admin at a doctor's office. She is my old cleaning lady's niece. When the old lady told me she no longer could work, I was upset because I did not know how to find a new person I would trust. The niece is separated from her husband and is living with her parents and two daughters. At the time, she was not working so, what I paid her was just a bit of pocket money for her. I encouraged her to work and she got a job but, thankfully she did not give up on me. Every other Sunday, she comes to clean my apartment. We had a long break due to the pandemic but, now that I am fully vaccinated, I would like to start again. I will wear my mask and after we discuss what I would like her to do, I will go out. This teminds me to call my old cleaning lady next week. It has been a while since I said hello. We talked right before the New Year I think. I like her a lot and it is nice to hear what her grandkids are doing. The oldest granddaughter is a basketball player and she is very proud of her.Hope, everyone will have a nice weekend. Take care!"},

Both times, my sister was with me and she drove me. I had a relaxing time at the beach and I feel full charged. I was able to spend time with family and friends and that did a ton of good to me. The drive took me 4 hours and 20 minutes. I stopped once to get a cup of coffee briefly. I think I drove faster than I normally do. If it weren't for an accident, I would have made it slightly under 4 hours.Boy, did I miss my home! I opened all the windows as soon as I walked in because it was smelling weird after being closed for 3 months. I then texted my cleaning lady for her to let me know when she can be here. The first thing to do tomorrow is to order water. I am completely out except for one big bottle I left in the fridge. I do not have much laundry to do because, I did my laundry back in Ankara. I need to go shopping tomorrow but, I will first wipe down the inside of my fridge while it is empty. I fixed myself a quick pasta dinner with what I found in the pantry and freezer.

He showed me her picture from yesterday and we both cried because she has no muscle, no fat left in her body. My sister and I went out to shop for diapers and other things. She bought several packs with a total of 120 diapers.

It has been over a year since the interior was cleaned. So, I took everything out and emptied the trunk. I am also planning to go to the cemetery. On Friday, I am meeting friends for a late lunch. Before that, I will help someone to run her errands.I do not know whether I should go back home on Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Part of me wants to be home a.s.a.p, part of me says traffic is usually horrid on the weekends. Plus, the Health Minister said now we can have our 2nd shots 4 weeks after the first one, instead of 6. May be I should get my second jab while I am here. If there is a bad side effect, I have friends within short distances. They have also decided that people over 50 should be getting a 3rd dose of any of the available vaccines but, I do not know how long we need between 2nd and 3rd jabs. So far, we have the Pfizer-BionTech and the Sinovac available. I know there are clinical trials on the volunteers for the Sputnik vaccine. It will be available soon too. I guess I should not be worried about the 3rd those just yet.Today, I took my SIS and BIL's car to get the tyres changed. They still had winter tyres on. Rolling my eyes... After driving an automatic SUV for so long, a stick shift sedan felt weird at first. I wish I had known earlier because I took my friend to the tyre place just yesterday. She was using 4 year old winter tyres. Rolling my eyes again! It is risky to use winter tyres during the hot months. She hasn't had her oil changed in 2 years as she told me.

I will also take an old lady who was my father and mother's friend to shopping. She is 83 and is taking care of her 90 year old husband who used to be my father's colleague. Whenever I go to Ankara, I go visit them and take her out for her big shopping to stock up on certain items. We call each other weekly. They lost their older son last year to a heart attack. The younger son lives in the UK. He just had a heart attack too and is recovering. He can't come to Turkey often. Once a year is what he can do but, due to the pandemic, he couldn't make it in quiet a while.I am sure, my apartment is in desperate need of  a deep cleaning. I am hoping that my cleaning lady can come."},

There was a problem with the original tiles so, they were taken out carefully and then re-installed. Dust everywhere! Uncle and I cleaned everything up three times over. I do not think we got rid of all the dust yet. Thankfully his cleaning lady will come next week.I was exhausted so, I took a shower and rested for about an hour before leaving for a wedding. A friend of my uncle's daughter was getting married. I was his plus one.  Since there is a curfew after 10 p.m., we left the wedding around 9 p.m. to get back home.SIS and BIL are leaving tomorrow. I am hoping to rest all day since we are not supposed to go out on Sundays. Why is it OK to be out on Saturday and not on Sunday? Nobody knows. I hope, next week, the weather will be nice. I would like to go to the beach every single day. I think, I am getting ready to go back home too. So, a nice beach week will be icing on the cake.Hope, everyone is having a nice weekend."},

One day uncle took us out on his boat. That turned out to be some adventure though. Lol!We went out on the boat and after a while, we decided to swim. SIS and I jumped off the boat and swam a little bit. While we were doing that the wind got stronger and the waves started to get bigger. Uncle steered the boat to the shore but it was impossible to hold it still enough that SIS and I could get on it. It was a bit of a struggle for a while. Uncle and BIL panicked a little bit but, SIS and I were just cool about that. We told them we could stay on the shore and BIL could get the car and pick us up. There were picnic tables in the shade and we had our phones with us. BIL and uncle went back to the marina while SIS and I first dried ourselves in the sun and then sat on the picnic tables and had some ice tea from our cooler. The place turned out to be a caravan camp but, there weren't many campers around. BIL came to get us and then when we went back to the marina, we decided to have an early dinner at the fish restaurant over there. The food was excellent and so was the restaurant. We ended up satisfying our appetites after an \"adventure\". Lol!They went to their favorite resort yesterday for a  few days before heading home. Uncle and I are supposed to attend a wedding on Saturday so, I bought myself a dress on my way to the beach. Today, I am at home while the contractor works here on the new shower stall. It turned out to be a bigger job (as usual) and will take a day or two longer than anticipated. Not a big deal though.Sunday was both my birthday and my mother's first remembrance day. My family made it a happy day for me because I have mixed feelings about celebrating my birthdays because of mom's passing on teh same day last year. We talked about funny memories. It was a better day than I anticipated.Here are a couple of pictures from a sandy beach we went to:BIL took this picture. I don't know how he did it."},

They slept in but, when they woke up, they came to join me. Originally, I was going to come home, shower and change before I went to the hospital but, SIS said, I should go directly from the beach. She also said, she would drive me so that, I would not have to worry about parking the car away and walking back. Very nice, right? Especially given that, she does not like to show affection. I know she loves me :) So, I showered at the beach, changed into a dry swimsuit, pulled over my beach dress and off we went. I was at the hospital 15 minutes earlier than my appointment but, they took me in right away and I got my first dose. Yay!They made me sit in the designated area for a half hour. I then got in the car and SIS took me to a very lively area near a beach. We got coffee from a coffee shop and sat in the shade for a while. Then my BIL came to join us. We sat together for a little more time and went home for dinner. Uncle does the cooking and SIS likes to do the cleaning up (she is a neat freak). Fine by me!It doesn't feel funny. It feels like just any other shot. Some people say I may feel worse tomorrow but, I guess everybody is different. We'll see.My second shot will be on July 17th or within a few days around that. So, if any of you had an mRNA type of vaccine, have you experienced any side effects? I got the Pfizer-Biontech."},

{"title": "Alcoholism or any other Substance Abuse", "date": "Saturday, May 29, 2021", "text": "Yesterday night, I woke up to a very loud swearing and screaming. It was also echoing through the apartment complex we live here in Antalya. This went on for about a half hour. That guy must have some lungs! Finally, I got fed up with it and looked to see if I could see the person. There were two of them, one causing the trouble, other trying to get him inside the building next door. I noticed other people at their windows and balconies. The guy was extremely drunk and was naming names, swearing and loudly yelling. I expected police to arrive for a while but, when he started saying things like taking his own life or murdering people, I decided to call the cops. As I was talking to the police hotline, 155 in this country, my uncle woke up to the noise. Meanwhile the second guy was able to push him into the building and take him to his apartment where he started throwing things on the floor and breaking glass. He came out to his balcony, then got dragged bck in by the second guy. I taped some of what he said just in case, he actually killed someone. My uncle was surprised that I did, because, it never occurred to him. I told himw I watch way too many cop shows.I called the cops a second time to make them hurry and finally, as soon as the 3 police cars and one ambulance arrived, his apartment went black and we could not get to see or hear him anymore.It took the police to get into his unit at least a good 40 minutes. I was hoping they would kick the door down but, I am not sure about the law. They tried to convince the guy to open up but finally, they kicked it down. I was worried about the second guy who was trying to control him because, from what I could see, he was skinny and had a hard time controlling the drunk guy.I listened to the police and a medic trying to reason with the guy to take him to the hospital but, he did not budge. This went on for about an hour and I think, they left one officer with him when he calmed down. I am not sure though. All the police cars and the ambulance went away and it was peaceful after that.Since my uncle lives here, he knows the person and told me his story. The guy is an alcoholic and he used to have his family, a wife, a son and an elderly mom living in the same apartment. When he started getting extremely drunk and abusive, the family had to leave him. His son kept on living with him for a while but, after he graduated College, he moved out too. Apparently, these episodes happen from time to time and when he does this, he feels ashamed afterwards, locking himself in, sleeping during the day and drinking at night. He seems to be well off on his own so, even though he does not work, he lives on whetever income he has and drive a luxury car.It is so sad to see lives wasted like that due to substance abuse. Imagine how his family felt when they had no choice other than leaving him. Imagine how his son feels when his father got so out of control that he caused episodes like last night. I am sure he does not want to be who he is either. Just sad...So, it was en eventful night. Oh well...This weekend is the last under curfew and the Government will issue a new set of rules for gradual opening. I am hoping my beach will be opened too. So, there is something I am looking forward to."},
{"title": "Being Nice or Not: Part 2", "date": "Thursday, May 27, 2021", "text": "This is a slightly different story than yesterday's. Before I moved to my current apartment, I used to rent an apartment in the same neighborhood not too far from where I live now. There were two buildings and a short driveway between them for us to reach the parking lot behind the buildings. As usual the parking spaces were scarce and people used to park on the driveway and on the street as well. The management kept telling the residents to use only the right side of the driveway to park coming towards the parking lot and not use the left side because, larger vehicles such as ambulances, fire department trucks could not turn into the parking lots where the building entrances were located. They put up signs for it too.There was this one guy who almost always parked on the left side. Nobody else but, this just one person. The building management asked him kindly, warned him, the neighbors pleaded with him but no! The stubborn idiot kept parking his car at the same spot no matter what. Walking 50 meters at most was too much for him.One day as I was sitting at the kitchen table having dinner, I saw an ambulance with lights and sirens coming our way. I then noticed that the ambulance was trying to turn into the parking lot but, because of the car blocking it's way, it could not. The paramedics had to get off and run into our building. Meanwhile everybody was trying to get a hold of the guy to have him move away his car. A few minutes later, the paramedics had to carry the patient on a stretcher all the way to the ambulance and took off.The next day, I have learnt that the guy who kept parking on the left side had a heart attack. It was him who needed emergency care. When the ambulance arrived, out of panic, his family could not locate the car keys and could not move the car. He passed away right then and there. I do not know whether he could have been saved or not, even if the ambulance could go to the building entrance. I do not know if the few minutes the paramedics lost would have made a difference. All I know is, I am glad it was him who died, nobody else. It must have been Karma, I guess."},
{"title": "Being Nice or Not: Part 1", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2021", "text": "I am generally a nice person. I smile at people, thank them, hold the doors, park my car so that others can park theirs too. I do not listen to loud music in order not to disturb my neighbors. In short, I treat everyone as I like to be treated.However some people do deserve to be treated badly. A facebook post of a friend reminded me of a problem that happened may be 10 years ago.As you know, I live in a gated apartment complex that has 9 buildings, a very nice garden, cameras and security. The only shortcoming is, we do not have enough parking spaces for all, given that some families have more than one car. So, we sometimes need to park on the streets on the perimeter of the complex. There is one emergency gate for emergency vehicles to enter the complex. There is a huge \"Do not park\" sign along with another that specifically says the gate is for emergency vehicle entrance..So, one night, I came from work late and parked my car further away from my apartment. As I walked back, I saw a car parked right in front of the emergency gate. I called Security but, they did not know who the owner was. I opened the windshield vipers and closed the mirrors of the said vehicle so that, the owner would know something was wrong. The next day, I saw the car there again but, parked differently so, I knew that it was driven off and parked in that same spot again. I took out a paper from my notepad and left a kind message saying that the very spot he is parked at, is for emergency use and please park elsewhere like the rest of us. You would think the problem was solved, right? Well, it wasn't. On Friday night I had gone out with friends and came home around 2 a.m. in the morning after dropping off all my drunk friends (yeah, I am nice like that), only to find the same car in the same place. My note was crushed and tossed not too far from the car. I recognized the paper because I was using a blue notepad those days. I went home, took out a marker and wrote \"You asshole! Park here again and see if you can find your windshield wiper and mirrors!\" on a few printer papers. Took my packaging tape and went out. I stuck the papers on his windows while using the packaging tape all around the car, twice no less. As you might have guessed I never saw the car in that spot again. Not only that, I saw it parked on the opposite side of the apartment complex after that incident for a long time.Now, I could have chosen to do the last thing I did, the first time. I did not, and I never will because, I am a nice person. I thought, may be the person who parked there did not notice the sign, may be he had some emergency to attend to etc. at first. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.Why can't people choose to be kind and nice in general? Why can't they be considerate and civilized? There are things in life, I will never understand.There has been another incident which I will tell you in tomorrow's post.Apartment living has different rules and the sanity of the people living in apartment buildings depend on others a lot."},

I lmost felt normal despite the mask and the constant use of sanitizer.I realized I missed doing this in a relaxed manner. All my grocery runs were in a rush but, today was different. The places I went to were not crowded at all.

Some people have no idea about personal space, social distance etc. It is amazing how they never learn. Rolling my eyes...It is getting hot and I am still not enjoying the sea as I like.

So, you have to carry your chair, your own umbrella and etc.Anyway, I went to that beach yesterday and opened the swimming season of 2021. I could not stay long at the beach because, I did not have an umbrella. After coming home and showering, I headed to a Home Depot style store to pick up one and a few other necessities like a toilet seat cover. Today is not a great day and it is windy with the possibility of rain showers during the day. We are not supposed to go out over the weekend till June 1st. So, tomorrow and the next day, we are home. I will go for a long walk by the sea in a couple of hours and come back by dinner time. The beach is 7 km. (4+miles) long and there is a nice walk-way and a bike-way right along the shore. The shower cabin is in bad shape and I decided to change it. Uncle protested that he did not want to deal with contractors but, it is leaking and falling apart. I told him, I will deal with them.

One heats up and shuts itself down after a while and, the other has a damaged top cover.I decided to use the second one and of course I managed to break the handle of the top before I even started vacuuming so, it cannot be used.The first thought that came to my mind was to get rid of both and buy a new one. My sister and I started exchanging messages as to what to get while I kept sending her my \"finds\" online. Then, I remembered that I am generally a frugal person so, I spoke to the Customer Rep and found out that the top cover is available as a spare part and can be delivered to my doorstep. If I wanted them to install it, that would cost extra.I went to check to see if I can replace the cover myself and found out that, it is very easy. So, at a fraction of the cost of a new VC, I will be able to make this guy work. Isn't frugality fantastic?I vacuumed most of the apartment with the other VC and I got tired, heated up and shut down before it did.So, both VCs are staying. One will be patched up and the other will be used as a backup. My sister agreed that buying a new VC for an apartment that is barely used is a waste. Besides, we do not want to add to the landfills.Then, the not so frugal side of me told me to order dinner instead of cooking tonight.

Here is what I bought:Arugula, Iceberg Lettuce, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers, Cucumbers, Eggplants, Artichokes and fresh broad beans to cook together, Strawberry, Melon, Garlic, Collard Greens, Broccoli and lemons.Then I went to get meat and some cheese, eggs and yogurt. Bought 4 steaks and about 4 pounds of ground beef.When I got home, I started processing the ground meat. Made beef patties, stıffed peppers and tomatoes and cooked them. I froze 6 portions of patties to be cooked later. I cooked some of the patties in tomato sauce and made some sort of a soup with tiny meat balls. The rest will be flattened in a few ziplock bags and frozen.Wanted to stuff some of the peppers with a rice stuffing but, the rice had gone bad.

She had been battling with cancer for a long time but, she was so full of life that, it is hard to believe.Once, when the cancer came back, she told the doctors that they could only give her pills because she wouldn't miss the chance to go to Mexico for three months. When she came back from her trip, her tests were much better and she lived at least 6 more years after that.She was working, learning Greek, taking dancing lessons and constantly traveling.

I even own a copy of this book: Day of Honor Omnibus which is 1104 pages long. It is about a sacred day of Klingons. So, you may imagine my disappointment in 21st Century. As a kid, I honestly imagined a peaceful world, lots of space missions, meeting other species, everybody having access to food and work, etc. come 21st Century. Naive? Yes, absolutely. But, wouldn't it be great?With all that said, I am still thankful for the current technology available to us. It makes my life so much enjoyable especially during the time of the pandemic. I get to speak to my family as frequently as we like, we can \"see\" each other while we speak, there are tons of material to keep life enjoyable such as audiobooks, tons of online content on pretty much anything and everything. Banking, dealing with Government offices or other businesses, ordering food and groceries can be done online now. I find this fascinating. Heck, we don't even need to red maps anymore! I remember those good old times, I kept getting lost while driving in the US early 90's. I worked in the US between 1990 and 1993 and then for another 6 months in 1995-1996. I have made great friends there. I was able t keep contact with some of them through simple letter and card writing nd sending via what we call snail mail nowadays. With some, I had lost touch. However, I was able to track down some of those people many years later through technology and now we are in touch again. I was in touch with a handful of my High School friends before Facebook. Now, I have access to not only 80 % of my graduate class but, a hole bunch of graduates of various other years. We seek out help, get to help others and do so much more via our groups. When I was in the US in 2018, my BFF's husband was very sick and was at the hospital. I had originally planned to stay for two weeks but when my friend asked if I could stay longer, I was able to extend my visit but I needed my prescription medicine which I couldn't get in the US. So, I reached out to a couple of Facebook groups and an old co-worker of mine told me her cousin who lives in the US would be going back home in a few days and that she could bring my stuff. We met in NYC where my friend's husband was staying at a hospital. I was spending the day with him, keeping him company so, I just took a half hour break to hop on a bus to collect my meds. Use of availabe technology made it so easy.My closest friend is American and she lives practically 5K miles away from me but we, speak to each other every day and we watch murder mysteries and crime procedurals. While we chat on Whatsapp, we watch our shows on Netflix or Amazon. I also know that technology made some things more stressful. People who are working complain about being so reachable at all times during the day and prolonged work hours. I symphatize with that and I am sure HO work will require new rules and regulations which will happen one of these days. Remember the Industrial Revolution, child workers and extreme hours? So, I love Technology and am very thankful for those who made it possible."},

Phewww! I am sooooo relieved. I wish my friend develops the skill to identify a lost cause when she sees one. I think I partially have that skill and if it weren't for her, I would have given up this client long time ago. Instead of hiring someone ever since I have told her that I would no longer work, she buried herself under more work. I understand her ambition to want to make more money because, she has two kids. One is studying medicine in Belgium and the other will soon be going to College too. Her husband is retired and although he is looking for a job, he can't find one. She is the sole bread winner and that is very stressful for her. A part of me says I can still work and be productive whereas, the other part says I should take care of myself and focus on self and family for at least a year. I will listen to the latter.I went out and bought some planters and soil. Need to change the planters and soil of the two plants we have at home in Ankara. Poor plants were left alone for almost two months but, they survived. Troopers! As soon as I got here, I watered them and then bought some soil amendments. However, changing the planters will probably help them further. They are rather huge plants. I bought a plastic sheet to cover the balcony with. I think, it will be a messy job so, please wish me luck."},

We brought our own coffee and my friend brought a healthy oat-banana cake. We had our folding chairs. It was a glorious day, 23 degrees Centigrade, 73 degrees Fahrenheit. Tomorrow it will be 18C/64F with rain showers, Friday 6C/43F and there will be snow! The weekend is supposed to be cold and snowy as well. Go figure! And some say there is no global warming because it is not warm, ey? The weather is out of whack and seasons are shifting. What else is needed to believe in global warming? Eventually, farming will be in trouble and guess what that means.Anyhow, we enjoyed our day very much and chatted away. Tomorrow I am going to buy a laptop computer to donate to my Alma Mater. I haven't been to the campus for a long time. It will be nice to go and stroll around. Although they offered to pick it up, I told them I would rather drop it off to see the campus again. It will sound weird but, they do not let everybody in the campus. Going through security is a hassle. A friend of mine got me a favorable price for the computer through a distributor. When they found out that it was for a donation, they even gave an additional discount. The school was actually asking for second hand computers and for a moment I thought about buying myself a new one and donating my current computer but, decided against it. I actually do not need a new computer. Mine still works fine and once I get rid of the part-time gig (yes, it is still dragging on), I will only need it for Internet, blog writing, and some MS Office apps. I decided a university student who cannot afford a computer can benefit more from a new one. Besides, I am only being frugal. I can afford a new computer anytime I want. Tomorrow is my baby sister's birthday. I cannot believe she is turning 48! That means I will be turning 55 in June. Yikes! I still feel somewhere between 25-30. Not physically of course but, mentally."},

It was not too bad really. I made a couple of turkey sandwiches and took a can of coke and did not stop on the road. I love to listen to audiobooks or to old BBC Crime radio shows while I am driving. The one I listened to yesterday would be politically very incorrect today. A 14 year old boy seduced by an adult woman, a policeman telling the same 14 year old that he was gay and that they should not socialize \"for the time being\". Social norms have surely changed over time.There is this mountain pass on the road from Istanbul to Ankara which is usually snowy but, I found that most of the snow is gone except for some patches under the trees facing North.Today, I went out and sent a card to my sister whose Birthday is on the 8th. It was one of those cards which tell you about the highlights of the particular year you were born. I remember picking it up at a small shop in Mystic, CT in 2019. Well, last year was a chaos so, I did not even remember those cards. I will make sure to remember to give my BIL his card this coming September.I have also scheduled flowers to be delivered to my baby sister. While I was ordering the flowers I saw that they were offering to put a picture on the vase so, I found a cute picture of us when she was possibly 9 months old. I am sure she will get a kick out of it. Then I went shopping and now I am well stocked here in this apartment except for salad greens. There is a farmers market on Friday so, I will get them then.Tomorrow, I will be meeting with my babyhood friends at a park. We all have folding chairs and we shall get together, maintaining our social distance. It is supposed to be a very warm day. I will also make sure to walk a little while in the open air.I like this apartment. It is almost twice the size of my own. I think, I will now go and look at some yarn at a nearby hobby shop because I left all of the crochet stuff back at home. Off I go! Stay safe and be well everyone."},

Oh and cosmetics... I am planning to be away for at least 10 weeks so, packing is a chore and I am trying to keep everything at a minimum. After I have written the above, I kept packing and I can safely assume I am 3/4s done. Phew! I would like to pack all except for the cooler before going to bed. Oh and the flower pots. For about a half hour, I thought about postponing my trip for another day. Yeah I know, I can be the queen of procrastination. However, due to the rapidly rising cases, in case they shut the city down tomorrow or ban travel between cities, I do not want to be here. Ankara and the vicinity of our neighborhood over there is in much better shape.Today I have seen a message posted by the apartment management.

Dependent on the hospitals' storage capability, people are being given options.The Minister of Health has announced that obese people will also be administered the shot but, so far, the health portal says I am not yet eligible. When I go to Ankara, I will call the hotline to see if I can get myself in.I will opt for the Chinese vaccine if I am given the option. If not, I will take whatever they will give me.My aunt-in-law and my cousin who lives with her told me that they decided not to get vaccinated. Rolling my eyes at that decision. My aunt (my late uncle's wife) is over 70 and she has many ailments. They run a gift store which, in my opinion is a hot spot. My younger cousin has MS and her immune system is already compromised. I hope at least she decides to get the shot. Or may be her doctor will urge her to get it.Oh well...I never thought I would live through a global pandemic but, here we are.

I believe, there are mutant strains. Istanbul is becoming a huge red zone again. It may be better to go away for a bit and I also do need change.I am thinking of going to Ankara for a few weeks till it gets warm enough to go down South. My sister told me she took everything she wanted from among Mom's belongings and I should give away the rest. We decided to keep the nightgowns and pajamas because, they fit us too. We are also keeping all the bed linens, towels and etc. Looks like we do not need to purchase any for at least 10 years or so. Lol! All of us are suckers for bed linens and towels. SIS also changed mom's bedroom by moving furniture around and told me to take that room from now on. I used to stay at the guest room. In Ankara, I will get to see some friends and my cousins minding the social distancing. When it warms up enough to go in the water, I will go stay with uncle for a few weeks in Antalya. There are tons of beaches where I can avoid people. An umbrella at the back of my car, a folding chair, cooler and lots of sunscreen are all I need. I am sure uncle will be happy because we both need the company. Once, it is June, Antalya becomes too hot for me and it also gets crowded. Then I will go stay with SIS and BIL although Izmir also gets hot too. I am thinking of coming back to Istanbul in early June.So, now I am eating out of my freezer to get ready to go on my trip. I will also check out the dates on other food items to decide whether I should leave them here at home or take with me.  Tonight's menu was sauteed fennel and onions with chicken.I need to make a list of what I am going to take with me on my trip because there will be different temperatures and I should pack accordingly. Sigh... That will be a lot of stuff plus beach things...Today, I attended a funeral and it brought back all those sad feelings and tears. My father's cousin lost her husband after a very similar ordeal to mom's. At this point, I avoid funerals but, she is someone I really like and care for so, I felt compelled to go.I will try to focus on the positive aspects of life and try to be more cheerful."},

A few unfortunate things occurred and I felt compelled to give my friend some more time to find a proper replacement. However, she did not act on it as fast as I wanted, perhaps due to her workload.Last week, she was very excited about a new prospect and asked for my help in putting together a proposal. She also sought help of another mutual friend. Well, we helped her put together a proposal and when she suggested the roles she thought we would take, I made it clear that I would not take part in this project. The mutual friend also told her that this was a full-time job and that she would not commit to it. I could sense that my business owner friend was bummed.First and foremost, she is trying to sell something she does not have: 7 hiring consultants. If she signs an agreement and hires 7 people, that is a huge risk especially if one of her invoices do not get paid on time. It would pose a serious cash flow problem.So, I suggested her to sell what she actually has: Her experience and her database. She was reluctant at first but apparently, she talked about this with the prospective customer and they loved the idea. Meanwhile our mutual friend called me and I told her about my idea and how it flew with the customer. She laughed and told me, my friend called her as well and talked about it as if it was her own idea and how well it was received. Lol! I am not angry. I don't care as long as I can be out of this a.s.a.p.As for the positions I am responsible for, it looks like one will be filled by the Customer and that's OK. It has been almost 5 months and they did not like any of the people I have sent them. The other may be closed if they finally decide to make an offer to my candidate and if he accepts it.So, I may be done by the end of this month after all. I also made it very clear that, I will not be taking on new work. She is still trying to convince me that this is a good business. I told her that it may be but, not for me. Can I be more clear? She acts disappointed but, I have told her that I would not hang her out to dry and that she should find somebody else, weeks ago. She should have.Meanwhile, I have decided to talk to a professional for my anxiety issues and depression. I want to focus on myself and get better. I need to sleep better, eat better, exercise, read and spend time with family. Today I did loads of laundry that I had been ignoring for a while and cleaned my kitchen.

I am well stocked for at least a week if not more so, I am planning to sit back and watch the snowfall with a cup of hot cocoa. I will process the veggies and put them in refrigerator bags which keep them fresh longer. I will also plan my meals according to what I have on hand.Here is what I bought: Potatoes, Onions, Carrots, Zucchini, fresh broad beans, peppers, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, scallions, dill weed and parsley. They would be way cheaper at the grocery store but, the stuff at the grocery store never last as long. I will cook the broad beans today or tomorrow. I need to finish the cabbage and Jerusalem Artichokes I made a couple of days ago. Yesterday, I decided to re-arrange my library and get rid of some old paperwork. It is a work in progress. I have also found some DVDs and a few books I wanted to get rid of. I put them outside my apartment with a sign that said Free.

If I had baked them all at once, they would be gone sooner. I never buy junk food at the grocery store because, if I do, I consume them rather quickly. This coming week is supposed to be real nice so, I am determined to go out for walks every day. Last week I bought this big box of salad greens. I like to add all sort of stuff to make a salad a satisfying meal. Beans, chickpeas, roasted peppers, cheese, smoked salmon, grilled chicken. etc... Not all of them at once of course... Haha!I need to soak some beans to cook tomorrow. I usually soak and cook a big batch and divide them in portion sizes to freeze. Tomorrow, I will also make a pot of soup. This winter has been so darn warm that I never craved soup. We are crossing our fingers and toes so that we will get enough rain and snowfall until the end of March or else, there will be a major drought and a shortage of water supply. If that happens, I will end up going to stay in Ankara, Izmir or Antalya. During the pandemic, a shortage of water can be a disaster."},

I had a feeling that this was coming our way because, I sensed her tension a long time ago. So, this means my friend will need more support than ever. Well, OK. As I have made a promise, I will honor that. Today, I was talking to her and I had told her part of my not wanting to do this job was due to the fact that I wanted to control my time and that I was unable to do so. That was causing most of the stress.She said, I am welcome to plan my time and when an unplanned meeting pops up, she will take over. I know she does not want to lose me completely. Still, we talked about the kind of person she needs to get on board. On top of all this, my ex-boss called me to say that, there is a project right up my alley and would I consider it? I told him, I really did not want to work. He asked me to hear out this gentleman who is in trouble with a particular part of his organization and he needs someone to help him decide what to do with it. Since I like my ex-boss very much, I said OK.I spoke to the gentleman and another lady who is in his team and it looks like an organizational structuring problem. So, I agreed to meet with them on Tuesday. I will wear two masks. This is going to be my first face to face meeting in months. I told my friend that this could be a project we might do together and she is in.So, you see as I was avoiding work, I got myself involved with more.

I told her, that was not the reason and she was not to blame for it. I also told her that I valued our friendship and would not want this decision to drive a wedge between us and she agreed. I could tell she was disappointed but, when her partner was leaving, if I hadn't told her that I would help, she would've found another solution, right? Besides, right around that time, the pandemic happened and there weren't a whole lot of work and I was dealing with mom's sickness and passing. It has been a year since we had that conversation.It is not like I am hanging her out to dry. Until she finds the person who would like to work with her, I will be supporting her.

I have three projects that I am working on and a bigger one which would require more of my time for at least 6 months, may be coming my way soon.My friend sounded worried so, I felt compelled to agree to the bigger one telling her my conditions. I fear those conditions will be stepped all over, once the project starts.Finally I have decided to wait and see if the big project will happen or not. If it does, I will work on it but meanwhile tell my friend that I do not enjoy this business and that I would no longer be available after the project. If possible, earlier than that if she can find a replacement. I do not want to withdraw just yet because, I do not want to cause her more stress. She has enough at home and at work.However, I do have a feeling that what I consider a thoughtful approach might still hurt our friendship. My friend is an emotional person. I understand the situation and after careful consideration, I decided I am willing to risk it for the sake of my own sanity. I am 54. My dad had passed away when he was my age. Life is too short to endure unnecessary stress. If this is going to cost me a friendship, so be it. I hope, she approaches this in a more mature manner.

I brought sweet tangerines. Hot tea and vitamin C!We walked 4 miles and half of it was quiet hilly. If that park weren't so far, I would walk those trails every day. It is such a great workout. I need to cross the bridge to go there so, I only go when we can get together.While we were there, we saw the first snow of the year but it did not last more than 5 minutes. Hopefully, there will be some more snow tomorrow.Yesterday, I decided to walk in my neighborhood and about half a mile from my apartment, I found a small park where there is a tartan track around it. It is rather short but, the soft shock absorbing ground was divine. If I get out my apartment, go there and walk like 10 times around it and walk back, I might hit 10,000 steps. I see myself walking there a lot in the coming days. I love walking by the sea too but it takes a while to get there as well. So, now I have four alternatives plus the treadmill at home. Not bad.After our walk, one of my friends told me there was a farmer's truck at the end of the parking area. She said everything he sold came from his own gardens so they were really fresh. I went to the truck and got some salad greens and broccoli. They were not only fresh but very inexpensive as well.All in all, it was a nice day. I have a meeting at 1 p.m. tomorrow.

{"title": "Curfew", "date": "Saturday, January 9, 2021", "text": "Due to increasing Covid cases and due to people's ignorance, the Government started a curfew about a month ago.On weekdays, people can be out and about between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.. 65+ can only be out between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and kids under 18 can be out only between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. The weekend curfew starts at 9 p.m every Friday and lasts till 5 a.m. Monday morning. Grocery stores, food delivery and pharmacies are open. You can go get emergency needs but, you cannot drive. You have to go to the nearest place and be done with your business quickly. Funerals and Weddings are still happening but there are limits to the number of people attending. The 65+ citizens are totally pissed but we have heard stories about a 79 year old lady who had been to 8 different weddings in 10 days in a rural area and spread Covid to several people who infected even more so, the entire town had to be quarantined. Entry and Exits were banned. Another old lady who had Covid was found trying to escape from the balcony because she was bored. There had been people with the infection who insisted they had to keep on doing their businesses. I understand people are hurting economically but, The Government came up with the idea of a smart phone app where you download an app. When you have business at any government agency you have to give them your code so that they can look up whether you had been identified as a Covid case or not. This is by no means mandatory. I have downloaded it and had to use it while selling the apartments in summer. The app also gives you a map of wherever you are and the severity of the situation in that general area. So, you can make informed decisions. If everybody used it voluntarily, I am sure we would be a lot more informed but, everybody has a different point of view about freedom. At this point, if I get infected and die, my freedom will not matter so much. So, I choose to use it.It also shows if you have broken social distancing in the last day, week or fortnight. It shows if you have crossed paths with infected individuals or not. I think it is a great tool and wish a majority of the population would use it till the pandemic goes away.It had gotten really bad around where I live about two months ago but, nowadays it is so much better despite the fact that we are still in the red.So, I am home today and tomorrow. It is dark and rainy today. In a few minutes I will go walk on my treadmill while watching a stupid reality show. Anything that helps me keep on the treadmill is fine. Lol!"},

Just Good Intentions", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2021", "text": "I used to come up with New Year resolutions in the past but, they always went down the drain in merely weeks not even months. So, this year, I have good intentions to:- Eat more plant based proteins and eat more healthy- Exercise more- Lose weight- Evaluate my part-time jobs to see if they are worthwhile to keepSince the first three need no explanation, let me talk about the fourth one.As you might know, I have two friends I work with. One has a traditional consulting company and the other is a boutique headhunting agency specializing in only technical jobs. I had started the latter just before mom got sick and I had stopped pursuing it till October-November due to my depression. With the first one, I have put in \"one day\" in all of 2020. Just one day. This was mostly due to the Global Pandemic and the taking economy in this country. We have had some internal discussions about what to do with the changing market but, I have a feeling we are not getting anywhere. So, it is just sitting there.I have my two real projects with the second one now. This type of work pays only if we place a position and if the customer pays the invoice. This is a job more stressful than I thought it would be. Takes a lot of effort to come up with a good short list to the Customer who can reject it without real reasons. They are very picky but, they have to understand that the best candidates want more money, some of them do not want to work for this company, some of the others do not want to be \"outsourced\" employees and etc. Today, we will talk to this customer to find out why they keep changing their minds about the required qualifications. I sometimes question why I am even doing this? It started when my friend had a cancer operation and her business partner decided to leave and she was terrified. She was very depressed and I had told her that I would help her. Then the pandemic happened and she was not swamped by work as she thought she would be. She closed the books with a profit. She is not as stressed now and her health is also in good shape. Meanwhile, I lost mom and I could not contribute much to her last year.On the other hand, this job keeps me occupied and what is the better alternative? Even if I cannot earn a penny for, say the next 6 months, what is the harm? With the pandemic, I stay home most of the time and get bored doing housework, surfing the Net and watching Netflix and such. Besides, the extra money can be nice.I think most of us are wired to see the financial outcome of our efforts on a regular basis and it is now hard for me to understand whether my effort is going to generate meaningful income. Also, despite the fact that this is a part-time job, it takes a lot of my time. A meeting at 11 a.m. and another at 4 p.m. eats all my day. For instance today, I wanted to get out and drive around a little because I have cabin fever. We were under lockdown for 4 days and before that I haven't gone anywhere except for grocery shopping. I even miss driving. However, due to the meetings I have at 11 and at 4, I can't go anywhere.  I think not being able to control my time gets to me. The 11 meeting will likely last an hour and then I have 4 hours till the next meeting but here in Istanbul, if you go out with your car, you can easily get stuck in traffic and may not make it home on time for the meeting. I am not taking the chances.I like to base my decisions on logic rather than emotions so, I have decided to keep a time sheet for myself to see how many hours of my life energy will generate income and how much? I must admit I am in the mood for giving up but, I am trying to control myself and intending to give this a chance for a whole year. At the end of the year, I will evaluate how many hours I have spent, how much money I have earned and whether the stress was worth it or not.Patience is the key, right?"},

Dollars, Gold, ETFs and very little amount of Euros. I had always tracked my money converting to TL at the end of each month and that has worked fine till this year. With severe fluctuations in currency exchange rates last year, my numbers became quiet meaningless. I basically keep the USDs, Euros, ETFs and Gold as my long term nest egg. I have no intention to touch those for a good while. I have to support my current income tapping into my TL savings because I still have 49 mortgage payments for the Antalya home. When that payment is gone, I shall be just fine with my passive income or so I think. So, now I have decided to track the TLs and set my goals in the national currency only. Today I closed the 2020 version and started 2021. The inheritance I have received and the proceeds from the sale of my apartment made me more liquid and as always I have distributed the money among the above stated investment tools.I am not planning any vacations in 2021 except for visiting my uncle and my sister who both live in coastal cities with nice beaches. I am sure these trips will not break the bank. I will probably go to Ankara a few times too. So, we are talking about gas money, not much else.I am spending way more money on food than I used to. Possibly because now that we cannot dine out, I like to make fancier meal at home. The inflation on food is also a major contributor.On the other hand, I am not spending much on gas and nothing at all on clothing. Can't believe 2020 is almost over and can't wait for it to be gone."},

I woke up at 7 a.m. and felt like I was not sleepy anymore so, I decided to start my day. I will try to keep busy during the day and not fall asleep on my armchair or sofa. I have been told that taking melatonin might reduce my body's melatonin production and that I could get dependent on melatonin pills so, I am going to be very careful taking it. All I need is my sleep cycle back. I cannot be living where I am and be sleeping and waking according to Eastern US time, can I?So, as soon as I got up, I decided to wash my bed linens and change them. Then I had breakfast at 9 a.m. and as soon as I am finished with this post, I have things to do for work. I will also walk on my treadmill and run the small vacuum in the rooms to avoid dust buildup. There is always something to do in the kitchen too.Yesterday I finally got back the money the gas company owed my mom and donated it to a charity for a children's hospital specializing on leukemia.

I am pleased because, I did not have to cook at all this weekend. There is a steak, some green beans and possibly a little cole slaw for tomorrow's dinner.I am out of many necessities such as eggs, bread, yogurt and veggies. I also need glass cleaner and spray kitchen cleaner. I am making a list to go grocery shopping tomorrow, so that I can be in and out real fast.Our walk last week was perfect. The weather was very nice and the park was huge. It was mostly downhill at the start but coming back, you need to walk uphill which was difficult for me. I managed it though. It was a 6 mile walk.

When asked, she used to say she worked for the Finance Department. One of them was a CFO of a major bank and the third one is a doctor. She is a Professor at a University Hospital and her specialty is Gastric Pathology. Unfortunately our doctor friend has found out that she had cancer in June and had been very depressed for a few months. Now, she is doing better and wants to get together again with friends which she had refused to do before. I am going to wake up early tomorrow and bake some savory snacks filled with feta cheese and parsley to bring.I hope, the weather permits our walk.

I am glad it will soon be over but, that does not mean much other than getting old by yet another year. Unfortunately, the upcoming year does not look promising either. I am worried about my family's health.Mom's loss had the deepest impact and to be honest, I am still as upset as the day she passed. Not a day goes by without me crying several times. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing the fact that I had always told her I loved her every single day. Still, not having been able to say goodbye and holding her hand in 77 days of her ICU ordeal are killing me. I will never get over this.There are new measures against COVID-19. The Government finally gave up lying about the numbers and pretending that they were managing this really well. I still do not believe the new numbers. They must be much higher.Every Friday, starting at 9 p.m. till Monday morning 5.a.m, we shall be under lockdown. During the week, people above 20 and below 65 are allowed to be outside between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. There are some exceptions to this. 65+ years old citizens and kids under 20 are allowed outside during the week only 3 hours each day. Dining in and take-out are banned. Restaurants are allowed delivery only. Funerals are limited to a maximum of 30 people. There are many new rules about public transportation and travel. I am hoping that people will start being more careful about this.Yesterday, I walked to the small grocery store right by me. It is located in a mini-mall. As I was coming back home, I saw a lady without a mask, getting a manicure. The people working at that salon were all wearing masks but, the customer also has to wear a mask. I did not confront them directly. Instead, I came home and called the mall management and told them what I had seen and if they do not take action to make sure the rules are obeyed, I would file an official complaint. That means a ton of money for them. That place is actually a very convenient spot for me so, it is important that it stays to be a safe place. It takes me 5 minutes to walk over. There is a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a tailor, a dry cleaners, an office store, a health unit where you can get prescriptions, a bunch of hair salons, a cobbler and a few other small businesses. My hair salon is there but I am afraid to go to a hair salon so, till I see my sister again, I am letting it grow. I wanted to go grey but, it looks awful so, I am back to coloring my own hair. However, this time I went for a dark brown which is more like my own hair instead of the lighter tones with reddish hues that I have used for so many years now.Tonight, there will be fajitas for dinner since, I have an avocado and some sour cream to use up. Sour cream is hard to get here so, when I see it, I buy it. Yesterday night I managed to go to sleep around 2 a.m. in the morning by the help of some Native American music from Youtube. I got up at 9:30. I forgot to buy the melatonin yesterday. Next time I go out, I will do that. Today is a windy and colder day. The Linden trees in front of my building are losing their leaves fast. I think I will question the reason of my being the rest of the day. Hope, your day is joyful and full of purpose."},

It has handy accessories with which you can easily dust and get to small areas. I love my Dyson but it is bulky so, taking it out of the closet and out of it's box frequently is a chore. This new one is great for frequent use. After I dusted with the new vacuum, I went back to my Dyson; vacuumed and mopped the family room, vacuumed the entrance and the kitchen too but was too tired to mop them. That is for tomorrow. Oh and I managed to clean up the most messy bathroom cabinet too. There is still work to do in the bathroom but, I am gradually getting there. I put away some groceries which were being quarantined too. The coffee table  and the dinner table are neat and tidy, unnecessary stuff is put away.Yesterday I was mad at myself because, I had spent the day mostly sitting.

I am glad I did because, it was a very nice day. Isn't it hard to believe the below pictures are from a megacity with a 15+ million population. It is a very long promenade with a bike lane, many small cafes (all closed now due to Covid-19) basketball courts, playgrounds and simple outdoor exercise equipment. You can rent a bike at various stations.I selected a part where there were just a few people and walked for about half an hour. If the weather is nice tomorrow, I will repeat it.As you can see from the above picture, there were lots of seagulls and shags around the same spot. So, I guess there were a lot of fish there.The islands are called the Prince Islands. They are very nice unless you go on weekends and on holidays. There are no cars except for Emergency and Service vehicles. There used to be horse driven carriages until this year but, now there are electric vehicles provided by the local government for a small fee. The ferry rides to the islands are pretty cool. You get to see the islands and the city from different perspectives. Then I went to the fish market right on the promenade and got two kinds of fish. I had bluefish (again) for dinner and I may try to make fish patties tomorrow, with the bonito I bought.Having fish and a salad for dinner was both tasty and easy. After dinner my BFF who lives in the US and I watched another episode of Bosch on Amazon Prime Video. I should be going to bed but, I am not sleepy enough yet.

Meat is so expensive nowadays. Anyway, for at least two weeks if not more, I think I am all set.Today's menu is Baked Bluefish and Carrot Salad. I shred the carrots and use lemon juice and olive oil for dressing. I also bought some real nice fresh bread too. Easy peasy and yummy!I am getting sick of cleaning the kitchen, filling and emptying the dishwasher. When I was working there were only dinners I had at home and they were mostly takeout. I would cook over the weekend and the cleaning would be done in one day. I remember using the dishwasher once or twice a week. Nowadays, it is almost everyday.However, I haven't forgotten the time when we had to actually wash the dishes so, I am never going to be ungrateful. When I was growing up, we did not have a dishwasher. They were too expensive and were not considered a necessity. After dinner, mom would soap the dishes and I would rinse them. It was a mother daughter bonding time. When I started working in the US, my apartment came with a dishwasher. This was in January 1990, when I was not even 23 yet. I fell in love with my diswasher and immediately decided to get one for mom. So, I sent money home to buy a dishwasher as a Mother's Day gift to my mom in May.

Negative thoughts surface so quickly and I feel depressed when I overthink and overanalyze things of the past that I can no longer change.Recently to avoid myself, I started to watch the cheesy Hallmark Movies. Most of them are about Christmas. I love the decorations so, they are pleasant to look at but, they are all pretty girls, handsome guys, one minor misunderstanding, a big happy ending and oh! everything is so romantic! Yeah right... There is a saturation point with these movies too. So, only one per day, no more!I am thinking exercise might also help so, I will come up with a routine which has some sort of variety because treadmill gets old fast.

I baked some veggies for later use, made a banana bread and cooked some other veggies. I have no idea why Banana Bread is called bread. To me, it is cake (like angel food cake, or pound cake) and I am gonna have a slice with tea in a few minutes.I had been given a small butternut squash by an old friend. I finally baked that too.

And no, none of the tailor-made ones made the list. I found that my shape and the fashion has changed considerably. If times were normal, if I was working full-time and intended to work for at least another 5 years, I would have taken about 5 of them for alterations. The fabrics were the best. But, hey, a challenge is a challenge right?Here are the winners:It was easy to select 4 jackets because there were only 7 to begin with. I have set aside a black jacket to go with the gray pants, a mustard colored jacket and a blue-gray jacket to go with the navy ones. One of the jackets is thick and can be worn in cooler days. I kept my beloved \"pied de poule\" jacket to go with the black pants.The picture is not so great but, here it is:Tops will be rather easy because I do not have a whole lot of them anymore. It will be a matter of selecting the ones to go with the selected pants and jackets. Now it is time to go wipe down the section of the closet to place my new work wardrobe. I wonder how much use they will get.I was planning to go to the grocery store to get the bags and other things today but, I just did not feel like it. I will give away the hangers too. I usually put such things in a box in front of my apartment and put a sign that says they are free to take and they usually go real fast. In the past, I have given away some books and some knick-knacks that way. Wish we had garage sales here although, I understand they are a lot of work.I have a pair of brand new skis and two tennis rackets I would like to sell. I never sold anything online before. I also have a very old pair of ski boots. I do not know if they can still be used. I will give them away for free along with the skis. I am just hoping that my motivation keeps going. There are a bunch of things that need to be taken care of. All the closets need to be re-organized. I hope, I will be able to do all this before the end of the year. My sleep problems have re-surfaced. I cannot go to sleep before 3-4 a.m. and I get up around noon time. Why my day is so upside down I do not know. Today, I tried to get up at 8, 8:30 and at 10:00 but, each time I turned off the alarm because I needed the sleep.

I would add Cost, Quality and Reliability to these but, I digress. I kept these in mind while making my selection and I kicked myself in the butt because of the ones I had to give away with tags still attached. When Evans and C&A decided to withdraw from Turkey, I remember running to the stores and buying many discounted pants and tops. I have worn all the tops and the money I have spent on them is OK. As for pants? Not so much.I am a size. 18-20 US, 22-24 UK, 54 Turkish. I am tall (5'9\"or 1.75cm or what is left of it after menopause), have a big butt and weirdly long legs. I always need to buy the Long versions of all pants or else, they look funny. As I was halfway through my exercise, one of my very very old friends called. Apparently, two of her neighbors had contact with COVID-19 positive people and now are waiting for their test results anxiously. When I told her what I was doing, she congratulated me and then told me today is a big sales event all over the country and that she had oredered some summer tops heavily discounted and urged me to look too. Gosh! I am trying to get rid of stuff! I laughed it off but of course, went online to look. Having worked for some textile companies as a consultant, I know their costs so, what seems to be a big discount is no discount at all. I shook my head and made myself a cup of coffee. Then I went back to work on my closet.I must say I decided to call it a day, when my BFF called from the US to watch Bosch, Season 1 Last Episode.So, I will be done with pants tomorrow. I need to walk to the small grocery store right by me to get some garbage bags to pack them. There is a collection box for clothing items and you cannot dump giant bags since, it's opening is rather small. So, I will put 4-5 pairs in smaller bags, mark them and put them in the boxes. I need to get eggs, carrots, cheese and walnuts so, the short walk to the grocery store is needed. Today, I had a gluten-free day and haven't felt sluggish at all. I wish it weren't so hard to give up bread and pasta. I don't think I will give them up totally but cutting down on them makes sense."},
{"title": "The Challenge: Pants Edition", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2020", "text": "Today I took 31 pairs of pants and a pencil skirt out of my two closets and put them on my guest bed.Here is the picture:Tomorrow I will select only 6 of them to keep and the rest will be donated. I think, my closet will thank me.The only resaon why I held on to so many pants was partly because of my weight. My size is not easy in Turkey and I have always been afraid of not being able to find my size when I needed a new pair of pants.Some of the pants you see have their tags on. So does the skirt. I haven't worn a skirt in at least 15 years if not more. It has a Dress Barn tag on it. Some of the pants have been tailor made with real good quality fabric and workmanship. 1-2 may be among the ones kept. Most of them are too small and even if I can be that size again one day, I do not need them since I no longer plan to work full-time. Besides, if I go down two sizes, then it is not so hard anymore and I can find things that will fit me.Then I sat down and thought more about this. Some of the tailor-made ones were made by my father's tailor. When I was 11-12, dad and I went shopping together and bought a corduroy fabric to have matching pants made. It was so much fun! I always liked to go shopping with dad because, he was just like me, taking his time, looking at different things, understanding the trends and etc. Mom on the other hand, was practical and would buy the first thing she thought was OK at the first store she would walk in.Then dad continued to order pants for himself for another few years from that place. So, when I went back many years after his passing, the tailors, two brothers recognized me because I look so much like my father I guess. They asked for dad's name and pulled his last measurements from their files. It was a very emotional moment. I think part of the reason why I kept the tailor-made ones is just that. Just a tie I still have with dad. I know it is mushy and probably stupid. I will donate the pants. I loved both my parents to the moon and back and I already have their genes in me so, I do not need material things. He was only 54 when he passed 26 years ago. If  nothing goes wrong, I will be his age next year. Wow... just wow... The things we bury in our minds and hearts..."},

I always cringed when I paid for those imports. I have decided to make lasagna without noodles. I will use eggplants which I have already cooked in the oven. When I turn on the oven, I like to make at least two things. I have cut the eggplants lengthwise and soaked them in salty water before oiling them and cooking them on a sheet. They are ready for tomorrow.I will also be cooking Thom Ka Soup tomorrow. I think, I will have enough leftovers for another day of both dishes. There will be chicken salad in this week's menu. I will also be trying the frozen hamburger patties of one of the stores I went to. My sister said it was really good so, I will wrap the hamburger patty in iceberg lettuce and forgo the bun.There are tons of greens and radishes to make salads with. I will possibly make a chili at the end of the week.Although I made lists, I forgot to buy carrots, pickled cucumbers and eggs. No big deal. There is a smaller grocery store within 5 minutes of my apartment.Tomorrow I will dust and vacuum the entire apartment. Thinking about it makes me wanna run. I need to mpo the floors too but, let's not go that far yet. If I can, I will.On Wednesday, I will dump all the pants I had been hanging on to and take a picture for Treaders. Lol!  The pants are the biggest mountain I need to climb. I will feel very light once they are gone. There are a few outerwear items mom used to wear. I will donate them too. Sigh...I wish everyone a good and fulfilling week as we approach the end of the year real fast."},

Yes, I do work part time, but that requires only a few decent looking pieces. In her comment, Treaders from Random Thoughts talked about the same thing.Sooooo, I decided to challenge both of us to purge our work clothes by the end of this month! Of course, there must be rules so, here are the ones I could think of:1. We will count the tops, jackets and bottoms by November 15th and share on our blogs.2. At the end of the challenge, we are allowed to keep a maximum of 6 tops, 4 jackets and 6 bottoms. These should cover all seasons so, we need to select wisely.3. Everything set aside shall have to be donated latest by November 30th. So no keeping them around our homes beyond that point.3. Just couldn't think of a reasonable penalty?Any ideas? Anybody else who want to join?"},

Normally, my suitcase would sit on the floor for days and things would be scattered around. As soon as I got up today, I found the motivation to put my beach things away, exchange the contents of my IKEA SKUBB boxes, and neatly put away everything. So, now I have my warm clothes in my closet. YAY! All set to face the cold seasons.Next job is to clean the refrigerator so that I can grocery shop. In the afternoon I must collect my deliveries from the Management Office, pick-up my meds from the Pharmacy. I still have too many clothes in my closet which I will never wear again. I just can't make up my mind. Most are work clothes which I have needed only three times this year. I can definitely get rid of a bunch. I guess, I am not mentally there yet.Before I went to Ankara, my SIS was there and she took everything she thought she could wear from mom's closets. She also made a pile to give away. Now there are only night gowns, shawls and some shirts that I can wear. The rest are household things left from mom like bedding, towels, etc. which we can all use. I feel so accomplished and proud of myself because for once in my lifetime, I emptied my suitcase poperly right after getting back home and put it away. Small joys of life are the things that keep us going right?Today is a very dark and rainy day. It is 13℃ which is 55℉. Only 10 days ago, I was at the beach using an umbreall to keep in shade. Lol! Well, it is getting colder in Antalya too. I hear my washing machine announcing that it is finished. I better go and hang up the laundry."},

I spend too much time on the Internet and I am determined to exercise, eat healthy and spend time doing different things each day.Reading is my number one hobby so, there's that.I found a lot of yarn and knitting needles among mom's belongings. I have crochet hooks and other knitting needles along with a lot of yarn at home too. Mom bought them but never had time to knit any of it. So, I have plenty of knitting and crochet material to play with.I have always wanted to make granny squares and I will be trying my hand at that. I bought some very colorful yarn for granny squares.I also have a coloring book for adults. It is buried somewhere in my bookcase. Time to dig that up and the coloring pencils too.Add the sewing projects I already have on top of these, there is plenty to keep me occupied and happy. Well, I hope so anyway...I think there will also be many Zoom Meetings with friends to fight the solitude. Today, I just felt this urge to go shopping. As I can not go to a Mall and wonder around carelessly, I walked into this store I really like. They offer very reasonably priced textile products. I bought myself two sweaters that I can wear at home during the winter. They are 50% real wool and 50% acrylic. Pure wool is hard to find and extremely expensive these days. Honestly, this mini shopping excursion felt good. Then I thought about this and believe it or not, my last shopping trip was in the US in January to buy something for myself. No wonder I felt like it.Tomorrow, I am heading home (hopefully)."},

So, I decided to check my BP and of course it was pretty high. I fought with it till early hours in the morning and decided to postpone my trip to tomorrow. If I still do not feel any better, I might postpone yet another day.BP or not, I took the old lady to the cemetery. It was very emotional for her and she thanked me many times. Every time I come to Ankara, I try going to the cemetery so, from now on, I will ask her if she wants to go with. It is so sad to see her trying to take care of her bed-ridden husband all by herself. If I were living here, I would do more for them. I call them every week to say hi. I told them I had many friends and in case they needed anything, I can easily ask my friends so, they should not feel troubled by anything. I can even hop in the cr an be here in 5 hours if need be. In the Spring, when I come back here, I will find a sitter for the husband for a few hours so that, I can take her out to lunch or something. She only goes out to grocery shopping in her neighborhood. While we were driving to the cemetery she was shocked to see how much everything has changed. Poor dear.I still have a lingering headache. Had dinner an hour ago, so I better wait another hour to check my BP again.Meanwhile, I have two assignments: 1. My BFF in the US wants to paint her foyer with a dark tan-ish color. She loved the foyer's color of the Irish mansion in Marcella, the TV show. She showed me her three colors she selected and told me to find out which one is more like it. So, I gotta go back to a few episodes. Lol! What a task right? Yesterday we spent a half hour trying to see which sample she had, worked better under different lights in her foyer on Whatsapp Video. Love the technology. Makes it possible to be best friends with someone who lives 5 thousand miles away.2. My SIS and BIL will be purchasing a Hybrid Toyota Corolla and since I am considered  a bit of a car enthusiast (yeah right, rolling eyes), they told me to compare and contrast the options within their budget. So, I better go tackle my assignments in order not to get in trouble."},

I wrapped each pair of shoes individually and I placed the huge bags in my trunk.I bought a nice potted cyclamen to bring to an old colleague and a good friend of my father's. We lived in the same neighborhood and my mom was also very good friends with his wife. Whenever I am here in Ankara, I always call them up to see if they need anything. The gentleman is bed ridden and his wife is 80 years old. She took me up on my offer this time and I took her to two grocery stores and she stocked up on quiet a few items. After bringing her purchase home, we visited for about half an hour and I kept my mask on. As I was saying goodbye, she gave me a huge bowl of Turkish style meat filled ravioli. I hadn't planned dinner so, I appreciated that very much.I had to ditch a friend for lunch because I needed to visit two other older friends who know each other. If I had visited one and not the other, potentially, one might have felt hurt. Yeah! I know, I have sensitive friends. Oh and BTW, I had seen the friend I had to ditch just three weeks ago. Anyway, one of them got a potted cyclamen too and the other got a bouquet of gerberas. I will buy some potted chrysanthemums for myself when I go back home. Flowers always cheer one up. We all need some color and pretty things around us in these depressing times.We sat with a good distance from each other at both houses and I kept my mask on when I was not eating or drinking. We may not be able to see each other in person for a long time in winter. We shall have to rely on apps to talk to each other. One of them gave me a butternut squash she grew. I stopped by the appropriate charity boxes for the donations and when I came home, I jumped in the shower, heated my dinner and gobbled it up. Then my BFF who lives in Upstate NY and I watched another episode of Bosch. I still have a few things to pack and need to put the kitchen in order. Tomorrow morning, I will load my car and pick up the lady I visited today. She told me she wanted to visit the cemetery and she had no means to go all by herself. So, we shall be visiting my parents and her son whom she lost in January. Mom knew her son well and she was devastated to learn that he had passed. After I drop the lady off at her home, I will take off to finally go back home.I am sure, I will be very exhausted tomorrow night when I reach home."},

I got blocked since I could not remember my password and had lost my debit car. They gave me a debit card right on the spot. Impressive! I will soon be transferring some money over to that bank so, I needed to go there.After the bank, I went to my sister's jeweler to pick up the gold coins I had ordered. The jeweler is a nice man and we had tea and chatted a little bit. I even got to meet his wife.Then I went to see my cousins who own a gift shop. We were chatting away when I realized that I was going to be late for my Zoom meeting so, I rushed out. All of a sudden several friends started calling me and as I answered the first one, I found out that a big earthquake hit Izmir and some buildings collapsed and people got buried under rubble. All my friends were inquiring after my SIS and BIL who were luckily here in Ankara. After I answered all calls, I started making my own calls and found out that everybody I know are OK. It is relieving but, there are people badly injured and some who lost their lives. We do not know the aftermath yet. Many people will be spending the night in their cars afraid to go inside.And, on my way home, I found out that my meeting is actually next Friday. Rolling my eyes at myself...So, I stopped at a hobby store to pick up some yarn to try my hand in making granny squares this winter.SIS and BIL came home very exhausted so, we ordered food.It was such a whirlwind of a day."},

I was worried a little because, today was  half day due to a National Holiday tomorrow but, since the couple who bought the place did not take out a mortgage and paid in cash, everything fell into place rather nicely.The lady is 56 years old and I am guessing her husband is a bit older, not much. They are downsizing from a big 4 bedroom apartment to this 2 bedroom because, it is easier to maintain and heat the apartment. Besides, they take care of grandchildren during the day so, an apartment complex with a large garden and security was what they wanted. I hope they enjoy their new home.As for the money I have pocketed, I distributed it between Turkish Liras, USD and Gold Coins. I normally did not invest in Euros but, I also bought some this time. This country is headed towards very tough times due to a terrible Government. I am not looking to make money but rather, make sure I don't lose any.I then came home prepped for dinner and left to meet my childhood friends for lunch. Ankara is definitely getting colder and after 4.p.m it was hard to sit outside. Then I came home, cooked dinner and ate with my SIS and BIL. As I type this, they are tidying up the kitchen and taking care of the dishes.In about an hour we will have tea. They always have tea after dinner so, I will tag along. Not a fan of tea although tea culture is a big deal in my country. You may want to check this out: Yes, I would love to have another glass of tea! I think it is very cute and spot on."},

Wednesday is a half day and Thursday is a National Holiday so, hopefully I will transfer the deed and get my money on Friday. If not, there is always the other week. I am so glad to be rid of this property. It wasn't bringing a decent rent and honestly, the apartment was getting old so, repairs would start to pop here and there. It was not a great part of Ankara either. I wouldn't want to live in that neigborhood if I had returned to Ankara for good. It is not about crime or anything like that. Just not some area I like plus too many young loud kids playing in the park of the apartment complex. It is on the ground floor so, it gets real noisy.I had bought it just because, I had some money that I wanted to use for an investment at the time. I lived in it for 17 months or so and then, it was always rented.On another note, I will be very very isolated when I go back to Istanbul because, they say 40% of all Covid-19 cases in Turkey are in Istanbul. That is scary. So, I will be very careful and try to entertain myself at home. After all, they advise against dining indoors and all summer long we enjoyed that outside anyway. It is not something I should miss till Spring.If I get too bored, I can always hop in my car and ride around and take a short walk by the sea."},

I am not much familiar with this city. I found my way to the Old Harbour and walked around a little bit. I wore socks and a cotton sweater. I had packed them just in case for my Ankara leg of the trip, never thinking that they would be necessary over here in Antalya. I think when I finally go back home by the end of the month, I will have to put away summer clothes, take out warmer ones and put a comforter on my bed.

He feels like he is doing time in prison. That is the extent of his dislike but hey, we all did what we had to do right?This morning the kids (yes, I know they are 46 and 48 but, that's what we call them anyway) left around 10 a.m. I decided not to go to the beach because, probably it is too crowded on a Sunday. They do place the lounge chairs 6 feet apart but still, I did not feel comfortable.It is going to rain possibly on Monday and Tuesday so, no beach days. Uncle and I decided to go to the Apollo Temple in Side on Tuesday. A change of pace for both of us. I don't know how many more days I will be here but, I guess I may be back in Istanbul early November. This is the beauty of being retired and single. I do not need to plan anything. There are cons too of course but, I have always been and still am content with what life gave me. I got a message and a refund for one of the swimsuits I bought online.

In the middle of the summer I wouldn't bother but, now, it is in the upper 70s and lower 80s (Fahrenheit).It looks like as long as the weather permits or till I get bored, I will stay here.Here is a video from the beach and some more pictures:This new blogger interphase is stupid. I cannot write uner the pictures somehow.The first picture is the entrance of the park. The second is a shot of the beach. The video says it all I think.As I was changing my swimsuits today, I found out that my favorites are getting faded and old.

When I was coming back from Cesme, I had bought wonderful big white onions and forgot to delete the onions in my online grocery order. That is why I ended up with so much.I love Italian Soffrito or Holy Trinity in my pasta sauces. So, I took the processor out, chopped a giant onion with the celery and carrots and then sauteed them in EVOO. That was pretty easy and painless as compared to the rest of the onions. Oh my! I cried my eyes out while processing the onions and even my giant wok could not handle all of it at once. I sauteed them in two batches and now they are cooling down.

We are sitting at a table in a place I do not recognize. Looks like a cafeteria or something. She looks a bit confused. I am asking what she experienced when she died and she says she remembers talking to my sister through somebody. I guess like a psychic and I am telling her no, that was me and I try to remind her the conversation and then it dawns on me we could have done that because she was not really dead. I semi-woke up feeling happy and then realized nope, we put her in the ground and remembered the funeral all over again. This is the first time I actually saw her in a dream. Or at least the first dream that I remember.When my dad passed, I was 27 and my sister was 20. She was still at school. Mom had told me one of his last words was: \"It's OK, I will not be worried, there are the girls\".  So, he entrusted us with her. He knew we would be her support.

I am too chicken to go the hair salon.I guess I will use the hair dye that I have on hand which is the light golden brown and next time, I will use a color that matches my own hair better  so that, I will not have a parade of colors on my head before I attempt to go gray yet again.

On Wednesday, I will check out my apartment which is vacated as of today and return the deposit. The realtor will put it up for sale for the time being.

WTF? I called them up and they told me to re-send the paperwork to a FAX MACHINE! Who uses fax machines nowadays?  Well I found a fax app which bills directly to my mobile phone. I sent the paperwork yet again. I will do it on Monday too because I have a feeling they will pretend they never received it. I will make sure to mark it \"REMINDER!\".I use the same cable company and my contract will be up December 21st. I can't wait to cut it off. Amazon Prime and Netflix are enough. I do not watch anything else on TV anyway. The only problem is that I will need to find a new internet service provider because my internet comes with the cable. I am sure I will be able to find good deals by the end of the year.When I had signed up for the service they had a good documentary package I specifically picked. Over the years they dropped some of the channels and this month they dropped Investigation Discovery and Animal Planet. That is the last straw. They also stopped showing the new seasons of the crime shows I loved to watch. I'm done with them.I better get started on my list of the things I need to take on my vacation.

{"title": "A Day at the Court", "date": "Thursday, October 1, 2020", "text": "This is a story from 1991. I was living and working in the US back then. One day as I was driving home from work, as I slowed down to take the exit, the traffic stopped suddenly and I managed to stop behind a van. It was a close call. However, the young woman driver behind me could not stop and I got hit from behind which made me hit the van this time. I ended up being the middle car in a 5 car accident.That was my first and thankfully the only accident so, I was shaken a bit. After the initial shock, I got out and saw that the front end of my car was in real bad shape because the van was a higher vehicle. The back side of my Toyota Corolla was not so bad, despite being hit from behind. The car that hit me was a smaller and lower car too. So, as we were all waiting for the police to come to the scene, my colleagues who were also returning home, saw the accident and they stopped to support me. Imagine identical Toyota Corollas with consecutive license plates keep coming and a bunch of foreigners appearing at the scene. Alien Invasion, no less!The police came and gave each and every one of us that were involved in the accident a ticket because of following too closely. Say what? And, the fine was not even specified on the ticket. That is unheard of in my country. So, the next day when I talked to my American colleagues, they told me to fill the back side of the ticket pleading \"Not Guilty\" and take the issue to the court. My 23 year old pride was already hurt because of the accident and I would never pay a single dollar for a ticket I did not deserve. No way! So, I filled out the form pleading not guilty and sent it at via the Post Office because it had to be registered mail. They sent me similar forms at least three times just to make sure if I really pleaded not guilty and, each time I had to go to the Post Office to send those forms. Finally, they gave a court date but of course, they changed it at least twice and each time I had to confirm my answer through the Post Office. I guess people just give up and pay at one point. Have they met me? I can be very stubborn. By the time \"the\" court date arrived, my car had already been fixed and returned to me for several months.On the day of the trial, I had to be there at 9 a.m. but the traffic related issues were not attended to till after 3 p.m. or so. However, you had to be there all day otherwise, your license would be suspended. Seriously they took attendance a few times during the day. So, I waited patiently and have seen rather comical trials. One of them was about this middle-aged couple who were brought in because of neighbor complaints. The lady was in hair rollers and her husband was in his pajama pants and white tank top. They were constantly yelling at each other and at one point, the lady hit her husband with her purse. The judge told the officers to get a hold of them and make them sit in separate rows and keep their mouths shut.I have seen lawyers who were dressed like the ones in old TV shows wearing bow ties with Prince de Galles suits. I have also seen people suing each other for all sorts of ridiculuos reasons and then I understood why there were so many 1-800-LAWYERS commercials on TV.Anyway, finally a police officer came to take the place of the prosecutor and gave us each 5 minutes to tell him about our cases. I told him that \"I WAS DEFINITELY NOT FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY\" because my pride was still hurt and it was a matter of principle. He agreed and told me that unless the officer was there personally to observe that I was following the vehicle in front of me closely, he is not supposed to issue such a ticket but, it is done all the time. You know, income for the police force... Tsk, tsk...When the judge told me \"Miss T'Pol, Officer so and so has asked to drop the charges against you. Do you have anything else to say?\" I stood up straight and proudly said \"No, your honor. Thank you!\" Hah! Goodby Elmsford Village Court!I think it was one of the most proud moments of my life. I persevered and won."},

Yeah right!!!?? I heard this weird noise from the outside and before I could realize,  huge hailstones came down from the sky and all I could think was \"Oh F...! My car!\" I had to wait of course because, I figured my head is a bit more precious than my car.I ran out when I could and checked my car. There are 4-5 dents which I hope can be fixed easily. Also, I will probably end up using this car till it falls apart. So, it is OK. With the current taxes, it is no longer possible to buy a new car anymore, anyway.A car with a 2.0 engine which has a base price of TL 170,000 is sold at TL 650,000 How do you like that? Would you pay USD 83,300 (total cost of ownership) for a car which is only USD 21,800 (without any taxes)? Oh and BTW, that sort of car is considered a luxury car here which is probably a mid-level car in the US. I understand there should be taxes but, 382%? As a country we are getting poorer and poorer.

They have only been married for a year. I kind of knew/suspected this was coming. Last April, they were supposed to increase the rent  according to our contract but, the young woman called me to say that her husband had lost his job due to COVID-19 and I let them keep the rent the same. I asked for her husband's CV to send to my friends in Ankara. When I looked at the CV, I found that he started at a bank, a pretty good job but then he left and kept changing his jobs frequently. It looked like he did not have any skills developed over quiet a few years and I thought he would never be able to find a job during the pandemic. She is still working for the same bank where they apparently met. I cannot know the real reason for their separation of course but, that is what I suspect.I called my real estate broker and told him the news. If I can sell at a good price, I would like to sell. If not, it will be rented again. We'll see what happens. All I know is; I need to go see the apartment before I return the deposit. I must be in Istanbul till October 4th. Then, I was planning to go see my uncle. However, I may go to Ankara first, see the apartment, hand it over to the real estate guy and head South to Antalya. It is a shorter drive anyway. My uncle may want some Fall clothing items if he is not planning to go to Ankara anytime soon. On the way back, I should go through Ankara again since I must get my tyres changed with winter tyres. I have them changed and stored in Ankara. Seems like there are busy days and a lot of traveling ahead. Well, I guess that is a good thing before winter. I have a feeling, we will be stuck at home more."},

Apparently, it is one of the expensive maintenance steps or so they say. Anyway, the damage is done. I had budgeted half the amount based on previous maintenance jobs. My car has a diesel engine. That's another factor for the expensive maintenance.Then I went to get my meds from my pharmacy. Some of my regular meds are provided by Social Security at no cost to me. However, I bought additional meds and vitamins to last at least for two months. That was pretty expensive too. Next time I go see my doctor, I will try to get a medical report for some of the others so that, I will not have to pay as much.I was planning to go and buy some fresh fish but, I stumbled upon a very good price for a roaster chicken and some turkey wings. So, I grabbed them. A roaster gives me lots of meals. I spoke to my sister today. She told me they found a new caregiver for my BIL's mom and will be going to Ankara this weekend again. The old one will be leaving by the end of October. The new one is a bit younger and had been an excellent caregiver for one of my sister's friend's grandma who passed a couple of months ago. Both ladies are from Georgia (the country). During October both will be together so that the old caregiver can train the new one. BIL's mom is bedridden and she cannot talk. It is so sad. I do not think she has much time left because last time I saw her, she was super skinny and although she ate well, she cannot gain weight. I had even bought some liquid food supplements but, they did not help at all.The old one has decided to go to Germany for work and we are surprised. Due to COVID-19, this cannot be easy. We suspect somebody is scamming her. However, she has been very persistent. She has told my SIS and BIL that she will be going to Germany with a Greek passport! What!? How? This cannot be legal. She said she had already spent 4500 Euros. Well, that is a lot of money for someone who has to go abroad to work. If the German police finds out what she is up to, she will be in a lot of trouble. My sister warned her about this but, hey, she is an adult, right? You cannot help someone who does not want to be helped. All these years, she was legally here. My BIL did everything by the book and spent tons of money on insurance and work permits. Most people take shortcuts but, as a family, we will never resort to illegal business."},

Apartment dwellers like I am are not so much. Although, I can spend time all by myself perfectly, I sometimes long for going out just to window shop or walk at the waterfront. I can do these things but then I must wear a mask, keep my sanitizer on hand, constantly be alarmed to keep social distance from other people. It is exhausting. If I had a little yard, I could grow veggies and flowers and sit outside in the sun. Or so I think. Lol! Given human nature who knows what I would want then?Long time readers know that I am a landlady of a two bedroom apartment in Ankara. Few days ago, management sent a notice that there were 3 COVID-19 cases and everybody should wear masks in teh buildings and in the garden. There are 7 buildings and a large garden in that apartment complex with basketball courts and play areas for kids. Today, the management sent another notice with big bold uppercase letters that, the security guards will report everybody without masks to the police. All over my country, masks are mandatory for everyone. There is a hefty monetary penalty too but, not a lot of people care and not all can be penalized. I am sure some people will take this as a threat to their rights and start talking about the legality of this but, the fact of the matter is, COVID-19 is now their neighbor. Hope, my tenants are taking precautions and keeping safe and healthy.On another note, I found out that I ordered spare heads for my electric toothbrush twice. Not a bad mistake. I will use them but certainly, I am not as organized as I like to be.My grocery order will be delivered in a couple of hours and I will walk to the Pharmacy afterwards to pick up my meds. My pill boxes need filling. I really would like to go out to the seashore to the fish market and buy some fresh fish but I am too lazy to do it today. Tomorrow, I will be taking my car to the service so, on the way back, I can go get my fish.

{"title": "Cats!", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2020", "text": "I am not talking about the musical but, I have seen it on Broadway twice actually.For 50 years I had ailurophobia to the point that eating a meal out with me in the summer would be a nightmare for mom and sis. As most other nations do not have so many stray cats and dogs roaming the streets, it might be difficult for most of my readers to understand. People like cats and they feed them on the streets. Real pet lovers do of course have animals at home but, they also feed the strays. My sister carries cat and dog food in her trunk. The municipalities try to collect the stray animals and have them neutered but, it is a job fit for Sisyphus.Anyhow, at my last workplace few weeks before I left it, I actually petted a kitten and held her and got over my phobia. With that said, I still do not try to pet a stray cat. I am not jumpy anymore when they brush past me.I live in an apartment complex and my apartment is located at the entrance level. My windowsill is about 6 feet high. Up until last week, I have never seen a cat jumping up there and look inside. Well, last week a youngish cat jumped as I was watching TV and meowed her/his heart out. I had a can of tuna so, I put it on the windowsill and she/he gobbled it up. The next time it showed up, I gave it some lunch meat. I then bought a bag of dry cat food and poured some on the corner of the windowsill. It showed up again but, decided that cat food is no good and kept meowing. I caved in and gave it some more lunch meat.A few days later, another one jumped up. This one is a black and white cat. He eats the cat food and always comes back to check to see if there is any more. I think, they are friends although they never show up together.Today the first cat showed up, ate some of the cat food and came back looking at me so, I gave it a big piece of turkey ham. Then the other one showed up and ate the leftover cat food. This time I felt guilty and fed it some turkey ham too. I do not dare to open the window all the way and pet them but, I think I will keep feeding them as long as they come to visit. There are two cat houses at different locations so, I am sure they can get to food and water all the time. A lot of people tell me to get a cat but, I do not think I will ever be a true cat person. Although I am not deadly afraid, I am not ready to be chums with one."},

We'll see.I took out the sewing machine to keep busy. I have some projects along with some more mask making in my mind. Yesterday night I was talking to one of my childhood friends and she mentioned that she wanted to buy a certain table for her balcony from IKEA. I told her I have the same exact table that I am not using. It is disassembled since 2012 and packed in my underbed storage. I had two and I am using one of them in my balcony too. She is happy and I am happy that I will be able to get rid of something that I do not need. There are a few other things I would like to get rid of. Let's see if I can find new homes for those."},

Iznik is a small town with a lot of history so, here is a link for anyone who who would like to know more.My friend preapared a picnic basket as I chatted away with her two daughters and her dad. It was a very windy and cloudy day so, swimming in the lake was not possible. We tried and got ourselves wet anyway.It was a fun visit and I came home by 10 p.m. Today, I went to the grocery store and came back with four 2 liter bottles of EVOO. I am all set for a whole year I think. The young lady at the cash register told me I could buy six 2 liter bottles of EVOO because it was a real good price. I bought only four because I already had a 2 liter tin can at home. I cook exclusively with EVOO. I use butter only in rice and some sauces. Never use margarin or any other oils.  May be I will take one of the bottles to Ankara on my next trip. I had used the last of it while I was there.I found perfect marbled steaks and bought some to freeze. I also bought about 3 pounds of chopped meat.When I came home, I first stuffed most of the peppers with a rice mixture (rice, EVOO, chopped onions, pine nuts, currants, dried mint leaves, cinnamon). While that was cooking, I stuffed the leftover peppers, tomatoes and zucchini with a meat mixture (chopped meat, rice, chopped onions, parsley) and cooked them in a tomato sauce.I sauteed odd peppers and insides of the tomatoes and zucchini for tomorrow. I will have that with garlic yogurt. It is more of a meze than  dinner dish. Besides, it helped me waste nothing.Some of the chopped meat became meat patties cooked in tomato sauce. I had a few of those over a bed of eggplant mash. There is another portion for tomorrow. I cheated and used canned grilled eggplants for the mash but hey, who cares?I sauteed the rest of the chopped meat with onions for later use. Soft tacosI will be freezing most of what I cooked so, whenever I feel lazy, I will know I have food in the freezer.This was a productive day so, I am happy."},

I haven't been in IKEA for almost a year now, I think.I also  needed to go to the Post Office but, the line outside was too long. Hopefully, tomorrow I will do it early enough so that, I will not have to wait in line. After that, I will do my grocery shopping. I do not feel like doing anything else today but I actually do have chores to do at home. Oh well...Life is certainly not what it used to be and it doesn't look like we shall be normal again. The number of cases are rising rapidly. It is actually worse than March/April/May but, the government isn't taking the same precautions for economy. I guess the economy is more important than human life. I hate this government of ours. First and foremost, they are thieves. They have no clue as to how the run the economy. They upped the taxes on the cars yet again. So, if you are buying a new car for yourself, you need to buy THREE of them for the government. Taxes are that high! They have no clue about running relationships with other nations so, it looks like the war we had fought and won 98 years ago will have to be fought again. I don't think it will be won this time because there is no genius like Ataturk running the country now. They are dragging the country to chaos having alienated every former ally. On top of this the stupid virus affected us in many ways. My grocery spending is significantly higher but my dining out/takeout/delivery spending is very very low. I must say, grocery prices are much higher compared to the last year too.I run the dishwasher almost daily now since, I am preparing my meals. Laundry seems never ending despite the fact that I am home most days. I do not get to see my friends as much as I want to. I cannot hug and kiss my SIS when I see her. I have decided to buy a mixed bag of frozen vegetables to stick in the fridge this year. I like to have fresh veggies but, now, I really do not want to go out much and it is difficult to buy fresh, consume and go buy some more for just one person. So, I will still buy fresh but, when I am out, I will not have to rush to the store.I usually do not like canned food but, I have bought some canned vegetables just in case.

{"title": "The Fall and whether I should freak out and a new mobile phone", "date": "Thursday, August 27, 2020", "text": "Today, I noticed a couple of branches turning yellow on the huge linden tree in front of my living room. Fall has always been my favorite season but, this year nothing seems to excite me anymore. I do not know whether I should start freaking out or not, but, I am coughing a little bit and my temperature is slightly elevated. I am taking an antibiotic for my implant so, even a slightly elevated temperature is alarming. I have no other symptoms such as loss of smell, achy joints and etc. I am hoping, it is just a simple cold.I made some Tom Kha Gai today. Sounded like a good cold and cough remedy. I also made fresh ginger/lemon tea using the real ginger and lemons. I may have another one after dinner.My 4 year old phone is about to kick the bucket. I have been resisting to replace it for some time. The battery needs to be charged like four times every day and I cannot use all the apps I need to use. I had to get rid of many apps because, it is just a 32Gb phone. Due to the weak TL, phone prices have sky-rocketed over here and I am the kind of person who does not like shelling out a bundle of money for a COOL phone. I have been an Ericsson fan for years and then when they sold their phone business to SONY, I became a SONY fan. Well, nobody imports SONY anymore because of it's high prices and even if they did, I do not think I would be willing to pay a lot of money. They used to be very reasonable in the past.I have been making do with my phone for quiet a while now and I even thought about getting it's battery replaced. However, that doesn't help with the capacity issue.My lovely, smart SIS came to the rescue! She found out that a website we frequently order online, is buying your old phone back and crediting your account for that buyback amount. Her husband had an old IPhone 7 which he was not using anymore. It's camera is not working. Their bank provides them with new phones every two years and lets them keep the old phones. She looked it up online and told me that they were paying a good deal of money for the IP 7. So, I started looking for phones and have decided to buy a Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite. It is a 128 GB; more than enough capacity and it has an enormous battery. Read good reviews about it and I know I will always miss the SONY phones I have had the pleasure of using so far, but, hey; it is just a gadget. I wanted to buy a Motorola when I was back in the US last year but, they are also non-existent in this market so, repair would not be possible if something happened. Plus,  the  government upped the taxes on the phones brought into the country by travelers just to please the importers while I was still in the US. You can only bring one phone every two years and you have to pay a huge tax. Have I mentioned that I really hate the government? I do.So,Xiaomi                                3609 TL (USD 493)IP 7                                   - 1900 TL (USD 259)Money out of pocket           1709 TL (USD 233) Perfect!So, I signed up for the campaign and SIS will send the I phone to the buying party who will credit my account within 15 days and I will be buying my new phone. Many friends may laugh at me because I certainly can easily afford a shiny, expensive, cool phone. They may think, I am being cheap. However, I think, this is only frugal. The phone I use, the apartment I live in, the car I drive do not define who I am. Do they?"},

It took a very short time for him to put the implant in. Then he stitched the place up and I was good to go. He made me stay a little while and gave me a prescription for an antibiotic, a pain killer and a mouth wash type of thing. He asked me to take the antibiotic and one pain killer right away. He also told me if I felt pain at night, I could take another one. It has been well over 5 hours and so far, I am OK. After the dentist visit, I did some grocery shopping. I am determined to stay put at home for a while because I was out and about too much lately. The house is getting out of control and so is my weight. I have trouble sleeping well for a long time now.

The bus service was provided by his workplace and so was our apartment. We did not have a car back then. He and mom had a handful of favorite spots to go. Although we stopped doing it after SIS was born, and after mom started working too, it stuck with me.

It was a very nice day and the water was awesome. To give the readers an idea; here is a map:As you can see, our neighbors are Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq and Syria. ,We share the Black Sea with Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia. The sea between Greece and Turkey is called the Aegean and our southern coastline is the Mediterrenean. I keep mentioning Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and Antalya and you can see them all on this map.It felt good to swim and just be in the water. My friends, a nice couple whom I have known for the last twenty years were happy to see me after many months, may be almost a year. After sitting at the beach in a shade and swimming, we barbecued some steaks and then went back to the beach to enjoy the amazing sunset.Here are a few photos of my beautiful Sunday:Today, I had an old filling replaced and now that the anesthesia wore out, it started aching. On Wednesday, I am going to get the work started on my implant. It is a great thing that my dentist is a HS buddy. I trust him. He is my Tooth Fairy. Lol!I will take a pain killer and rest a little bit."},

Then I swept and washed the floors of my kitchen and the entrance to my apartment. Since, I got rid of all the junk at the entrance, it looks very spacious and nice. Now it smells nice too.As I type this, two eggs are boiling on the stove. I am having egg salad on top of a mixture of onions, tomatoes and cucumbers for dinner tonight.I also need to take out the last piece of work I was dealing with to go over it. The customer had stopped that due to the pandemic but, as we approach the Fall, they want us to go ahead. Seems like work may resume. We will see about that.The Fall is definitely in the air. Now, I realize it gets darker much earlier than in June and the breeze is cooler with some of the trees slightly turning color. I am sure there will be warmer days but, the change is in the air.I am invited to a friend's summer home for the day tomorrow. Initially, I did not want to go but, these types of things may help shake my depressed state of being. So, I'm going.I also got another invitation from one my of friends whom I work with. She says she is working from her summer home and we could work together and still enjoy the beach. I think,  I will go. After that, I think I will go visit my uncle for a few days. He sounds like he is missing us. My SIS and BIL are not sure whether they will be able to take time off this year."},

We grew up in the same neighborhood, our dads were colleagues and moms were friends. We know each other since we were three years old or so. Now, that is an old friend right? Lol!She is a bit depressed too because she lost her mom and dad within two years. She was very close to her mother like I was and she misses her very very much. She just got retired and due to COVID-19, she cannot do any of the things she wanted to do.We were just chatting about how much stuff needs to be done around our homes and how we felt like we did not want to do them. I have a closet full of shoes, suitcases and who knows what else. She said, she needed to go through her clothes and we were laughing at ourselves. She said well, you go tackle your closet tomorrow and I will tackle mine. Let's call each other or at least text as to how we did.Sounded like a good idea to me.Today, I started by getting rid of the broken vase that had been stting in a clumsy package by the door for the last two weeks or so. I could not put it with the garbage because I cut myself badly enough as I was trying to make a safe package. I did not want to cause anybody else any harm. So, I asked the apartment complex manager to send someone for me to hand it over. It was a huge glass vase which I absolutely did not need. So, I am kind of glad it is broken and gone.I also had some stuff that came with the grocery delivery which were being quarantined by the door. That was four days ago so, I put them where they belong. The entrance area got cleared away and I took down the whole closet. Yikes!I then washed inside of it. Took out all the shoes from their individual boxes. Cleaned them if they needed cleaning and gave each pair a coat of shoeshine. Decided which ones to give away and put each pair in individual plastic bags. They are ready to be donated.I cleaned the suitcases and travel bags. They collect dust just sitting there and the closet now looks a lot better.We do not enter our homes with shoes. At the entrance everybody changes into slippers. I need to buy a few pairs of new slippers for when uncle, SIS and BIL visit. The pairs I had for them are worn out but, before I replace them, I am not getting rid of them just yet.I even cleared a space for the vacuum cleaner. Yay! Inspired by One Family One Income, I cleaned my vacuum cleaner thoroughly. It is now good as new. Feeling very accomplished today. Tomorrow, I will tackle the little table by the door. I had been dumping stuff on it for quiet a while now. It won't take long. Then I will wash the floors of the kitchen and the entrance.Tomorrow is mom's birthday. She would have been turning 78. Sigh... I am getting together with a small group of High School friends tomorrow night. I know they will be good  for me."},

I do not remember how many times I warned people to keep the social distance, cover their noses with the mask and wear the damn mask. It is mandatory here in this city and people must wear masks properly at all times. Period!How can this be so darn hard? Yesterday, I have read that a woman was tested positive but, she kept it a secret because her daughter was getting married. If she herself had kept home, may be it would not be that bad but, she attended the wedding and people started to get sick right after the occasion. So, the health officials immediately started to interview people and found out about the wedding. Now they are tracing everyone who had contact with, who had contact with the woman. How can people be so selfish AND stupid?"},

After that, I went to a Notary to get some more documents notarized. These two were easy to do. I then went to cancel her land line but found out that the Internet comes with the land line. I wanted to keep the internet so, I had to fill a gazillion forms with the same info over and over again so that, they can transfer the title to me. It will get processed for a few days and when the transfer is finalized, I will cancel the landline and keep the Internet. As I was finishing my errands, a former colleague and a good friend called me and we decided to go to a Starbucks. I haven't been in one since February or may be even January. We sat outside away from a few people who were also there.We chatted for about an hour and a half and then on the way home, I just went into a grocery store to grab something for dinner. I will make sandwiches for tomorrow for the road. I also got gas so that, I can just get in my car and not stop till I get home.I intend to do a grocery shopping once I am back in Istanbul and just keep at home for a while. As I was filling out the dreadful forms today, I have realized that it has exactly been 2 months since mom passed. Between her 77 day ICU ordeal at the hospital and the shelter-in-place orders I do not think I know what hit us. It is just a blur and the void inside of me is still huge.What a year this is...I must go pack up my little suitcase, organize the paperwork, make the sandwiches and just be ready to hit the road tomorrow. I was planning to wash my sheets but, I will just place them in the washer. Sister can take care of that when she comes back here. Hanging up laundry for three weeks to a month does not make any sense. It will only collect dust."},
{"title": "COVID-19 on the rise again", "date": "Wednesday, August 5, 2020", "text": "In this country the COVID-19 has been handled fairly better than some other countries at the beginning. We had shelter-in-place orders, mandatory mask wearing in populated cities, lock-down on weekends and on a few other times along with travel restrictions. 65+ citizens and kids younger than 18 had to stay home for several weeks. Their needs were met by local authorities and volunteers. Most businesses allowed peope to work from home and high risk people who worked for government offices had paid leaves. My sister is one of those who did not go to work for 54 days starting March 20th. Restaurants, cafes, hairdressers, barbers and many non-essential businesses were closed.Then the Government decided to open the businesses since the economy is tanking and the tourism sector was hit really badly. And of course summer came with everybody looking forward to beach vacations. People started ignoring wearing masks and social distancing. They started attending wedding parties, beach parties and crowded get togethers. Lo and behold, the Covid-19 cases are on the rise again! They say the ICUs are filling up again. Today my cousin who has MS went to see her doctor due to a recent attack and she needs to get cortizone intravenously for 5 days. The doctor told her it would be very dangerous if they did it at the hospital because the risk of exposure is so high nowadays. He also told her never to leave home at least for a month because, the cortizone has an adverse effect on the immune system and she is very susceptible to any kind of virus, germ, whatever.Today, I had to go to a local government office to finally transfer the deed of my mom's apartment to my sister and me. My BIL called last night to ask me not to go. He has seen some of those offices where they live and he thought they were overly crowded. I assured him that I would not walk in if there were crowds. Luckily, they were observing the rules strictly and I was able to take care of the business. Wearing a mask is mandatory but, it is not enough. Washing the hands with a bar soap for the duration of at least two Happy Birthday songs and social distancing are also important aspects of taking care of ourselves.I hope people will go back to being careful."},

I need momentum, action and a sense of accomplishment in life.Yesterday I got together with my childhood friends. One is still working and she has a family of her own and has too much on her plate. The other just retired but, was already staying home since March due to Covid-19 anyway. She is single like I am and during the last 10 years or so, she had been arranging the caregivers for her parents and taking them to hospitals while she worked. In a matter of two years she has lost both parents and now, she says she just watches Netflix all day long. She feels depressed and regretful that she did not have a family of her own. We tried to cheer her up yesterday but, I am in not much of a different situation.I had always thought, I would do some volunteer work but, with Covid-19, that's not possible.My sleep schedule is quiet out of whack and I have no idea as to how to get back to normal. What to do?

My sister told me not to shop for anything because the long weekend is not as long and she wants to spend time with her in-laws and friends I guess.So, I just bought a pack of chicken breasts, 5 tomatoes, 5 cucumbers, 3 onions and a head of iceberg. I ate some grilled chicken and a salad today. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Most likely they will get up late and rush to her in-laws. I am going to see two of my childhood friends on Saturday. We were raised in the same neighborhood, our families were friends and our dads were colleagues. Older friends become closer as I age.It is so damn hot in this city.

Besides due to Covid-19, the pool is closed so there will not be any families crowding the restaurant after spending the day at the pool. There is a restaurant and a bar, a pool, one basketball, two tennis courts with a nice lawn to spread around.I miss my friends dearly so tonight will be a nice change. We will surely observe social distancing and be very careful.Tomorrow I am heading to Ankara for the long weekend coming up. My sister and BIL will join me too.

It took all of 50 minutes.I am still binge-watching Star Trek: Voyager and enjoying it very much.A HS friend of mine has moved to the US last year. She and her husband are architects and their two sons are going to college in the US too. Yesterday we were talking over whatsapp and she told me she had a niece going to Cornell studying Business Administration /Economy. She told me this young lady is interested in tech companies and was looking for some advice/mentorship and asked me if I would talk to her. I happily accepted that because, I never miss a chance to share my experience.My friend's niece called me today at the time we had agreed on and we talked for about an hour. I enjoyed our talk and I hope she liked it too. Although she has lived all her life in the US, she speaks flawless Turkish and looking at her whatsapp message introducing herself, her written Turkish is excellent too. Kudos to her parents!My sister and my uncle shared the temperature today in Izmir and Antalya as 102 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Yikes!

{"title": "Forgotten Favorite", "date": "Thursday, July 23, 2020", "text": "As a kid I used to love a veggie and meat recipe but, I forgot about that dish completely. There really is no recipe for it since, it is rather simple. I haven't been making it in ages. A couple of days ago, I had some leftover lamb meat and a bunch of vegetables so, I decided to make it.It doesn't have to be lamb. It can be any meat you like. If anyone is interested:1 large potato (cubed)2 eggplants (cut them up in half inch slices)A big handful of string beans or a bit more. Cut them up about an inch long or a bit longer2 tomatoes (cubed)4-5 Cuban or Italian peppers (no hot peppers)2 zucchinis (half inch slices)1 onion2-3 tablespoons tomato sauce or a tablespoon of tomato pasteOlive oil or margarine or butter I like olive oil.1/2 pound of cubed meatSalt and pepper to tasteCut up the eggplants and soak in salt water, set aside.Cook the cubed meat first with a little oil.Add chopped onion and tomato sauce or paste, stir thoroughly. Lower the heat to a minimum just to simmer.Add string beans, a little water and cook further about 15 minutes with the lid on.Wash the eggplants and squeeze them.Add the eggplants, tomatoes, zucchini, potatoes and peppers, mix well. There should be enough water but not much. So, every once in a while you need to check this. Cook further with the lid on.If the vegetables are tender enough, you can take it off the stove. If you wait for the next day to consume it, it is even tastier. Please do not heat it up in a microwave. Stove top is the way to go. You can serve it with rice.What makes this recipe so tasty is, minimal heat and the long time to cook it. So, if you have a slow cooker, it could be perfect. However the meat takes the longest time and the beans take slightly longer to cook than other veggies. If you put everything all together, it can get pretty mushy.You can use more or less meat or any of the vegetables. It really depends on your taste buds. You can make it vegan if you forgo the meat."},

I always consider changing them but, as soon as I put up the floral lace sheer curtains in front of them I say to myself: \"It's not that bad. I don't have to see them and nobody else does either. Why spend money?\"I have tried ironing them before and the result is not any better. It is such a stupid material so, I do not iron them anymore. I take them out of the washing machine and just hang them back up. Easy!The dining room table now looks promising. Tomorrow, I will pretty that up. I have put away quite a bit of stuff today.As for Star Trek, I love all versions. I thought I had seen every episode of every version but, apparently I haven't or I must have forgotten some of them.I was going to go to the farmers market but, I decided not to go because, I woke up too late.I now have to put my hair in a pony tail, wear some nice top and join a Zoom Bridal Shower happening in South Carolina.

I am as fast as a sloth when it comes to doing house chores.I was overwhelmed by things scattered around all over the place, sewing stuff on my dinner table, all sorts of things I have brought back from Ankara, loads and loads of laundry and oh! the DUST! Everyday, I said to myself: \"How am I gonna get this mess in order?\"Well, today I realized that it doesn't look so bad anymore since I have been taking a few things at a time and putting them where they belong. It looks like the living room room can be cleaned tomorrow after a short trip to the farmers market early in the morning. I am planning to take down the curtains and dust, wash the windows and deep clean. It certainly looks doable but, we'll see if this sloth will have the stamina to do it.Here is what makes me want to cry: Back rooms need cleaning again. Thankfully, just dusting and vacuuming will suffice.Next up are the kitchen, the balcony and the entrance. The bigger chores are waiting for me in the closets. I have not been able to take them down yet. It is just another overwhelming chore. I need to get rid of many pairs of shoes. I wore a pair yesterday and remembered they hurt my feet. So, that pair is already set aside. This pandemic and the time I spent in Ankara due to mom's sickness taught me how little I actually need. However, whenever I start to set things aside to give away, I tell myself: \"Well, if I give all these away, I am sure I will need to go buy new stuff. These are in perfect condition. Why not keep them? So, let me hold on to these. Besides, what if I lose weight?, What if I gain weight?\" and put the things back in my closets. It is very difficult with outerwear. I like everything that I own and even if I wear a coat once or twice in a year, I like to keep that. Oh, well...I would like to buy fresh veggies and fruit tomorrow. If I go early enough, I am hoping the farmers market will not be crowded. Here is an image of yours truly:Image By Ralf Designs by Pixabay"},

He asked for help for these people. So, I told him I would like to contribute to this.Yesterday I asked him what to get and he said, there were a few women among them and that ladies hygiene products would be good. He told me he was taking water and food. So, I bought sanitary napkins, lots of hand soap and wet naps along with about 40 pounds of fruit from a big box store. I figured fresh fruit would be a welcome treat.So, this morning I met up with my friend and we went to the embassy only to find out that the refugees were taken to be sent back to their country. We decided to go to the place where we were told the people were taken to. When we went there, they told us they could not accept food from outside due to Covid-19. Stuck with lots of stuff to be donated we called a few places and finally found a soup kitchen. We took the stuff we bought and met with the coordinators. I asked the lady if sanitary napkins would be useful and she told me they were also helping battered wives and people on the streets so, she was very happy about that. I am glad, they were able to take those because, I cannot imagine being stuck with them especially now I have no use for sanitary napkins.I had to cross between the continents four times today but, after all, our mission is accomplished and we were able to do good.This friend of mine is about 11-12 years my junior and he is such a kind-hearted man. Through him, I was able to help several children in poorer parts of the country quiet a few times in the past.It was refreshing to spend time with a kind person and we chatted away as we were on the road.I have recently found out that a fellow Canadian blogger friend has been diagnosed with cancer. My heart goes out to her and I am wishing her the best."},

Then I went to the Government Office related with deeds and told them I could not find the deed in mom's documents. They gave me a document to prove her ownership. By 10:30 a.m. I was done with the documents required for submission to the Inheritance Tax Office.Then I went to the bank to which I had applied for lifting the lien on the Konya property. They had told me there were 28 outstanding checks by one of the previous shareholders and that constituted a risk for the bank so, they would not be able to lift the lien. My sister said there is a statute of limitations and they should be give me a list of the alleged 28 checks with their expiration dates. I had sent an e-mail to the guy and he never answered. So, it was time for a face to face talk. The lazy dud was sort of apologetic. he went downstairs to ops to get the list. Now, 27 of those checks have already expired. There is onşy one left to expire in November. He told me I could pay a certain amount of money for them to lift the lien. It is not a lot but, why would I pay them? I am in no rush to sell that property. I will wait till November and they will lift the lien. Victory!I decided to visit the two cemetaries where my grandparents are buried. They both wanted to be buried next to their mothers. That is why they are in separate spots. I got some flowers and went to visit them. I told them we have just sent their daughter and they should not wait for anybody else in a looooooong time since we are now outnumbered by a lot!The last thing on my agenda was to go see the house that belonged to my grandparents. I now own 5/6th of it and my sister owns 1/6. It is in real bad shape. I do not know what to do with it. It was kind of sad to see it like that. I have so many happy memories there. Sigh... Will think about it.I was back home in Ankara by 6 p.m.Yesterday morning, I went to submit the documents to the tax office. Then I went to visit mom and dad. Originally I was going to return to Istanbul today but, my sister and BIL are coming for the weekend. I have decided to stay and see them tomorrow. I will go back on Sunday.So, today I went to visit old friends of my parents. They have called me very often during mom's sickness and they had just lost their older son. The husband is bed ridden. The wife is 82 and she is the only caregiver. They cannot afford to hire someone. Really very sad. I visited with them for an hour and then took the lady for grocery shopping. I told her to take her time and get whatever she needed to. I drove her back and carried the groceries inside. I am sure glad, I was able to be of service if only a little. Then, I visited old friends with whom I worked for the same company both in the US and in Turkey. They have a really nice, big garden. We spent the whole afternoon chatting away. It was such a good time. I think, this was a happy day in a very long time.Now, I am ready to watch another episode of a Turkish show on Netflix with my BFF who lives in NY. The distance between us does not mean a thing.

Mom left us an apartment and her share in the family property. I already own the rest of that property and I cannot wait to sell it.My uncle is dragging his feet to clean the place and take whatever belongs to him. He still thinks since it is a home with some small yard it could be useful. He just does not get that none of us will be living in that city and none of us are up to dealing with a house and a yard. He also thinks since the place will not be sold at a good price (due to some technicalities), it is a waste to sell it. Well...Anyway, I am doing pretty good with what I eat but not so much with exercise. I have to start loving my treadmill. The treadmill is in the spare room and I have so much unfolded laundry on the bed there along with a drying rack which gets daily use nowadays that, working out is not appealing right now. Need to get that room put together fast. May be after I type this, I will go and take 15 minutes to do whatever I can.On another note, I have two scales at home and one needs a special battery, the other just died yesterday. It was working fine on Monday and now all it shows is an error message. It is a Tanita scale and I lke it very much. I need to get it fixed somehow.Yesterday night, I finally slept in my own bed instead of crashing on the loveseat. It took a while to fall asleep but, I did it. I will start going to bed early and try some soothing music or a really boring book to keep sleeping in my bedroom.Today, I realized that there was a story from my youth that my sister did not know. She was surprised too. It is a kind of funny one actually. Here it is:I did not have any boyfriends in my early teens. I did not have the time due to having to study very hard and commuting to school every day. Summers were usually at my grandparents and with my parents so, I had some little innocent crushes but, nothing that can be considered slightly as flirting. I was a bit of an introvert too. Yes, I was. I am surprised at that even now.Well, the summer after my freshman year, I turned 18 and we went to a vacation spot ran by my dad's workplace. We came accross and old schoolmate of his with his family. They had two sons, one a year older than I am and another, a year older than my sister. The two families became very friendly. Their son and I became friends and took long walks together, sat by the sea at night, sort of like a very very little flirting thing. My dad went nuts. He would tell my mom to stop me to hang out with this guy. Mom would argue with him thinking that he was nuts, etc. He never said a word, himself.After this 12 day vacation, we went to grandmas. One day I told my dad that I wanted to go on a long walk with him and I opened up his dreaded subject of me becoming an adult and showing interest in the other sex. After a long speech delivered by yours truly, we came back home to grandmas and not another word was said.When we went back to our home, the guy started calling me to get together and my dad would be telling me I could not. So, one day, I sat him down and told him that I did not want to lie to my parents but I did want to keep being friends with the guy and if I did, they wouldn't even know.A few days later, dad called me to the breakfast table and said: \"Well, your mom and I talked about this your growing up thing. You are right. We do trust the values we gave you and we trust you and your choices. We know you will not do anything stupid to harm yourself and jeopardize a bright future ahead of you. However, I am a bit old fashioned and I just cannot bear the thought of you dating someone. So, as long as you tell us at what time you will be home, we will not ask you who you were with or what you have done\". I looked at my mom and she just rolled her eyes. I asked him wouldn't it be rather safer to know who I hang out with and he said \"No. I decided to trust your judgment than be uncomfortable and hurt our relationship as father and daughter\". I said \"OK. Fine. I know, noone will be sorry\". This worked out fine for everyone.So, that was our deal. To this day, my sister did not know that and she is shocked. Lol! Needless to say, dad was never as strict with my sister who is a social butterfly. She also wouldn't mind lying to her parents :)"},
{"title": "Life is so complicated", "date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2020", "text": "Today an old HS friend of mine called and told me that one of our friends had a rather big surgery due to an aggresive cancer in her ovaries. She is a wonderful woman, an excellent Professor of Medicine, an oncology pathologist. She had been very kind and helpful during my mom's illness. She gently kept checking on me and was truly upset on mom's passing.I asked my friend who called, how this was never diagnosed during her yearly controls. It turned out that she never had yearly gynecology check-ups. I am still trying to process this info. How? Why?They say do what the doctors say, do not do what they do. Must be true... I am hoping she will get better. Her daughter is in Canada and we do not know if she knows. I am so so sad today.So, I am trying to keep busy. I took apart the outer parts of the pedestal fan I have since 1997. I do not use it much because my apartment does not get too warm but still, it is an old fan. However it has a remote control, timer, different speeds and oscillation feature. One of my ex-boyfriends used to work for the company that made it and he had given me some spare parts for it although I never had to use any.Well, it was filthy. I should remember to use a cover for it when it does not get used. I cleaned it thoroughly. I feel cleaning things make me feel satisfied in a strange way. This is rather interesting and weird for someone who loathes any house chores. Well, whatever floats my boat, right?The nose clips I have ordered online for the masks I am making have arrived today. They are pretty good. Today's goal is to be done with sewing today and clean the living room tomorrow. I had also ordered a 50 pck of ready made masks with elastic just in case. I will add 30 of those to uncle's package for shorter trips outside.I got up a bit earlier today. I must go back to a normal routine. I stay up until too late and then I sleep in till noon time. Today I woke up at 10:30 which is better. I would like to fall into a routine when I can get up at 8 a.m. every day.Gotta go and take care of those masks. I would like to mail them to uncle on Friday.What a day... Again..."},

My uncle was preparing all the meals and he made healthy and filling food, lots of vegetables and meat, very little carbs.I need to shed much more weight so, I have downloaded an app to count my calories. I also need to pay attention to the carb, fat, protein ratios.I picked up a roaster chicken today and dry-brined it. I am thinking of roasting it for tomorrow's dinner. There are two potatoes I need to use up with that.This bird is going to give me lots of meals I think. I have chicken breast and turkey breast in the freezer too. I have been eating too much red meat and I have decided to cut back on that. I have some frozen meat patties too.Tonight's dinner was steamed broccoli and mixed salad greens plus grilled turkey breast. I love my olive oil so, I am not going to give it up. I made a salad dressing with salt, lemon juice, olive oil and garlic to put on my salad+veggies.Time to menu plan with what I have:- Roast chicken, potatoes and salad (Dinner)- Chickpea Salad (Lunch/Brunch)- Shepherd Salad with cold chicken (Dinner) Shepherd Salad is like Greek Salad but, we do not put cheese in it and the tomatoes and cucumbers are cut in much smaller pieces.- Tom Kha Gai Soup (the chicken stock to be made with the carcass) (Lunch/Brunch)- Chicken salad sandwich (lighter version half mayo-half yogurt) (Lunch/Brunch)- Meat patties with piyaz (Dinner)- Sauteed mushrooms and peppers in garlic yogurt sauce (Side)- Kısır (Think Thabouleh with more bulgur wheat and green peppers in addition to parsley) (Lunch/Dinner) Goes best with fresh brewed tea.- Navy beans and rice (Lunch/Dinner)When I get through these meals, I will need to buy more salad greens and some kind of a vegetable.I forgot to buy celery but, I need to go out to IKEA tomorrow. So, on the way back I can quickly go into the grocery store to pick it up."},

The small table top ironing board and the sewing machine is set up on my dining room table right now and I am ready to go.I have two huge Linden Trees right outside in front of the apartment and they are probably producing a lot of pollen because despite taking allergy meds, I keep sneezing. Too much sneezing makes me feel sick. Sometimes a dark cup of coffee helps. I may go for a cup in a little while.My BFF and I are watching Broadchurch on Netflix. She lives in the US and I live an ocean and a continent away. I love technology! Yesterday we decided to be each other's accountability partners in losing 30 pounds. I will start walking every day regularly too. She walks for 45 minutes with a neighbor of hers every day.Today is the second day of the university entrance exams and I expect Istanbul to get less crowded in a few days. Most families will go to their summer places although if I were them, I would not. If one catches the virus, there are very few small hospitals with not much ICU capabilities in vacation spots. I would rather be in the city and be closer to better health care. However, not a lot of people are taking this seriously and I have a feeling they have a tough time keeping their kids at home as well.This week is a stress factor for my sister and BIL. The bank will most likely place them in different branches. They have put in a request to go back to Ankara but, one of them will have to give up her/his title. That is bullshit of course but, if you do not have someone influential, that is what happens to you. It does not matter if you are best and the most hard working person. Corruption, what else? My BIL actually has a very influential cousin but, he is not the kind of person who will ask for favors even though it is actually not a favor but, rather a right.I am hoping that they will not be placed anywhere they will be very unhappy. I am already concerned about my sister's health as it is."},

I also pushed and pulled the closets to get behind them for more dusting and washing.I had left a bunch of stuff at the entrance to my home and I took care of all that. Some are dumped on my dining table, some are placed neatly where they belong.My pressure cooker died. I need to replace it but the new ones are so darn expensive. I cannot even remember when I had bought it. Probably more than 15 years ago? There are two in the Ankara home. I will ask my sister and uncle if I can take one of them. That apartment is literally empty 90% of the time so, who needs two pressure cookers there? I know my sister has hers at her home and uncle has his in Antalya. Till I get back to Ankara, I will make do without one.Tonight I am having a salad and some nachos. Salad is to eliminate the guilt of eating nachos. Kind of a balancing act.I am going to hang the curtains back and empty the dishwasher before dinner. I am thinking, cleaning the balcony and the living room will be the hardest. The balcony is closed with sliding glass windows and they are filthy. Washing them will be the toughest chore. In the living room I have this two display cabinets and a TV unit. One of the display cabinets is glass on all sides. I keep my dad's sailing ship models there.Every night after dinner I put the kitchen in order and the next day after cooking, it is a war zone. I think, I should batch-cook some food and leave the kitchen alone for a while other than fixing salads.I was planning to call the cleaning lady but, I decided, I am too chicken for that yet. Besides, I am cleaning in detail. She could never do as much. It would take her forever. So, I will do my own deep cleaning and may be call her in a few weeks. Depends on how much I can keep up with it."},

I do not have the stamina to do it.I have also re-organized my pantry drawer and spice cabinet.Yesterday I made a modified version of the Tom Kha Gai soup. No basil, no cilantro, no fish sauce. It still turned out delicious and I had that for brunch today. I will have the rest of it for tomorrow's brunch.Tonight I am having a naked burger (no bun) small green salad and corn on the cob.I am getting up late so, I am now eating two meals a day with occasional snacks. I added some cooked rice to the soup to make it more filling. My BFF keeps the rice separate so that it doesn't soak up most of the juice. That's what I did too.Due to COVID-19 and University Entry Exams this weekend, there is a semi-shelter in place order. On Saturday, noone other than the entrants and a maximum of two people who accompany them to exam centers are allowed to be outside till 3:30 p.m. On Sunday, it is till 6:30 p.m. I am not planning to go out at all.I had taken a coffee break as I typed this.

I cannot forget the walnut sized hail storm three years ago. So many cars were hit very badly. A search on the Internet gave me a place within 6-7 miles. So, I just drove there, parked my car and took a cab back. Went into the Pharmacy for my eye drops and did a quick grocery run. And totally forgot to get more allergy medicine... Ugh!Now, I am home. I did one load of laundry but, I do not feel like doing much because of the magnitude of what I need to do. I must take my wardrobe down, wipe it, get rid of some items, take out the summer clothes, etc. I need a Marie Kondo moment.I am ready for some tea. Here is a video of how we make tea. Warning: It says soft water not salt water. Some people hear it as salt! Lol!

Finally, I loaded my car, dropped mom's old apartment keys at a realtor and signed a contract, visited old neighbors who had been my parents' best friends way back when I was a baby and drove back to Istanbul.As soon as I opened the door, I was greeted with a musty smell, two pairs of winter boots and coats on the rack. As I opened the windows, I realized that my thick comforter was on the bed. It felt like my home is frozen in time and it is still winter.A whole season went by and I feel lost. During my five hour drive, I cried a little, listened to an audiobook a little.Outside of my apartment the damn hydrangeas are in full bloom. They have not been blooming for the last 6-7 years due to a poor trimming job and mom had been looking forward to their blooming every year. Well, this year they are gorgeous and mom can't even see them! How is that fair?My BFF says, I should take it as a sign that she found Dad and they are happy again. It sounds good especially, I was begging for a sign to know that she is well just yesterday.Sigh... Life will be very different.The apartment is very dirty. The windows need washing and a detailed cleaning job is a must. I think, I will call the cleaning lady after all despite the Covid scare. I should find a way to keep safe.

I just heard from  all of them that they arrived at their homes, safe and sound.So, I am alone tonight. Trying to keep busy. I sew a mask today. It was pretty successful, I must say. I think I will make 20 of them and send 5 to each of my family and keep 5 for myself. The masks we buy are hit or miss. Some are good quality, some are not so, washable masks are better I think.I have also decided to wash the couch covers. There are two IKEA Ektorp couches in this apartment. I need to put the dishes away and put the rest of the dirt ones in the dishwasher. I will then go to bed.This apartment has 4 bedrooms. SIS and BIL have the master bedroom, uncle has the one next to that and mom used to have the one next to his. The fourth was sort of like a sitting room where I am currently staying. SIS told me to move to mom's bedroom but, I am not ready to do that. Whenever we come to Ankara, we will stay here. SIS and BIL are trying to decide whether they will ask their bank to place them back in Ankara or not. Apparently, one of them will have to lose her/his title if they move back. I do not know whether they will decide to stay put or not. Till they come back to Ankara for good, this apartment will serve all of us.SIS and I could not bring ourselves to go through mom's stuff yet. We gave away only a handful of things to BIL's mom's caregiver. I will take two pairs of shoes to Istanbul to give my cleaning lady. They are brand new. Mom never had a chance to wear them.This week, I have to find a realtor to put my mom's old apartment on sale. It has been vacant since November. We always thought mom would recover, come back home and tell us what she wanted to do with it.I also want to see a few friends before I leave. We shall keep our social distance of course.Ever since, the normalization started, the Covid-19 numbers started creeping up. People are either stupid or ignorant. If the numbers go up, I am sure the travel restrictions will come back and the shelter-in-place orders will be in effect pretty soon. When I go back home, I will limit myself to one outing per week and will not let my guard down. No restaurants, malls, crowds or vacation this year. I may go visit family come September. I do not want to visit them before September because both cities are too warm and I cannot stand heat. My apartment is the coolest place among all the places we all have.Gotta hang the laundry and hit the sack. It feels weird to be alone after being with family for weeks."},

I went in to see her for the last time when the women were washing her. (Muslim custom). I washed her face and hair and asked her who will be my travel companion from now on? I am so thankful to those three women who washed her gently and with care and who wrapped her in her shroud kindly. My sister's BFF did not let me in there alone. She stood with me.On seeing her body and the damage of the infection, I feel very grateful that she finally gave up the fight. She looked like she fought a monster but, her face was peaceful. Her ordeal is over.The ceremony was really nice. The Imam (a Muslim priest) was a very good man, a devout Ataturk (founder of our country, a great visionary) follower just like my mom. He thanked Ataturk and his comrades who fought the War of Independence and founded modern Turkey in 1920 just like mom would have wanted during the prayer both at the mosque and at the graveyard.My uncle helped putting her in her place. Then uncle, sister and I were handed the shovels first to put soil in the grave. I remember yelling at the stupid Imam who told me women do not shovel soil during dad's burial. I had snarked \"He is my DAD!\" Apparently, my sister's friends who had attended dad's funeral remembered that too. Thankfully, this man was 100% nicer and kinder so, nobody had to pull him back to protect him from my wrath.All of our closest friends were with us at the cemetary paying attention to social distancing. I cannot thank them enough.Then we visited my grandma's and my late uncle's graves. After this, uncle left us to go home. I stayed with SIS, BIL and their best friends. When I went back home, I found my uncle crying his heart out. I do not remember him crying so much at his parents' or his brother's funerals. He and mom were very close siblings.During mom's hospital stay, I was the point of contact. The hospitals would call me and every time the hospital's name appeared on my phone, I felt a huge panic and fear. Every day, waiting for that call was such a difficult thing. Now, I know they will not call me and it makes me feel better which in turn makes me feel guilty. Is this normal? Has anyone felt like this after a loved one's loss especially after a prolonged sickness?"},

Who am I to refuse the life she made me have?Yesterday my BIL came all the way from Izmir to be with us after hearing my mom's situation.The four of us (Sis, Uncle, BIL and I) are talking, laughing and crying at the same time today.We are lucky to have only sweet, loving and funny memories in our family.

Especially, if you are feeling well and happy. Stay that way and count that as a blessing.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My sister has been here for the last two weeks. She is due back at work on Monday so, she will be driving herself on Sunday back to Izmir. I told her to go on Saturday so that she can rest for a day at home before starting work. She told me she wanted to spend my birthday with me which is on Saturday. For a long time I was hoping mom to start recovering by my birthday as if it is a truly important or special day. It's just another day of uncertainty, that's all. I told her I do not mind at all.I like the fact that my sister, uncle and I are together but, I also need some time alone so, I am encouraging uncle to go back to Antalya to his home for a while. He is bored to death over here and I know he misses his bicycle, his friends and routine over there.I told both of them that even if mom starts to improve, which is unlikely, they will have enough time to put their things in order to get back to Ankara. I will stay here and one person is quiet enough. Although, I like being with them, I need some alone time. Sometimes I want to stay in bed, cry my heart out or do something stupid. With people around me, it is not possible.Mom is not able to breath on her own and she is not improving. She is also not getting any worse. They asked for permission for a tracheostomy saying that she will  be more comfortable without the tube in her mouth. They said she is very agitated by the tube. So, I signed the papers. Tomorrow she will be taken to the operating room to do that.Sometimes her heart or her kidneys get problematic but, they fix them pretty quickly. The other night I was wondering if she never improves and if she needs to be hooked to the machine as long as her organs let her live. Will they keep her in the hospital? Will they tell us to create hospital environment at home? In that case, we will need to hire a retired nurse 24x7 because, I can clean her up but, I cannot imagine aspirating her or feeding her through the tube in her nose. I would be deadly scared of hurting her. Then I started looking for hospital beds, portable ventilators, power supplies and such to see how those can be set up at home. Finally, I decided to sleep a little bit but, it was already 7 a.m. Did not sleep a wink that night.Sometimes \"what ifs\" haunt me like that. Then I try to calm myself down by saying to myself: \"T'Pol, one day at a time! Whatever will be will be as in the song and I will do whatever it takes when I know what needs to be done. One day at a time!\" But when every day is just like the the day before without any change, \"what ifs\" come back with a vengeance.Today is a very bad day and I want to cry constantly. Mom's friends call every few days and it is tough to talk to say she is the same not getting any better. Their words of sympathy do not help although I do appreciate them very much.Sometimes I get very angry because I know people who do not even talk to their mom/children anymore for whatever reason and yet they are healthy and happy in their own way. Why is my mom sick and we can't even see her? Why does such a compassionate and nice person have to suffer? I am not a believer. I am between being an atheist and a deist so, no, I do not believe this is God's will for a reason. If God existed, he/she should have been nicer to my mom and would not let her suffer like this. Becoming an invalid was the only thing she was very afraid of and here we are!We had some neighbors when I was a kid. There would be constant fighting and sometimes the husbands would beat their kids or raise their hands to their wives. My mom would always intervene and succesfully scare those men away. They knew she could easily beat the crap out of them if she wanted to. She meant business. Mom was never scared of confronting a guy who would beat his family. One day, she went downstairs and pulled out the 16 year old kid whose father was beating him with a hose. She took him to school herself and advised the kid to go to a different city for his university education and stay the hell away from his father as much as possible. My father never raised a hand. They would of course argue from time to time but things never escalated at our home. They loved and respected each other. My father gave up a career just to be able to spend more time with his family. That sweet man, loving husband and great dad passed away 26 years ago. My mom was widowed at the age of 51. Now, she is stuck in the hospital with a tube down her throat and I see those old neighbors celebrating \"happy\" annversaries of 50something years of marriage on Facebook. It is very hard to resist the temptation of commenting \"yeah, we know how happy that marriage was when he was beating you and the kids. Remember that sweet day when he threw a hot kettle to you?\".What is happening to mom is so unfair. SO DAMN UNFAIR!Well I got some stuff off my chest but, honestly it did not help much. I should make myself busy with something else. May be a warm shower will do me good...."},
{"title": "Mom - New Hospital, New Doctors", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2020", "text": "Today, I texted my friend's friend who is the head of the Infectious Disease Department. He told me to go see him by 2 p.m.Promptly at 2 p.m. I walked into his office. He is a very nice and mellow man. He told me mom's lungs are not the biggest problem but her heart is. He gave me a summary of what has been done at the other hospital and how he now intends to follow her. He said a cardiologist was going to see her today and after they receive the test results that they have ordered today, they will sit down and come up with a treatment plan.He then called the medical technician who monitors the patients at that particular ICU (They have 5 of those). The technician had done his homework and he also summarized their initial findings.They promised that, they will call me every day possibly around noon time to update me. I asked if we could make our voices heard and talk to her at least over the phone and they said they did not have that capability. I told them I could bring her cell phone and give it to the nurses so that, when they are tending to her, we could at least talk to her although, she will not be able to answer us. They said, it may be possible later on. So, I did not press further.I asked them to please talk to her when they are in her room because she needs some stimulation.I also gave them the air bed we had purchased for bedsores. It looks like the other hospital did not even use it. She has some bedsores. The kind of bed we have bought is better so, they will use it. I was waiting for a nurse to come get it but, the Professor was going upstairs and he saw me. He took the air bed and carried it upstairs for me. Such a nice man. He told me never to hesitate to call him on his cell phone.These things of course do not alone determine whether mom will make it or not but, now the doctors are reachable and at least we will ask everything that confuses us.As for the financial aspect of this; the hospital care for her is free since, she has been admitted through ER and ended up in the ICU as per the social medical system we have. However, I told them if there is any medicine or any other thing they may need which is not reimbursed by the Government Social Security, they should call us. We are willing to do whatever it takes.I then went to the Pharmacy owned by one of my old HS pals and picked up 10 bottles of Nutrivigor for my BIL's mom. She is not in good shape and is having difficulty eating. Apparently, she is losing weight and not getting enough nutrition. A doctor needs to see her and put this on her medical requirements list so that, they can get them for free. However, at this time we wanted to try it first to see if she will like it. I am told it tastes like chocolate shake so, what is there not to like? I also brought them some extra trashbags for the diapers they use on BIL's mom and some masks just in case the dad or the caregiver needs to go out. I did not enter the apartment because I was at the hospital earlier so, I could not see the mom. Poor woman. The second stroke did her in. Her right side is paralyzed, she can't talk and we are not sure if she understands who is who and what's going on around her.After I left, I called my BIL to tell him that I had dropped the stuff at his folks and he said both moms are making us miserable these days. He is an only child, poor thing. He then, thanked me for being his big sister too. He is a sweetheart and loves my sister to the moon and back.When I came home, I hung my clothes outside, took off my mask and face shield and took a long shower. I was wearing gloves but the doctor told me there is no need for it if I practice good hand hygieneSo, today was busy and purposeful. It made me feel a wee bit better."},
{"title": "Mom now at a Different Hospital", "date": "Wednesday, May 13, 2020", "text": "Earlier today, mom's doctor called me to let me know that they are moving her to another hospital's ICU. She said theirs was a Covid-19 pandemic hospital and that if she were in a regular ICU, we would be able to see her.They had told us that they were looking to move her but, I thought it would be within the campus. At first, I was devastated because I knew nothing about this other hospital. So, I went on Facebook to my and my sister's High School Alumni group to see if anyone knew about this place. It turned out that they have a good reputation. On top of that we have discovered many friends who knew doctors there.As soon as the former hospital told me the specially equipped ambulance took her, I jumped in my car and went there. I have been told the families are not allowed to see patients these days due to additional precautions that they are taking. However, I was able to see her for 5 minutes. They let me see her when I told them I have not seen her for over two months. She is being sedated but, she was awake and she did respond to me. I made her blink if she recognized me. With a mask and a face shield, I wasn't sure. I told her that we loved her and missed her over and over again. I saw a small tear and a bit of a smile. Knowing that she is conscious is a good thing. But then again, may be not. I do not know how frightened she must be.I will not describe how she looked. Suufice it to say, she just looked like she has been in a battle.Later in the day, a friend of mine called me to check in and she told me that she was very good friends with the Head Infectious Disease Doctor at that particular hospital. She called him in the evening. He told her to give me his cell number so that I can call him anytime tomorrow to meet up with him.Mom is still in critical condition and her other organs are under stress making her very fragile.I am happy to be able to see her but, my heart is aching and I am constantly sobbing today. This has been the hardest test of my life and I hope, I will never ever have to face another one like this.Thanks to all of you sending prayers and thoughts our way."},
{"title": "Mother's Day when Mom is still in the ICU", "date": "Sunday, May 10, 2020", "text": "This is a tough day with mom still in the ICU. My sister's birthday was in April and she did not celebrate it. Now, Mother's Day... I still hope for her recovery before my birthday in early June.Also, my heart goes out to Anne over at Cooking and All That Jazz whose mom just passed unexpectedly. She and her sister are in my thoughts and prayers.If I cannot be with mom, if I cannot even send her flowers like I always did, I can at least talk about her here.Mom is not a typical doting parent. She is a realist and a tough cookie. When we got sick as kids, my dad would be devastated and was not much help around because he worried a lot and he could not function other than taking our temperatures and pacing the apartment nervously with a very worried look. Mom on the other hand, would feed us, administer our meds and would order us to stay in bed and rest. Even if she was worried, she would not let us see it and would rather act like the authority figure than get all sentimental. So, as I was waking up after a surgery when I was 17, I was shocked to see that she was crying by my hospital bed. Then, she told me they were tears of joy because everything was fine.In 1990, when I have learnt that my new company was going to send me to the US, the very weekend that I started my new job instead of three months later as was the original plan, I called my dad and he totally freaked out because he thought, he had time to get used to the idea of me moving away for the first time. I also called mom and she said \"Oh... This weekend ha? I should take a half day of today to do some shopping for you.\" She came home with a bunch of new clothing items including extra underwear, a bath robe and pajamas and started packing my suitcase while my dad was still nervously ranting. At the airport, they stayed longer to see the plane take off and right after it did my dad turned around and told her \"Shit! She really is gone!\" Mom laughed at him. When my sister wanted to get married, she was cool as cucumber. Typical Turkish moms would be overinvolved with everything, be ready to dislike the mother-in-law to be, would state their opinions on everything from the wedding venue to the vacuum cleaner to the bed linens and every single trivial matter. They love to meddle and blow everything out of proportion. Mom? Not at all. She worked out a budget and handed my sister and BIL the amount of money she wanted to gift them to buy whatever they liked. Then, she gave me the same amount of money in cash! She told me even though I did not get married, I was still her child and the money was my right. It was a pretty hefty amount too. Then I jokingly asked her what if I got married later on; with a big smile in her face, she told me I would get zilch then.She always believed in the values they instilled in us, the education they have provided and also believed in us. She says, they have done the best that they could and after graduating the University, it was our turn to get a hold of our lives and live with our own decisions.She is the authority figure and the matriarch of our family. As my grandparents got old, my grandpa took her two brothers aside and told them that, the three siblings would be getting their house as inheritance. They were all entitled to do whatever with the house but that, my mother would be the one to say the final word.HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY MOM! I love you and I want you back! Please, please, please get better and come back to us!"},
{"title": "Mom Day 45", "date": "Monday, May 4, 2020", "text": "Thank you all who have commented. I appreciate your well wishes and prayers. They are much needed. Please do take care and be safe!Mom is still in the ICU and we still cannot see her. Her lungs are not getting any better despite the heroic efforts of her doctors. They have ruled out Covid-19 after three tests. Pneumonia can be deadly for 30% of the elderly and we think, her situation may be just that. Her other organs are under stress now too. The only thing that keeps us sane is that her doctors are not giving up on her. I can see the tests they giver her daily, the meds they try and the CT scans. There is no such thing as a DNR in Turkey and the family is never asked to permit pulling the plug unless the brain is dead. So, everybody is fighting.My sister says mom is sort of like in limbo trying to decide whether to cross over or stay on our side. The other day she said, not only mom but we all are in limbo too because of not knowing what is gonna happen next.This is the most painful experience of my life. Normally, one expects her parents to die before oneself but we all thought (wished, hoped) we had at least another good ten years to go with mom. We never expected her to be in the hospital for so long and we surely never thought we would not be able to see her and whisper that we love her into her ear.Every single day is plain torture. I try to read, watch TV or just surf the Net just to keep my mind from constantly thinking about mom. Then, I feel guilty because I am trying to not think about her. I do not want to talk to any of my freinds because, I am tired of telling them the same exact thing. However, when I do talk to some of them, I feel a bit better. Then I feel guilty again because, I have felt better. I am caught in this terrible vicious cycle.However, there are other life requirements like paying taxes, getting tyres switched, grocery shopping and etc. So, we deal with them no matter what.Tomorrow, uncle and I will take our cars to have the winter tyres be switched with regular tyres. We not only use a mask and a pair of gloves but also a face shield when we go out. Many people may think we are overdoing it but, I am obese and I have a high blood pressure problem so, those put me on top of the very vulnerable list. The Government is very keen on getting back to normal because the economy has already tanked. They seem to not care about the death toll. I know they are not being honest about the number of deaths and the sick patients they publish every day. Even if the world goes back to normal, I have a feeling that I will not, at least for another year or two.Honestly, I would prefer alien invasion over what we are going through right now.Again, take care and be safe..."},
{"title": "Can't think of a post title", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2020", "text": "First and foremost, I would like to thank you all who commented on my last post. I appreciate your well wishes and prayers. We do need them very much.Mom is still in the hospital, still the same. Not getting any better. She has pneumonia in both lungs. 3 Covid tests came out Negative. She is still intubated. This is day 17.Us? Still hoping for the day she recovers and comes back home. .I have been driving myself insane by checking mom's health account several times during the day. Feeling very depressed, having panic attacks and gaining weight because of mindless eating.Well, Wednesday night I have suddenly decided to pack up and go to Mom's home to stay with my uncle in Ankara. I do not know what triggered it. All Thursday, I packed my suitcase, my home office gadgets, meds and pantry and carried them out to the car. Took me several trips. Early Friday morning, I packed the contents of my freezer and just left Istanbul at 5 a.m. and I have arrived safely at mom's before noon.And then, at night it has been announced that travel between 30 major cities is banned and will be regulated by permit only. Wow! Just wow! I cannot imagine having to stay in Istanbul when I wanted to come over here. It was a very close call.I am glad I did this. Staying with my uncle turned out to be a very good idea and although he is very concerned about his sister, he is calming me down. Apparently, Sis, BIL and uncle were worried about my health. So, they are happy that I did what I did.My uncle is 15 years mom's junior and 9 years my senior. It just occurred to me today that mom is his only living family member other than us, his 4 nieces. I have two cousins, daughters of my older uncle who passed a few years ago. And, there is my sister and I. Poor guy! Being the youngest in his family, this is expected but, still he is very close to mom and they get along really well.Stay safe and stay healthy!"},
{"title": "Mom: Official Call from the Hospital", "date": "Wednesday, March 25, 2020", "text": "Today right after 9 a.m. teh hospital called. I picked up the phone and someone told me mom's doctor wants to see a relative to provide information. When I asked what time, they said right away.I almost had a heart attack and called uncle who immediately dressed up, put on his mask and gloves putting his sanitizer in his pocket before going to the hospital.For about an hour and a half, sis, BIL and I waited for uncle to call but it felt like 100 years. Her doctor told uncle that she is in critical condition but, is hanging tight. She also said the PCR test result still did not come but looking at her condition, they started her coronavirus treatment. She said the Chinese drug arrived just the day before at that particular hospital for the first time and they started giving her this drug which healed people in China. When uncle told her that he was a pharmacist, she told him more about the protocol and the drugs. She also assured him that elderly patients are never being ignored and they are being taken care of very carefully. If an elderly patient recovers, this will be their success so, they are very keen on this.Uncle said he saw tons of idiot relatives who did not use protective gear, who ignored social distancing and who arrived at the hospital as a whole clan even when they were instructed to send only one person. There was a guy in front of my uncle who lost his grandpa, whose grandma was in ICU and whose father just got sick without any protection. I do not think the virus kills people, it is the ignorant people who cause all the deaths.Uncle also told that, she was very blunt with relatives and she said that there was no hope for some of the patients and she informed the relatives as such. She told my uncle mom is hanging tight, most patients go down real quickly and she may have a chance.So, relatively good news. I so want her to recover and come home to us. What a fucked up situation it is to have your loved one in a quarantine."},
{"title": "Mom Day 5", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2020", "text": "First of all, thank you for all your well wishes. I could not post answers to your comments like I used to. I know, you will understand.Mom is still at the ICU. No official word from the hospital. Thank God the alumni of our High School (my sister and I are graduates of the same school) go out of their way every day to get info on mom. Yesterday a Child Oncology Professor stepped up on seeing my FB posts. She told me she will be getting and sharing info on our mom as much as she can.Many doctors, even a former representative of the parliament is involved extracting info. We can never thank these people enough. Feeling so blessed with having such a caring network.Yesterday, she has been intubated, her condition is stable and is receiving a cocktail of meds. She has a viral pneumonia. We still do not know if it is the corona virus. Even if it is, I doubt they will tell us. They like to cover up a lot of things for stupid reasons. The chest tomography show a mid-level damage. So, they are helping her with all the resources and sedating her and helping with her breathing is a good thing.Her being stable on day 5 makes us feel better. Hang in there Mom!On another note, I have written about Lemon Cologne in a previous post. I came accross this news on Yahoo News today: Turks fight coronavirus with secret weapon.Stay healthy, stay safe!"},
{"title": "Mom...", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2020", "text": "Very early Friday morning, my mom told my uncle she was not feeling well. She had a high fever, she was trembling, had a shortness of breath. The Ambulance took her immediately to a Government Hospital where she was quarantined right away.I do not think it is Corona Virus but, they do not reason. They just quarantine the patient. My uncle took nightgowns, a cardigan and some underwear which they refused to take.They are not admitting anyone without a serious condition.We cannot hear from her. She probably has pneumonia due to her RA and she is being kept in ICU. They said she has been tested and the test result takes a few days. Then, no communication.I can log into her health portal and can see only see the drugs they give her, the tests. Apparently they are not letting her get up even to go the bathroom. She is all alone in there.Meanwhile, anybody and everybody in our social circles have been trying to get even the tiniest information. Thanks for all of them from the bottom of my heart. We are hoping to hear from her hopefully tomorrow or on Monday or else, I am going to be causing a lot of trouble such as contacting major newspapers and all related agencies. Do they expect us to put our patients in the hospitals and walk away, carry on as if everything is fine?We had been hearing about this outbreak for months now and the people in teh Government apparently have not been thinking about it or planning any actions. Ridiculuous!Also, some people are plain stupid because, they keep going out and socialize. Many think that this is an opportunity to go to beach areas. STUPID IGNORANTS! Those places lack health resources. They have very limited capacity. What idiots!We know that mom is conscious so, I am sure she knows why we cannot be there. As a matter of fact everybody over 65, everybody with chronic conditions such as liver disease, high blood pressure, coronery and heart problems and a few other things are limited to go out as per a Government Mandate issued an hour ago. So, all of us need to stay put.Stores, schools, restaurants (except for take out), barbers, hairdressers, mosques are now closed. people are working from home, those who cannot will be working in two week shifts. Half will stay home while the other half will work. Then, they will change.Not being able to hear from her, talk to her and be with her are just plain killing me. What if...? I do not want to say it aloud but many whatifs are eating my brain and making my heart ache.If no, when she pulls through, I will never let her out of my sight again. Yes, we need our spaces and what not, but we need each other more than anything. If this will mean major life changes, so be it."},
{"title": "Lemon Cologne", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2020", "text": "I do not know if any other country has this; so far I have not seen any that I have been to. In Turkey, we have lemon cologne which has 80 degrees alcohol in it. It is not like eau de cologne or perfume. It smells very nice and lemony for a short while but, the smell does not stay for very long.When I was a child, whenever you visited someone, the homeowner would offer a few splashes of this in your hands just like they would offer tea and sweets or candy. Both my grandmothers were big fans and before they went out, they would splash some in their hands and when they came back from the outside they would first wash hands and apply this cologne later on. It was also a hygiene thing. I remember my grandmother rubbing the silverware at restaurants with some of this stuff and a napkin before using them. They would also wipe certain surfaces like public high chairs.My grandparents also used it when they had headaches because the lemony smell was refreshing for them.It is customary for people to take a bottle as a gift when they visit sick people. My sister told me her customers kept bringing her bottles of lemon cologne so they have plenty at home.I always kept a small bottle at home but, I never used it as much as they did. I guess it is time to use it like that.Due to the coronavirus panic, people have started hoarding lemon cologne as well. I asked mom if she had any and I ordered two 400 ml bottles for each of us.There are a lot of Turkish people living in the US so, I checked if Amazon carried it and here is the link for it:Lemon CologneThis is the most famous brand in TurkeyI guess Amazon is out too because the companies cannot meet the demand over here and I doubt they will be exporting any before they meet the demand over here. The price in the link is outrageous. That 150 ml bottle should not be more than 10 bucks. It is much cheaper over here.Anyway, I just thought it would be interesting to share. If you can buy some later on once the panic subsides, get a bottle or two. I have a feeling you may like it."},

For me, I found my mom very sick when I returned from my fab vacation, then there was the earthquake in the East and the talks about a big one hitting Istanbul soon . The refugee crisis, war with Syria, the Government meddling in Libya's business, sending troops over there upon the Libyan Government's request, alliance with the US going south, alliance with Russia ending up s..ing us, deaths of many young soldiers in Syria, the economy tanking, growing incompetence of the Government... And now the Corona Virus... Yikes!Life goes on as usual but now, there are people panicking who make you second guess your own understanding of the matter. Is this virus real like the Bubonic Plague or is it just a part of a big game planned by nasty people to profit from this by causing terror and panic? I guess time will tell if we survive it.I am trying to wash my hands more frequently, sanitize my belongings when I come home, eat and rest well and avoid crowds. Other than that, I just keep doing what I do normally. What else can we do anyway?All this negativity and craziness in the world is probably due to ever diminishing resources, environmental pollution and booming population and poverty. I suspect there are many nasty people who are behind all the political bullshit that is happening. They are using and manipulating the rest of the people in their quest to success.I wish there could be a virus to wipe out just the politicians and other people with secret dark intentions.I was expecting a Star Trek Universe in 21st Century. It feels like we are going back to the Medieval Period in many ways.So, who cursed us anyway?"},

{"title": "2020 Vacation Plans", "date": "Friday, February 21, 2020", "text": "Yesterday I was talking to my friends in the US and one of them asked me my vacation plans for 2020. I told him that I did not know yet.Then I started thinking about it. My country is being dragged into war in Syria by our incompetent government and allegedly it's allies. The incompetent government keeps pressuring the Central Bank of Turkey to lower the interest rates and nowadays the interest rate for TL is negative. This makes foreign currencies leap so, it is a de-facto devaluation. The Central Bank of Turkey is no longer an independent organization which is not only wrong but very scary. The economy is in real bad shape and I do not see any major steps taken to improve it. I think, the current president is a very bad person and intentionally dragging the country towards doom. I see no way to stop him. He has control over everything.I believe my country is headed towards more hardship and very dark days. This means we should do our best to protect ourselves and our belongings as best as we can.So, I have no vacation plans this year. My sister and BIL live in Izmir which is a beach city. My uncle spends most of his time in Antalya which is another beach city. So, I can get my swimming and beach fix utilizing places we already own. If I plan my visits to these places carefully and spend enough time, I can optimize my gas consumption which is a major expense.My BFF may want to visit me in Turkey but, she does not think she can make it more than 10 days. If she comes for a visit, then I will modify my current plan. After all, it will be her 2nd visit in 30 years.Staycation is not a bad idea either."},

I unpacked, did tons of laundry, packed again and came to Ankara on January 13th. The first two weeks, I had been taking mom to the hospital mostly. After she recovered, we had been organizing her new apartment.So far, I have helped mom organize the kitchen cabinets, her closet and drawers, the bathroom drawers, the closet at the entrance and the closet in the room that I stay. I donated all that she wanted to get rid of. She wanted new ottomans and some other smallish things. I found them online and upon her approval, I have ordered them. There are two closets/cupboards in the balcony to be organized but since, it is too cold, she wants to organize them when it warms up possibly in early April.I am thinking of organizing all hand tools because, there are multiples of some of them and the extras can be set aside for my SIS and BIL for the new apartment they intend to buy over here.So, since January 12th, I have been here and I am very homesick.Uncle is coming tomorrow and my mom's control appointment is on February 28th. Depending on the test results etc., I am hoping to go back home right after that. Uncle can take her to the doctor's too but, I go in with her and talk to her doctors myself. So, I will wait.Mom thinks and expects me to be back quickly but, I think I will stay in Istanbul for at least a month. There is so much to do at home and many friends to see.  Needless to say, having lived on my own for all my life, I need my space and time. I was alone only for about 10-12 days when I was on my road trip in November.Don't get me wrong, I love my family and my friends and I feel truly blessed by having so many who do care about me. On the other hand, I need my \"me\" time doing things I want to do and not having to think about things for others at least for a while.I also need to talk to my friend about the new business prospect and that requires at least 2-3 meetings.We were preparing to sell mom's apartment and buy my SIS and BIL a new one closer to where she now lives which is their apartment. However, it looks like the apartment will not be sold for the amount we were hoping for so, I suggested that we could replace the kitchen and other things to their liking and they can use that apartment till they retire and come back to Ankara which is at least 7,5 years away. We will see which course of action we will take.My sister says if the apartment is sold, half of it should be mine. My lovely stupid little baby sister!

Commercial fishing season will be over by the start of April till September. So, it is time to eat lots of fresh fish and stock up.I am going out for dinner with babyhood friends tomorrow night. Guess what we are having? Fish! I do not mind eating fish two days in a row.  Depending on what the restaurant has, I will probably go for smaller fish like grilled anchovies or sardines. They are very fishy and I love fishy fish.While traveling abroad, I have seen that mostly the fish is served as a filet or in pieces. In my country seabram, seabass, bluefish, and such are served whole with the head and tail. They clean the insides of the fish and throw it on charcoal grill or in hot oil. It is a bit tricky to eat at a restaurant using your fork and knife trying to get rid of the bones and still being a civilized person. Lol! At home, I do use my hands, just do not tell anyone, OK? They will filet the fish if you like but, the norm is to serve it as a whole.I also love smoked fish. Nothing beats a a piece of toast, cream cheese, few slices of an avocado and smoked salmon for breakfast. Avocados are pricey so, I only buy them when they are on sale."},

Should be easy to mash. Let it cool and mash it up. Shred the onion and mix everything together real well. You may add 1/2 cup grated cheese if you like but, I did not. If the mixture cannot be shaped since it is watery, you may add more breadcrumbs or flour. I did not have to.I oiled the baking paper on a baking sheet and shaped the mixture into egg-sized patties. I brushed them with olive oil and baked them till their color turned goldish. They were pretty tasty. I dipped them in hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce while I was eating them.

I have found out that she is very upset and overwhelmed over having to break her business partnership. She is buying the business from her partner. She had asked me in the past whether I would be interested in working with them and knowing that her partner was a difficult person, I had bowed out.She sounded like she would be drowning under her workload to the point that she was going to reject  new work. I decided to offer her my help. I told her that, I would help her initially without expecting anything in return to decide whether this job will be suitable for me. If I decide that, it is something I would like to do and can do, we would then sit down to figure out how I will be paid. I also told her that, I would have to spend more time in Ankara but, she assured me most of the work can be done remotely.She thanked me several times and said our phone call must have had some divine intervention.

Today, we woke up to snow and although it snowed for a while notheing more than two inches stayed on the ground.Some days we wake up to a glorious sunny day and by noon time, the sky gets very dark and we get rain showers.It doesn't get very dark before well after 6 p.m. so, that is a welcome sign for Spring. Sometimes March is the coldest month with lots of rain and snow. We shall see how this March is going to be.Today, I finally donated the clothing items and sheets and what not. My trunk was full. It is nice to claim that space back.I like to keep my trunk clean and nice so, I have a plastic cover in there. Knowing how sloppy my uncle can be, I had covered that before I went on my vacation.After dropping the stuff, I took mom to get her prescription, exchange some yarn she had previously bought and to get some lunch. We then went grocery shopping and had tea at a small cafe at the Grocery Store. I think, she is over her cabin fever somewhat and exhausted a bit. Tomorrow, I will meet a very old friend and her daughter for lunch and make some time just for myself.Tonight, we are having soft tacos and some veggies.I have earth apples (also known as Jersulaem Artichokes or sunroots), cauliflower, Swiss Chard, celery roots and spinach to cook and serve this week."},
{"title": "Nice Weekend", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2020", "text": "My SIS and BIL were here over the weekend. I have seen her for the first time in over 4 months so, it was a happy and nice weekend for me.SIS had some overdue doctor appointments and BIL needed to check up on his parents.  He cannot bear to see his mom as an invalid so, every visit is very painful. His dad is a stubborn old man and he drives poor BIL crazy. They have a live-in caregiver but his dad meddles with everything. He is a bit of a penny pincher. However, I also feel sorry for him too because I am sure he is very bored. He is 81 and he probably did not envision this for his retirement life. His wife has become an invalid about 8 years ago due to a stroke and ever since, life has been very difficult for them. BIL is an only child so, whenever he needs help my uncle and I step up but, if he had siblings, it would have been different.Anyway, I picked up SIS from her last appointment Saturday afternoon and went out for lunch. Afterwards, we ran some errands for her. BIL called as we were getting ready to go home and told us that his father wanted to visit my mom since she was so sick a few weeks ago because of the RA. I guess the poor man gets very bored as well. We told him to bring him for dinner.I ordered fish from the downstairs fishmonger. They cooked the fish for us and delivered, so, all I had to do was to fix a salad and set the table. I had a grilled salmon whereas, the rest of them had fried whiting. My sister bought some banana and strawberry rolls as dessert, which we served with tea after dinnerWe had breakfast yesterday morning and then SIS and BIL went to see his parents. They came home around 5 p.m. and we took care of some things around the apartment for my mom. Then we took them to the airport because it was too cold. It was well below freezing and the wind made it even colder.SIS and BIL want to buy a small apartment here because, they still have their master bedroom here in the apartment which my mom is now occupying. It is a huge space that mom will eventually need to use. I told them not to rush and look for reasonable places and not spend too much money on a small apartment.I am still very confused about whether I should move back to Ankara or stay put in Istanbul. I need to go home and be on my own for a while. My uncle will come back in a few days and depending on the road conditions, I will either go to Istanbul right away and come back for mom's control appointment on the 28th or, go after the 28th and spend most of March in Istanbul. Need to think."},
{"title": "Not a great day", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2020", "text": "Yesterday I felt the right side of my throat was aching slightly. I ran my errands and did not think much of anything else. Last night, I woke up not only with the sore throat but also, my stomach and esopaghus on fire. It felt like I had swallowed acid.Luckily, the medicine drawer is in my room and I found a bottle of Gaviscon. I took a table spoonful and the burn gradually went away. I attribute that to eating too much spicy hot food lately. Today I ate very bland food and my stomach feels completely normal. The throat soreness is also fading away too.So, I am taking it easy today. Tomorrow I need to drop off extra clothing items, sheets and things like that at a charity place and also go grocery shopping. It looks like snow is on our way so, I must stock up on certain items so that we do not have to go out next week if we do not have to.Today started as a sunny and bright day but it quickly changed and now it is raining and snowing at the same time. The temperature has dropped significantly as well.Then there are sad news affecting the nation; an avalance that took 33 lives, a plane crash during a bad landing which killed 3 passengers so far. Feeling very down.Hoping for something uplifting. Soon, please..."},
{"title": "A Mango Brings Back Memories", "date": "Monday, February 3, 2020", "text": "Today, mom and I walked into the grocery store and saw a guy peeling mangoes. He offered us a piece and we bought one to bring home. I do not normally buy mangoes because, I cannot be sure of the ripeness. When they are cleaned, it is easier to pick one that is really yummy.As for the memory; it is really kind of both stupid and funny. Many years ago, when I was working for  a large international company, my boss at the time was very keen on participative management. One day, he decided that all senior and middle management should get together on a weekend every 6 months or may be every quarter to talk about the status of zompany goals, new opportunities and play some games to encourage team work and such. He also said that, we should name these meetings and offered a poll for suggestions. Most people rolled their eyes and did not make a suggestion or made suggestions like \"Quarterly Management Meetings\" etc. Knowing that he would be upset about not enough people participating, at the last hour before the poll closing time, I  came up with: MANGO meaning Management Goes Off-Site.Lo and behold, my boss loved it and found it very creative ?!?! Really? They were going to give me the gift of staying at a nice hotel over the weekend but, the place was too far away from where I lived and to me, it wasn't worth the effort. So, I suggested a gift card to my favorite bookstore instead. My boss was beyond pleased with that suggestion. I guess, most people would have liked the hotel stay better. I got my gift card and bought 6-7 books with it.I am as creative as a fireplace log but hey, I won, didn't I?"},

I am trying to make meals taste edible without using any salt. I cut back on salt consumption significantly too.We usually have tea in the afternoon. So, I decided to make an apple cobber with the three huge Granny Smith apples I had. Never made it before, so I found a recipe online and it turned out pretty good. I cut back on the sugar by half but, it still tasted fine. I do not like very sweet things.My BFF says the Turkish Delight, Baklava and the rest of the variations of it are so sweeet and rich and how come I say I do not like sweet stuff? The answer is; I do not eat them. I may have a piece or two of Turkish Delight if I am offered but I never buy it. I am very picky about Baklava and there are just a couple of places that make it absolutely divine and I will have that may be once or twice a year. I buy boxes and boxes of Turkish Delight only when going to the US. Lol!I need to attend a funeral tomorrow. I had a Physical Ed teacher at HS and her husband just passed. She was my sister's volleyball coach and they are still very close. Mom knows her well too. So, I will represent the family since Sis lives 500 Km away and mom cannot handle standing up so long. I need to go to the Mosque, pay my respects and offer our condolences and come back. I do not intend to go to the cemetery. Unlike Christian ceremonies, the whole thing happens outside the Mosque and is pretty fast.After that, I will come and pick my mom to go grocery shopping. She has cabin fever and although, I despise going to the grocery store on a weekend, I have decided to do it for her.As I type this, mom is watching a volleyball game. She is very much into it. My sister quit playing during College but, mom never quit watching. Our Women's National Volleyball Team is pretty succesful and will be participating in the Olympics this summer."},

So, I was determined to watch what I ate and not gain weight during my fabuluous vacation. I did fine until Thanksgiving I think. Too many parties, more than usual drinking, less walking and too much food made me gain about 6 pounds between Thanksgiving and the New Year.I love a good pizza and New York is the best place for it. I tried eating only one slice most of the time so, I have satisfied my pizza cravings without much damage.I also love all those rich pasta dishes which I do not make or eat here in my own country. So, I decided to have pasta only at really good Italian places. Thus, I limited my consumption. Well this reminds me I must learn to make a good vodka sauce. I totally fell in love with that.Other things that I miss and eat whenever I am in the US are, good burgers, Buffalo Wings, New England Clam Chowder, Lobster Rolls, cheesecake, cannolis and dumplings. I also love Dr. Pepper diet or not. I normally do not drink so much soda at home but I overdid that too:(The good news is, I am back to my weight in August 2019 now! Yay! I did not do anything special for this. I am just eating the way I eat when I am home. I haven't been eating any sweets other than 70% cocoa chocolate. My uric acid level dropped back to the upper limit of the normal range which is great news.I am going to start walking soon despite the cold weather. It is in the 30s and lower 40s here in Ankara but, it feels much colder than that. I will bundle up and just walk around the apartment complex that my mom now live in.I feel good!"},

The guy who passed must be my age or may be a year or two older.Meanwhile, I am going to see two of my babyhood friends over dinner tonight. Our dads were colleagues and we lived in the same area for years. When we get together, we always have a good time.My mom must be feeling a lot better since she is doing some stuff around the apartment. Just a week ago, I was very concerned about her health.My BIL's mother has been hospitalized twice due to a broken bone and she has been an invalid for a long time after two major strokes. The doctors told my BIL to be prepared for anything now because, they think her health is deterioriating rapidly.My friend who owns the consultancy business I work from time to time has also been diagnosed with a form of arthritis at 55. She has been administered cortizoen as well. She is normally very active but now, she says she gets tired very easily.Life has many twists and turns. We do not feel this during our daily routine but, once that routine is broken somehow, we just realize that, we are in fact very fragile."},

My uncle cooks every day depending on what he feels like havng. I cannot do that. I like to cook larger batches and freeze some. This way, I always have ready to eat food on hand.Now that mom is on a no salt diet, I decided to cook a bunch of stuff.I started  at 1 p.m. and finished by 5:15 p.m. My back is killing me. I wanted stuffed grape leaves but since they come in a brine, I stuffed Swiss Chard for mom and grape leaves for uncle and me. I also made some meat balls. Cooked leek in olive oil and sauteed chopped meat for some Mexican food for later.I have processed all the meat I have purchased. I think, I will make navy beans and rice at some point during the week. I still have some celery heads to be cooked with carrots and potatoes. I am in no rush to cook them. They keep well.Phew! Now I have to clean up the kitchen but, I need to rest a little. I will clean up after dinner or may be uncle will do it. Lol!No salt diet is very difficult for mom. I marinated some boneless chicken thighs in a cup of tangerine juice and a mixture of lots of cumin, thyme, black pepper and unsalted garlic powder. She liked that very much so, I see myself making that in the future. She asked me where I got the recipe for the marinade. Ummm... Depths of my own brain I guess. I totally winged it and it worked. How can you go wrong with any marinade anyway?I am going to see some friends this week and am looking forward to it."},

We ended up seeing a Chest Professor and a Rheumatology Professor. Blood tests, a chest X-Ray and a Tomogrophy later, she has been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and is put on a no-salt diet with a Cortizone Treatment. Initially, they suspected Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and I almost had a heart attack.Her breathing was terrible and both her hands were very swollen. If I were around, the moment those hands swelled up, she would have found herself at the doctors. My uncle and my sister could not make her go. She is stubborn but I am more so.Already the swelling is considerably better and she is regaining use of her hands. I just cannot believe why she did not go to the doctor. Her coughing is still bad but, that will take time.Now she is very unhappy because, she cannot eat salt. She loves all sorts of cheeses and she likes to sprinkle salt on her food. Bummer!Hopefully, she will soon feel a lot better. Arthritis is a bad auto-immune disease but, that is so much better than the IPF."},

I will know on Saturday for sure. If she cannot come, I will dust a little bit and run the vacuum.Today's goal is to re-pack everything I am taking to Ankara with me and put away the laundry.I have also cooked a little so that I do not need to order food. I had groceries delivered yesterday so, I could cook today.I noticed that one of my suitcases have been opened and as far as I can tell, a pair of pants for my uncle, a T-Shirt for my BIL and one of my 7-Day pill boxes is missing. Bummer! This is the first time I had this problem. Well, there is nothing I can do about it.I do not feel very tired but, my time is still out of sync.

During the days when I am visiting with friends, we have such a great time that I again get exhausted during the day and do not even open the cover of the laptop.Well, after I left upstate NY, I stayed one night at Winchester VA, one night in Roanoke VA and two nights in Savannah, GA. The first two days, I basically drove and rested whenever I made it to my destination.I had a very good time in Savannah. I got on a trolley tour and saw all the historic sites and enjoyed the beautiful day. Then I left for Florida to see a long lost friend that I had not seen in 27 years.He and I worked together in NY and he was my mentor for a while. Before the days of cell phones and Facebook, we lost track of each other but, I never forgot him. About 7 years ago, I found his daughter on Facebook and sent her a message but, never received an answer back. Almost a year ago, she reached out to me saying that she never saw my message since, she was taking care of her new baby at the time and my message got buried under a pile of other messages. She was so sorry but, I told her that the important thing was that we found each other and I wanted to get in touch with her father.Since then we talked to each other every week over Whatsapp. When I told him about my intended big vacation, he wanted to know if I would go down as far as Florida to see him. How could I not?So, I am here in Florida on my fourth day. I will be leaving here on Monday and I spent a good deal of time with my friend, his wife and nephew. It was nice to catch up on several years worth of life events.As I type this, I am doing laundry at the hotel. Lol!

I liked JC Penney and Dress Barn and was always able to find reasonable stuff in my size. So, yesterday I decided to go to Dress Barn and found out that all stores will be closing very soon. I spent a good deal of time but did not find anything that I liked except for a nice soft sweater. The quality used to be a lot better. I really wanted to buy jeans but, could not find any that I liked.Talking about pants, can someone please tell me what is the point of jeggings and skinny pants in sizes 18 and up? Anything I grabbed turned to be either of those and I am a size 20 with long legs and a big butt. Why on earth would I need pants that will stick everything out that I want to keep to myself?One of these days I will go to JC Penney and see what they have available.As I do some consulting work for textile companies, I know how little their costs are. So, paying USD 29.99-49.99 for what can be called a basic T-Shirt makes me cringe. The per unit cost is usually not more than USD 5 even for things that have beads and trims. I ma trying to spend as little on clothing as possible. It is such a waste. I would rather spend my money on travel.Last Sunday, my BFF and I went down to NYC to see the Vessel. It was not very cold that day so, we had a good time taking many pictures. I will share them in another post.Today I am not feeling 100%.  I feel like I am coming down with a cold which is bad because I need to leave for my road trip this Saturday. So, I just took something to help with how I feel and I am thinking chcken soup. I am also taking Vitamin C.Spoke to my family yesterday. Mom is moving to my sister's apartment which is a very large and comfortable 4 bedroom unit. She and my uncle will be better of there. Mom was tired of her own place. When I get back to Turkey, we will put her place up for sale and try to buy a new place for my sister and BIL.

I got up, took a shower, carried my bags up to the Security Gate because in our apartment complex, the road in front of my building is only for emergencies and a vehicle cannot normally come to the front unless I ask the security guards to open the big gate.The driver arrived right on time with a big luxury van and I thought there would be other passengers because I had booked a regular size car. But no, it was for me only. There was only some light traffic and we made it to the airport in thirty minutes.Checking my suitcases and going through Customs took less than twenty minutes. Such Luck!The Turkish Airlines flight made it into Frankfurt Airport in 2 hours and 45 minutes. The weather was nice and the flight was good.Since I had about 5 hours to kill before my flight, I walked around quiet a bit and stretched my legs. I only had a small carry-on with wheels and the exercise helped me a lot.I had lunch at the airport which turned out be pretty dried roast chicken. But, I sent that to my stomach with a small bottle of red wine and it wasn't so bad. Lol!My flight on Lufthansa was on a Jumbo Jet and my Premium Economy seat was excellent. The leg room and the comfort of the seat were superb. Despite the fact that we left Frankfurt a good 40 minutes late, we made it to JFK 30 minutes earlier but, because of that we had to wait on tarmac so that the Gate would become available.Going through the crowded Customs was a breeze because, they routed me to the machines where you self-check through Customs only to meet an officer for a brief moment to get the passport stamped.I had to wait a little while to collect my luggage and 10 minutes after I got out of the airport, my friend pulled in to get me. She is the sister of my BFF and I am staying with her and her husband's nice home in Forest Hills till next Friday.Yesterday I went downtown to stroll around and meet my BFF to sit among the live audience in the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The waiting in line part is a killer but the monologues were very funny, the band excellent and the guests were interesting. It is taped with a live audience and broadcasted later at night. The guest was Mia Farrow's son Ronan Farrow who is an investigative journalist. His book Catch and Kill came out and it is on Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer.Then we had a quick bite and my friend returned upstate. I hopped on the subway to go back to Forest Hills.

I bought just enough food to tie me over till I leave. It cost less than what I would spend on the order so, I am glad.My suitcases are nowhere near the weight limit but, they are full. Some of the gifts and winter clothing take up a lot of space. If it weren't for them, I would probably be able to take only one with me.Before I leave, I will change the sheets on my bed and the guest bed so that if anyone in the family wants to visit while I am gone, will have fresh sheets. That also means, there will be laundry waiting for me. I think, I can wash the sheets on the guest bed today and put them away before I leave. My bed sheets will have to wait. I could wash them and hang them to dry but they would collect a lot of dust. Who needs fresh but dusty sheets?The only things that I need to pack at the last minute are my eye drops and my toiletry items.Tomorrow, as the apartment gets cleaned, I will clean the fridge and plan my initial days in NYC.I will go take a warm shower and have a cup of coffee and a banana now.Hope, everyone is having a good weekend."},
{"title": "Ugh! ", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2019", "text": "My apartment is a mess. The gifts, the clothing items, the meds and other necessities are all scattered around. I have no idea how and when this happened but, I am the culprit.Today, I have decided to take care of the meds and pack my carry-on. I had borrowed my mom's carry-on rolling suitcase and was planning to take that. I only packed it halfway, thinking that I could put my laptop on top and be done with it. Something made me weigh it and opps! It was 7something kgs. What? A pair of pants, a blouse, a cardigan, meds and a change of underwear plus pajamas. How could that be?Then I emptied the thing and weighed it by itself. It was 4,5 kgs! The allowance is only 8. So, it turned out to be a stupid idea to take that.I hopped on a bus to go to Metro Gross Market and looked at the suitcases over there. Their prices were outrageous although all the bags were super light. I took a cab to Carrefour and looked at the carry-ons over there. The selection was huge with a variety of prices. I had this luggage scale and a measuring tape with me and I started looking at all the bags and compared prices. I spent more than half an hour choosing a carry-on. The lightest bag was less than 2 kgs and before I walked out with it, I sat down to grab a bite.My inner voice told ne to check the luggage requirements one last time and of course what I selected was not good on the airline I am flying with. Some airlines tell you to add up three dimensions and anything below 115 cm. is good. But the airline I am flying with specifically requires a maximum of 55x40x23. So, I walked back and spent another good 20 minutes. By the time I checked out, there were no cabs available. I waited for a WHOLE HOUR to get a cab and could not get one. So, I stuffed my things in the rolling bag and walked outside the store to a busy intersection. Luckily, I found a cab. The driver told me at that hour it was almost impossible to find a cab.I normally never need cabs and certainly I had no idea about their rush hour and driver exchange hours.I am so exhausted. Took a long hot shower and will kick back and relax.I did not realize that the fridge door was not closed properly last night and today, I had to throw away the chicken I bought yesterday, the yogurt, the salad with mayo and the cheese. Thankfully, I did not have much stuff in there but still...I hate wasting food and this was totally my stupidity. I changed the places of some condiment bottles and did not see that one of them was getting stuck.Ughhh! Now I have to shop for food again."},

I hope not to have to use it.Then I went downstairs to the pharmacy to hand them my prescription. Didn't wait for them and said I would pick the package later in the day and walked to the bank to pick up my renewed credit card. The lady at the bank was a former employee of my BIL and she was super nice.I then went to get my prescription sunglasses. I had them put in new lenses into the frame I already had so, that did not cost a lot.I hopped on a bus to go to Carrefour to check out suitcases because the duffel bag I am planning to take is now off acceptable limits. Bummer! I have a twenty dollar cheap bag I bought from Chinatown years ago. May be I will use that along with my good suitcase. So, before I bought another one, I decided to pack and see first. I purchased a few grocery items to consume what I have on hand. By the time I was finished, I was exhausted and had a heavy bag to carry so, I hailed a cab.I went back to the pharmacy, picked up 3 months worth of meds.I also picked up the delivered packages while I was away.Now it is time to wash everything, plan what to pack in which bag and etc. I feel so ready for this trip. I am crossing all fingers and toes so that, nothing comes my way to jeopardize my plans."},

On Friday, I will be meeting a friend and completing my shopping. Will pick up some Turkish Delight, pistachio nuts and dried figs. These are popular among my friends.I have so much to pack. I am allowed two suitcases, a carry-on, and a purse. I want to be done packing on Sunday. My flight is early Tuesday. I have arranged for a pick-ıp service from my home and allowed myself ample time at the airport. I hate to be in a rush when I am traveling.I have 5 hours to kill at Frankfurt Airport.

Lol!Anyway, early this morning my uncle showed up. We took both cars to the tire place for winter tires so, I did not have to make two trips. I ran a few errands for mom. Later in the afternoon my sister and BIL showed up grinning from ear to ear. We all went out for dinner and had a good time. It has been quiet a while since the five of us have been together.Tomorrow, we are having breakfast together and then, they will be on their way back to Izmir.

Thankfully, nobody took it and the machine swallowed it. I have spoken to the Call Center rep and he says a new card will be issued and sent to my address within 7-13 days. Yikes! That does not work for me. Thankfully my sister is a branch manager at the same bank and I know she can pull some strings to get me the new card faster.To be on the safe side, I inquired if my other card will allow me to make payments in USD when I use it in the US. It looks like they do. In the past, I would make USD purchases and the bank would convert it to TL at a higher exchange rate than the prevailing market rate and I would end up losing money. So, I had stopped using this card. Tomorrow, I will take care of that.The only inconvenience is that, I will have to deposit USD into an account at this bank. When I come back from Ankara, I will deal with that. Not a big deal.I have so much going on at the same time and when I do, I sometimes act without my brain. Today was one of those days... Sigh..."},
{"title": "Started tracking my travel budget already!", "date": "Wednesday, October 9, 2019", "text": "I have been carefully planning my big vacation for weeks now. I have set aside a notebook and a notepad. The notebook is for keeping track of the places I want to visit, notes about my day and etc. The notepad is for lists and budget tracking.Last night I made the first important purchase and entered that on my notepad. I ordered this package  from Mint Mobile. I could use my Turkish mobile phone but the roaming charges would kill me. I have actually calculated what it would cost me to use my phone and it turned out to be USD 533! Yikes!  60 bucks works for me. I use Whatsappp to call home and the 8 GB of Internet is plenty both for that and all my other needs.I have searched for mobile phone solutions for quiet a while and this seems to be the best fit at the best price. I am bringing my old phone which is unlocked and compatible with the T-Mobile NW. I have checked the coverage and it looks very good on my route.Since I am going to be spending quiet a bit of time in NYC, I have checked out The New York Pass and calculated whether it would be worthwhile to get it. Made a list of places that I want to visit and checked entry fees. I have decided against it. I can do better without one.Getting the 7-day Unlimited Pass of MTA in NYC is a fantastic deal for my visit. You can use the pass on the buses and on the subway. It is also refillable after the 7 days are up. At USD 33 for 7 days, I think it is an awesome deal. Besides, I know my way around the City and as long as the weather cooperates, I will be just fine.The contractor came today for additional work and things seem to be fine. He must paint around the window frame from the outside and the site manager will supply the required paint. He has nothing to do inside till I decide to get my room painted which is months away. Once he finished the paint job, I will pay him. I haven't paid a dime until now and I think, the payment has been motivating.I am only praying that the fix will work.After lunch, mom and I are going to the mall to order me prescription sunglasses. I will use one of the frames that I already have and the glasses will not be progressive. That will save me a good chunk of money."},
{"title": "Contractors...", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2019", "text": "I have a problem in my bedroom by the window. Unfortunately, the contractor who changed my window frames did a lousy job and the wall next to the frame has been damaged causing some humidity issue in the wall and the paint.This year I found a contractor through a good friend. All summer long either the contractor was busy or I was traveling. Ever since we came back to Istanbul, I had been bugging the guy to come and fix the wall. He always had a reason to postpone the repairs and finally, he came on Monday. He brought some stuff and looking at them, I knew something was not quite right. When I inquired further, he seemed to have totally forgotten what he and my friend discussed. I could not call my friend right away because she has moved to the US. So, I just texted my friend hoping that she would see it early enough to intervene. Anyway, the guy and his helper started doing what they were prepared to do but I was totally bummed.Then I thought of asking the apartment complex' site manager. I am glad I asked him to come over and look at the work. He apparently was familiar with the kind of damage and he told the contractor what type of material needs to be used. Luckily, the contractor listened to him and did the first part of the job. Then the material needed to dry before other isolation material could be applied. So, they left.Meanwhile my friend saw my text and called me and then called the contractor to find out what he was doing. She also video called me and I showed her what was done. Later in the day, she called me again to say that what he started doing after the site manager's intervention was OK. The repairs would be finished today but alas! It has been raining non-stop. So, may be, he may come tomorrow but, I doubt it. I have to take mom to Ankara on Thursday and run errands for her before I can come back next Tuesday. That leaves me just a week to get this work finished.At least now that he has started, I am sure he will be wanting to finish and get paid. Wish me luck!"},
{"title": "25 Solo Roadtrip Tips and Precautions", "date": "Sunday, October 6, 2019", "text": "I will soon be on my way to the US. I have planned a solo roadtrip all the way to Florida and back. This means, I will be on the road alone and be staying at various hotels.To be safe, I take some precautions while I am traveling alone and below you will find them. Please feel free to contribute your ideas in the comments.1. Never stop in badly lit areas with just a few people around. I always pull into busy stops whenever I have to. Sometimes, I exit the highway just to do that.2. Always check the gas level, around the car and the tires before pulling out of a stop.3. Never leave any belongings in the car within plain sight.4. Be aware of the surroundings, the cars and people around.5. Don't stay at places where room entrances are from the outside. This means, I spend more money but, that's OK. Safety first.6. If asked whether I am on the road alone in a general conversation by anybody, always tell them no or meeting up with friends right after whatever I am doing.7. Always keep my phones charged. (This is easy to do in the car)8. Share my itinerary with my sister and my BFF.9 Check the windows and the door one in the room. If I am on the ground level, I make sure to draw the curtains well and place some objects like my suitcase, or an armchair by the window. I also use door stoppers if there are no deadbolts. Some may argue that, it might be a safety problem if my health fails me and if the hotel staff needs to open my room but, that's what I do.10. I have my sit down meal during lunch time rather than dinner time in order to be in my room before it is too late. It is also cheaper.11. Consume nuts and cheese rather than carbs in order to stay awake and focused while driving.12. Keep myself hydrated and I drink water mostly.13. Keep some extra food and water in the trunk.14. Do not wear fancy clothing or attention attracting bling.15. Act confident, not lost even if lost.16. Do not drive for more than two hours at a time. Always, stop, walk, get the circulation going and rest.17. Don't be looking at your cell phone and not be paying attention to your surroundings.18. Get the navigation started before pulling out of a rest area.19. Make sure offline maps are downloaded as well.20. KEEP FOCUSED WHILE DRIVING!21. Travel light and bring only the necessary items.22. Keep the nightgown, toothpaste, toothbrush brush and meds within easy reach to hit the sack if too tired.23. Keep USD 20-30 in small denominations in the pockets rather than fiddle with the wallet when paying for small stuff. Keep cash and credit cards out of sight.24. Keep Emergency Info in cell phones and in wallet. This includes allergy information, who to call, the number for Turkish Embassy and meds regularly taken.25. If not feeling well, re-arrange plans and take care of self first."},

I've got less than two weeks!My friend got tickets for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The show is not on in Turkey but, I have watched him while I was in the US and sometimes, I watch the show on YouTube.I am going to take mom to Ankara next Wednesday or Thursday. My uncle will go to Ankara to stay with her while I am gone.Today, I made something. A total DIY type of job. You see, I am not a handy person at all. I have this big ottoman. It is also a box where I store my throw blankets. It is awfully heavy and when we want to stretch our legs on it, it becomes a hassle to move it around in the room. So, I have decided to put wheels under it. Unfortunately the base board was so thin, I could not drill holes. I bought a scrap wood board half an inch smaller than the base and installed four wheels that move in every direction. Pat on my back! I drilled holes and screwed the wheels perfectly. I then placed the ottoman on this thing that looks like a skateboard and voila!Mom has two of the same ottoman and she wanted wheels on them too. I bought enough hardware to take to Ankara. I am very impressed with my skill. Lol!"},

Bah!", "date": "Friday, September 27, 2019", "text": "I do not know if I have mentioned this before but, at my previous job, we had a toxic employee. My ex-boss and I were able to place him at a customer site so that he could not jeopardize daily operations. The project lasted for over a year and everybody was comfortable with the arrangement. My ex-boss sold the company, new owners took it over and the said project came to an end eventually.Knowing this person, I alerted the new management about the upcoming problem and the new GM decided to offer him another customer site project. He did and the idiot rejected.Right around those days, the company arranged for a dinner party and the GM decided to talk to this guy once more.All through the night the GM and the guy talked but could not come to a conclusion. Finally, late at night as he was leaving, I have realized that he was very drunk so, I told the waiters to call a cab for him and urged him to leave his car. He refused it but I insisted and told him that he could expense the cab. He said fine and walked out. Well, being the idiot that he was, he took his car without waiting for the cab and right around the corner, he came across another car and somehow got involved in a fist fight with those people. The police station was within quarter of a mile so, they came immediately and arrested the guy since he was drunk driving. We were still at the restaurant when he called the GM. At that hour of the night both the GM and another manager went to the police station and I got a hold of the company lawyer. We went out of our way to help him but the level of alcohol in his blood made it impossible for him to keep his license. Due to a previous DUI, his license got suspended for two years!Well, our business required everybody to drive and hence, we had issued company cars to all.The guy came back a couple of days later. (It took him two days to sober up). The GM told him that now that he will not be able to drive, he should accept the customer site assignment since the customer provided transportation. He refused it AGAIN! The GM was way more patient with him than I would be. He talked to him for at least two hours and finally gave up. We then terminated his contract having no other choice.He decided to sue the company which is fine. However, the first court hearing is on Monday and being a witness, I have to go. Bummer! I was really hoping that the court date would be set later and I would be abroad so that I would not have to go. Bummer again!At least the previous company is sending a car to pick me up to go to the court on my request."},
{"title": "My tips for Rental Cars", "date": "Thursday, September 26, 2019", "text": "We all know that shopping for prices and reserving a car well in advance of the travel dates are important to secure the best prices.I rarely need to rent a car in my home country since I have a car. When I need one, I shop around using international sites and believe it or not, I get the best prices through them.I usually need a car when I am abroad. With my upcoming trip I need a car for about 41 days. Rental companies allow you to rent for only 30 days so, as I am dropping the first rental, I will be picking up the other.I have started searching and reserving good deals months ago and made and canceled several reservations. I wasn't expecting to find better deals as the date approaches but, I kept on looking and am very glad I did. This week I have been pleasantly surprised by a better deal on the first rental.I use AUTOSLASH and a few other sites but, I found the best prices through AUTOSLASH this time. It is a real neat site where you can enter your reservation details so that they can track and find you even better deals if possible. You get to see the offers and then make the reservation online through Priceline. If you are a foreigner like I am, do use a VPN to be able to see the Autoslash offers on Priceline. If you don't, you may see higher prices. Autoslash has a pop-up that tells you this. You may always ask for help and they respond pretty quickly. I am not being paid for this post and this represents my experience.My time frame for rentals include Thanksgiving and days close to Christmas. One of the busiest times when car rental prices sky rocket. It is always more expensive in the New York area anyway.I am pretty comfortable with the current prices on my reservations. The killer is Damage Waiver and Additional Liability Insurance. American consumers who already own cars and car insurance do not have to purchase those since their policies cover rentals. As a foreigner I have to. I knew this from the start and have made my budget accordingly.I have rented cars several times and have never needed the insurance but, I am not going to risk anything. Peace of mind is important. I hope never to need the insurance and always be able to pay for it."},

She sent me to an eye doctor upstairs and the eye doctor gave me a basic exam and confirmed my current prescription.Then I went to the Government Office where they issue and renew IDs, passports, DLs. I had to wait for about an hour because I went in earlier than my appointment. Then they canceled my current DL, gave me a temporary one and told me that they would be mailing my new license. It is good for 10 years so, I do not have to do this again anytime soon.Old licenses did not have expiration dates. New ones are valid only for 10 years. I used to have a US license from NY State. I think it was good for only 5 years? I am not sure.Then I went to get my glasses adjusted.

He is a nice guy and I thought he had moved to Canada with his family. Seems like he has one foot on this continent and travels from time to time.After that one of my employees from my last job called. He is over the moon that he is about to be offered a job by a multinational company. He had it with the new manager he reports to. He is a great guy and deserves the best. I hope, he gets the job. There may be a few stumbling blocks but, I have a positive feeling about this.I have finalized my rental car arrangements. It is the most expensive part of this vacation and I am not even renting a car for the whole time. Just 41 days out of 78.  The killer is the DW and the ALI I must purchase. Since I am not a US citizen with a car coverage that would take care of a rental car, I must purchase the expensive insurance.

Other than coming to Ankara, she did not go out after the surgery. Over the weekend, we shall meet my sister and brother in law and go back to Istanbul on Monday.I am really tired already."},
{"title": "Gotta find a new cardiologist", "date": "Tuesday, September 3, 2019", "text": "Bummer!My mom and I used to go to the same cardiologist in Ankara every 6 months. Today, I found a message on my cell phone that she has left the hospital and now she has her own practice. Our insurance does not accept individual practices and also, a single doctor cannot issue a certain type of report for meds we take on a regular basis. It has to be a board of doctors which you can only find at a hospital. One of mom's meds require a report every 6 months. The rest is every two years.We liked our doctor and have been seeing her for the last 10 years or so. After I come back from my big vacation, I will look for a cardiologist in Istanbul possibly at the hospital mom had her appendectomy. I intend to ask around to my doctor friends also, before I decide on a new hospital and new doctor.We came to Ankara today and I ran one errand to get it out of the way. Tomorrow I am meeting some alumni of my HS. I know most of them only through Facebook. It will be nice to meet face to face.Yesterday when I went to the bank, I parked at the grocery store's free parking lot because, they charge you for the rest of the parking spaces. When I returned, I noticed the good sales that is going on and grabbed two packs of 32 rolls of TP. I have some more at home and I think my stock will last me a long time.I have skipped the perihables since, we are not going to be here for a week but, I bought some detergent along with the TP.  Mom disagrees with me and says with the limited space in my apartment, I should not be stockpiling. Well, the only thing I put in my closet is the TP. The rest of the stuff are put where they belong.If I feel like purging further sometime soon, I will empty out some space for stockpiling.By the time you read this post, we will probably be either on the road or, in Ankara.Have a good day!"},

Since November 2016, I had been paying a debt that belonged to a family member because he did not have the means to take care of it and not paying it would cause loss of a family home and some other complications. Since, I was earning very well at the time, I had taken over this debt.Today, I made the last payment! THE. LAST. PAYMENT.I have only one remaining debt now, a mortgage on an apartment that I purchased from the same family member so that he could generate some cash and to keep the apartment in the family. We all use it. It is a 3 bedroom apartment close to many beaches in the city of Antalya.There are 64 more mortgage payments but, it is a lot lower than the one that has been paid. About 1/3 of the other so, it isn't all that important.Pheeewww!"},

Despite that, I still lost 4 pounds but, it could have been a lot better.I have to admit that every time I am on the treadmill, I want to give it up during the first 15 minutes. Past that mark, I motivate myself by looking at the screen and setting mini goals like \"I am going to up the incline once I hit 1 mile\" or \"I am going to keep on at 4.2 miles till I hit 35 minutes\". I am making a game of this and walking between 35 and 55 minutes every day.Now that it is cooling down a little, I would like to walk outside too. I need to purchase gifts for my upcoming vacation so, there is some motivation there as well.We are going to Ankara on Tuesday, coming back on Monday. I have several errands to run so, it is going to be a busy week.Today, the cleaning lady could not come and since we shall be away for a week, I do not mind it. When we come back, I can dust and vacuum."},
{"title": "New Method to Follow Liquid Assets", "date": "Saturday, August 31, 2019", "text": "The crazy fluctuations in the exchange rates make it difficult for me to track my Liquid Assets properly. I have my savings in TL, USD, Gold and an insignificant amount of Euros.I normally track my Liquid Assets by converting all foreign exchange to TLs at the exchange rate of the last day of the month. This is very deceiving because of the exchange rate fluctuations. So, I have decided to track only the TL starting in January 2020, since the rest of the stuff is actually my nest egg. I am not touching that yet and hope, never to touch it. As long as I have the mortgage for the Antalya apartment, I will be tapping my TL savings by about 4.5% every year, i.e. till January 2025. The current interest rate on TL accounts is about 17% so, 4.5% is not too bad and it is only over the TL savings. After that, my passive income will cover my living expenses. If I get some consulting business, that will be the icing on the cake for travel.My passive income was enough to cover my living expenses until recently. When I had to add health insurance to my budget and due to hiking prices of utilities, gas, food and almost everyting, I now need to supplement it. The economy is not doing well over here so, savings are even more important now.Looking at the current numbers, it looks like I will be doing better in meeting my year end goals but, I know that, this is deceiving. Hopefully, next year's goals will be tracked in a more realistic manner.A lot of bloggers calculate their Net Worth.  I do not. Why? Because the worth of the real estate keep fluctuating and unless you sell them, you have no idea what they are really worth."},

My friend used to be a neat freak but, she is a bit better now. Her husband is a very good man with a kind heart and honest personality but, he was a bit of a slob. Not dirty but just a bit messy.Soon after they married, my friend started complaining about her husband, how he never picked up after himself and things like that. Every time I suggested something, she had a counter argument. I would say: \"Well, don't pick up after him. Let his pants stay on the floor and when he needs them again, he will understand\" and she would respond \"I cannot bear that. Everything must be in it's proper place\" or \"I can't do that\". After a while, I started to get frustrated and realized that this exchange may end up hurting our friendship. So, I have decided to talk to her about it openly and honestly. She agreed with me and did not complain about her husband to me again. I do not know if he is any better or not by now. He has proven that he is a good husband, very caring dad and a dear friend over the years.Nowadays, I am watching My 600 lb Life and I see that before the patient truly decides to get help, she/he cannot be helped. When they stumble and are told to seek psychological help and when they refuse, they cannot be successful. The patients who do everything right to a T, are the ones who succeed. Why? Because, there is a tried and true way of doing the weight loss program. Dr. Nowzaradan knows what he is talking about.What prompted me to write this is another blogger who recently got into a very big trouble. I am not going to name names. Her financial status, her age and her health are not in the greatest shape. So, a bunch of fellow bloggers offered a lot of sound advice but, she does not want to hear any of it. That is absolutely fine. She wants to do this in her own way and noone can make her do otherwise.However, she recently deleted all those comments that she did not like or agree with. I think, that is wrong. Very wrong. After all, all of us who commented, do care about her. She is almost my mom's age and I cannot bear the thought of her current hardship. I wish her the best of luck in handling the situation her way. I do want to be wrong about my assesment of her situation. However, I am not going to be following her blog and commenting on it any longer."},

The first night at the hospital, she had too much pain and she could not find a comfortable position to sleep. In 7 hours I took 1020 steps between her bed and the recliner at the foot of her bed! At my weight, getting up and down several times during that time was terrible. My leg muscles and my back still hurts.At 10 p.m. I finally could not bear it any longer and made sure she was comfortable, then fell into a very very deep sleep on the recliner. Mom needed to get up and she called me some time after midnight and I did not hear her! I am so embarassed! Since we could not find a single room at the hospital due to some renovation, we had to share a room with another sick lady and her niece. The niece heard my mom and instead of waking me up, she went to help her. Such a nice person! She was quiet the chatterbox and entertained us with all her interesting stories. We exchanged cards and promised to see each other. They do not live too far away from us.Anyway, I got up at 5 a.m. and heard the story. I am thankful they let me sleep but, I was also very embarassed.She was discharged by noon time and as soon as we got home, we both wanted to nap and nap we did! It was dinner time, when I finally woke up and found my mom making soup. She said, she realized how tired I was and did not mind throwing together a simple tomato soup (from scratch). She is the one who had the procedure and I was the one who could not get over it.To be honest, I started feeling better only today."},

And how I made a list of things to be done?Well, thankfully what happened was not something to derail all (for the moment anyway) but, Sunday morning mom woke me up and said \"I am not well T'Pol. I think it is my appendix\" Later on she joked about how I got up so fast, saying that she never saw me like that before.I took her to the ER and they ran some tests and could not confirme the appendix but, they admitted us so that further tests could be run and a general surgeon could check it out.To make a long story short, we both had a terrible night on Sunday and on Monday morning, they took her appendix out.  Mom's surgeon said the appendix was not about to burst or anything so, she decided to look at other internal organs to see what caused mom's pain. Last night we slept better but mom was not very comfortable due to the IV, urinary catheter and the compression socks. She wanted to move and be out of the place a.s.a.p. Today they discharged her.As soon as we got home, we both fell asleep and rested quiet a bit.Life is an adventure... I am glad mom is already doing better."},

As we approach the end of it, there are chores I must be taking care of before I take off on my big vacation.I started by getting my car serviced. It did not cost very much. The guy who explained what was done told me that my brake pads did not need to be changed. He was surprised. Who needs brake pads be changed at 30,000 Km? Never heard of it. It usually takes 70-100,000 Km for me.I also took my mom and my grandparents' Moldovan caretaker out to lunch at a nice restaurant right on the water. She is a very nice lady. She took care of my grandparents as if they were her own parents between 1999-2002. My mom and uncle treated her as a sibling and one of the family so, now they are very good friends. She has been taking care of other elderly people in Istanbul since my grandad's passing. Her latest employer just passed after 5 years due to cancer. Now she is going to her own country for a while and will come back in January. So, today's outing was timed just fine.She is more of a companion than a caretaker and I have ideas for the future.Anyhow, I have decided to make my list of the major chores that I am facing over here:Take mom for a haircut. DONE!Take mom to Ankara August 30thTake the car in for service and inspection September 2ndPay the last of the debt taken over September 2nd (WOOOHOOO!)Get the car Inspected September 3rdTake an inventory at mom's home and do her shoppingCook and freeze food for momGo to see the eye doctor, get a prescription for new glassesTake current measurements and sizes of mom, sis, BIL.Come back homePurge, purge, purge and donate...Select a new frame and order new glassesTake uncle's jacket to be waxedSee the kidney doctorShop for gifts for the big vacationGo back to Ankara for the cardiologist visit for both mom and myself.Clean out the fridgePack suitcasesGet my home cleaned right before the big vacationLeave enough cash in accounts for automated payments.Get USD in cash in small denominations.Get 3 months worth of regular meds plus others that I might need.I also need to get together with a few friends. I am sure, there are tons of other things I have forgotten to list. I will keep on adding items as I remember them."},
{"title": "Thoughts on purging", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2019", "text": "This summer taught me an important lesson in how much clothing I actually need.All summer long, I wore a pair of New Balance sneakers and a pair of footbed sandals I bought from Kohl's last year. I also wore two pairs of shorts and two pairs of capri pants with a rotation of 5-6 T-shirts.Also, I found \"the bra\" that I love. It is a Bali front closure bra and I had bought 4 of them when I was in the US last year. I keep rotating those. The underwire broke in one of them just recently. I have many more bras that I am no longer wearing. Why keep them?Earlier this year, I set aside several pairs of work pants that I thought I might need when I lose some more weight. Now that I am working part-time, I realize, all I need is two, may be three pairs of pants and some tops for work. I have three jackets that I do actually wear. So, I will go through work clothing  again and part with most of them.I also have many many many pairs of socks and more than enough jeans for the Fall and Winter. I have tons of shirts, turtlenecks and T-shirts as well. I will purge quiet a bit there too.I found two soft capri sweatpants that are now too big for me which still have the tags on. I have decided to make them pajamas utilizing two tops that are too big as well. Pajamas need to be comfy after all.I can go on and on but, to make a long story short, I have too much to purge. I also need to buy some things such as a pair of work appropriate shoes for the summer, and casual winter boots. I intend to get them during my trip in the US.Off to purging I go!"},

It is still warm but, I can feel the weather turning which also means I am so much closer to my big vacation. Today is a cloudy day with a nice breeze.Today I processed the tomatoes I have bought to freeze for winter. I wash them, cut them up, run them through the food processor and put three ladels full in one freezer bag. I flatten them all up and freeze them. I had bought close to 8 kgs but I think, we ate 2 to 3 kgs of it since last Saturday. I do not have much space in the freezer so, this much will have to do. I use tomato puree and paste too but like to use the real thing better. I will not be home from end of October till early January so, I am sure this will be enough. If we can free up some more space, I may freeze some more later on.I need to look through my pantry and share some of the stuff with mom. There is more than I can consume.When we go to Ankara, I am going to look at her home and go for a big grocery shopping. I will also cook some stuff and stock her freezer. When she is alone, she doesn't want to cook and doesn't eat much. I am sure my uncle will stay with her at least for a while, when I am away. When he is around, I know he will cook a variety of food so, that's good. He can also take her shopping for fresh produce since my 2010 Nissan is in the garage of mom's apartment for their use. Mom never drove and I know, that is something she regrets."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Mom!", "date": "Tuesday, August 13, 2019", "text": "Today is my mom's 76th Birthday. I am taking her out to dinner. My sister, brother-in-law and I bought her a new cell phone as a birthday present few weeks ago. Her old one was no longer charging well and she needed a bigger screen. She seems to have gotten used to it.Mom is an archaelogist but, she never worked as one due to getting married right after College and having me a year after. She was a stay-at-home mom till I was 11 and my sister was 4. She was very bored and her working would contribute tremendously to the family budget since I had started a private school  So, she started to work for a Government Agency. She enjoyed her career and got retired when her parents and my dad's mom started needing care. After my uncle passed, my grandma on my father's side wanted to go to a nursing home but, mom said she would not let that happen as long as she herself does not need medical care. So, she brought grandma to live with her and my sister. She took her to several doctors because grandma had ignored her health, trying to look after a 60 year old alcoholic son, my uncle.She was and still is the authority figure in our family. She made sure we got plenty of exercise outdoors, had balanced meals, stayed away from junk food and read lots of books. She used to spend lots of time when we were little teaching us songs, fun things to contribute to our motor skills and answered all our questions with patience. She also tutored a lot of neighborhood kids when asked for free. She had a way with children. I guess my grandma wanter her to be a teacher but she chose archaelogy instead.I started to read when I was little over 4 and of course no school accepted me at the age of 5 but, the headmistress of a nearby school was a family friend and she said that, if I could write and do some simple math, she would be willing to put me through an exam to accept me for 2nd grade instead of starting me at 1st grade. All summer long, my mom collected every neighborhood kid at our dining room table and had them complete their summer homeworks, while teaching me writing and math so that I could be in a classroom like environment and get used to school. So, at the age of 6, I was accepted to 2nd grade.My father was a worrier and he would not let us do some things he considered dangerous or things that might interfere with school. Mom always supported us and assured dad, things will be fine. When my sister started playing volleyball, she made sure, she picked her up from practice every night after school. She went to all her games.She is an excellent mom and I love her to the moon and back. We spend a lot of time together and enjoy each other's company. I cannot say we get along 100% but close. We are both strong-willed and have our own ways so, sometimes we need time apart.As I observe her age, I think new living arrangements should be made. I also know that, that responsibility is mostly mine since my sister has her auto-immune sickness to deal with, is still working and is married. I do not know what the days ahead will bring.She wanted me to order the rollator last week. She says she doesn't want to hold me back from doing things and she tinks the rollator will help her keep up with me better. Isn't that amazing? She may be turning 77 but, her soul is not older than 35:)HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM! WISHING YOU A LONG, PROSPEROUS AND HEALTHY LIFE!"},
{"title": "Scattered Thoughts - Need to pick your brains", "date": "Sunday, August 11, 2019", "text": "If you have read my previous post, this is about it. Ever since my friend asked for my help, there have been things bothering me at the background of my mind. So, I have decided to put them down here and see what my friends in the blogosphere has to say.First, let me share some historical info:There are 5 ex-employees of mine working for this particular company. I cannot say I liked them much and in fact, I was relieved when they left my former company on their own. They were making the environment toxic and affecting the others in a negative manner.Guy 1: The head of the professional services team - He should be able to do what needs to be done in terms of my friend's needs, except that he is lazy. He always has a reason why he cannot do a certain thing. (all those things he could not do, could be done by others).Guy 2: I actually liked his attitude, appreciated his knowledge and work and sent him to an event in the US, a rare perk of the job. I was hoping he would mentor the new recruits afterwards but, he resigned a week after the trip just because, he was offered a 5% better salary. I was willing to counter-offer but my ex-boss refused it. All that time he was getting ready to go to the US, he knew that he would resign. In my book that is not acceptable. He should have bowed out gracefully and let another colleague go.Guy 3: Lazy, always complains, never in a good mood.Guy 4: Lazy, never learns from mistakes. He is supposed to produce marketing material but he never ran a spell check despite being told several times. Always produces inferior quality work that needs to be touched up by someone else.Gal 1: Did not have much interaction with her since she left shortly after I joined the former company. For all I know, she was known to be rude to the customers. She made an effort to come back but, my former boss did not accept her.The owner of this company tried to recruit others from our team in the past but, they did not go since they loved my ex-boss and got along well with me as second in command. So, he recruited the bad apples in a way. However, since he did not let anyone go, they must have been working OK I guess. The owner seems satisfied. My ex-boss on the other hand, never liked any of them and when they wanted to leave, he did not move a finger not to lose any of them.You may be thinking 5 people can not be all bad and there must be something wrong with me too. I am a bit of a perfectionist and even though I know, not everybody can be great, I like to see genuine effort. Not everybody can be an excellent worker but, they should at least try.I do not think, I want to have anything to do with the above people anymore. I would never hire them, if I were the boss.So, all the above had been bothering me in the background. My friend needs my support, has joined this company about 5 months ago. She is an excellent salesperson. On financial issues, she can be a pain in the butt, however, overall she is a nice person.May be I should tell my friend all about this and leave it at that. If there is a way around working as a consultant without having to deal with these people directly, I may consider it.What do you think?"},

She is now working for a competitor.She basically told me she needed support at her new company. There are certain things I used to do at the former company and she says she needs those things adressed at her new company. I told her that I am not willing to work full-time. She says we can work it out so that, I could help them on my own terms sort of like a consultant working mostly from home and attending a few meetings every once in a while.To be honest, I do not see what I can contribute but, I guess we need to talk further to see what we can come up with. I also told her that I would be gone for a long time for vacation. She thinks that could be managed.I do not know what to think, at this point. This can be financially nice but it has a potential to be stressful. I must clear my head and talk some more to my friend.Interesting, huh?"},

Don't you think?I thought I was done with laundry but mom reminded me that we needed to change the sheets on our beds! More laundry...Then, I decided to process the meat I bought yesterday. Shanks went into the pressure cooker. I sauteed  a small part of the chopped meat for our taco dinner and the rest became meat patties to be frozen. Took me about an hour to do all that with the help of mom. I also had to hand wash quiet a bit of dishes because the machine was already full and working.I also dusted our bedrooms and mom vacuumed them. I am allergic to house dust and since we weren't at home for almost a month and a half, the cleaning lady could not come. I wrote to her today that we were back and she said can come not this coming Sunday but, next Sunday. So, more dusting and vacuuming tomorrow. The bathroom needs to be cleaned as well. Ugh!Have I ever told anyone that I hate housework? Give me all the chores outside the home and I will gladly take care of them. Housework? No thanks!I like to cook but, do not like to clean up the kitchen. I do it beacuse I have to.Mom is very neat and tidy. She cannot stand clutter or seeing things out of place. So, when she is home with me, I have to be as neat. I am not messy but, I may leave things around. I like clean but can stand some disarray.Anyway, from today on, no cooking for us. We will only make a salad and pull the stuff from the freezer to go with it. Makes it so much easier.I will go back to my exercise routine on Friday, I promised myself. I have not been bad but, I really haven't been watching what I ate lately. Ate more fruit than I should so, I gotta stop that.The consulting company paid for my days and reimbursed my expenses. Nice!Next week is a religious holiday here but, I do not practice any religion. I do contribute to charity on a regular basis though. I am not doing this because I am afraid that I will go to hell after I die. I just want to be a decent human being who helps others within her means. I do believe that there is a creator and that's it. As long as people do not hurt each other, suppress others or start wars, I do not care what they believe."},

We made it there by lunch time, had lunch at my mom's favorite place, sat by the marina, had coffee and bought ourselves matching sun dresses. Lol!Then we stopped at another town to visit an outlet store and looked at towels as if we needed more. She bought a pair of bedroom slippers and I bought a sheet for her bed.We bought a water melon, two melons and some onions on the road.All this activity and road took 12 hours. Mom told me she had a very happy day and that comment made my day. She was very exhausted this morning but still happy. So, I went out alone and did our food shopping. I did not buy vegetables since, I want to get them from the farmers market on Saturday. I bought a lot of meat for upcoming meals and fish for tonight's dinner.I am glad we have food in the freezer that I cooked a couple of weeks ago. We do not need to cook much for a while. I am planning light meals such as a salad and some kind of meat. I would like to have a soft taco night since I have been craving that kind of food. I make my salsa and guacamole from scratch.I also did three loads of laundry today so, I am exhausted. Good to be back at home."},

I see her taking her cane more these days. She also says one day isn't like the next. She sometimes feels very strong, other times not so much.Nowadays, she has developed an interest in getting a rollator with a seat. Her walking distance is getting shorter and shorter and she always looks for some place to sit. She thinks a rollator is a good solution and so do I. She has the stamina to go and see places but, doesn't have the physical endurance.I remember her as a young woman who could move mountains if she wanted to. Watching her slow down is sad but also, a fact of life. I even feel myself slowing down at 53 sometimes.On the other hand, I did not have the chance to see my dad age. For all we know, he will always be 54.So, seeing a parent age is also a blessing albeit, a bittersweet one.Hoping to have several good years with my family in good health."},

Mom did the same.I also brought two purses/handbags to my sister. Both were barely used. I hope, she will use them. She seems like she liked them but, you never know my sister.Today my new tenant called to say there is a repair that needs to be done regarding the heating system. There is an upcoming expense.

Then we returned home.Tomorrow we both have doctors appointments for prescriptions and I need a blood test. We will have breakfast after the doctors visit. Having breakfast out is better than having dinner out moneywise. Right?I will also have a haircut and get my hair shortened significantly which will get rid of the balayage and from then on I will be able to color my own hair again. This will save me quiet a chunk of change. Especially, when I am in the US for almost three months come October, that will help me manage my hair. I am not setting foot at a hair salon in the US. Yikes! It is a lot cheaper in here.I have two days of work next week so, there will be some little extra income.The economy in the country is headed to disaster so, saving every penny, or \"kurush\" in my case is becoming more important.I cannot believe that I have less than 90 days to go before my big vacation. I saved USD 16 by re-booking the same hotel room at a different site that offered a discount yesterday. I will be staying at hotels for 12 days for the time being during my road trip from NY to FL and back. I may end up scheduling some other travel during my time there but that depends on the plans we will make with my friends."},

My apartment is in the shade due to many nice grown trees and I am sure, upper floors are warmer.I missed reading my favorite blogs so, I have a lot of catching up to do.We got home around 6 p.m. yesterday and I went shopping today. I did not buy any vegetables. Tomorrow, mom and I are going to the farmer's market. After tomorrow, we will be well stocked. I am planning to cook a lot of food and freeze them.

It is further down south and on the Mediterrenean but, not as hot as Izmir. It is a very hilly and small place. Visitors make the traffic terrible and driving in the tiny streets is very tricky. We parked our car and used taxis or the shuttle service our hotel offered mostly. Since we made our reservations in different times, mom and I stayed at a hotel and my sister and BIL stayed at the bungalows by one of the beaches.I spent tons of time in the water and enjoyed it very much. The water gets deep right away and I do love that. I am not a fan of sand.The whole town was covered in Bouganvilles. Too bad I could not take more pictures of them.Bouganvilles of the hotel behid oursFrom our chaise lounges in the shadeFrom the trerrace of our hotel where we had breakfastThe picture does not do the color justice.

I do not like to be exposed to the sun unless I am in the water. This is a picture from our table:The picture was taken around 10:30 a.m. so, you do not see many people. The whole place was really big and it was only about 1/4 full because it was a week day and the place is a bit pricey. However, there weren't many alternatives where mm could be so comfortable. There was a nice breeze and she was able to read and enjoy the view all day. The food was excellent and so was the service. I used those steps to go in the water.This place is called Hagia Yorgi Bay at Cesme. The water was so clean and clear. We will go back again next week after we come back from Kas. Mom is willing to go in the water which is next to impossible these days.Here is another beach I used to go to:It is also very nice but the facilities would not please mom. I used to rent chaise lounges under the trees rather than being under an umbrella. It was a bit crowded too.Then we had ice cream in town in Cesme before we headed back home.This area is a peninsula with several bays and beaches so, you can be at a different beach every day for at least 3 weeks.The weather was much nicer than it was in downtown Izmir. Nice breeze made it very pleasant."},

I may have to go to the customer site once or twice a week. Nice!I have been told there was another project somewhere on the Black Sea coast but, I have already planned to be in Izmir for some time so, I bowed out of that one. I will support them offline if and when they need help. No direct flights from Izmir to that city and to be honest, it is not something I would like. Family owned businesses are OK when there is one senir person calling the shots but when there are too many egos involved, thank you very much! Don't need the stress.We will see how much extra money I will be able to bring in before I leave for my big vacation in October. I have the money earmarked for it but every little extra is nice.I have a very solid budget yet, unanticipated expenses pop here and there all the time. In August for instance, I will have some repairs done for a water damage in my bedroom. After the fix, the whole room will be painted. I knew the repairs would have to be done but, did not have any idea regarding the cost.

Heat makes her grumpy, and sluggish. Wondering how she will tolerate Izmir which is worse than here.I must have hurt my big toe probably when exercising and it is giving me some trouble.

It was a Sunday in February. I was just up from the bed when my mom told me something was wrong with him. I called the ambulance and we took him to the Emergency Room at a large university hospital around 10 a.m. and by 5 p.m. he was gone.He had lost his dad as a child at the age of 9. Having lived through that loss, he wanted to be a great dad.He was an agricultural engineer with a PhD on plant protection.He was a very loving father, a true family man and he sacrificed a career just to make sure both my sister and I receive the education he wanted us to get. We were good students and made him proud.He had a great sense of humor which could be annoying at times. His worst habit was that he worried too much and was a born pessimist. I may be like that at times but, not as much as he was. He loved reading and learning about new things. In that respect, I have taken after him too.We had our differences growing up especially when I was a teenager but, mom always managed us both. She was and still is the boss.I cannot imagine having someone else as a father. I loved him very much and still miss him. Not a day goes by that I do not think about him or remember something funny he might have said.I hope, you are resting in Peace Dad! Happy Father's Day!"},

My current goal is to lose 33 pounds by 10/22/2019. My current records show that I am past the half-way mark. Mind you this goal is not the ultimate goal. I have not set one like that. That is too far away and I just cannot deal with the thought of that. Too overwhelming.I have lost 18.5 pounds and have 14 something to go.I am positive I can make it. Writing here, using an Excel sheet and sharing with my family keep me motivated. I am just hoping that, I will take care of my weight problem once and for all within the next couple of years. I have tried this many times and failed. So, treading carefully here.I was very sedentary and I never want to go back to that anymore. The big vacation and the winter will be the biggest test for me to see whether I am truly committed.In the past, I had all sorts of stupid reasons that I used as justification to mindlessly eat, be a couch potato and such. I was working, work was stressful, I was tired, had no time to cook, I wasn't worried about my looks and etc.I completely ignored the health problems my weight caused or might cause in the long run. I was ready to accept them as a natural part of getting old... At the age of 50something! That does not make sense and I have always defined myself as a logical person. Where is the logic in that?This is a struggle and the enemy is within myself. We will see who will win in the long run."},

If I get stuck, I will go see one of those two ladies.I am trying to walk 7500 steps at least 5 days out of 7. I sometimes slip but, don't give up on my diet. I haven't eaten even a slice of cake on my birthday. However, I did eat a cheeseburger. No fries though...Go me! Lol...Tomorrow, I will weigh myself in the morning. Hoping for a loss of at least two more pounds.I have added a sheet to my Excel File to follow my weight loss and exercise. I am logging my data every day and using charts for visual aid. This keeps me in check.I am preparing all the meals and mom is very happy about that. She hates having to consider what to make and enjoys being served healthy meals.I promised my sister that when we go to visit them on the 24th, I will take over meal prep duty so that she can concentrate on losing weight as well. She and her husband are branch managers at a bank and they come home very late. Unless they have something pre-made, they tend to eat rather late. If they find dinner ready when they get home, it will be great. I will also prepare her breakfast, lunch and snack to pack. She just bought a new fridge with a big freezer section.

We then went to visit an old colleague of my dad's. We used to live in the same neighborhood due to my father's and his colleague's work. Mom and his wife were also friends. He is 8 years my dad's senior and is bed ridden for the last two years. He loved my dad as a brother and was shocked when he passed away 25 years ago. They all got a bit sentimental but, were glad we visited.After the visit, we drove home to Istanbul.I haven't been reading my favorite blogs for a while so there is a lot of catching up to do.However, I first need to go grocery shopping, get cash, have my mom's prescription processed and plan our weekly menu. I plan my menu to make sure we consume the things that may go bad sooner than the others. If I buy strawberries and apples, I make sure we eat the strawberries first. I process the fresh veggies within two days of bringing them home.We will be here till Monday 24th and on that date, we will be going to Izmir to my sister's.

This way, I am getting to know the public transportation better. It is really very inexpensive in Istanbul. Most rides are less than USD 0.50 and if you are going in one direction on multiple vehicles, the second and third rides in the same direction within 1 hour are discounted. So, if I take the Metro (subway-underground) to Kadıkoy, the ferry ride across the two continents is discounted. I can then take a tram to wherever and that will also be discounted. There is this thing called Istanbul Kart that I use exclusively for the public transportation. You can load money to the card in many places. It really is very convenient.Tomorrow, I will walk in the neighborhood. On Wednesday, I am going to visit a friend at Buyukada, one of the Prince's Islands. So, I will walk on the treadmill in the morning before showering and heading to the island.I am in the mood for visiting museums nowadays. The day before yesterday, I have visited the Isbank Museum.

{"title": "Bucket List Vacation and required modifications", "date": "Friday, May 31, 2019", "text": "For years I had been thinking of a solo road trip in the US from Thousand Islands to Key West. I had also been thinking about how much I loved the holiday season in the US and wanted to be there late October till early January one more time. A hybrid of these two separate vacation ideas is cooking.With these dreams, I did a lot of calculations over time and the costs of these two dreams turned out to be quiet high especially given that TL is very weak against US dollars lately. It was a lot more doable couple of years ago but then, I was working and I could not take so many days off. Well, life is all about tradeoffs right?During my visit last year my American friend whom I will call M, kept saying that I should go back for a long visit, stay with them and spend more time in the US with her and her family. I kept saying it would be difficult and very expensive and she kept saying I would have no accomodation costs, so what was the big deal? Honestly, despite the fact that we have been very close during the last 29 years, I was still hesitant about staying with them for so long. It was very sweet of her to offer this. We get along very well and have loads of fun together.Last year I was thinking that with the income I would bring through the part-time consulting gig, I would be mostly traveling. This year the economy is tanking and the potential customers are reluctant to spend money on consultants although common sense dictates otherwise. We do bring tons of efficiency and cost savings through our work.So, after much thinking and urging M to talk to her family about how they felt about a long visit and getting a positive confirmation, I have decided to take a long vacation which will involve a road trip in the US from the end of October till early January.I will be staying in upstate NY mostly but, I will take a solo road trip to Tampa FL and Charleston SC to visit two more friends. The one in Tampa was my mentor and cubicle friend whom I will call G, way back when I used to work for a Turkish-American JV in NY. The other was an HR person at the same company with whom we have become very good friends during the same time. I will call her P. Needless to say M and her husband E are also from the same company.Recently, I have been spending a lot of time to come up with the route plans, the hotels to stay and cars to rent. The worst budget buster in this trip will be Car Insurance. Since, I am a foreigner, I do not have an insurance coverage to take care of rentals.I will be spending 78 days in the US and am looking forward to it. As I make plans and reservations, I will share my experiences and how I plan to save money and still enjoy this huge, once in a lifetime vacation.When I look at the total amount of money I am budgeting to spend, it is overwhelming but, I have worked for more than 30 years and spent a lot more money on others such as my family member who went bankrupt and needed financial help, such as my cousins who wanted to sell their shares in the family home and etc. I think, I have deserved this and I should spend this money on myself.More posts to come on this topic.I have been home for the last few days and I got bored. So, when one of the bulbs in the bathroom went out and I couldn't find a suitable replacement among my spares, I dutifully went to Bauhaus (a hardware store), to look for a replacement bulb. As I was there, I also picked up a windshield sunshade. I thought I had one but, could not find it.Then I went to get bottled water and a couple of other small grocery items. Found my favorite hot sauce and grabbed a bottle.Came home, screwed the bulb in place and felt very accomplished. Haha! Retirement is funny. I hope, some consultancy work comes my way soon or else, I might even start deep cleaning the house. Today, I cleaned my kitchen counters and stove top despite the fact that the cleaning lady is coming over the weekend.I am hoping to go out for a long walk tomorrow if I can get up early. If not, treadmill it is.It is past midnight over here so, it is already tomorrow. Gotta go to bed! Hope, everyone has a good day/night!"},

Sweet!I downloaded the app and placed my order. I wasn't feeling like going anyway. I placed a little bigger order than I was originally planning so, I cooked a lot of stuff today, cooled them down, divided them into portion sizes and popped them in the freezer. I had cleaned up the freezer so, it was time to fill it yet again.I know the quality of the food is always good when they deliver. This store is right next to the store's HQ and that is where I shop most of the time. They carry the best and freshest stuff and avoid complaints like the plague. After all, the boss is right next door.I do my grocery shopping online only occasionally because, I like to go to the store and choose what look best. My shopping list would say vegetables or fruit but, I never specify anything before I see them in person. Online shopping requires you to make decisions without seeing the actual produce so, you are taking a chance.The only thing they brought which was not in great shape was the celery. It was Ok though. I used most of it for soup and the rest will go in a chicken salad tomorrow."},
{"title": "Screwed up Health System and Insurance Decisions", "date": "Tuesday, May 28, 2019", "text": "In the past, the health system was pretty good in this country but, the current government (idiots!) gradually and intentionally screwed it up to create this big mess during the last 17 years. It is still not as bad as the US but, slowly getting there.The Social Security system provides some basic care but, the co-pay has become pretty high if you go to private hospitals or private university hospitals which I prefer. As long as I have worked, the companies I worked for, provided a supplemental insurance with excellent coverage and 20% co-pay. Now that I am not working, I must take care of the supplemental insurance which is a higher cost for an individual as opposed to a company who buys these policies in bulk with a big discount.I have called the insurance broker and he is currently working on some alternatives for me. Sigh!This expense was built into my budget but I think, I have underestimated this. It is not a huge deal and I can certainly cover this expense. Still, it annoys me.I have updated my projection going forward.I sometimes think, what if the people of the world had decided to live in peace and stopped investing in stupid weapons and pour those resources into education and health. Wouldn't the world be a better place? May be we are past that point with so many people on Earth? I do not know. The only thing that I know for sure is people never take any lesson from the history and keep on doing the stupidest things.I like watching WWI and WWII documentaries. It is so sad how many people and mostly young people lost their lives for exactly what? So, so sad."},

We took the tram since, you need to go uphill for three tram stations. After my friend found what she was looking for and bought them, we walked to Sultanahmet to grab lunch. We were planning to go to the grand Bazaar when her husband called to say that their daughter's tests were over and they were ready to meet us.We told them to walk towards Sirkeci (where the Orient Express used to leave for Europe in the past). We walked down to Sirkeci and sat down at a patisserie. The four of us had a good time just chatting and joking. Their daughter was glad the stress was over so, she was happy. We fed her different kinds of pastries and ice cream. I did not touch any sweet stuff except for two teeny pieces of Turkish Delight served alongside my coffee.We then walked around some more to admire some newly renovated historic buildings and took a tram and a taxi cab to go pick their car. We then drove along the Bosphorus to go to a nice fish restaurant. The dinner was fabuluous and we spent a good deal of time there too. They dropped me at the ferry pier and I boarded a ferry to get back to Kadıkoy to pick up my car.I was out from 9:00 a.m. till 11:00 p.m. and walked 13197 steps.

The back streets are full of stores of anything and everything. My friend is into designing jewelry and she wants to find things that she can use. I hope, it will be a nice day without rain.The reason why she is coming to Istanbul is that her younger daughter is going to take an advanced German Language Exam at the Goethe Institute. The morning session is written and the afternoon session is spoken. She wants to go to College either in Germany or in Austria and passing this exam will mean she will not have to take a German Language Prep Class. She is a smart and hardworking kid and wants to study some type of engineering. Their older daughter is a Computer Engineer. My friend and her husband are both Electronics Engineers. Smart family! While my friend's husband waits for their daughter, we will go and have some fun.I have met her when I was stationed in NY many many years ago working for a Turkish-American JV Defense Company. For the first 7 months, I was the only female in the Turkish group stationed out there and her arrival was a welcome change. We had such a great time roaming the streets of The Village and other lively spots at night in NYC usually leaving the guys out :) We were not being mean to them. They would get tired, bored, sleepy etc. early and would want to head back. However, my friend I would be out tll 4-5 a.m. Young and brave times...Many people, including her dad had told me they thought it was so strange that we had become such close friends because,  our personalities were so different from each other. Yes, we are very different but, she is such a nice, level-headed and sweet person, it is impossible not to like her. I guess she saw something positive in me too and hence, we have been friends for the last 29 years.Today, I am getting my hair dyed to look nice in the loads of pictures, I am sure we will be taking tomorrow. My roots are in a sad state and I had been just being lazy about that. Once I go back to dyeing my hair next year, it will be so much easier. I am also planning to maintain a shorter hair next year once, I am done with this balayage thing.

One load is out and hung, another is in and I have three more to go.I am doing my best to keep my home tidy while I find that there are still stuff that needs to be given or thrown away.

Million more photos, very old appliance manuals which I no longer own, extremely old business card holders loaded with cards and hobby paints with brushes.It was easy to gather what needed to be trashed. I dumped all the photos on the table to sort. I think I have another box full of photos somewhere else. I need to dig that up and go through all the photos. Some are really old, from my parents'  to my grandparents' childhoods. This is not going to be a fast or easy task. My goal is to be done by Sunday and put away everything. It looked so overwhelming that I was tempted to put them all back in the box and leave them alone. Then, I just couldn't do it.I need to tidy up the kitchen and enjoy my coffee afterwards.

Mix really well by kneading and then shape into 1/4 inch patties, freeze them with parchment paper in between. I usually make a batch with 3 pounds of meat and consume 4 patties at a time. They last quiet a while. It is easy to take them out with the parchment paper in between without having to thaw them.I have decided to postpone the washing of the curtains. I can do that next weekend without having to rush."},

While I was at it, I looked at all the photos I handled and tossed more than I expected. They did not spark joy! (Hello Marie Kondo!)I also tossed three albums which were falling apart and put the photos I wanted to keep in a neat tin box just the perfect size to hold them. Never knew I had so many pictures prior to the digital era.This cleaning up, tossing stuff out and de-cluttering activity is making me feel really good. I am claiming a lot of space I did not know I could. It is also a good way to keep busy when the weather is not cooperating.Today is another windy and rainy day with low temperatures. So, I was on the treadmill. I listen to mystery stories on Librivox as I exercise. Sometimes I watch an episode of Grace and Frankie on Netflix. I have always loved Lily Tomlin and I have learnt to like Jane Fonda on this show. Today, I walked 2.7 miles in 45 minutes. Felt really good.Among today's chores are; two loads of laundry, changing the sheets on my bed and general picking up and tidying. The cleaning lady will come on Sunday so, when she comes, I will take down the curtains and wash them. I hang some of them back right after washing and some need to be dried horizontally to prevent sagging.I am also going to meet some friends at 2 p.m. on Sunday afternoon and I guess I should leave home an hour earlier. That will not leave me much time to wash all the curtains before I go. So, I will probably do some of it later at night or on Monday."},
{"title": "Frustrated (Venting ahead, beware!)", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2019", "text": "I don't understand why my weight fluctuates like the stock exchange. I am measuring and watching everything I eat and see the good results on one day on the scale and two days later, it looks like I have gained! Go figure! Is it water? But why? I am already drinking tons of water and watching my salt intake. I guess after 50, the body has a mind of it's own.I am not going to give up so fast this time. It is basic math. Energy in, energy out! Besides, the endocrinologist is waiting like a hawk to keep on trying to push me into bariatric surgery or Saxenda. No! If need be, I will rather change the doctor. My BMI is fluctuating around 40 so, yes some may consider that a bariatric surgery would be appropriate but, I know without changing your ways, it means nothing.Today, I pushed myself more on the treadmill and that felt good. So, I will keep at chipping off the pounds. When there is a will, there is a way.After all, I have gained all this weight in many many years and I was stupid not to control it when it would have been easier. I admit, I was wrong. However, even if I lose 10 kg per year (22 pounds), I will be done with my problem in three years. That is less than 1 kg per month. The key is to change my eating habits. I have to become a mindful eater and it takes a while for habits to develop.I understand that my problem was eating more carbs than necessary, even with healthy options, I was consuming large portions than I needed. If I were eating a normal portion of pasta, instead of the 1/3 of the Barilla box, I would not be in this position. I was eating big portions and I wasn't putting my mind into what I ate. I could eat pizza for lunch and pasta for dinner. You may get away with that at 15 but, at 52, no way! Also, when I felt down or bored or unhappy or angry, I would find myself in the fridge. I did not keep junk food in there but excessive amounts of even good stuff can make you gain.As I watch the TLC show, My 600 lb., I realize that I also have some issues I must deal with. Thankfully, I have never been abused or assaulted in my life but, I had some relationships in which things did not work out as I hoped. Things I thought I had forgotten surface from time to time and I must deal with them. I have decided to go through some old photo albums and get rid of some photos which I could not part with in the past. I thought they were a part of my life at one time and I have held on to them. I am thinking that, getting rid of them will make me feel better. There are a couple of things gifted to me. I will get rid of them as well. Yes, they were a part of my past but, they did not bring me happiness after all.So, there! I have come up with tomorrow's chore.I dwell on the past too much. I should look ahead and enjoy myself. What could have been or should have been, did not happen. So, why?There! I got this off my chest. It is almost bed time so, I need to sign off now."},

I knew that I had those documents but, it has been years since I had looked at them.Upon digging further, look what I have found:These AAA TourBooks are from last century, 1991-1992. They are in mint condition (who cares?).I immediately thought of putting them in the re-cycling bin, but since I will be traveling from upstate NY to Floria and back in November, I can make use of the parts where they talk about each city on my way to and from. I have decided to keep them.I also found the following which I will definitely be keeping. They are also from 1990-1993 with the exception of Phantom of the Opera which is from December 1999. Forgot to take a picture of Miss Saigon Playbill. Been to Cats twice.These things brought back many great and bittersweet memories and I got quiet emotional as I type this while listening to the thunderstorm outside. It is one of those days when you want to curl up with a blanket and hot cocoa by the window. I think, I will do just that.I have also dug out several souvenir books and Museum Guides from the places I have been to both in Europe and in the US. They will no longer be in hiding. I will pack some books I have read, in the boxes and put them away, making room for this stuff on the upper, open shelves of my library so that, I will remember to pull one out and enjoy.from time to time.Off I go to make my cocoa... Enjoy your weekend! Here is a video of Barbara Streisand who according to me is the best singer who sang \"Memory\".UPDATE: After the thunderstorm, it is now beautiful and sunny with a gorgeous blue sky...

There may be some extra stuff I will not be consuming due to my diet. I can give those away or take them to my sister's when I am going to visit them in June. The plan is for them to take my mom with them to Izmir early June. I will be joining them in Izmir and the four of us will spend some time together.I will be giving away all the herbal tea I have to a friend. The doctor told me to drink plenty of water, reasonable amount of tea and coffee and to stay away from the herbal teas and sodas. Not a problem. My habit is quiet like that actually. I will go in for another control in 6 months before my big vacation in the US.Yesterday I dug out more old paperwork and I am in the process of going through all of them. I am sure there is plenty to be trashed.I found my grandfather's diploma from medical school. He was born in 1900 and graduated medical school in Istanbul in 1926. He then went to Vienna to further study medicine and I found the documents appointing him to Internal Medicine Department in some Austrian Hospital. I will check whether the hospital is still there. He spent a good deal of time abroad and returned to Turkey in 1936, married my grandmother, had three kids and passed away in 1949 due to kidney failure. My father was only 9 then. Sometimes I think about how different it could have been if he had lived longer. My dad passed away at the age of 54 due to a different condition. Sigh...Hope, everyone has a nice weekend!"},

When this happens, the summer comes with a vengeance and it gets to be very hot. Good thing that my apartment is usually cool and even on hot days, I can get by with a fan. I have no A/C and it would cause a lot of inconvenience to install one.Thankfully, what started as an overcast day became warm and sunny today. I went out to get my electricity subscription for the apartment in Ankara cancelled. They told me I would be getting a refund on the subscription fee. Then I sent the signed rent agreement back to the real estate agent. With the economy this bad, I sort of knew that it wouldn't be sold but, at least now it is generating a little income instead of sucking maintenance fees.I remembered that I ran out of bread, onions, yogurt and tomatoes. So, I went into the grocery store to get them. Came home, made a cup of coffee and enjoyed my dates and walnuts with that.As I type this I am watching a stupid Turkish Reality show on TV. Some people are plain idiots and unfortunately, they elope at young ages to get married r to live together, have multiple kids they cannot take care of, cheat on their spouses (with multiple people) and cause all sorts of trouble. The kids' lives are ruined forever. Ugh!I used to have a hobby box from way back. I will dig it out to see what is in there. I want something to keep me busy during the day. Not having to work is nice but boring. There is also a project that I had been thinking about for a long time. It is about designing a training on contract management. I have lots of information, sample contracts and books scattered around. I should also pull them together, brush up my outline and get started. However, it is a serious project. What I need now is a bit of a fun thing.Today, Expedia offered me a discount on my stay in Tampa Florida in November. Same hotel, same dates. It was USD 50 better for my 5 day stay and I took it. Nice! Canceled the other reservation.It will be a long road trip from upstate NY to Tampa FL and back. I will be breaking the driving so that I will not drive more than 6 hours which is tolerable for me each day."},
{"title": "Pocketbooks / Handbags / Purses", "date": "Tuesday, May 7, 2019", "text": "Gill, over at That British Woman had a recent blogpost \"What do you call this:\"and that inspired my blogpost title today!I have called these things handbags for years because that was the first dialogue in my First Things First Book by L.G. Alexander when I started learning English in 1977. Happy memories...Then having spent too much time in NYC area, I started calling them pocketbooks and meanwhile I knew that they were also called purses. Oh boy!Anyway, as I have mentioned yesterday, I have looked at the bags I had on hand and decided to offer three really nice ones to my sister.I am keeping one nice looking fairly new, barely used Anne Klein bag for myself along with most of the small bags that I know I use. Most of them are from T.J Maxx or Marshalls and some are brand names like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren , Etienne Aigner and etc. I am sure I have purchased them well below USD 30.I am going to offer the cleaning lady four bags. One has never been used and real suede, quiet beautiful. It is not something my sister would use. She is very particular about bags that she likes.I am keeping two bags for sentimental reasons. One was a gift from my dad from a business trip from Germany over 35 years ago. It is rather small so, I never used it very much. That is why it still looks new. The other is a gift from mom, a nice leather bag that I want to keep.A lot of women would change their bags in accordance with what they are going to wear the next day. I am not one of them. I have currently been using a small backpack for months now and my sister made fun of it when we were all together recently. She teased me saying that I was using a 5 buck backpack and at my age wasn't that kind of embarassing! I told her to shut up because I was also wearing 180 buck (new Balance 990s never come cheap) athletic shoes with it. Lol! Actually with today's exchange rate, that bag is well below 5 bucks...After sorting through the handbags, I have decided that I am not buying any more for at least 5 years. If I rotate what I own well, there is no reason to buy a new one. If I keep on using the 5 buck backpack till it falls apart, make that 10 years!Yesterday was a nice, warm day and today it looks like winter is back. If someone says there is no such thing as global warming I will strike him on the mouth with my slipper (idioms sound pathetic when translated).I am still in a de-cluttering mode though, I am not seriously doing anything about it. Today I was thinking of my procrastination and my inner voice said: \"Check out the pocketbooks!\" Yep! That is definitely an area that needs attention.What are the odds of using a bag that I haven't used in 5+ years? Minus 5 may be?So, I will tackle that this week and set aside all the bags that I would like to give away. I will offer them to the cleaning lady and she can take all of them if she wants. Let's see how many I can get rid of.Next on my list are the shoes and slippers. That closet is in real bad shape.Today, I had dinner with two good friends from my consulting work. It was supposed to be a happy night but, there is some political turmoil and the so called president who is a dictator wanna-be is pouring gas over the fire. I don't even want to think about it. All I can say is I hate the current government and hope they all drop dead like.... right now!"},

The best motivation to lose weight is to lose weight. To me anyway:)I also went out and had lunch with a friend I have not seen in quiet a while. We had lots of catching up to do. I had steamed vegetables and a small grilled chicken breast.After I left my friend, I went to a farmer's market but, forgot to get cash from an ATM. When I opened my wallet, I realized that I had very little money. I asked around, but there were no ATMs within a reasonable distance.I was able to buy the following with what I had in my wallet:2 pounds of cucumbers1 bundle green onions1 bunch of dill weed2 bunches of parsley1 bunch of purslane2 pounds of fresh fava beans1 pound of strawberries1 pound of green peppersAfter mentally kicking myself, I woved to stash a large TL bill in my cell phone wallet just in case. I used to do it but, I must have spent the money and forgot to stick another bill in there.Then I went to the grocery store to get meat, cheese, bulgur wheat, sundried tomatoes and salad greens. I was gonna get tomatoes too, but the quality of those were not comparable to the ones in the farmer's market. Bummer! Well, there is always next week.I was famished when I got back home so, I fixed a quick dinner and had some fresh strawberries afterwards.I think, I am all set for this week grocerywise. I have also started to track my spending this month.Here is my food plan for the week:Today's Lunch: Chick Peas and Bulgur PilafToday's Dinner: Lunch Meat on a SaladMonday Lunch: Green beans in olive oil and a purslane salad with yogurtDinner: Out with friendsTuesday Lunch: Fresh fava beans in olive oil and purslane salad with yogurtDinner: My version of a TaboulehWednesday Lunch: Fresh Fava Beans in olive oilDinner: Meat patties I had made and frozen and a saladThursday Lunch: Green salad with Tuna on topDinner: Stuffed peppers and a saladFriday Lunch: LeftoversDinner: Out with friends (most likely grilled fish and salad)I do not have plans for the weekend yet.

Told them I would be back before 7 p.m. when they close.I walked down to the main street and hopped on a bus, got off at the nearest Metro (subway) station to go down to Kadikoy. It is a busy area and walking is a bit of a chore but, I did walk around quiet a bit, looked at some old book sellers, sat down for a cup of Turkish coffee and walk some more. Next time, I will go down there either for lunch or dinner. The fish market is great and there are good but inexpensive restaurants.I hopped on the Metro again. I had to walk to the intersection to get another bus because the road was one way coming back. That was another longish stretch of walk. I made it back to the main street and went back to the Pharmacy where I sat down a bit because, I was totally exhausted since I had to climb up the hill. I came home feeling very proud of myself for having walked 8800 steps.I want to be able to walk 10,000 steps all at once and not feel exhausted at all. That is my goal. I think, if I keep on like this, I can do that by mid-summer. My muscles feel strong and my legs definitely want to move. Using public transport helps with the arm muscles too if you are standing because, in the crazy traffic, you can never anticipate when the driver will step on the brakes or the gas pedal. You need to hold on well. Crazy!Tomorrow, I am going to meet a friend at noon and will go to the farmer's market later on. I am planning to walk tomorrow too but, I will walk less because the dietician warned me against upping exercise too quickly.I hope everyone has a nice weekend!"},

Mom wanted to keep her father's home in the family so, I took over the payment of this loan. The family home was collateral.The good news is, I made another payment today and there are only 4 more payments to go. Yay me! It was a 48 month loan and I will have paid 34 of them come September. The first 14 were already paid before I have taken it over. I cannot wait to wipe the entire sheet dedicated to that in my Excel file. I will talk about how I use an Excel file for tracking my finances and other important aspects in my life in a separate post.The Real Estate Agent called me today and told me a couple who will be married soon is interested in renting my apartment. They were asking for a price cut but were willing to make a full year's rent all at once. Weird, but OK. I did the math and it still makes sense. I just need to draw up the contract such that, if they want to go on a monthly basis next year, we should understand that the increase will have to be a different percentage. Inflation is quiet high so, I have to be careful.Anyway, I do not know if this tenant will decide to rent my apartment or not till tomorrow. I really wish, it could rather be sold but, whatever...I fell of the weight loss vagon last week when I was in Ankara and I was scared to weigh myself. Today, I plucked up courage and weighed myself. No gain! I thought, I gained but, I did not! I am back on track now and I did quiet well today. Not only watched what I ate but also, walked for over a half hour. If the weather permits, I will walk more tomorrow. Thinking back, I did not make bad choices bur, ate a bit more than I should have.I printed a page of weight loss inspiration and a cartoon of Dr. Nowzaradan and put both sheets up on my fridge. Lol!Since there is not much work in the horizon, this year will be my year to take care of myself and have a nice long vacation (Bucket List #1). Next year may be different who knows?"},

Her cleaning lady can no longer come because, apparently she and her husband had been divorced due to some financial issues but kept living together. She has two young daughters. As I understand, the ex-husband had promised to re-marry her after the financial things got sorted out but, he did not keep his promise. So, her brothers came and took her with them to the village they were from. I understand that her mom needs to be looked after and the brothers want her to look after the mom. The poor woman is separated from her home and her kids. She tried escaping back to re-unite with her children but, her ex threatened her that he would spread bad rumors about her and that her brothers would hear that too. He is probably seeing someone else. Some people... Sigh...I found two young cleaning ladies through a friend of mine. They come together and instead of staying for the day, they are done within 4 hours. Last wednesday, they came for the first time. Mom liked them and I hope, they liked mom too. I told them, we would pay for their services even if mom is not home so, we want them to keep the half day every two weeks on Mondays. We will see...I took her and my sister's FIL to the cardiologist. I also saw the cardiologist and my eye doctor. I am happy to report that everything is OK.

Take duct tape for instance; you can fix things, strengthen things, bind people (don't!) etc.Today I fixed a garment bag with duct tape. Now it is stronger than before and I can get many uses out of it. It is something easy and cheap to replace but, why? Two inches of duct tape fixed it really well. Frugal, easy, environmentalist... Right?I have a cheap bag I had bought for USD 20 from Chinatown in NYC. It has zippers to make it bigger or smaller. I have one good quality big suitcase and an OK midsize one. When I go to the US for an extended period I need two big pieces. I use the midsize when I travel for a week or so in the country. Instead of buying another large suitcase for which, I have no storage space, I use the cheap bag which can be folded for easy storage but, it was worn out at the bottom. Less than a yard of duct tape and voila! Better than new! The fix is inside so, it doesn't look funny but, even if it did, who cares?I am sure you all know the suitcase wrapping service at the airports. Don't you think, they are outrageously priced? I do. My suitcase does not need wrapping but the cheap bag mentioned above would be better off wrapped. What do I do? I wrap it at home with a box or two of cling wrap after I am done stuffing it. The closure is at the top so I forgo that part just in case, they want to open it and look inside. Even if I use two boxes of the cling wrap, it is still much cheaper. Yes, I like to take vacations in the US, but I do not like to spend money having my bags wrapped.I use four hooks and a few yards of laundry line to hang my laundry indoors in my corridor. The hooks get attached to the doors.  I need this contraption when I wash the bed linens. I use a drying rack for most other things. This line which I can put up and take down easily holds at least two sheets, four pillow cases and a couple of towels. When I am done, I just take it down. I never owned a dryer and have no space for it. So, line drying is my only option. Living in an apartment in a nice neighborhood makes it impossible to hang laundry even in the balcony. One needs to be creative.I have cut up some old sheets which had holes and tears into a few 1 and 1.5 yard squares and sew all around them. I use these sheets to place my clothing items and other necessities snuggly in the suitcases. One could hold all my underwear, another would hold t-shirts and sweathsirts, etc. They keep my stuff clean and even if the suitcase is damaged somehow, my clothes will not be sticking out.I use thick elastic bands that are used to tie broccoli, for extra grip when opening jars. I keep a couple in my utensil drawer just in case.I am always looking for things that are simple and handy. Any tips and tricks you may want to share?"},
{"title": "Exercise, Motivation, Eating Disorders... Long Post Beware!", "date": "Friday, April 19, 2019", "text": "I have been told to walk for 40-45 minutes twice a week and keep a generally active lifestyle. So those 40 minute walks are supposed to be sweaty. Rest of the time, I should walk in a normal window shopping pace.I have added some very basic weight lifting 3-4 times a day to this. The weights I use are only 1 kg ea. just a bit over two pounds. I only want to tone my arms a little bit and build some strength.The other day, the therapist buzzed me in and watch me climb the 20-25 steps. She said, I did well without stopping or slowing down so, my muscles must be in shape. That observation made me happy and even more motivated.This was a 1-1 session since the rest of the group did not show up. As we talked, she told me if I had seen the movie \"To The Bone\". I did not so, she told me to watch it and tell her what I thought about it the next session. The movie is on Netflix in Turkey, so I watched it. It is about an anorexia patient with a dysfunctional family. She could only see the calories and could not make herself eat. I just cannot believe how hunger, taste and smell of food are not enticing. She just cannot bring herself to eat even a little bit. The actress had lost a lot of weight during the filming and she looked pretty horrid.I also keep watching the \"My 600 lb. Life\" series which is on TV. Those people are constant eaters and they eat all sorts of unhealthy food. Fried, packaged food, candy bars, potato chips, tons of sugar laden soda all day long... They are also very dependent on others who enable them. I cannot quiet associate with them either. A lot of them had been sexually abused or bullied as kids or have dysfunctional families.I cannot say I do not have an eating disorder. I do. It is just different than the anorexia patients and morbidly obese.I  do not believe that you need deep issues to have an eating disorder. I am happy with my life. I would change probably just a handful of things if I could start over. I do know, I have an unhealthy relationship with food though. I am a mindless eater. Don't need to be hungry to eat. Who needs to be hungry to eat cheesecake? Stress and deadlines make me eat because, it is a part of procrastination. Boredom also makes me eat. I also like different tastes and generally love food. Good things in life are also associated with food. Birthdays, Holidays, outings with friends, celebrations of all kinds.The other day I posted that I am not buying anything unnecessary and this is now something I do without even thinking. In the past I could have bought something just because... My relationship with shopping has now matured. I want the same maturity with my relationship with food. I want to make healthy choices and control my portions without thinking. I made healthy choices partially in the past. I could eat a nice healthy lunch and then I would have a piece of cheesecake with coffee. I could eat something high in calorie with my coffee every day without thinking. I want to be able to say \"no\" to that cheesecake and instead reach for a small piece of fruit or just have that coffee and be content with that.People on diets think: \"So, even when I lose the weight, won't I be able to eat cheesecake?\" I do not know the answer to that. It can be \"You can eat 1/3 of a commercial portion every once in a while\" or it can be \"Cheesecake is poison, noone should be touching it\". I just don't know the answer to that and may be that answer is different for different people. Everybody has a different way of coping with a variety of problems.For instance, when I start not weighing myself, I gain weight. When you are trying to lose weight, they tell you not to weigh yourself too frequently. That doesn't work for me. I know the weight will not go down on a steady pace. There will be ups and downs. Actually, right now I am in that position. It has been 8 days since I have weighed in at the dietician and I haven't yet lost a single pound. That is only natural. May be I did not drink enough water, may be I ate too much salt, may be I did not go to the bathroom. However, I have to track my weight every two days or so and mark it on my Excel sheet. I need to feel that I am in control. I was discussing this with my sister and she is the opposite.My weight loss journey will not be a short one. I just do not want to think about how long it will be. I also do not want to set a goal that is too far away. I need to see reaching smaller goals to keep on being motivated. I have no ideal weight that I have set for myself. The BMI Index tells you that. Now, I am not concerned about that. Baby steps are just fine.Wishing everyone a very nice weekend! It is still cold in here. I hope, May will be nicer."},

I like cooking but, not cleaning up the kitchen. I do not mind laundry and folding. I do not like emptying the dishwasher. There is nothing I like to do. Is it just me? Or do people generally feel like that but, do the chores anyway?Yesterday I wanted to have fish for dinner and instead of buying something and cooking at home, I went to a small fish place and had a fish soup and a sea bass. No matter how you cook, the fish stinks the apartment. Sometimes I do not mind it, sometimes I do.When I was done with dinner, it was 8 p.m. so, I decided to do my grocery shopping. I needed only a few items to get by till Sunday when I am leaving for Ankara for a week.I bought some boneless beef shank and frozen string beans. It was almost 9:30 p.m. by the time I got back home but, I cooked both items in the pressure cooker. I have all my lunches and dinners I need till Sunday. You see, I am not lazy when it comes to cooking.As I type this, a load of laundry is in the washer so, all good in that department. The kitchen needs cleaning up due to the cooking yesterday. I will get that done today although I really do not feel like it.My apartment has central heating and since, it is still cold, the heat is on. Once they turn off the central heating; I have to take down all the curtains and wash them. My curtains are wall to wall and ceiling to floor. There are tulle curtains and underneath the tulles, there are light blocking curtains. Taking them down, washing them and putting them up usually takes two days. That is a task I dread yet, needs to be done due to my allergies.Change of seasons always require more housework. Sigh..."},
{"title": "Not one item of clothing since October", "date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2019", "text": "I just realized that I haven't bought one single item of clothing since October 2018. I have only purchased a pair of shoes and a pair of slippers.Wow!This was not intentional at all. I just did not need anything. So, I congratulate myself for having self control when there is no real need for something.I also haven't purchased anything that can be considered a decorative item, or any linens and towels (my biggest weakness) in a very very long time. Yay me!It seems like, I now know what is a want and what is a need without conciously thinking about it. I hope this habit will rub on to my eating.I mostly spend my money on groceries, utilities and maintenance fees on the real estate and gas. I consider the cell phone, Internet and TV a part of utilities. For me the most important thing is to be able to travel and take long vacations.This week, I am looking at my wardrobe to see if there is anything I can give my sister or get rid of. There are a couple of summer dresses, I would like to give my sister. I haven't worn them at all since they have shrunk after I washed them. My sister can wear them to the beach if she likes.I also need to organize my wardrobe a little bit. It is one giant mess these days. However, I will not dump everything on the bed like Marie Kondo suggests. I am lazy and I easily get bored doing something like that. It would be a disaster.I will however, handle the mess, section by section."},

The work has been slow but, it did generate some small income so far.The owner of the consulting company is also now a friend and she was looking very stressed yesterday. When I inquired about her, she told me the business was not doing too well. The country is in a crisis due to incompetency of the current Government along with many other things. She told me there are no new projects in the horizon so, I should be prepared to not receiving any income in the coming months. I told her that it was OK and my sustenance does not depend on the income from the project work. She felt a bit relieved upon this assurance. However, having to make this conversation with every other team mate will probably be very difficult for her.I really like her so, I hope this stress will not wear her out so much.On the other hand, I was kind of relieved too since, I had been having trouble concentrating on work lately. I do not know why but, going to work every day is one thing and working without a schedule is another. Besides, this last project was so up in the air that it stressed me out. We did not follow the usual steps in the anaysis, and had to rely on very little information due to some customer budget constraints and I have not felt comfortable with designing processes in such a situation.I still would like to be able to generate some additional income but, if it is not going to be possible in the near future, I am OK with that. Being a frugal person, I can make my income work especially after September when I will finally get rid of the loan I had taken over from my uncle.Renting or selling the apartment in Ankara will also help.Life happens..."},

In case you do not know what it is; here is a picture:I bought two very big bunches with the roots still intact. It is very messy and you need to wash it several times to get rid of the soil. I cut off the roots and washed it real well. I then sauteed an onion and a couple of tomatoes, cut up the purslane and added to that. Since the vegetable is very watery, it doesn't need any added water. This cooked on the stove for about 20 minutes to get rid of all the liquid. Two big bunches make just one and a half portion vegetable! I love this but, the washing and the small yield just kills me. I have both the purslane and the eggplants with plain yogurt. I sometimes add crushed garlic, mint leaves and red pepper flakes to the yogurt.All that effort and I have 4 portions of vegetables! Whatever...Today I met a friend for a cup of coffee and a stroll. After I dropped her at her apartment, I went to my favorite fish place and had a salad with sea bream for lunch. It was yummy and I did not have to cook it myself and make the house stink.Now, I have some work to do. Hope, everyone is having a nice weekend."},

I know I have slipped a bit lately and I know, it could have been 14-15 pounds but, this is good too.I will try harder this month. Feeling very motivated.I would like to share what I have learnt so far:- Water intake is the key. 8 glasses of water is not enough. 10-12 works wonders.- Eating after 7:30 p.m. is bad. If you cannot go to bed hungry, a small cup of yogurt with a sprinkle of cinnamon is a good idea.- Pineapple, Kiwi, Berries help accelerating weight loss provided that you control your portions. 2 thinnish slices of pineapple, 1 Kiwi, 10-12 Strawberries are a portion- If you do not consume enough calcium, weight loss is harder. So, consuming two portions of plain yogurt is in my diet.- If you are on the road, if you cannot drink enough water, do not weigh yourself because the body will retain water and you will be disappointed. Go back to drinking plenty of water for a few days and then weigh yourself.I am hoping that this time I will do it, do it well and not gain weight back.I am going to meet a friend for lunch and I think I will even put on make-up since, this is a special day.I wish everyone a great weekend, beautiful spring days and lots of happy things to happen!"},
{"title": "Real Estate ", "date": "Thursday, April 11, 2019", "text": "Lately, I have been thinking about the real estate I own: Three apartments and 2/3 of a small house with a small garden. I actually have no use for any of them except for the apartment I live in Istanbul.My uncle and my mom had bought one of the apartments and when my uncle's business problems got worse, I bought it from him to make sure he does not lose it. So, that is my uncle's primary residence and it has to stay. I have 69 more months of mortgage on that. My sister asked if she can make the payments from now on since he is her uncle too and I refused that. It was my decision and I live with it. I told her to pay for upcoming repairs and furniture needs instead. She can also chip in for the repair of the small house.The small house was left to my mom and two uncles by my grandpa. With the consent of his siblings the uncle whose business finally went bankrupt has taken a loan against it. I have taken over the loan from him and have made 35 of the 48 payments and that is a lot of money for me every month. Thankfully only 5 months are left and I will be done with that in September. That house had been put on market several times and did not sell. Besides mom wants to keep it in the family. It needs a real makeover. I own my uncle's share and I recently bought my cousins' shares since they needed money. 1/3 is owned by my mom.The two bedroom apartment in Ankara was rented but, during the last 7 months, it has been vacant. Nobody has a say on this one so, I finally made up my mind and called the real estate agent today to say that I will be instructing a contractor to make some repairs and I also want it to be listed not only as For Rent but, For Sale as well. It's value hasn't appreciated but, if it is sold at the price I have specified, I will not lose money. I am not telling my family till it gets either rented or sold. Not may be even then.I like to be liquid and am feeling very stuck with all this real estate nonsense. It is not like I do not have savings but, still it is too much real estate for someone who lives alone and has no kids. If I drop dead today, everything goes to my 77 year old mother and 45 year old sister who has an autoimmune condition. I wish her a healthy and loooong life. She is my baby.Surprisingly the pap smear result came today. I thought it would take a week. Thankfully, it is normal.I had the kidney ultrasound today and that is also fine. So, the BP probably needs different meds, exercise, weight loss and less salt.I am going to measure my BP at the same time twice a day and report it to the nephrologist on April 29th. This morning it was quite tame; 111/80. I just measured it 10 minutes ago and it is fine again: 109/85. Hope, it continues like this. The doctor doubled the dose of one of the meds I am taking and it is too early to feel it's effect yet.Last Thursday and Friday it was around 130/100, 140/105 etc...May be all these doctor appointments were making me nervous without me realizing it. I don't know.Today, I went to my first ever group theraphy session. There was one lady who had bariatric surgery, the psychiatrist and my endochrinologist. Today, it was mostly about getting to know each other."},

He is not alarmed about my kidney functions but ordered another urine test and an ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow. He will follow up on my BP and hopefully fix it. He also told me to see a gynecologist since, those off numbers might perhaps be due to something down there.I do not have a gynecologist since I have been avoiding them like the plague during the last... many years? I inquired if I could see someone there and they had a slot with a young nice guy right then. So, I had that awful exam and a pap smear. He doesn't think there is anything wrong and I will have the results of the pap test next week. I am so glad, this is out of the way. I do not know if I am weird but, I prefer men for gynecologists over women. They are a lot more gentle.On 26th of April I have my routine Cardio and Eye appointments. My goodness!I am looking to get my BP under control and be done with all these doctor visits."},

I rested a couple of hours and let them do the rest of the driving to Antalya another 6+ hours.My mom and uncle were expecting them but, not me. We had decided to surprise them and spend the weekend together to celebrate my sister's 45th birthday which is actually today. So, I let the kids (yeah we call a 45 year old and a 47 year old, kids) enter the apartment and hug and kiss mom. Then, my sister turned around and re-opened the door to let me in. Mom was very happy to see me. She came forward, hugged and kissed me and started to tell something... And then, she was completely out of it. She could not speak. We sat her down and my uncle ran for his BP monitor and mom was silent for I'd say, a good 3-4 minutes. Then she slowly started to make gestures and tried to say she was OK. We were all so scared!She fully recovered in 10 minutes or so and said that she was very surprised and excited on seeing me. Mind you, we've spent a whole three and a half months together just before and after the New Year. We talk to each other every day, sometimes twice. It's not like I am the estranged daughter living in Australia for the last 30 years who just came back...We decided never to surprise her from now on. I guess as people get old, they react to the same things differently. Normally, my mom is well.... was cool as a cucumber.Anyway, the next day, the four of us went sightseeing and my uncle stayed behind to prepare us a great feast. I did not kill my diet entirely. I was very careful and may be I ate more than I should but, selected wisely.We went by the sea and we all (not mom) had our swimsuits so, we decided to open the swimming season of 2019. The weather was 60 degrees and the Mediterranean was about 62-64 so, yes we, the crazy people went in for over 20 minutes and had a great time in very cold water. It was good though. Mom sipped her tea and watched us have fun.Yesterday, we drove back from Antalya to Izmir and today, I drove back to Istanbul.It was a crazy weekend...Now, I think I should write \"Never surprise mom again!\" 500 times."},

I am so glad, I did.Now that I am home most of the time, I use my home Internet over Wi-Fi and whenever I am out and about, I give restricted access to only a handful apps to use data. Facebook, Whatsapp, GoogleMaps and Chrome. So, nothing else can download updates or do any other funny stuff with the data unless there is Wi-Fi.I am going to download a couple of audiobooks for tomorrow's trip.This plan suits me just fine. I have saved a bundle of money.Yesterday, I was going to have both lunch and dinner out but my lunch was cancelled. So, that helped a lot. I woke up late and decided to wait until lunch time to eat a two egg omelette with cheese and dillweed. I also cut up some tomatoes. For dinner, I chose grilled chicken breasts and grilled vegetables. They were a bit on the oily side but since, I ate no bread the whole day, I guess caloriewise, I did well. Snacked on three dates. Had two cups of coffee with milk.Today, I am going to do another three mile workout. I got up late and will again wait for lunch tiem to eat. I am not hungry anyway.Lunch is a Shepherd Salad with a can of tuna. Here is how we make Shepherd Salad:TomatoesCucumbersSweet PeppersOnionParsleyEVOO and lemon juice for dressingSlice the onions, cut the other veggies in small bite sizes (I like them really small but that is not necessary, whatever you like) add chopped parsley and a mixture of olive oil and lemon juice. I use olive oil very sparingly these days but, if you do not have weight problems, you can add more. It is healthy.Tomorrow, I am going to Izmir and then my sister and BIL will go to Antalya for the weekend. Monday is my baby sister's 45th birthday. Mom and uncle do not know I am going too. So, it will be a surprise.Antalya will be less than 20 degrees Celsius (mid 60's F) so, although my sistre wants to go to the beach and and take the first dip in the water, I am not sure. We may try. We love cold water and most people think we are crazy :)In terms of my diet, It will be testing to be with the family during the weekend.

I have been told to exercise 40-45 mnutes 3 times a week. So far, I was only able to get barely past 30 minutes on the treadmill.I looked up some home walking videos and tried to do them last week.Today, I have decided to challenge myself to a 3 mile walking workout by Leslie Sansone. It was a 46 minute program and boy was it hard! Even so, taking it easy with some movements but always keeping up with the pace, I did it! I wasn't expecting to finish it and thought of stopping 3-4 times but, held on to it.I am so proud of myself. I know tomorrow, I will be a bit achy but, I think it is worth it.So, now every other day, I will try to do this ecercise and in between do some stretching, use elastic bands and do some basic Tai-Chi moves. I think, YouTube is the best we site for this type of stuff.I actually own some Leslie Sansone DVDs but, my DVD player is dead (confirmed today) and placed by the door to be taken to the re-cycling box on my way out of the building.My laptop does not have a CD/DVD drive anymore. Buying an external one is an inexpensive option but, I am in no rush really."},

I always knew I had a problem with portion sizes rather than eating junk food and sweets. Now that I am measuring everything I put on my plate, I believe, I must have been eating like a monster. Especially when it comes to pasta, I was eating way too much. Well, now I don't eat any. I have insulin resistance and I am not supposed to eat any pasta, anything that has white flour, rice, potatoes etc. The only thing I am allowed is bulgur pilaf and only sparingly.I could not go to my control appointment due to work. My next appointment with the dietician is going to be on April 10th or 11th. I should be able to weigh 12 pounds less. I think, 4-5 pounds of that must have been water retention, but still, it is great progress. I am almost down 9 pounds now.Today, I had another two egg omelette with cheese and dillweed along with some cherry tomatoes. For lunch I had brussel sprouts, yogurt and two slices of organic whole wheat bread.For a snack, I had coffee with milk and three dates. Dates are full of fiber and satisfy the need for something alongside coffee.For dinner, I am having half a fillet of a sea bream with salad. The other half is for tomorrow. In the past I would have eaten the whole fish.Now, I have to walk on the treadmill for a half hour and take a shower. I have some work to do before and after dinner.I have two social gatherings this week; one lunch with ex-boss and office assistant and, dinner with old HS buddies. Both on the same day! Yikes! I have to survive eating out while on a diet or else, I will need to give up outings which would really be upsetting.Got up late today. Didn't feel like doing anything much so, I just chilled. Then I took a nice long shower, dressed and went to meet an old colleague and his wife for dinner. We had a very nice time and I stuck to my diet. Yay me!Tomorrow, I will go vote and grab a couple of things from the grocery store. I guess, I am not very good in planning my shopping. There is always something I forget. I also do not buy in multiples. That is stupid so, tomorrow, I will get multiple items that I consume all the time. There is a kind of cottage cheese that I am eating these days since the white cheese is salty and I am having BP problems again. I will also buy more of the dried apricots and dates. I have 3 apricots or dates every day with my afternoon tea/coffee.It was very cold and windy today but, looks like it will gradually warm up a bit in a week.Hope, everyone is having a nice and relaxing weekend."},

{"title": "Frugality and a Healthy Diet", "date": "Thursday, March 21, 2019", "text": "A lot of people are concerned that a healthy diet might be very expensive. I do not know if that is true in other countries but, in here it is not expensive at all.First of all, I do not eat outside as much as I used to. That is a big savings. I guess some people in other countries might have access to Dollar Menus at McDs and stuff like that but, I normally did not eat fast food at all. So, if I eat even a salad in a regular restaurant, that is a lot of money. I am picky about the places I eat because of hygiene reasons. I buy a whole package of salad greens and two pounds of tomatoes for the price of a salad at a restaurant. Those will last me a whole week.Second, portion control keeps you from eating too much anyway. A good steak is expensive. Normally, I would eat the whole big piece in one sitting. However, I now have to cut that in half for portion control. I also use red meat sparingly for a heart healthy diet and that helps with the costs. I use only EVOO in my cooking and that is expensive too. However, now I have to measure how much I use. I use probably a third of what I would normally use. There you go again.There are lots of produce that I need to buy. I buy seasonal items with the exception of tomatoes and cucumbers to keep the costs down. I can eat only one portion of fruit and I eat seasonal fruits.I eat all sorts of beans and they are very inexpensive especially, if you buy them dry. Soaking them overnight is no hassle.I normally consume a lot of cheese bu,t with the diet you can only eat controlled portions.Here is what I have in my diet:Whole wheat bread (limited number of slices)Lean cuts of meat, fish, poultry (the size of the palm of my hand, my pinky thick)Salad, lots of salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots...VegetablesCheese (we have a feta like white cheese not as sharp)Plain Yogurt (1 cup per day)Milk (max. 1.5 cups per day)Fruit (sparingly, medium orange, apple etc.)WaterCoffeeFor me, diet soda is a treat. I allow myself to have a maximum of 3 cans per week. Not more. Artificial sweeteners are not good so, I keep away.There aren't any exotic specific ingredients in my above list. Very basic stuff. So, this eating plan also keeps my budget at a minimum. Win-win in my book!"},

Instead I walk for about 20 minutes and then do some exercises with an elastic band.I am hoping that I will keep up with this. For inspiration, I am watching the TLC show where some of the patients lose 90-100 pounds before the bariatric surgery. I am not anywhere morbidly obese like that but these people have the worst eating habits. I already have better eating habits so, with portion control and a little effort, I should be able to drop a good deal of weight.I am going on my BIG VACATION late October. Until then, I would like to lose at least 26 pounds.I made an Excel Chart so that I can motivate myself. Visual aids do help.

Normally she would have shown up this week but she was busy again. She will come next week hopefully. However, I must set things in order, dust and vacuum no later than this Monday or else, I will drive myself crazy.Tomorrow I will change my sheets dust and vacuum my bedroom, the spare bedrrom and do some laundry.I went grocery shoping today and bought fresh fava beans (just like string beans) and some kale. The fresh beans were cooked in the pressure cooker the usual way. Sautee cubed onions, season to taste, add tomato paste or sauce, dump the veggies and cook. We, the Turks cook almost all vegetables and even meats like this. We do have a lot of other methods of cooking but this is the simplest. We serve veggies warm or cold. People cook with butter or margarine for warm dishes and olive oil for cold. I exclusively cook with EVOO.I chopped the kale and sauteed it with lots of cubed onions. I will have both dishes with garlic yogurt sauce. I have 4 portions of veggies in the fridge now. I also have a portion of frozen stir-fried veggies for Friday. So, I am all set. I am supposed to have a veggie dish for lunch or dinner every day. The other meal is protein heavy. For protein, there are three portions of chicken breast, 4 portions of meat patties in the freezer. However, I intend to have chick peas for two meals this week. Protein does not need to be meat all the time.Since, I have processed the veggies, I was able to clean the kitchen halfway thru. Tomorrow, I will take care of the rest. Right now, there is pot on the stove for veggie broth. I learnt that by reading American blogs. I don't think anybody else does that here in this country.When I was working full time, the kitchen was never used this much. I am sure the dishwasher is shocked that it gets to work almost every day. I am not a big fan of handwashing the dishes you see.Oh I purged some unused plates and some kitchen utensils along with some candle holders. Instead of doing one big cleanup, I get rid of things slowly as I come by them.

I hate wasting food although I have badly burnt two slices of bread today. Well...I made a salad for today's lunch and realized that my salad greens are no longer in the best shape. However, I am not feeling like eating another salad  made from the same stuff tonight. So, I chopped a small onion and sauteed the greens. I know they are salad greens but who cares? I have meat patties for tonight and I will have the sauteed greens as a bed for them.I must go grocery shopping tomorrow which I am not looking forward to. Saturdays are so crowded. I hope, I can get up early and be done with it quickly. I wasn't in the mood to go today.My sister called me today saying that my uncle was having a high blood pressure problem and that his nose was bleeding. So, I called mom up and inquired about it. It turned out that the idiot (lovingly said) has given up one of his meds thinking that he no longer needed it because his blood pressure was normal. This man has seen his grandma and his very own mother, my grandma have strokes due to high blood pressure. Both of them became bed ridden and suffered a long time. Not only that, but he is also a Pharmacist. He should know thet the normal BP is due to properly administered meds and this thing is really never cured. BP and Thyroid diseases are genetic in our family. Sigh...Later in the day, I called them up and found out that his bleeding got worse and he could not go to the doctors. Instead, they called the emergeny hotline and medics helped him advising strongly that he should see his doctor. My sister and my BIL are going over to Ankara tonight to see what's going on. Mom says a friend of my uncle is gonna take him to a doctor on Monday. Hope, he does go. He is such a stubborn person, you can never know.My family is really small. Mom, sis, BIL, uncle, two cousins (their dad was my older uncle who passed), cousins' mother, BIL's parents and me. All of 10 people. The youngest is 43,  four of them are over 70 and almost everybody has important health problems. So, we should take good care of ourselves to be able to help each other when needed. One of these 10 people will have to bury everyone... Oh boy..."},

Luckily there is a small grocery store right by me.I am in a grumpy mood because I was hoping to clean up my home a little bit. I have cramps and I am feeling uncomfortable so, no cleaning or vacuuming today.I also have cravings for chocolate but I am not destroying day 2 of my new eating plan. I had two thin slices of pineapple to satisfy my sweet tooth.Tonight, I am having a nice big salad and meat patties. There is a little bit of mixed veggies (eggplant, zucchini, string beans and tomatoes) leftover. Instead of having a slice of bread, I will have that. I do not have to cook today or tomorrow. Just need to fix salads. That's all.Anyway, the work is starting to pick up pace again. I would like to bring in as much extra money as I can until October. Ideally, I would like to finance my big vacation entirely by the extra income from consulting but, we shall see.I will be done with the payments of the family home on September 2nd. There are only 6 payments left and that is a great thing. I cannot wait to see that. I am hoping to fix the roof this year"},

Well, the last three days were awesome and nothing lasts forever, right?I was home which desperately needs a good cleaning but, I did not feel like doing it. Had a bad night with insomnia again.I went on the treadmill and walked while watching an old episode of Star Trek Next Generation. After the exercise, I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee and an apple.I found some unused china and I am going to place them outside tomorrow with a notice that says: Free to take. While I was looking in the china cabinet, I found a brand new small frying pan. I was thinking of discarding the old one and BUYING one. I did not even know that it was there. God knows when I bought it. I use that size pan for making an omelette or frying eggs for breakfast.Tomorrow, I intend to gather all the spare light bulbs and look for white lights which I will put outside for people to take. I do not like white lights and never use them but apparently I bought  some by mistake.Tomorrow, I have a meeting with a Customer so, I must get up at 7 a.m.First day of the Diet: Check!

{"title": "Off I went to the dietician!", "date": "Monday, March 11, 2019", "text": "Lately,I have realized that my weight is spiraling out of control. Due to my insomnia, I cannot go to sleep at a normal humanly hour so, I get hungry and eat late at night. Not good.I know every detail about a healthy diet and how I can lose weight but, putting that knowledge into action is another story. So, I decided to see a dietician for accountability reasons.Every month I will pay 95 TL, about 17-18 Dollars US which is very cheap since most of the cost is covered by Social Security. For this miniscule amount of money, I get to see the dietician and weigh in every two weeks. She gave me her mobile phone number in case I may crave something, may be in need to go out or stuff like that. That is actually very nice.She also told me to take it easy with the exercise. She doesn't want me to be sedentary but she says for now, 30-45 minutes of a walk for three days a week is enough. I was also told to drink a ton of water. Not really, just about 2.5 liters or about 10 regular glasses a day. That is very doable because I already drink water quiet a bit.She gave me a lot of food to eat but they are wholesome fresh foods so, let's see how I will do.After the dietician I returned an item I had bought for the bathroom to a Home Depot like store. Then I went to IKEA to buy something else for the bathroom. I like how IKEA makes you walk all around the store even though you are there to look for or buy one thing. It is a marketing gimmick which does not bother me. I focused on what I needed to buy and did not purchase anything not needed. Also, by returning the other item and buying something else from IKEA, I was able to cut the cost in half. Plus, I walked more than 1500 steps in the store. Perfect!In total I have walked close to 5,000 steps today. Good Job!It is another beautiful and sunny day and I think I should pack away warm clothes pretty soon. Spring blossoms are everywhere and soon tulips will be covering Istanbul. I will surely share some pictures then."},

I will make a schedule to walk at least 30 minutes every day for two weeks and then, I will try to walk 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes in the afternoon.I bought some chicken breasts and minced/chopped meat. I will make meat patties and freeze them today. I have salad fixings and the amount of food at home will last me at least a whole week if not more.The cheese pie was something I missed lately and since, I will get back on a diet on Monday, I will have a few slices and freeze the rest although, it is a fairly healthy version.Have a great weekend!

{"title": "Idiot Mobile Operator! ", "date": "Wednesday, March 6, 2019", "text": "A while ago, I was contacted by my mobile operator about my contract being up today and they offered me the same package MINUS 5 GB of Internet at a small price bump. Why? Lesser package, higher price? Can anyone care to explain?Anyway, I really do not need that much data and minutes so, I told them I no longer need that big expensive package and I would be content with a smaller one. They said that is the smallest package they can offer. As this conversation was going on I was looking at their website on my computer. There are smaller and much more interesting plans that they can offer for newcomers but not to current customers. Being a loyal customer is penalized. Really? So, I hung up without comitting to a new package.I sent them an e-mail explaining the situation and asked for help. Two useless e-mails later, I decided to change my operator. This one is not better than the other by any means but at least, they treat me as a newcomer and I can get to choose a plan more to my liking. This is going to be a 1 year contract so, most likely, I will keep on going back and forth between operators to be able to use a plan I like. There is a third operator but I am not sure about their coverage. May be next time I am gonna try them.Today I went to the nearest mall where there is this operator's rep office and got my new SIM card. In the next 5 days, my operator will be changed. It took me less than 10 minutes to process my request amd there!I will be paying 35 TL instead of 96 monthly. The 96 TL plan has 15 GB of Internet, 2000 minutes and 2000 sms. I surely do not need that. When I was working full time and had a second apartment with no TV, it was a need (may be). Now, 3 GB of Internet and 500 minutes are more than enough.What an idiotic wat to treat a customer..."},

Today, I watched Borg vs McEnroe.Both movies made me realize that all of these athletes faced difficulties when they were young. Their families or coaches helped them move through rough patches and they all became very successful at the end. Quitting was not an option for any of them. They worked on their problems. Borg for instance had anger issues. Imagine that! The guy was called Ice Man. So, he was able to deal with it.I think, I prefer to quit when push comes to shove in many occassions. I have changed several jobs because I felt stuck, I gave up exercise and diets many times because I don't know why.If people were all like me, I guess we would not have Edison, Albert Einstein, Da Vinci, Malala Yousafzai, Venus and Serena Williams, Socrates, Vincent Van Gogh and many more who excelled in their passion. These people had all sorts of troubles from dyslexia, disadvantages, health problems, injuries, to people who outright went after them to kill. However, they persevered.Yet, I think most people are like me and the above are just extraordinary. Why is that? What makes a person never to give up a goal or a dream?Same thing with finances too. Thank God, I have done fairly well in this but it could have been much better if I had more patience."},

It is much better today.Yesterday, I worked on a new project and participated in a teleconference.It is very cold and cloudy today but, I must move so, I am thinking of doing some beginner tai-chi movements with YouTube and may be walk for a half hour on the treadmill. It has been more than 24 hours since the shower door installation and I can take a nice long shower.I do not have to cook today but, I must take some frozen meat out for tomorrow. I am thinking grilling chicken breasts to go with a salad. Last time I bought chicken breasts, I had cut them up and put them in ziplock bags. It is very easy to let them thaw and marinate in the bag. I have some frozen veggie dishes too. So, I do not think I need to shop till Wednesday or so. I do need bread and milk though.My friend's wife called me to say that he is out of surgery and it went well. He is still sleeping. I think this time it was the other carotide artery plus a by-pass.

He is in good hands and his wife and his son are taking very good care of him.I talked to him yesterday and he was fine, doing some work in his hospital bed.I like his wife as much as I like him so, today I called her to see how she is doing because taking care of a loved one is a tough job and the caregivers need empathy, encouragement and the feeling that they are also cared about as well.As I was talking to her, I mentioned how I will go visit them once this ordeal is over and suddenly she said, she wouldn't be there at the house where they have moved to after retirement. I did not get it at first, thinking she was joking but, then she said that they are separated and will soon be getting a divorce. My mouth must have remained open for several minutes.They have a young adult son who lives in Europe and these two seemed like a happy and dedicated couple. I always thought they have been very lucky to have found each other.I am so sad about this. She told me a few things and her heart is broken for good reason. However, she says she still loves him as a friend and the father of her son and that she will take care of him through his recovery. I thought, may be they could work things out but, she says it is time to let go. They have both tried very hard but apparently my ex-co-worker has some anger issues which I never knew and he is reluctant to seek help.I could not be more upset.

There are so many items that I do not use just staying and collecting dust or taking up space. After all this is a two bedroom, one bathroom 940 sq.ft. apartment.I watched a couple of episodes of the Marie Kondo Show. Some people have enormous amounts of stuff and I consider myself lucky because I am nowhere near that. I do have things that serve no purpose other than having sentimental value. For instance I have 4 model sailing ships my father had made and painted. There are also a few earthenware things that he painted. I have received some serving dishes that I never use. I just cannot get rid of these. They spark joy I guess :) If I had to throw away everything that didn't spark joy, perhaps I would need to empty the apartment. My idea of feeling joy is very much different than Marie Kondo.I got rid of an old lamp and an old silly hat plus half a garbage bag of stuff today.Part of my problem is I do not usually put things back in place after I am done with them. I had a serious look at the kitchen countertops and the living room and confirmed this. So, I attacked those areas and I am almost done. I think I have an hour more work. While I put things in place, I am also dusting. After I am done, I will vacuum the apartment.Before taking a shower, I will take care of the bathroom and my apartment will look nice again!I have also discovered that, the cleaning lady is not doing such a great job dusting. I will tell her the areas she keeps forgetting. She comes every two weeks and I know it is not enough but that is all I can afford. I always tell her that windows do not need to be washed every time especially in this season. Instead she can do a better job with deep cleaning and dusting but, she always washes the windows. I guess it is easy and can be easily seen so that it gives a clean feeling.May be I should sit less on my butt and dust and vacuum the place on the weeks she does not come.Hopefully the shower doors will be installed on either Friday or Saturday.

It turned out to be really awesome. Here is the linkI have a roasting pan with a grill rack that I had bought from IKEA. I lined it with parchment paper and sliced some potatoes which I drizzled with EVOO. I put the chicken breast pieces that I had marinated on the grill rack and 30 minutes later, I had dinner! I also had a salad made with grated carrots and red meat radishes. Oh I used some baby arugula too. Lemon juice and EVOO for dressing as always.I also cooked celery roots with potatoes and carrots in EVOO. That dish is usually served cold but if you like it warm, it is a healthy veggie stew. I start with sauteeing cubed onions and add cut up pieces of the veggies and a little tomato sauce. It takes about 20 minutes on stove top. You have to watch the water you add. It should not be watery at the end.So now, I have this veggie dish and leftover chicken to last me at least two days with a salad. In order not to eat the same thing on two consecutive days, for Wednesday, I am thinking manti, Turkish Meat Ravioli. And no, I bought it ready to cook. It is too much work. I only prepare the garlic/yogurt sauce and heat the butter with red pepper flakes. Very tasty.For Friday and the weekend, I would like to eat out of my pantry so, we will see."},

There is a very long shore where you can walk your dog, grab a bite, ride your bike, bring your kids to any one of the children play areas on the Asian side. There are about three sailing schools too.During the last few years, the local governmentn installed rental bike parks along this place. I have always wanted to try riding a bike but never dared due to not having ridden one in many years and due to my weight. My entire childhood was spent on a bike and I loved it. I think, the last time I was on one was back in 2010 when I was visiting Chicago. That was the first time ever since 1997.Today, I decided to act courageous and try the rental bikes. They looked sturdy enough. After figuring out how the automated kiosk worked, I rented one bike and rode it. I was very wobbly at first, but my muscle memory stepped in and at the end of 10 minutes I was feeling a lot more confident.Next time, I will be wearing sweatpants instead of jeans.

Tonight's dinner will be a can of cannelini beans, onions, olives and boiled eggs. I make a salad with these and use lemon juice and olive oil for dressing. Yum!I know it is healthier and cheaper to use dry beans but I have none at home and I am using the canned version. I also have two cans of chick beans which I will use in salads. This week, I could not let myself buy any salad greens because they not only looked very sad but were very pricey too. So, I got carrots and red meat radishes to make salads. I basically grate them and use lemon and olive oil on top.Tomorrow, I think I will have what we call \"kisir\" something similar to tabouleh for brunch. I have my own recipe perfected over the years and it is neither tabouleh nor kisir anymore. Lol!Here is how I make it:Ingredients: (2-3 Servings)1 cup of fine bulgur wheat1 bunch of parsley (about two cups chopped) you can use less or more depending on your taste buds2 cups of finely chopped freash sweet peppers. In the US, I use green Italian peppers.1 small onionHalf a lemon's juice (I use a bit more since I like it that way)1/4 cup of tomato sauce3/4 cup of hot waterCuminDried mint leavesSaltPepperRed Pepper flakesOlive OilPut the bulgur wheat in a container that has a lid. Pour the mixture of hot water and tomato sauce on it, stir so that all the bulgur is wet and put the lid on. That needs to sit for about 10-15 minutes while you wash and chop the parsley and the sweet peppers. I use my food processor and put them both in together. Set the chopped veggies aside.Chop the small onion finely and using a table spoon of olive oil, cook the onions slightly. Do not caramelize or overcook. 2 minutes is enough over medium heat.Now combine everything you have prepared and season with the above spices to your liking. I use about two heaping tablespoons of dried mint leaves and at least a teaspoon of cumin if not more.Add some more olive oil and voila! I like this best with tea. There is nothing bad for you. Since I use the food processor, it takes all of 20 minutes to prepare and a lot less to eat:)"},

There is so much to be done. I feel a bit overwhelmed. I took mom to her home last Friday and came back yesterday. Now I can structure my days around project responsibilities.In fact, I have been working all morning. Took a break to put a roaster in the oven and check on some blogs while having a light lunch. The bird will provide quiet a few meals and I will make stock using the carcass.Tonight, I am having roast chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I will also make some gravy to go with it. My favorite combination. Yumm...I will have to plan what to do with the rest of the chicken. Some will be had with rice. I have some rice left and I need to use it up before buying a new bag.A pot of soup is in the plans too. I think, I will freeze some of it for salads,sandwiches or small pot pies for one later on. I do not think, I can be eating chicken every day.I have finished my tea as I typed this so, it is time to go back to work."},

I have no idea how long it takes their outsource partner to process the forms. I guess we will find out.Mom is going back home next Friday. Actually, I am taking her. My uncle is in Ankara and he will stay there for a while. He is doing two favors for me. Taking care of the title transfer of the family home and taking care of mom for a while. I love my mom to the moon and back but I also enjoy my solitude. Having lived alone for so many years, I need time for myself. It is difficult to explain perhaps, but that is what it is.Tomorrow is a busy day. I will get a blood test early in the morning, then I will take mom for a haircut. After that I will go have lunch with my ex-boss and our old office assistant. I may meet some High School buddies afterwards."},

I am sending the money for 1/3 of the old family home to my cousins and some money to cover the expenses during title transfer to my uncle who will take care of that.Technically my Net Worth is staying the same but, I do not include any real estate in my NW calculation. I like liquidity best. I would much rather have just a primary residence and the rest in my nest as sweet cash. Lol!My BIL is calling me the Queen of Real Estate\". Cute! If I sold all of what I have, I could buy a 2 bedroom apartment or may be a small house within an hour or two out of NYC. So, not much money in US terms. On top of that, the real estate taxes in the US would plain kill me. Lol!I feel blessed that I do not have to work but, having a part-time work at the same time.Mom and I found out that the movie theaters around us are offering less than half price for 50+ for sessions before 4 p.m. during the week and 2 p.m. during the weekend. We just went to a new Turkish movie taking advantage of that. Yay! Never thought I would be eligible for such a discount. It is quiet significant. Think 10 TL versus 25 TL. Not bad at all."},

Now that I have to buy the share of my cousins and their mom in a family house, every little bit will help.I was originally planning a 3-4 month stay in the US at the end of 2019 but, that is unlikely now. It will heavily depend on how much I make by doing consultancy work and contracting the rental unit to a new tenant.I am preparing for the work ahead by looking at best practices and such. After almost 5 months of free time, it feels good to have a purpose and responsibility without the added stress.For the upcoming work, I have arranged my wardrobe so that I can pack easily whenever I have to visit the customer. Our first customer is in a different city. I have ditched all the old make-up material I had. I bought a new mascara and an eye pencil. I do not wear much make-up. I also ordered a boot and a shoe online. I am all set for the next phase of my work life.Let the new year begin!"},

{"title": "Real Estate that I have no use for... yet anyway", "date": "Monday, December 17, 2018", "text": "This is a long story. It began when my grandpa passed away and left his house on a small piece of land to my mom and my two uncles.One of my uncles was living at that house so, the siblings decided he should keep on staying there. That uncle's business was going poorly and at one point in time he borrowed money from the bank showing the house as collateral. Both siblings agreed to this so, there were no problems between them. Then my other uncle passed and now 1/3 of the place belongs to my two cousins and their mom.At one point in time my sister and I told our uncle to file for bankruptcy seeing that he will soon be a lot more in debt. He reluctantly agreed. Mind you the failure of the business was not his fault. His lenders were expecting payment but the organizations who owed him, did not pay him on time or at all. So, the cash flow situation became very problematic and we wanted him to stop working to stop the loss.He spends his time between an apartment I have bought from him to help him with his cash flow  a few years ago and my mom's apartment. He has a small Social Security income and I pay all his utilities and whenever he needs a car, he uses my 2010 Nissan which I am not using. I have another car I bought this year. He is not happy since he feels he screwed up and he thinks he is a burden. Very far from the truth. He is our only uncle, my mom's only living sibling and his failure in business was no fault of his. Lots of bad luck. He also took care of my grandparents for many years since he lived with them. Also he is the only living man in our family. He is only 9 years older than I am and I consider him more a brother than an uncle.I own his portion of the family home left to them since, I took over the bank payments for the loan he took showing the family home as collateral. Lately my cousins and their mom declared that, they are in need of money and they would like to sell their shares. Mom does not know this, since she will be upset if we sell the home. The property isn't worth much. So, selling it would be meaningless and would upset mom. Therefore, I have decided to step up (again) to purchase their shares. Tomorrow I will talk to my cousin.When all is done, I will be owning 2/3 of the family home. 1/3 belongs to mom.So, now I own my current residence, a two bedroom apartment in Istanbul, another two bedroom apartment in Ankara which I rent (still looking for a new tenant), a three bedroom apartment in Antalya which is mostly used by my uncle although everybody goes and stays there a few weeks a year, and 2/3 of a small house in Konya which is desperately in need of repair. Except for my residence, I truly have no need for any of the other properties. I would much rather have cash in a savings account than all this real estate. However, I cannot sell them for obvious reasons.The bank loan will be gone in October 2019. Before that, I cannot really do any repairs on the home except for the much needed roof. I will probably slowly do the repairs and use that place as a weekend home for all the family. I intend to plant some fruit trees too. My grandpa used to have a great garden. So, at least we can go and stay there any time we want. I think this will make both mom and uncle happy.I am glad I have the means to step up and do all this. I do not know what would have happened if I did not."},

My sister and BIL still have 10 years to go before they can retire. I would like to be close to them eventually. They live in Izmir but they do not like it very much. My sister thinks they will most likely end up in Ankara which I dislike. I would like to be near the water and yet I do not like to be too far away from good health services. This is an unsolvable problem. Anyway, I have no intention to move within the next 3-4 years so, may be I should park this concern for now."},

We may need some small stuff but, not much.In any case, everything is so darn expensive. Eating out is getting to be real expenive so, I am glad we are cooking and eating at home mostly.We bought quiet a bit of vegetables and some chopped meat and turkey drumsticks. Here is what mom and I will be making:- Stuffed tomatoes and peppers cooked in tomato sauce.- String beans cooked with chopped meat- Stuffed eggplants- Turkey drumsticks cooked in pressure cooker. The meat will be used for salads and sandwiches. The broth for soup.- Pumpkin. I will use half of it in a soup, the rest baked in the oven with sweet potatoes and regular potatoes.Meals will be divided in portion sizes and frozen so that we will not have to cook every day.

On my first day there, an old colleague called me to say hello and when he found out that I was not too far away from where he is now living, he and his wife came to have dinner with me. They had been inviting me over to their house for years so, they told me this time they are not accepting any excuses. We agreed that I would go visit them after my time with my High School buddies.During the rest of my time, the weather and the sea were very pleasant.I then went to this beach resort to spend another three days with my High School pals. We all had a very good time as always. I enjoyed the sea and got a nice tan under the October sun.I then went to visit my old colleague and his wife. They have a wonderful little home in the woods. They took me to a very nice beach at a nearby island. The weather and the sea couldn't be any better.I am happy and relaxed.Now, I am back home doing laundry. What else? Lol!Next week I am going to Ankara to see mom. I think, she will come back with me.The best part of my vacation was that, it was all paid for in the spring. So, other than buying gas for the car, eating on the road and treating my friends for one dinner, I haven't spent any money. Did not buy knick knacks or anything like that. I only bought some towels deeply discounted at a factory outlet.I am so glad I was able to do all the laundry today. Tomorrow I will be putting things in order."},

I took every item out, cleaned it from top to bottom and threw out all outdated sauces and things and washed all trays and shelves. I put everything back and arranged them nicely.Next place of attack in the kitchen will be the spice cabinet and the rest of the cabinets and drawers. Mom and the cleaning lady have different ideas of placement. I need to re-arrange everything.I cleaned the kitchen counters too. My kitchen looks really nice now and it will be deep cleaned by the cleaning lady in a few days.I had been gifted a huge tea maker couple of years ago and I had no use for it. It is also taking up too much space. My sister was mentioning that they needed a new tea maker, I jumped in and told her I will give her mine. So, a lot of counter space is saved. Yay!My sister and BIL are moving to their new apartment tomorrow. I will be seeing them on Thursday or Friday. This is a bigger apartment and the best thing is, they own it. Technically they have a 10 year mortgage but, the interest rate was very favorable so, it was a great deal.I thought I was over my jet-lag but alas! I dozed off on the TV chair yesterday and woke up wide awake at 2:30 in the morning. Not good.I still need to put some things away and pack a suitcase for my trip to Izmir, then to the Mediterranean. Mom is bored in Antalya so, I am guessing she will be heading back to Ankara and I will directly go to Ankara after my High School re-union.

Each time I did the math, I made a more conscious decision.I stayed with my friends and we ate all breakfasts and some lunch and dinners at home. I cooked veggies 5-6 times Turkish style.My friend did not want me to rent a car and I was able to drive one of their cars especially because the husband was not allowed to drive for 6 weeks due to multiple surgeries he had to have.I did not want to pay for extra luggage and therefore, I kept my purchases under control based on weight as well.I did treat my friends for a few lunches and dinners at nice places quiet a few times.

I tried to change my ticket but it would cost an arm and a leg. So, I looked for one-way tickets and found a ticket with Aeroflot, the Russian airlines. I bought that ticket and ended up staying a month.This way, I had some time to myself, some time to take care of my friends and run errands for them. It has been a very good stay. When my friend got out of the hospital, we even had opportunities to go out and celebrate his recovery on a number of occasions.

Somewhere in Pennsylvania, I offered to take the steering wheel. It was drizzling a little bit and was foggy up in the Poconos.I had the car on Cruise Control and was on the middle lane. Suddenly the truck on the right lane decided to swerve in front of us. I do not know if the guy was sleepy or was trying to avoid something on the road. I immediately pushed the brakes and looked to my left and saw a car but had to swerve a little bit for a few seconds just to avoid the truck.Lo and behold I see a police car behind me and pulled over. Mind you, I have lived in the US for over 3.5 years and don't know how many times I have been to the country in the last 28 years and never have been pulled over.Anyhow, the policeman approached the passenger side window and started to speak to my friend while looking at my driver's license and the car rental agreement. He was friendly and wanted to make sure I wasn't falling asleep. He asked us where we were going and when we told him we were bringing a kid to school in Michigan,. He wanted to see the kid, talked to her and advised her to study hard. Then, he let us go. Well, I wasn't sleepy at all but after the episode, with the adrenalin rush, I was wide awake for quiet a while.We kept exchanging the steering wheel every two hours and so and thus, managed to safely drive all the way. The last 6 hours in Michigan was so boring, we wanted to scream.When we finally got to our destination, we checked into the hotel, showered and took her to the school to her orientation. After the orientation we emptied the car and helped her while she organized her dorm room. She wanted to stay in the dorm that night although her roommate did not show up that day. So, we left her and went out to shopping for small things she might need and had dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings.I decided to go to the sauna to shake the cold I had and both my friend and I probably fell asleep at 8 p.m. that night and slept like babies. Wonder why?The next morning we woke up very well rested and decided to find out more about the campus and about Lake Superior. It was a nice and relaxing day."},

She had rented a giant sized SUV to take her daughter to school up in Michigan and we went to put my name and driver's licence on the rental agreement.Then, we went to visit her husband, my other friend who was at the hospital for a couple of hours. We then had dinner with my friend and her daughter at the hospital cafeteria and hit the road to Michigan. Yes, I know it is crazy but we were on a deadline for the daughter for her orientation.The plan was to drive from NY, to Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. That is a 16 hour trip, if you do not stop.

We will probably hit the road early in the morning after my arrival. I will pack very lightly. Last year, I did not wear some of what I brought so, this time I will keep the stuff to a minimum. Besides, I can wash my things if I need to.I am not going to be bringing a second suitcase with me this time since I will not be shopping much. One suitcase and one carry-on is all I need. I will save a good deal of money on the second checked bag this time. It is usually USD 80-100 and I cannot justify it given the current state of USD. It is not as bad as on Monday but still too high.I also need to do two loads of laundry before I leave. I must wash and put my work clothes away.I will clean my refrigerator. I usually wipe the interior with a light solution of white vinegar and water.As you can see, I am not quiet ready yet and have some chores to be taken care of."},

It is a crisis state right now for the entire country. We just have to sit tight and ride the waves and see what happens.It is outright stupid to be going on a vacation in the US but, my ticket has already been paid for months ago and I have dollars available so, I am not purchasing it for horrid prices and I will not be doing much shopping.I will spend time with my friends, enjoy my time, purchase only what is an absolute neccesity, like a pair of pants and a couple of tops that I can use when I am consulting.

I would like to pack a very light suitcase. I need a What to Buy List too. I am not in need of much stuff except for a good pair of jeans, another pair of New Balance Shoes, some shoe inserts that I cannot find here at home, some tops and that's pretty much it. Besides the dollar has further appreciated against TL and if I had to actually buy dollars with my TL, this vacation would be utterly stupid. Thankfully, I have dollars purchased at much much lower rates.Today we are having a barbecue at work for my retirement. Next Friday is my last day. I am still driving the company car and will do so till my last day.I bought a small going away gift for the company. It is a decorative object, an \"evil eye\" thing like the one in the picture. You are supposed to display it at the entrance so, the people who envy you will not be able to harm you. It is an old superstitious thing. This is for their new office.I wear a small one all the time. My father believed in this so, he always made me wear one. An old habit.It has been awfully hot and humid lately and I just cannot stand it. As I am typing this, I am at work in one of the meeting rooms where there is a/c. The one in our area is broken and nobody wants to fix it or buy a new one since, this office will be vacated soon. I truly do not need to come in to work anymore but, an agreement is an agreement."},

{"title": "Tweaking the Budget", "date": "Wednesday, August 1, 2018", "text": "I have started to look at my budget items to see if there are anything that I can lower. My phone contract still has 4 months to go before I can make a change. I looked it up and saw that I can save about 30%. I have made a note of it on my calendar.As for Cable TV, I will cancel the sports package when mom leaves. She is the only one watching them. She is a volleyball enthusiast. When she comes back, I can always add the sports package. The rest is very basic except for my documentary package which I am not willing to give up. That is about 15% savings when mom is not around. I plan to freeze my account till November since, I will not be around much.I have checked my insurance items and do not see any room for improvement there just yet.Other items are pretty standart and beyond my control. For instance, the heating system is central. I am very careful about electricity. My normal usage is perhaps at a minimum.So, I will track my spending for a month when I come back from vacation to see exactly where my money is going. I think I can lower my general expenses by about 25%. That includes groceries, eating out, clothing, cleaning supplies and etc.I will keep on having the cleaning lady every two weeks because, it is not just an expense. She has moved to her parents' home with two young daughters and she needs a little bit of pocket money. That expense has a social aspect. Her folks want her to go back to her husband who has cheated on her several times and have been physically abusive. He also cannot hold a job. I do not understand her parents. They do not let her to take him to court for divorce either. Anyway, one day the guy will probably want to re-marry and he will then, divorce her.I will also keep the donations to charity in my budget. I would be willing to lower other spending but, not that.I am ready to retire, relax and take some time off. Then I will go back to part-time, project based work."},

Goodbye having the perk of the company paying for all car expenses and car lease!So, I decided to look for loyalty programs and ease of use of major gas chains. Ideally, I would like to be able to pay for gas without having to get out of my car. There are so many campaigns, perks whatever that I started feeling dizzy and to my chagrin, none of them are so great. I guess, I will keep on using the two stations closest to my home and get out of the car to pay.BTW, we do not have any Self-Serve stations in this country. Nevertheless, I will keep my ears and eyes open because, sometimes credit card companies may have campaigns and I can take advantage of those.I also have to draw up a new budget. My income will be significantly lower so, I must lower some expense categories such as clothing, eating out and etc. My passive income covers all my living expenses. When I get part-time projects and make money, that money will be spent for travel.So, I sat down today to figure out how much of an Emergency Fund I must have sitting in an easily reachable savings account. The rest of the money will be in savings accounts earning more interest. The economy is going downhill here in this country so, I have taken some precautions to protect my money.My sister and I have also discussed our family assets and income and knowing that the youngest child born to this family is now 43, we think, we do not have to worry about the future. It is more my issue than my sister's. She is totally cool about it. She says \"whatever will be, will be\" and when and if push comes to shove, we will figure a solution out. She has a point."},

{"title": "Important Things Change Over Time", "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2018", "text": "The other day I was thinking about my 30 year career and realized that, what was important to me back when I started work have changed very dramatically over the years.When I was a Business Administration student, I used to think, I wanted a very well paying job and my focus was mostly money. As I started looking for a job, I have realized that the job itself was almost as important as money.In my early years, I have come to the conclusion that, training, possibility to grow into different roles and moving up the hierarchy were important.As I went up the hierarchy, I was more focused on work-life balance and pay-responsibility-authority balance. I have also started to pay attention to the people who were working for me, their growth both at work and as people, their well-being and their happiness.When I became a consultant, I wanted to see good implementation of my guidance and when the customers had problems implementing change, I first became upset but then I have quickly realized that change must come from within. Someone in a particular organization must lead and sponsor the change. If that does not happen, no matter how good you are, you cannot be successful. So, a consultant sometimes has to shut up, deliver the work, get paid and not be upset about the outcome.When I finally joined my current company as the second in command, I felt very responsible for work outcomes, the general day to day requirements, the happiness of the people and the contentment of my boss. I was being paid very well but that was not the sole reason that motivated me.So, over the years I became more people oriented and my return on that investment is the outpour of love and respect from my team. That, I will not trade for anything."},

Ehem... I meant her.For some reason I felt like I wanted to touch and pet the kitten. I did that while other people held her last week.People at work insisted that I should hold her even once to experience what a warm feeling that is. I had doubts about that but today, I held her! I could feel her little heart beating and she was warm and soft and for the first time, she meowed!I am amazed at my courage. This by no means is a sign that I am not afraid of cats anymore. Their sudden movements still make me jump. But, I have also learnt that, cats do not scratch or bite people for no reason. That was today's lesson.My sock drawer is so full that I have difficulty closing it. It looks like socks are coming out of my ears. How did that even happen? I have to sit down and put that in order. It is driving me insane.Why do people do this to themselves? Honestly how many pairs of socks are enough?I also found that I have way more nightgowns and pajamas than I need. I always keep a couple unworn ones just in case I need to be in a hospital. Other than that, how many do I really need? There are two drawers full of them. Yikes!Every time I sort through them, I end up keeping most because they are broken in and comfortable. I must confess I still wear a couple with holes in them. So, the new rule is: If one does not go away, another one is not coming in.I do need to check out all my clothing items and donate and get rid of all that I do not need.

I will just take my fountain pen, my notebook, and my laptop when I finally walk out this place.They will be leaving this current office by the end of August, moving to a plaza. This place is very nice with a large garden, fruit trees and picnic tables but, it has many infrastructure problems too. Also, it will not be sufficient for more people to be hired.It will be the end of an era completely by then.When my replacement starts working, I will cut down on the time I spend at work gradually so, she can be more comfortable.I will also take her to meet the team in Ankara early August. The plan is, to take my mom back to her home to Ankara on the 11th, do her shopping. Most likely my uncle will come to Ankara to spend time with mom while I am away. Then he will drive her to Antalya where he spends most of his time. On Monday the 13th my replacement will fly to Ankara in the morning, meet me and the team at the office and later in the afternoon I will drive us back.That will be my last week. I am getting pretty excited and finding it really weird because I am usually very cool. When I was being sent to the US for the first time at the ripe age of 22, to live on my own for the first time, to go abroad for the first time, to be on a plane for the first time, I did not feel any excitement whatsoever.

{"title": "Tick tock! to Retirement", "date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2018", "text": "I have 24 work days to go and I am starting to feel excited. I am making a list of things that I want to do more of when I retire so that, I have a new purpose in life. There are business related subjects and personal and health related things I want to do more of. I need structure and discipline in my life, otherwise, I may become a couch potato very easily.Yesterday, the car was ready for me to pick-up. So, I left work around 2:30 p.m., called mom to see if she wanted to go with me to pick up the car. She agreed. I parked my company car in the gated parking area in my apartment complex. Since, it is a small place, every apartment is allowed to park only one car in that space and it is not even sufficient for all apartments. So, we park on the street which is not busy.The friend who helped me buy the car came to give us a ride to the dealer's. As we were waiting for the last few things taken care of, we were offered coffee and mom was able to sip her coffee looking at the nice, shiny black Mustang GT that she loved. Lol!I had my insurance broker issue the insurance policy before I took the car out of the dealer's. Then I drove to the nearest bank where they have the easy-pass stickers. It will be on auto-pay tied to my credit card. So, I am all set.When I came back, I parked my new car in the gated parking lot and drove the other one out just to be nice to my neighbors. Needless to say, not all of them are as considerate as I am.I want to go through all my clothing items and donate all that I am not going to use, leaving only a handful of work clothes and jackets for part-time work.I have to do this after I take my mom to her home because if I start, she will want me to finish on the same day whereas I like to take my time. It will also be a good exercise since, I will know exactly what I need to buy while I am in the US. I do not see myself needing much.I have gone through my shoes once but, I think I should do that one more time.And my cell phone now plays \"It's my life!\" by Bon Jovi each time someone calls me :)"},

So, I always get my water delivered and use that even for boiling spaghetti.Whenever I am out and about and when I get thirsty, I grab a bottle of 0.5 lt bottle from any small place, gas station or even Starbucks.Just recently it hit me how much I am spending on those small bottles.Last time I was in Starbucks, I grabbed a bottle at 2.50 TL. What!? I get 19 lt. bottles from the guys who deliver my water for 12.50 TL. So, today I asked them whether they also deliver 0.5 lt. bottles. In fact they do. The 24 pack 0.5 lt. bottles cost 16 TL. I ordered my usual two big bottles and a 24 pack.Then it hit me again that I could just fill up stainless steel water bottles at home and save even more. 2,5 TL vs 0.66 TL vs 0.33 TL!I am sure I will forget to do this or grab a small bottle when leaving home but, that's OK.

{"title": "Why an SUV? The Decision Process ", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2018", "text": "I never thought I would buy an SUV in my entire life. So, what got into me? Linda asked me my criteria and since it took me a lot of research and quite some time, I decided to share my decision process.First of all I started looking for small cars on the market. The selling price is a factor but I concentrated on total cost of ownership in the long run. There are many variables affecting that, such as gas per mileage, yearly tax, routine service, cost of spare parts, cost of new tires.In this country diesel is cheaper than regular gas so, the car needed to be a diesel. The yearly tax is based on the age of the car plus the engine size. I checked the tax table and decided that the car should have a maximum of 1600 cc engine. For Americans that is not even an engine I know, but the gas prices in this country are 3x what they pay.Then I looked up service charges at 15,000-30,000-45,000-60,000 etc. kms. along with spare part costs. It was such an eye opener to see how small cars were not necessarily inexpensive. Tire costs vary due to size. (My new car is expensive in that respect.)At that point I became skeptical about small cars especially in the gas/mileage department.Then I decided that I need an automatic car. I can drive a stick shift but as I age, it is so much easier. At that point I realized that there are not many automatic small cars with diesel engines. Then mom said she hates to get in and out of cars because they are so damn low. She even brought a thick pillow to the VW Passat, my company car that I am driving. She sits on it. I do not think it works well because after all, it is a pillow.Mom is 75 and is getting old. So, the travel we can do together is somewhat limited to perhaps the next 10 years, may be less. I want her to be comfortable.This way,, I started looking at crossovers and SUVs. I do not need a 4x4 since they tend to consume more gas. However, all the available options were beyond my budget. I decided that I could buy a gently used, new-to-me car below 50,000 Kms.After looking at used cars every night online for quiet a while, I found that Nissan Qashqai, Renault Kadjar, Jeep Renegade were possible options. I found a couple of cars that were worth looking at and sent the links to a friend of mine who is very knowledgeable and who has quite a network of technicians and car salesmen. He researched the cars and told me that the new Ford Kuga (Escape) has a better 1.5 TDCi PowerShift engine. Since Ford sells many cars in Turkey the spare part industry is pretty good and this engine is fairly new with pretty good gas/mileage. The routine services are very inexpensive compared to most cars.This way, I added the Ford to my list and started following sales ads. That is how I made my decision.Due to a change in tax law, since this car was a 2017, the yearly tax is lower than the same exact car that is a 2018. With about 6,250 miles, it is practically new. That was my bonus. It is the simplest version. For instance, it has parking sensors at the back, none in the front. It has a screen and bluetooth but, the screen is not a touch screen. However, all the standart features are pretty good and I will not miss anything."},

When I reach that age, depending on my health, my family's situation, I may sell my current apartment and move somewhere else.That is when my assets will become important. Shall I sell that apartment or this one? Shall I upgrade this car or that one? Do we still need two cars?

I paid a small sum with my credit card which I will pay in full when I receive the bill. I collect flight miles with that card so, that is a bonus.I gave power of attorney to one of their employees to handle the sale of the car. I only will have to go pick up the car on Monday. Meanwhile, they will deep clean the car and check it out before handing me the keys. It was pretty clean anyway. I am happy with my choice. I was hoping to spend way less money but after writing down my criteria, I had to go for an SUV type car. The price was reasonable so, I will consider this a once in a life time splurge.While we were in the showroom, mom decided she liked the Mustang GT best. If she wins the lotto, we may buy it. After all, dreaming is free.I am glad I did this. I will hand over the company car mid-August as I leave for good.I get to keep my laptop and my health insurance policy till it expires in June 2019.

I reviewed it, made some changes and sent it right back. He accepted all my terms so all is good. For now anyway.Today, mom and I will go see a new-to-me car. I wasn't going to rush but, I have been told this is an exceptionally nice car gently used at just 6,250 miles on it. The friend who looked at the car told me there wasn't even a scratch on it. It is a 2017 but, it was put to use in early January 2018. It is being sold as Ford Escape in the US. Here it is called Ford Kuga. The price is good but a bit at the higher end of my budget. Thinking that I will use this car for at least 10 years, I think, what they offer is a good price. If I were buying brand new, I would be paying an extra USD 7,000. The taxes on cars in this country are outrageous so, I am definitely not buying brand new knowing that the car will depreciate several thousand TLs as soon as I drive off the seller's parking lot.As for work; I will be leaving mid-August and going on vacation to the US. When I come back, I will rest all through September and head to my sister's for a week or so. Then I will drive down south to meet High School pals and may be spend a couple of days with an old colleague. Then, I will drive along the Mediterranean to meet up with mom and uncle. I will spend some time with them and take my mom back to Ankara for our routine cardio appointments.And then what? I don't know.All I know is:- I will not have to do my grocery shopping over the weekends when the traffic is real bad and the shops are crowded.- I will not have to drive to and from work eating up more than two hours of my time each day.- I will not have to get upset about things at work.- I will have more time to take care of myself, be with family, read, write, relax, volunteer, socialize...- I will not have any excuses for not exercising or eating healthy.

I am going to miss him but I am glad he is taking on a new and better role.After my last post, I am truly thankful that I am leaving because, I just do not want to deal with this chaos for which I am not responsible.If they ask me to come back part-time, I do not think I will accept it.I am looking forward to my two-week vacation in the US. After I come back, I will relax all through September and in October, I shall visit my sister, spend three days at a resort with my High School pals, then drive to visit my uncle who will have probably brought mom to his home in Antalya. By the end of October both mom and I have cardiologist appointments. So, before I know it the winter will be right around the corner.I am casually looking for a new-to-me car, but I am in no rush.Feeling content and excited."},

I did not ask for this. Neither did the Technical Team Leaders in either of our offices. Naturally, it is very disturbing for them since \"someone\" is looking for a person who will supposedly be reporting to them. How stupid! How unprofessional! I wonder if my replacement is aware of these. If so, I am going to be very sorry for the people I will be leaving behind.It turned out that the new GM has asked for these. What is he trying to accomplish by disturbing the people? There is no such need and yet, he is hiring. People are very uncomfortable and they come to me. I have no answer to give them just yet because I have to wait to announce my leaving till next Tuesday. What a mess! Thank God, in a few days I will anounce my departure and will not have to deal with this chaos anymore.Meanwhile, they have hired a Pre-Sales person already without properly giving notice to the Sales Leader at the same office.What a poor way to treat people! I am absolutely furious."},
{"title": "Tell me your friend, I will tell you who you are", "date": "Wednesday, July 4, 2018", "text": "This is an old saying in Turkish. The other day, I was thinking about that. I have a bunch of young people working for me and as I observe how they interact with each other, whether they are friends outside of work too or not, this old saying came to my mind.People change after they befriend someone who is toxic. A normally cheerful, self-motivated, hard-working individual may turn into a self-depreciating, depressed person if she/he spends enough time with such a person.I have seen this pattern in our company several times.Sometimes a friend can be intellectually challenging and you strive to keep up with her/him. You start learning about different things, you widen your interests and these type of friends uplift your mood and help you become a may be not better but more interesting person.We cannot choose our families but we surely can choose our friends. I am not saying that we should abandon people who are going through a bad period or suffering in any way. As good friends, we definitely should stand by them and help them any way we can. I am talking about an entirely different type of personality. The one who always complains, who always looks for the negativity in anything and everything, who gossips about people, who constantly digs into other people's personal lives. I also cannot stand materialistic people. They will never be happy.I treat everyone nicely but, I decide on the distance between us. Life is too short to be in pain. Every day is a gift and I am determined to live it happily and peacefully."},

Cooking is not like baking where you have to measure ingredients and be careful about the recipes.The other day, I made a stir-fry dish of some vegetables on hand and mom and I had it for dinner. The leftover portion became part of a frittata.My soups are always loaded with things that may not be in the original recipe. If I have to use up something, I will.Trying to stick to a recipe is tiring and frustrating since sometimes they call for ingredients you may not have on hand at all times. Besides, I do not like to buy something which will be used just once and most likely go bad before being used a second time.The other day, I was watching a cooking show with some obnoxious contestants. They visit each other's homes for dinner and grade the cooking. They say things like, \"such and such does not go into this soup or casserole or whatever\". Who says? And Why?The other day I put carrots and potatoes I had to use in lentil soup and mom said she had never seen someone putting those in lentil soup. I think she watches that show every day. Lol! I said, a soup is a soup and anything can go into it as long as it is tasty. The soup is gone already so, I must have been doing something right.When I leave work, I will try to focus on cooking healthy and fresh foods. I generally like cooking but cleaning up aftrwards is a chore I hate."},

I am not in a rush to get part-time project work.My current company may ask me to work part-time but I do not know if I want to. Not yet anyway. We'll see.I have been looking at cars. They are so darn expensive in this country. I do not want to rush. I have a 2010 Nissan Note in Ankara which my uncle uses for himself and mom. I will take that to Istanbul till I find myself a new-to-me reliable SUV type car. My sister has an identical car that she also keeps in Ankara unused. Uncle and mom will use that while I look around. Both are old cars with only about 90,000 miles. We had bought them new and we are sure they are reliable so, we do not want to sell them at very depreciated prices.

Up until then the weather was not so bad with occasional rain showers but a major thundestorm hit followed by a short hailstorm. It was raining so badly that we had to wait until it stopped. Unfortunately the storm was on my way home so, I got hit for the second time. At a point, the traffic stopped because we had zero visibility. A lot of side roads were flooded. So, I had to make several re-routes to avoid the flooded areas.By the time I pulled in our parking lot, the rain had stopped and I was able to walk to the apartment without getting wet.Saying goodbye to two good colleagues was hard and I suddenly remembered the three witches of Macbeth:When shall we three meet again?

I cut them into smaller pieces and cooked them in a deep and large pan. Then, I cut up onions and potatoes and added them to the chicken. On top of everything, I placed thick slices of tomatoes and small italian peppers. Mixed tomato sauce with water and poured that in. I use only salt and pepper to season food (weird for someone who lives in this part of the world, I know). Then I covered the pan and let everything simmer until all was done. It is my favorite comfort food.Mom doesn't feel like cooking most days and I cannot blame her. It is usually very warm and she gets tired easily. Some days, she feels better and she cooks. I do not ask her to cook anything.I do not mind cooking but, I hate cleaning up afterwards. So, I try to be very creative and use the smallest number of pots and pans and gadgets.I am really looking forward to having more time on hand, to plan my shopping and homemade, healthy food, exercise, pay attention to my personal care, read and relax. I am also planning to minimize my wardrobe getting rid of old items.When I work part-time, I do not need many clothing items. I already have 3-4 business jackets. I need easy care tops to go with the jackets and a couple of pants. The pants I have been rotating and wearing everyday to work are getting pretty worn. So, when I am in the US, I will try to get a couple of pants and some tops. When I get back, I will clean out all the old items cluttering my wardrobe."},

Nor, I will inquire about who the heck is my replacement.So, I am waiting not patiently but pretending to be so. I am also getting uncomfortable being around the new people. I am feeling outside the circle which is actually the case but, having devoted over three years, it feels like something that belonged to me is being taken away from me which is really weird. When I think about all the change that is due, I am feeling glad that I will not have to deal with those unless they keep me as a consultant. I am thinking it is not such a great idea anymore.Our office assistant is leaving the end of this week. I will miss her.I just cannot seem to motivate myself. I do what has to be done and that's all.My mood is partially due to the latest general elections in Turkey too. Unfortunately, the present president won and God knows where the country will be headed. Possibly the big mess of Middle East rather than the West. Having said that, I must remind myself that my family is rather small and the last born child is 43. We should be fine but, freedom of speech, justice, secularism, science and such will not prevail. Fundamentalist religion is on the rise.I was born Muslim but, I have never practiced. I believe there is a God or Allah or some super being who created the universe but that's all. I think the likes of me are called Deist.The weather is foul too. We are expecting major thunderstorms and possibly hailstorms today.Overall, my mood is down.Well, it'll pass I know. It always does.The good news is my sister and her husband bought an apartment in Izmir where they have been living for the last 3 years. They were paying too much rent for a small apartment hoping that they would go back to Ankara. However, they now realize that, it is difficult for the bank to transfer them both and provide similar size branches. Both of them work as bank branch managers. They will now pay a similar amount of mortgage for a much larger apartment. It is a bit farther than the city but it is an investment. The mortgage is only for 10 years since they paid 50% down payment. So, by the time they retire, the mortgage will be paid. They have been able to obtain a very favorable fixed rate and that is a great thing in the long run. Inflation is on the rise."},

It was a very nice evening.Little breaks do wonders.I told her that I will soon be leaving the company and she agreed that it was about time and it would be best for me to work part-time.I graduated with a BSc degree in Business Administration in June 1988 when I was 21 and started working. This year is my 30th in the Work Force. There has been times I was between jobs because I do not like to burn myself out just for the sake of making money. I am thankful that I could choose not to work every once in a while. Thanks for all the advice at Personal Finance blogs about Emergency Funds.Today I had lunch with my ex-boss and our soon-to-be ex-office assistant. She wanted to leave right after the ex-boss did but stayed because I needed her around. However, there is no point for to stay anymore and she is going. She had been training her replacement. I will miss her but we can always get together since we will both have more time in the very near future.The ex-boss is going on a long vacation with his family.

Normally, I would tell him all the possible negative side effects of implementing such a procedure but, I forced myself to keep my mouth shut. Wrote an e-mail to the staff and started the procedure.Up until now, I have shared my experience several times but, he mostly did not take my advice. I have done what I have done for 30 years and have come accross the same issues at several different companies. I have been wrong. I have made mistakes. I have learnt the proper way of doing things and I have accumulated all this experience. I pay attention to minute details and think ahead. I never take decisions on a whim because I now know better.I offered experience, they prefer learning the hard way, so be it.For the first time in a long while, I am feeling peaceful and am in a mood to let go. Today I had someone calculate my normal severance if I had been let go so, I have that information to asses the offer they will put on the table.I will also ask to keep my laptop and my health insurance policy which has been just renewed till next renewal time.As I asses the situation for doing part-time work for them, I have some doubts such as the following:-  The person who will replace me might be uncomfortable.-  The people who worked for me all this time may keep on coming to me creatig mistrust on the newcomer's part. I want the new person to understand and appreciate what used to be \"my people\" and establish a good working relationship. So, I should not be the obstacle-  The tasks they will want me to do may not be all that interesting to me.So, I have decided to give them a daily rate and take it from there. I do not want to commit to much else.I just need to keep myself motivated till the end so that I can set a good example for the people who work for me.This is most probably my last full-time job and I am glad I accepted the offer of my ex-boss and worked with him.

Besides, there will be no accomodation costs or car rental costs because, I shall be staying with friends. I am not planning to do much shopping either since I was in the US last year and am planning my bucket list vacation next year in Fall.I started my new meds today and I guess it will take a few days to understand whether they will work or not.

On Monday, we will head further south to Bodrum where we will stay at a resort. Our room opens directly to the pool and the Aegean Sea is within two minutes of walking distance. I prefer the sea over the pool but, sunbathing by the pool with mom will be nice. She no longer likes to go in the water. She says the movement of the water makes her dizzy.We will stay there for 5 days and head back to my sister's who will be home then :) We will spend some time around that area and head back home by the following weekend.We are planning to go to a classic car museum, visit some archaelogical sites (mom is an archeologist) that we have not been to and mostly relax.This vacation has been booked in January at a fraction of what it would cost now and has been paid for. I am not expecting to spend much money while we are on the road or in Izmir. The resort is quiet pricey but, I have taken advantage of the early bird special booking they have offered way back in January and purchased insurance just in case we would not be able to go.

They had asked me not to tell mom because they wanted to surprise mom who is staying with me these days.They drove all the way from Izmir after work on Friday so, knowing that they would arrive after midnight, I tried to convince mom to watch a movie after midnight but she was sleepy so, she went to bed.I made sure, my sis and BIL would not ring the door bell and right after they arrived, we all went to bed. Then it struck me: What if mom wakes up and decides to check up on me? Would she be afraid, if she ran into one of \"the kids\" in the middle of the night when going to the bathroom? Thankfully, none of that happened.Anyway, I got up and started breakfast and woke my sister and BIL up. They woke mom very gently and boy! was she happy! She loved her suprise.Since, everybody was tired, we decided to stay at home and just spend time together on Saturday till dinner.We went to a fancy fish restaurant that both of the kids love and had a very good time. After I paid the bill, I went to get the car from the valet service and started waiting for my family to get in the car. Minutes passed and there was noone coming. It kinda felt like the Twilight Zone. They were right behind me! Where are they now? I called my sister and my brother and they did not answer! What?! I was about to leave the car to look for them when they finally arrived.Apparently as they were walking out, they have seen a famous newspaper article writer whom we all like but whom my mom absolutely loves! He is a very smart man, with an incredible archive. He writes politics and he is an opponent to the current Government just like we are. So, they stopped to say hello and he came around, gave mom a hug and posed for several pictures. Bummer! I missed that.Mom was ecstatic! She kept saying \"what a wonderful day this was\".  The next day, we had breakfast at home again. My BIL loves pancakes so, I made some and he had his first taste of Maple Syrup. Magically, he liked it! Members of my family have very conservative taste buds unlike mine.

I would like to take them on a boat tour either to Prince Islands or along the Bosphorus if the weather permits that. I have booked a very nice fish restaurant that they love for dinner.On Sunday, we will have breakfast together and they will drive back to Izmir in the afternoon. It is just a short little visit but we shall hopefully get to see them again next month at the end of our mini vacation with mom.I think it is a blessing to get along well with one's immediate family.

We may as well kiss secularism, democracy and justice goodbye.The economy was getting worse and worse each day and the Government has not been doing anything about it. You may ask why and I can answer with one word: Corruption!Anyway, there are rumors that, as soon as the elections are over, if the current Government stays on, there will be a major devaluation of Turkish Lira against hard currencies such as the USD and Euro. They are also thinking that, the currency regime may go back 40 years and that our USD accounts may be frozen at a certain exchange rate and we may have no longer access to hard currencies as much as we like to. Given that half of my savings are in hard currencies, this can lead to a disaster for me personally.They think bank safety deposit boxes will be safe at least for the time being. I started withdrawing hard currencies and placing them in a safety deposit box that I rented from my bank. My sister also has one at her branch. So, I am sending her some USD for her to keep it in her safety deposit box. I have a safe at home but, I really do not like to keep much cash there. I am also converting as much TL to USD as possible anticipating the devaluation.I presume, none of my readers will ever have this problem. If this scenario does not happen, all I will have lost will be some interest on my USD accounts. Better safe than sorry...I am also investing in small gold coins since they can be converted to cash very easily.

Of course, this date may change. It is not set in stone but, for me, it is something that makes me calmer. Now, I have something to work and look for.Our Office assistant decided to leave within a few months as well. The Accounting Company to whom we outsource the accounting business has also declared that they will no longer be in the picture after the end of this year. So, come next year, the place will look very different.I am also leaving the Studio Apartment within 10 days or so. For about 10 months it will be a hassle to go to work and come home but, that's doable. I am saving like crazy. My plan after quitting is to go back to working part-time on a few select projects that come my way. My passive income is enough to handle my living expenses and the extra I might be making will be for travel and home improvement projects.I am financially independent as of now but, adding some more on top of my savings will help a lot more in the long run.I am also thinking of not buying a car at least for a while. It makes a lot more sense to use ZipCar and similar services. I will give it a shot for at least three months to see if that works but there is still a looong time to consider all these."},
{"title": "On the Fast Track", "date": "Friday, March 30, 2018", "text": "Life has been very stressful, busy and fast lately. I have been gaining weight because, I was burying my feelings in carbs. I made a bargain with mom. She will come and stay with me for a long time and I will eat only what she serves me. She had been feeling lonely for quiet a while so, she agreed.Not a single day passes by that I do not question whether I should keep on working here or not. It is not the load of work but rather, the constant turmoil created by the new CEO. He has never worked as a CEO before and has the attention span of a three year old. Completely lacks strategic thinking. This week, I am feeling especially drained. It feels like my life energy is being sucked by Death eaters of Harry Potter.I constantly remind myself to be patient.On a frugal note; I will soon be the proud owner of a second hand threadmill at no cost. I have always wanted one but did not want to pay a lot of money for it. My ex-boss did not want to take home his when he sold the company and I asked him if I can have it. So, hopefully next week or so, it will be delivered to my apartment.I am also going to give up the Studio Apartment by the end of April. The new office will be closer to the bridge and I can commute from my primary residence. Besides,I do not even know how long I will be working at this Zoo. I have tremendous trouble sleeping at the place anyway. Some significant savings there too. I am so glad. Maintaining two places was difficult. Initally, it was worthwhile but lately no more. Especially after I have found out that, part of my insomnia is due to the noisy place.Today I am in Ankara at our office there. In about an hour, I will go see my eye doctor and then meet two babyhood friends over a cup of coffee.Tomorrow, I have to be at the airport at 7 a.m. to meet my sister who will be flying in just for the day to get her scars checked and stitches removed after mole removal surgery. She had three moles on her face that looked pretty ugly. I will get an injection for my back pain as she deals with her own doctor. Then, we will have a Girls day out with mom.On Sunday, I am heading back with mom to Istanbul. So, not much resting this weekend but that's OK.What are your weekend plans?"},

These indirectly affect my relationship with my family too.I know I eat unhealthy stuff when I am stressed. This drives me into an insane vicious circle where I get stressed and eat and gain weight and get stressed even further. So, as of today, I am stopping that. My back hurts which makes me impossible to walk. I have to go get a shot and will do that this week.I cannot believe how fast the days go by but I am not sure whether it is a good thing or not."},

Not 2017, 2016!It was a layered short cut so well done that, the hair grew out even and I did not feel the need to go to the salon. I just colored my own hair every 6-8 weeks or so, to cover the gray. Easy peasy!However, since I have been feeling stressed out lately, I decided to go to the salon and told my hairdresser, he can do whatever he wants to except for darkening my color. So, he decided to give me a balayage. I had no idea what it was just kind of knew that it was like highlights, just subtler.After spending four hours and about USD 100.- (I know it is a steal when compared to the US prices but, I still felt it was too much), I walked out of the salon a happy camper. My hair has never had such lighter color before and I think, it suits me since I have pretty light skin. Actually, the first week of a summer vacation is pretty embarassing. I look like a big white whale and then, my color starts to turn just a little. I don't remember having a tan ever. I need a beach vacation for 6 weeks before I can get a tan. Who is that lucky?I have been told not to wash my hair till Tuesday morning. He apparently gave my hair some special treatment after the coloring. This prosedure is not done very close to your roots, so I have been told, it is safer than the highlights.Perhaps it was time for me to go dirty blondish at the age of 51, ha!"},

I hurried out to get to the tailor to drop a pair of pants for hemming before heading to the coffee shop we were supposed to meet.Since I was rushing, I was not paying attention to the sidewalk and my bumper got caught. As I tried pulling away, I managed to break the bumper. Yeah! I quickly called my friend and cancelled our get together. I really wanted to see her but, it wasn't meant to be.I took pictures and called the Fleet Company (I am driving a company car) and they told me they need a police report. I thought the police would not come for such a minor issue but luckily they did in less than an hour. They gave me an alcohol test at 3 p.m. in the afternoon! (I guess some people can be drunk at that hour of the day). They quickly jotted down the report and told me to get it from a police station on Sunday.30 minutes later a tow-truck came and took the car. It was a minor issue but, the broken part was going to rub on the tire so, I did not want to drive the car.By the time they took the car away, it was too late for the Fleet Company to bring me a loaner. I had to go to the airport closer to me to pick it up. No big deal really.Other than this, I cooked a couple of dishes for the week and spent every single moment dozing off in fron of the TV.Today, the company driver went to get the report and the Fleet Company started the repairs already. It was such a stupid mistake on my part but, it is covered by insurance and this is the first such thing I did since early 90's. Better than a real accident thank God."},

The smell is mighty horrid, the garden looks like a swamp and the Landlord refuses to help. So, we decided to evacuate as soon as possible and started looking for probable office spaces. Needless to say, we will be suing the Landlord.Our Office Assistant and I have visited several places with a realtor and came up with 3 alternatives. Tomorrow, we shall be showing those places to the CEO, CFO and the architect to decide which will serve our purposes best.In any case, we cannot be out of this place before late April.The ex-boss is glad, he barely escaped this hellhole. We always had small issue with the electricity and the infrastructure but the beauty of our garden and the peaceful location made it worth staying over here.Now, we will be moving to a plaza type of office space with a Mall or very close to one and life will be different.I am sure, the Mall will have a terrible effect on most of our staff's finances but they have to grow up and manage their money.That's why I have been MIA lately.

{"title": "Keep Asking: Is this a need or is this a want?", "date": "Wednesday, January 31, 2018", "text": "Since the theme of this year is SAVE! SAVE! SAVE!, I must constantly remind myself whether something I want is a real need or not.For instance, I have an old rug in the kitchen. It doesn't look bad. Only I know how old it is. Besides, if I did not have that rug, do I really need one in the kitchen? Not really. So, that has been crossed from my list.Have I ever told you about that list of mine? I don't think so.Whenever I feel like I must buy something, I put it on a list. Once or twice every week, I visit that list and extract my weekly grocery shopping items. So, you see it is more of a catch all list.I want a pair of nice Caterpillar boots. The boots I currently have, started to look shabby and although I think, they will survive this winter, I will need new boots next year. So, for now, I have put the boots on my list and noted the current price. When I go to my primary residence next week, I will see if there are other boots that I can wear so that I can postpone this purchase. I may have some less worn boots but for a while I could not wear them. I had some pain issues and I relied solely on New Balance Athletic shoes and the boots that I currently wear. My problems are gone and I may try to go back to wearing my old footwear to see if the problems will come back or not. If it does, there is motivation to purge right there!I was thinking of getting a new bedspread for the bed in my primary home but, since I will give up the studio in the summer, I will end up with extra bedspreads anyway. Pooof! No more a need. Just got crossed off my list.I was at IKEA yesterday. Since the weather was bad, I just wanted to stretch my legs. I really did not need anything to buy except for ziplock baggies. Meanwhile, on my need list, I had some hand towels. I was looking for the  cheap white kind which can be bleached and this has been a long time need but I simply refused to pay more than a certain amount for them. I found towels that were just what I wanted and the price was very close to what I would be willing to pay. Then all of a sudden, I remembered that I had a 20 TL off gift card from a previous purchase which was about to expire. Voila! The cost of the hand towels came to a figure below what I would be willing to pay. A bit of patience sometimes goes a long way.Using a list makes your buying choices a somewhat fun exercise too. How? You get creative. For instance, sometimes, I find things to re-purpose to serve a need and cross the related item off my list. Every penny saved now is a penny that might be badly needed in retirement. I am a big proponent of the quote: \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.”"},

It does sound expensive but, I think we can justify that expense\" or something like that, he chose to say:\"I cannot make you understand the urgency of this matter. Financial sector has been on the decline and we need all sorts of reports... blah blah... Your ex-boss must have hidden these facts from you etc.\" He also cc'ed the new CFO.I took the CFO out and wrote to him:\"Your below comment was truly unnecessary especially with the CFO included. Besides ex-boss did not need to share with us anything. It was his boat, we merely worked for him\".My ex-boss is a very intelligent young man and he knew that doing what we do, it would not be possible to grow as a company. He needed to take risks which he was not willing to take. Therefore, he sold the company. SMART is written all over his story.He responded by saying he did not mean to break my heart. So, obviously, he does not even realize that I am pissed, not heart broken.This was strike 1 on his part and duly noted.After all those due diligence work, these shmucks probably did not know what they were getting into.Now I am changing my attitude. There have been issues pending due to cost reasons. Next week, I am inviting all subcontractors to provide quotes for whatever is necessary. I will bombard them with all these expenses and justify how important they are including the application. It will cost a ton of money and so be it."},

Just a bit hyper, that's all.The problem is, they have set out to change a lot of things all at once before understanding how everything works. They will lose more sleep than they intend to but, I guess, it is a part of learning.For instance there is an application that we use to track sales and we chose to use it at a very basic level up until now. It is USD 25 per person per month and it works.The new CEO comes from an international organization and he is used to the Enterprise edition of this application. The cost? USD 150 per person per month. In our case, only 7 people use it actively. If we decide to make it organization-wide, that will have to be USD 150x30 versus USD 25x7. Big difference... No?"},

Since, life can go many ways, I had settled on setting more than one target which I named, Minimum, Good, Better, Best and Utopia.I am happy to report that my minimum target is achieved as of this month. (Actually, I reached it a couple of months back but, then something happened and I had to gift a good chunk of money to a family member)What does reaching the Minimum mean? Well, if for some reason, I walk out with no option whatsoever to work anymore, I can pay the debt I have taken over from a family member and have a modest retirement. I can only take one modest vacation in country per year and drive a small, second hand car. It is not a great option by any means.According to my projection, my next target can be achieved by the end of this year and the next target, by the end of next year. So, patience is key here but, for some reason I am feeling very uneasy.I should make myself stop thinking about retirement constantly. I am only 51. It is even possible to reach the target I named Utopia which is projected to happen at the end of 2022 when I will be just  55.Patience is no virtue of mine but, 4 more years to work is not so bad. Is it? I must find a way to not think about retirement or leaving anytime soon. Makes no financial sense and as logical as I am, I should actually be targeting 2022.I think, my life's been a bit boring lately so, I just need to figure out something fun instead of counting down till an illogical time."},

There is a very small budget for home improvement and that's it. I spoke to an architect friend and she thinks she can help me in identifying the true problem so that she can suggest a proper contractor who will do a good job.- I will most likely need to buy a couple of pairs of pants in the summer. Other than those, I will not need any major wardrobe improvement. Small amount set aside just in case.- I will give up the studio when the rental contract is up which is in August. I have decided that I am not comfortable there. It is very noisy at night and most likely adds to my insomnia problem. I miss my home and I want to sleep in my own bed. I will have to get up earlier and most likely hit a good deal of traffic in the morning but, we shall see. After August, I can assume it is all temporary.

The way the new team interact with me like; whether they will see me as a part of the new team or a representative of the old \"regime\".3.

{"title": "The only point is: What are you going to do about it?", "date": "Tuesday, January 9, 2018", "text": "The Management of the company is changing and so are some people's behaviors. It is only natural, I know. Some people want to emphasize their importance. Some want to be \"noticed\" by management. Some are considering changing their jobs. Some want to be just left alone. The new management want to show how bright and smart they are. The consultants they bring talk about things we already know and implement. So on and so forth...Under these circumstances, I can panic, overreact, underreact, resign, show cooperation, be a pain in the butt, etc. There are a zillion ways to react to anything and everything. I can keep cool and have fun or I can get mad and argue.The point is what am I going to do about each and everything that is and, will be happening?Well, to keep my sanity and self-respect, I will consider each situation carefully, decide on a sensible course of action and act accordingly. I will make this my motto and remember it every day.Here are a couple of cases and what I decided to do:Case A: The new management strategy is to go into new areas of business. They asked me to come up with a list of my technical staff who is capable of learning fast and who will adapt to the new subjects easily. A good deal of money will be spent on some training courses and exams. Meanwhile, one of our sales guys told the new CEO-to-be that he is concerned about the capability of our technical team.Now, I can get mad at this person and get into an argument. It is none of his business. I can let the technical team know what he said about them so that they will turn on him. I can tell the new management that he is an idiot not to be taken seriously. Hoever, all of these are destructive and will make me unhappy in the long run.What will I do then?I will keep calm and implement my plan. In case the new management pays attention to what he says, I will just tell them that there has been no incidence where our technical team failed. I will also tell them that if I had any suspicions, I would not take any risks. When I see the sales guy, I will ask him to have coffee with me and tell him that I had been giving him some tips about how to make himself noticed by the new management and that I have always been supportive. I will then ask him to name 3 incidents where our technical team failed him. (He will not be able to). I will also ask him why has he chosen to go up to the new management to talk about his uneasiness instead of coming to me or my technical team leader. I will be gentle and easy on him. However, this will not work. I know what kind of a person he is. So, this type of stuff will keep on happening till the new management comes to an understanding that he is who he is and he should not be taken seriously for such issues. I know that will happen.Case B: One of my technical specialists applied for a position at the vendor we work with and this has been heard both by my soon-to-be ex-boss and our next-CEO. The soon-to-be-ex-boss has heard it a month ago and we handled it on the vendor's side. They could not even invite this person for an interview. The CEO-to-be on the other hand, heard it somewhat recently. This issue has come up at a meeting yesterday evening in an awkward manner.What did I do?I told the people in the meeting that I knew the situation and that there is no real risk that this person is planning to leave.This morning I had a long conversation with the same employee saying that it is only natural that she may want to consider her options, interview for jobs and leave the company for whatever reason. I told her what has happened and she was shocked because the people who were supposed to keep things confidential over at the vendor's did not and one of these people happens to be her cousin. I told her the career path I am envisioning for her and that she needs to be patient just a little more. It was a good conversation.I am sure, I will face with a lot of challenges due to this big change. There will be things that I will be able contain and control, others that I will not be able to. However, my attitude and my approach will be a big determinant of how I will end up feeling. I am hoping to make it easier on myself."},

I got more carrots than I needed so the carrots will be cooked with a handful of rice in olive oil and sauteed onions. I do not like the carrots alone but food is food. I am not going to waste them. Or, may be I should just run them through the food processor and consume the carrots as a salad. We'll see.All morning I have been washing the spinach. I am using the root part of the spinach. You can buy bundles of spinach as a whole, buy prepackaged leaves or buy prepackaged roots. I like the taste of the roots but that's the dirtiest part of spinach. The package I bought said it was washed twice but, the first two washes I gave the veggies turned out pretty muddy. I think my fourth or fifth time will do the trick. Such a waste of water for two servings of spinach! Ugh!I better go and start processing the earth apples.In addition to meal prep, I must wash two loads of laundry, one load of dishes, change my purse (when it starts to weigh a ton, I know I have to empty it and change it) and take care of my pill box for the entire week ahead. Also the dinner table and the little table at the entrance are a mess. Things must be put in place. Nothing too tiring or too significant but chores are chores and they must be taken care of.I just had a very late breakfast with no carbs and I am feeling very energetic.

Chop onions, sautee them in Olive Oil, add tomato paste, add the veggies and simmer till done. I use a pressure cooker instead of simmering to save significant time.I add a handful of rice to the spinach and the earth apples. I consume these two with a quiet a bit of plain yogurt preferably with minced garlic but, I do not eat garlic during the week so, that will be out this time. Besides the grocery store had the Chinese garlic only which I refuse to use. The local garlic so much better.There is no meat in the above list. I like to buy and cook meat fresh. So, I will just figure out what I will eat for meat during the week.I was out of a lot of staples so, I placed an order online to be delivered by noon time tomorrow. I will forgo breakfast and sleep in tomorrow. I have some pasta and meatballs for lunch leftover from today.I bought a butternut squash last week but that will have to wait till next week to be cooked."},

I must touch those up too.It was a dark and soggy day on Sunday so, I did some laundry, spent time on the couch watching TV and dozing off.I will be in Ankara tomorrow and Wednesday. I will have only a few hours to see mom but, that's OK. We'll be together for the New Year.I cannot believe that 2017 is almost over. Personally, it was not a bad year but, I think it was a pretty bad year in terms of economy, unemployment, international relations and general governance of the country. I have a feeling that 2018 will not be much better. The growing tension between the nations for all sorts of stupid reasons make me worry but I will foucus on my life and try to make the best of every single day if I can.It is time for me to come up with the budget of 2018.

Gave him hints as to what he needs to mention. The sooner he thinks he can depend on me as a catalyst in this change process, the better it will be to work together.He and I will have a meeting next week to go over my evaluation. He said since my competency level was beyond the expectation there is not much to work on there. However, you may remember that my EQ turned out to be lower than the normal distribution. So, he offered that if I would be willing to participate in coaching sessions, they will pay for them and I said why not?Let's see if I can \"improve\" my EQ. Lol! I see nothing wrong with being very analytical just like Bones or Mr. Spock but, I do not have a problem receiving some coaching either. EQ is a personality trait not a competence item so, I am not sure if I can improve especially after 50. The reason why I accepted coaching was to make sure I was not rejecting what is considered a positive offer on their side.So, today the team will hear about things from the reps of the Buyer organization.I am sure they are as nervous as we are.

Because, the serious illness I had 3 years ago forced me to try to stay away from stressful situations. That is why Miss T'Pol has joined us, and has taken some of my responsibilities over and thus, I was able to cut my working hours as you may have noticed. In addition, switching off my phone and staying away from e-mail from time to time and taking long vacations were other precautions I have taken to keep away from stress and to avoid the recurrence of my illness.I have taken this decision for two reasons. First, whatever I did, I could not learn to work without stress. I tried but I guess I cannot change that much. Second, I was anxious that my difficulties would slow down the progress of our company. I could not drive an organization which must move rapidly while working the way I was and that would be unfair to all of you.As a result, I will be with you till the end of this year or till the end of January 2018. Our current operations and team will stay the same and even get larger.On this strong foundation ACME will invest in \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" to take our company to a new level.I am sure there is no need to say that my door is open for all your questions.I hope this will bring luck and prosperity to all of us."},

After the Q&A Session we shall go some place to \"celebrate\" this.I am glad that the uncertainty is over. The change that is awaiting us is not worrying me. I know I can handle change one way or the other.From now on, I will be the catalyst between the staff and the new management. I will be answering the staff's questions, helping them get over their anxieties and showing them that business will be as usual. I will also hold the hands of the newcomers and make their integration a smooth one. If I keep a positive attitude about this change and act accordingly, I think it will be so much easier for the others too. If the new CEO or any other management member says or does something which would normally make me mad, I should keep calm and make sure they understand that I am here to help and support them. Being the oldest person on board with 30 years of experience under my belt, I think I should become the trusted advisor of everyone.As I am typing this, my boss sent me the memo he drafted to share with the rest of the staff who will not be here to listen to the announcement. He asked my feedback. It was beautifully written. Open and honest. I should translate it and share it here.I wish and hope that this will mark the beginning of a new and exciting new journey."},

The meal plan was not inexpensive at all.I want to have turkey and eggs for protein this week. I will see what I would like for a vegetable dish.Tomorrow, I will do some cooking to last me till Wednesday night and then I will cook on Wednesday for the rest of the week. I must be very careful about my portion sizes.After I wrote the above, I went to check my pantry and sadly noticed some items way beyond their \"Use By\" date.

It would be great if she could go on a weekly basis\". She also has been dreaming about adding new pieces to her wardrobe. (Before the sale season? No way in my book!)I asked her if she did not have the raise, would she be looking for a better paying job. She said no. She feels comfortable where she is and she thinks the people who left are in for a rude awakening once they settle in their new firm.I asked her what her future plans are with the extra money. She laughed and said \"What? spend it of course!\" I told her wouldn't it be better if she used at least part of it to increase her savings. After all, if the recent changes weren't made, she would be getting her old salary anyway. Then she told me she did not have a savings account.Wait a minute!This woman is 42 years old and she has no savings in her name whatsoever. Every month, she is taking some money off her salary and giving the rest to her husband which is a constant cause of friction between them. She has no idea if he is spending all their money, investing or saving or whatever. Totally clueless! I hope their marriage last till death do them part.

I do not agree with this but I went with the majority's vote. I like receiving and giving gifts.So, last year I decided that I wanted to buy gifts for the children of our security guards, gardener, secretary and our office boy for the New Year.We are not Christian so, we do not celebrate Christmas but somehow Santa or rather \"Noel Baba\" (Father Noel) in our case brings gifts to the children for the New Year on 31st of January. Many people reject and frown upon this idea and do not even celebrate the New Year thinking that it is a Christian thing but I disagree. Besides, I love Christmas and all the festivities.We even decorate a tree at our office.Anyway, I bought gifts for all the children during my lunch break and coming back to the office put the gift for the 4 year old son of our secretary under the tree him without seeing it. He was at the office that day because the nanny was sick.I then pretended that I was talking to Noel Baba on the phone and asked his mother if there was a little boy named let's say Jim around here and when she confirmed that it was her son, I said: Yes Noel Baba, he is here at the office right now. A gift for him under the tree? Yes, yes sure, I will tell him. Thank You! Bye!\"I told the little guy that Noel Baba left a gift for him under our office tree. Since he has a 9 year old brother, he was not very sure if there actually was a Noel Baba. I pulled up a picture of an American friend of mine posted on Facebook. He had dressed as Santa one year for a charity organization. I told him, Noel baba was my special friend. Well, I am serious, I am his mother's boss so, I must be telling the truth right? He totally bought it! :)Our secretary told me today that he was talking to his cousin over the weekend about Noel Baba and the little girl her age was completely rejecting the idea that there was such a person. Our secretary heard her son saying to his cousin: \"No! You are so wrong. There is Aunt T'Pol at my mother's work and she is Noel Baba's wife. She showed me his picture!\"He got his facts a bit jumbled but I got such a kick out of the story that I am still smiling as I type this."},
{"title": "Random Stuff", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "Last week I decided to straighten out the studio apartment.I cleared out all the drawers, the closet and looked at the clothing items, folded them, re-arranged spaces, gathered stuff that I will not be using over the winter to take home, vacuumed the place and by the time I was done, I was very exhausted. How much work could that be? Lol!I finally put together all of the exercise items. This is important because, I like to wash them after one single wear and when I do not know where the next sweat pants are, I tend to wash small loads. That is a waste of energy, water and detergent.As I started, I was thinking may be I needed some more storage space but, I realized that it was not a real need. I use the place only during the week and I have plenty clothing items to shuffle. If I get bored, I can always take some home and bring others.There is one drawer left to clean up. I will be taking some books home. I also need to arrange the shoes. I do not need a whole lot of shoes anyway.The weekend was over very quickly because, I went to the funeral on Saturday and hung around with the family and with my colleagues after the funeral. Due to teh distances, that took all my day.Before going home, I was able to purchase various school supplies to donate to a school in need.I need to pack them at work and ship them. Money well spent.On Sunday, the cleaning lady came and I made sure, my bedroom was cleaned throughly of dust. I had a good night's sleep yesterday night.My closet at my primary home is in desperate need of re-organization and my be this coming weekend, I will feel like doing it."},

However, lately he started to show signs of heart failure and this morning hours after being re-transferred to the ICU, he passed.We knew that he would not recover deep down but we kept hoping.

There are bars as small as 1 gr. Here is what they look like.I like to buy the three kinds at the top row on the right. The ones on the left are too big. The second row is a bit lighter than the ones at the top row and those are mostly used for gifting purposes. I do not buy any of the third row. Bars are good too.In rural areas women prefer to buy 22 ca. gold bracelets with minimal workmanship. They dress modestly and they can actually hide the bracelets in their sleeves thinking that it is a good way of safekeeping. Not! Some like to show their bracelets of during weddings, get togethers and other family occassions. They look like these and those:The heart of gold is the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul and here is a typical jewelry shop window:Here is a picture of the gifts of a bride from a very rural, very rich wedding. This is very rare obviously. Besides, I would not wear most of that stuff if I had been gifted them. Too rural for my taste. Hope you enjoyed this shiny post :)"},

I am going to be off by 2-3%.I have looked at my cash outflow and realized that the fluctuation is due to two things:1. I did not anticipate that I would need work clothes due to the fluctuation in my weight.2. The USD exchange rate fluctuation.I will be better prepared for the wardrobe items this year. However, the exchange rate is out of my control. Lol! Too bad:)Here is a tally of the USD/TL parity at the end of every month this year.          31/1/17  28/2/17  31/3/17  30/4/17  31/5/17  28/6/17  31/7/17  31/8/17  30/9/17   3.7875  3.6978  3.6362  3.5504  3.5312  3.5211  3.5226  3.4410  3.5521 As you can see the difference between the beginning of the year and the end of third quarter is about 6.6%. So, it is difficult to estimate this correctly in Turkish Liras.This year I am going to separate my TL goals from USD goals. My savings are in TL, USD and in Gold. You may ask why Gold? Well, this part of the world is not all that peaceful. God forbid, if s..t hits the fan, one may have difficulty in accessing her/his funds. Gold coins are always worth money. So, I like to keep a healthy number of small coins. As a matter of fact, I shall be purchasing some more when I get paid next month. (We get paid monthly). I shall be setting next year's goals in December."},

Since this is a major change, the current staff needs to be encouraged and motivated to embrace this change and turn it into something that benefits them.

{"title": "Walking!", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2017", "text": "Whenever I walked, I had some back pain which would keep me from walking in the past. Then I went to a doctor to see if I had some real issues. She is an old friend of mine and she told me, my back was not worse than hers. She told me my real problem was a muscle spasm and gave me a shot and I felt 100% better.Then I really did not walk much because it was so hot, because I felt so tired, because I did not feel like walking, you know all sorts of excuses... I also had convinced myself that I were unable to walk due to my weight.When I went on vacation I had to walk enormous distances. On the day we went to see the Freedom tower, we walked more than 15,000 steps! In some other days, I walked more than 12,000. So, obviously I was able to walk! What a revelation!As soon as I came back from vacation and settled down, I decided to start eating healthy and exercise.Within 6 weeks, I lost 4.3 kg, 9.47 pounds. Some of that might have been water weight but still, even if half of it is real loss, I am content. I have been eating very healthy food and have been almost consistently walking. Some days, it is hard. Yesterday, my back acted up again and I am sitting here writing all this with a patch on my back. Today, I will only use dumbbells to work my arms.I am using a MiFit Band II and it's app along with a couple of other apps on my phone to track my progress. Believe me, this was such an eye opener. I have discovered that, I was not literally walking even 1,000 steps some days. OMG! Such a couch potato!I am now taking a short walk at noon right before lunch. About, 2,000-2,500 steps. After work, every other day, I go for a walk for at least an hour. Some days I walk faster, some days I walk slower but the point is I do walk! I have the muscle spasm back again but I know how to fight it off. I will apply Tiger Balm or Ben-Gay or something similar before I go out. I am terrible during the weekends so, now that is my new thing to work on. I should be more active during the weekends.I made a promise to myself: I will spend at least an hour each day exposing myself to the elements. Snow, rain or shine, I will spend time outdoors. Working on it.I have also found out something about myself: I must make something a bit of an obsession so that I can make it a healthy habit. For instance, I had been obsessed about my finances, financial independence and all that. I control my accounts, payments on a regular basis. I have charts to see my progress and to analyze if ı am doing the right things. My financial situation is at a good place now. If I had not been so diligent about that, I do not think, I would have saved as much as I did.So, tracking progress, checking the count of my steps, my pulse and becoming a bit obsessed about these will help me in the long run and assure my success. Obsession is a negative word but there is a healthy dose of that. What do you think?"},

What do you think?I just want these things over with.I have been very happy in this job. I just wish things had stayed the same for another two years. It is not happening. So now what?People generally have issues with big changes. Up until now, I have always considered myself as a more adaptive person to change than many others. But may be I am not? Why am I worried?I can certainly walk away from my job come January and be still OK financially. However, I would like to be at a much better spot than simply be OK. Another two years will make a tremendous difference and I want that. Otherwise, I will most probably go back to consulting for may be at least five more years, if I can.Here is what I want: I want to keep my current job for another two years and then slow down, taking only some select consulting jobs or not working at all.I am wondering what is going to happen?  I am so nervous! I do not want to discuss these with anyone around me so, this blog is the only outlet that I have. When people ask me about what will happen to me I just shrug it off and say that I am not expecting much change. Playing cool. I am far from cool.I just want these things over with!"},
{"title": "How do you define a \"NEED\"?", "date": "Friday, October 6, 2017", "text": "I caught myself searching for a small Microwave Oven the other day. I thought I needed one. I quickly gave myself a shake and asked \"In all of 50 years, you did not need one, use one; how come it is a need now?\"My logical self stepped in and took control and I gave up the search. I truly do not need a microwave. I heat my lunch at work and for dinners, I have been using the stove forever. I have small pots and pans that I use to heat up food.The money I would have spent on a microwave is now working hard for me in my savings account. All is good!Sometimes people say they need a new pair of shoes when they already have 20 pairs, they need a new TV set for a spare room, they need this or that which really are not needs.If I said I needed a new pair of pants, that would not be true. I probably own less than most women but still, that would be a want.All I need nowadays is groceries just for the weekend because, I have started getting the calorie controlled packages during the week again. I also started a new walking routine.When I was in the US, for a couple of days I thought I NEEDED a Fitbit Charge 2. I have a much cheaper device which is working just fine and which actually does not require to be charged as frequently as a Fitbit. Thankfully, I came to my senses before I made that purchase.I must constantly remind myself that I do not need a single item of clothing or shoes for the winter. I do not need gadgets or a new cell phone. I actually need a big \"purge\".I only need a couple of mats for the entrance of my home and my kitchen at my primary residence but even those are not urgent needs. Also, I need a couple of \"good\"pillows.I MUST not spend my money in an unwise manner. I should save as much as possible till the end of the year when the company is going to change hands. It is not 100% yet, but the likelihood of that happening is pretty high."},

The friends I were going to visit used to live in Danbury, CT but after retirement they moved South for tax and climate purposes.I went to the gate and started to wait for my flight. I couldn't help but notice that the aircraft was a small one, kind of like a bus. Well, I do not like those. As I was sitting there, they postponed the flight to three hours later. So, I walked up to the gentleman at the counter to ask why, because the aircraft was at the gate already. He told me it was due to a mechanical failure. Uh!Oh! I became quiet nervous and decided that I would not fly. I immediately cancelled my flight and got reimbursed for it. Apparently Delta is very gentle about nervous fliers.I rented a car at JFK to drop off at Charleston International Aİrport the next day and headed South. I left the airport at 2:15 p.m.Meanwhile my friends in SC were nervous wrecks because, it is a 14-15 hour drive. I assured them that I would definitely check-in to a hotel at night and rest.I drove until 11:00 p.m. with 2-3 short stops and checked in to a hotel north of North Carolina. Next morning I woke up at 6:00 a.m., had a shower and a good breakfast at the hotel. I was at the Charleston Airport by 1:00 p.m.I actually like to drive in the US so, next time, I will definitely do this with better planning so that I will not feel rushed.My friends and I had a very nice time in SC. We visited the Magnolia Plantation and Charleston. Most of the time we just sat and chatted because it had been two years since we had seen each other and although we keep in touch via whatsapp, face-to-face time is important.Photos will follow in the next post!"},

Starting where I left, I continue;After spending a couple of days around my friends' beautiful home, we decided to have a trip to Newport, RI.We booked an inn for a night and headed to Newport. I was still sick and very tired so, I slept through the three hour drive.We bought tickets to visit two of the Newport Mansions (called cottages by the owners) of the Gilded Age: The Breakers and Marble House.I have been to palaces and mansions in Europe and these \"cottages\" were no less in terms of lavishness and in terms of the extraordinary amounts of money poured into them. The families would use these places only for a few weeks during summer months and yet, they were quite the match for French Palaces. Yes, these people earned a lot of money by building railroads in the United States but, spending that kind of money is not justifiable in my opinion. Especially, given that the country faced with the Big Depression in a few decades down the line.Their heirs unfortunately could not deal with the upkeep of these places and now the Preservation Society of Newport County is making an excellent job to keep the mansions in good shape and entertain the curious crowds visiting Newport.You may want to pay special attention to the Platinum Panels below and some pictures:Ceiling- The BreakersThe BreakersPlatinum Panels!The Kitchen- The BreakersChina Cabinets- The BreakersMarble House and the rest of my Newport trip will be the subject of another post"},

I topped my salad with a good portion of poached Norwegian Salmon. For dressing, I used pomegranate molasses and extra virgin olive oil. I am so glad. It was such a filling and healthy salad. I will make variations of this till I use up all my ingredients.To make the fresh produce last, I put them in paper bags and wrap them with plastic baggies they come in, just loosely and put them in the produce section of the fridge.Tonight, I am going to make \"kısır\" which is our version of tabbouleh. I will use up most of the remaining parsley and half of the peppers. We tend to put more bulgur wheat in it. I eat this not as a salad but as a whole one dish meal. It goes best with tea.I will use up the remaining cooked salmon tomorrow. Then I will use a variety of cheeses and some eggs for protein over my salads. I promised myself not to eat anything else before I use the salad ingredients.I had an omelette with cheese and dill weed for breakfast this morning so, I do not need any more protein today.

Some debts they had were in the neighborhood of a total of a few hundred thousand dollars. Yikes!To me it is very scary but these folks were happy and content.I hate debt. I try to avoid it like the plague. I do not have any debt of my own but, I have taken over a couple of payments from a family member because that person is unable to make those payments anymore and we would like to keep the properties in the family.Every single month, I look at those payment schedules and look at the money sitting in my savings account and I start itching to pay them right away to get rid of them both.The sad fact is, one of them is a loan you cannot pay in full. There are exactly 24 months to go on that one.The other is a mortgage of 10 years and it goes well into 2025. Hate, hate, hate that! The only reason why I am not closing the mortgage is that I can still earn more interest in my savings accounts than the interest on the mortgage. It is 10,53% versus 12%. Not a big deal but still... Logic dictates me not to do it.For some people debt is a way of life. For me, it is the Plague. If I say, it gives me physical pain, it is not an exaggeration."},

Well, the company may get sold this time.I was talking to my boss the other day and he was so happy that one of the venture capital firms is interested in buying us out. I assumed, they would buy it but keep my boss in the Management Team but, nope, they want to buy the company 100%. They may or may not want to keep me on payroll when the company is sold. That means my job may cease to exist some time in the coming months.I am really tired of thinking \"what if?\" every few months. So, I hope, this time it works out and I get to learn what will become of me. My boss thinks, they will definitely keep me on board but, I am not so sure.I have decided that I have already thought about my options and there is no use in overthinking. Whatever will happen will happen and I have the savings to deal with it. Now I already feel better!"},

It was unusually cold during the Spring and in June. Then the summer arrived with a vengeance.It is so hot and humid that I can feel gills will be soon forming behind my ears.We had a very bad rain storm last week and most places were flooded. The well at our office got contaminated with backing up neighboring septic systems so now we need to be connected to the city system and giving up using the well.On top of this, the A/C at the office decided to stop working yesterday. I sent all employees home to work from home until further notice till we deal with all this mess. There are only 4 of us at the office trying to make do with a small A/C unit waiting for different types of contractors.Have I ever told you that I hate heat? I should have been born in Norway, Sweden or some place cool in the summer."},

I lived in the US for 3.5 years back in early 90s and I still have very dear American friends with whom I am in constant touch, thanks to the Internet and all those cool mobile apps.Few days ago, my friend in New York hailed me on Whatsapp to find out about my schedule. I always rent a car at the airport when I land. Knowing that, she told me, she would come pick me up at the airport and told me that she and her sister planned that we would stay at her sister's the first night, doing something cool the next day. Her sister lives close to JFK and Manhattan. I know her sister for years and last year she and her husband came to Istanbul and stayed with me. Being from New York, they have been all over Istanbul all by themselves during the day and we had great dinners at night together.My friend insisted that I should cancel the car reservation and save my money. She told me, parking by her sister's is a hassle. Normally, I do not want to drag her around to do my shopping or borrow her car just in case something happens to it. However, she was convincing so, I obliged.The rental car company and the insurance provider both returned my money to my credit card and my credit card now has a positive amount on it. This is probably the first time ever. Weird.I will be staying with her the first 8 days of my visit and then fly to Charleston, SC to visit my other good friend.I also spoke to my boss and told him that I wanted to prolong my visit by another week if he will be around. I have not changed the return day yet. We will have to wait until his plans get finalized."},

You literally have to go up to the unit and point the \"remote\" to make it work.I am not too sure if the thermostat is working properly either. I am going to try and see if it works. Another idea is to move the bed further away from the A/C and keep it running all night.In any case, I do not think, I will need the AC tonight. Hopefully it will be nice and cool at night due to all the rain coming our way.At my other home, the apartment I own, I never need and AC.

{"title": "Mid-Year Assessment of Financial Status", "date": "Saturday, July 1, 2017", "text": "As we have completed the first half of the year, I have decided to look at my financial goals and assess my status.Although there is still time till the end of the year, it looks like I will be missing my Savings Target by 5%.Thinking back, I now know that I had not budgeted for my progressive glasses and the need for some new wardrobe items due to unexpected weight gain. My estimate for charitable giving was also underestimated by the beginning of the year. I paid all the real estate taxes (not as horrible as what you guys have to pay) for all the family owned property. That was also not in my budget.Next year, I will be better at forecasting these expenses. I have already noted them on my budget sheet.Now the question is whether I should update my goal and move forward or wait until the end of the year to see what the real damage will be or whether I can make up for some of the \"loss\". Changing the goal seems a bit like cheating so, I am leaning towards keeping everything as is. This is going to be a reminder of better forecasts."},
{"title": "Locking too much money up?", "date": "Friday, June 30, 2017", "text": "I have realized that I, sometimes leave too little money in my non-interest earning accounts as I approach the end of the month. I am a bit obsessed about keeping nearly all of my money in interest earning accounts.I just had to shuffle some money around to meet the end of month bills because of that.Was it due to unexpected expenses? Not really. I just felt like donating more money to a charity this month and I did not have my infamous budget sheet with me so, I used the wrong account to make the donation. Couple of days later, I realized my mistake and moved some money around in three separate accounts. Thankfully, I did not miss any of the automatic payments and ended up being charged a late fee. That would make me kick myself.In the USA, FDIC insurance is up to USD 250,000 which is great. In this country, it is up to TL 100,000 which is about USD 28,600 these days. So, I have to use a number of banks to keep my money in. I only use reputable banks and usually keep more money than the insured amount. Still, I have to deal with a number of banks and multiple accounts. That makes management harder.Mind you, the interest rates in this country are around 12-14 % for TL and 2,5-4% for USD. That is why, I try to lock my money in interest earning accounts."},

My upcoming visit at the end of August is a good opportunity to do that because, a non-resident cannot open an account online. I know there are some options but, I would like to go with names, I am familiar with.I am looking at Wells Fargo, Citibank and HSBC. HSBC is present in Turkey whereas the other two are not.I am going to base my decision solely upon the following fees:1. Account Fees2. Fees for withdrawal from an ATM outside the USNormally, if you maintain a certain balance, they should not hit you with fees. I have no intention to use this account in the next few years. No fees for a minimum balance of USD 1500 and 2-5 USD per each ATM transaction outside of US is acceptable to me which seem to be the norm from what I have read.I haven't decided as to how much I would like to bring to the US. That is an important decision and I do not want to go overboard with that at least in the beginning. I am thinking of gradually shifting money to such an account.If HSBC makes it easy and cheap to transfer funds between the two countries, I think, I will do business with them. Right now, I am not a customer of theirs in Turkey. I looked it up though and by moving some of my savings to an account with them might prove useful. I have submitted a form inquiring about what I need to know. I will wait patiently till someone gets back to me in 24 hours. Hoping at least...Some of you may ask why I want to do this so, here is why: I am very suspicious about the future of the economy and political stability in my own country. I think the current government is screwing up big time and at one point they may decide to freeze our accounts, limit withdrawals (happened in Greece; a European Union Country a couple of years ago) or decide that our savings in foreign currencies will be converted to the local currency. Or even worse, a civil war may break out because of the stupidity of the Government.Many people do not think any of this might happen but, I am a born pessimist. I would like to park at least some of my money outside of Turkey at a trustworthy organization yet still within reach globally. Better be safe than sorry..."},

He thanked me too and we ended the night at about 11 p.m. chatting and laughing with the team.It is the beauty of a small company doing a very technical job. There are only three problem people and one of them is leaving the company today. The other two work off-site so, the rest of the team can work in harmony and co-operation.My boss is going away for vacation tomorrow and he will not be back before mid-August. He designates a couple of hours each day to communicate with work and the rest of the day, he is radio silent.

So, she sent a normal message to Olivia to get together and talk. She asked why Irene wanted to speak to her and she replied that it was about what has happened and that she felt it was necessary to talk face to face. Olivia never answered her back because she was probably expecting Irene to be apologetic.Then I got fed up with all this nonsensical drama and told the BossMan that this is childish and that Irene should stay at least until the fall till after our vacations. Only then we can look for a new person, get her on board and let Irene go. Meanwhile there are 5 companies looking to buy our company so, may be there is no reason after all to let her go.So, the whole thing is over now.It was silly from the start."},

{"title": "Emergency Funds When You Have Some Passive Income", "date": "Monday, May 29, 2017", "text": "I am a big advocate of Emergency Funds. Even a mini EF with USD 500.- can be very handy in case of an emergency and when you are low on cash.A lot of people have difficulty in determining how much is good enough for a healthy Emergency Fund. This depends on a variety of factors such as the size of the household, one's age, the stability of income sources, whether there is some passive income and how much is available to earmark as Emergency Fund.I have gradually built up my Emergency Fund from USD 1000.- to a very healthy level. I am on my own so, after I passed the USD 1,000.- Threshold, I have targeted to set aside at least three month's worth of expenses as my Emergency Fund. Once I achieved that, I targeted for more. Before I had some passive income, I was at one point, able to set aside a whole year's worth of expenses which was quiet an accomplishment.Now that, I have some passive income, I have a smaller Emergency Fund, knowing that, there is a steady flow of money on a monthly basis.I do not like to disclose my real numbers. So, let's say;Monthly Expenses: USD 4,000 (This should include everything)Rent Income: USD 750SS Payment: USD 1,000Monthly Deficit between Expenses and Passive Income: USD 2,250Therefore, a healthy EF should be USD 2,250 x 12 = USD 27,000If I did not have the passive income, I would have to try setting aside USD 48,000 as an EF.Having an EF to cover a whole year's worth of expenses may be a little too much for some but at my age, finding a decent job with good pay is next to impossible. For younger people with a variety of skills, a three month EF may be sufficient.You may argue that the rent is not a very stable source of passive income but, in my case, I would not have a hard time finding a new tenant in my rental property's area.I am targeting to fully retire by January 2020 which is a little over 2,5 years away. What if I lose my job earlier than that? I will definitely try going back to consulting to see if I can pull in enough income without having to downsize. I would give this a try for at least a year.If that doesn't work, I will definitely downsize. My apartment is already small but it is worth more than a larger apartment elsewhere and my monthly maintenance fees are high. I can easily buy two apartments at the location of my rental property if I sell this one. That way, I would create another source of rental income by renting one of the apartments and living in the other.That means I would have to move out of Istanbul which is something I really do not want to do. So, we shall see what the future holds for me in a couple of years. I just gotta keep saving as much as I can, while I can."},

The first video I listened to was about relaxing and had very low background music. A lady was almost whispering techniques to relax. It helped me get a bit sleepy but not so much. So, I switched to an Irish music video. I probably fell asleep within 15 minutes. Mind you, I was not watching those videos. I was just listening to them.The important thing was I read somewhere that 432 Hz music is better for the body and the soul. It may be a myth. However, on reading that, I looked for 432  Hz.music and found meditative videos and used them.They also say, some people enjoy benefits of 528 Hz music as well. I do not mind the mythical hypotheses about these two frequencies. Whatever floats my boat i.e. puts me to sleep, is OK. If there are true healing powers associated with these, fine. Icing on the cake.I enjoy Celtic music and American Native Music anyhow, so, I will keep on using them to get to sleep.I also checked my sleep pattern and found out that I had at least two solid hours of deep sleep.

They were on the expensive side but I have no choice being the size that I am. Until my visit to the US in late August, I am not going to spend money on anything else.I must go through my wardrobe and shoes to find out what needs to be thrown out and what needs to be donated. This coming weekend is a long one with the 19th being a National Holiday. It is probably the best time to do this.As I was shopping, I got hungry and sat down to have lunch at a cafe. The people sitting next to me were a young girl and a guy with their mothers. Apparently, they have decided to take their relationship to the next level and decided to introduce mothers on Mother's Day. I think that was sweet but, as they were perusing the menu, the girl's mom said something about wanting home-style potato fries. The guy being truly tactless, jumped in to say that they stay away from carbs and gave a long speech about unhealthy carbs. Haha! That is your MIL-to-be you idiot!"},

He told me Irene needs to call Olivia and apologize or at least makes amends with her.Once that is done, he will tell his wife that he gave her another chance.The problem is Irene is very proud. She would rather leave the company than apologize to Olivia who once used to be her good friend. She believes Olivia sent such a stern and mean message on purpose knowing that she would react as she did.I am trying to reason with her telling he that she still needs to work and it is not just her. She has a family and she has responsibilities.I truly do not want her to go and I think BossMan ants to keep her too but his pride has been hurt since he was cc'ed in Irene's backlash.In a few minutes, I will sit Irene down for another \"reasoning\" session.On the other hand, even though I understand why BossMan wants Irene to have a heart to heart with Olivia, I am dreading the outcome of that meeting if Olivia accepts to meet with Irene. Both women are stubborn and proud.What a stupid mess!I will let you know how this ends when I find out.Meanwhile all your suggestions are welcome!"},
{"title": "Never a Dull Moment (Warning: This is a long story albeit an interesting one)", "date": "Wednesday, May 10, 2017", "text": "It seems like there is never a dull moment in my life. Now, I am going to summarize you what I have to deal with:The company I work for is a small company with a very pleasant young boss in his late thirties whom I will call BossMan. There is an assistant who is a nice woman in her early forties whom I will call Irene. Irene is an old friend of BossMan's wife whom I will call Olivia.Apparently, Olivia started to work in this company many years ago and had Irene hired as an assistant. Then Olivia and BossMan fell in love and got married. Olivia left work.After the marriage, Irene was asked to help with the matters of the home gradually such as finding handymans, painters and such. BossMan's mom got friendly with Irene too and she too started asking her assistance in certain matters. (One may argue that none of these were Irene's job but, mind you this is a very small company and as an executive assistant, she was expected to comply with these tasks).At one point, the MIL and Olivia had a falling out in their relationship and both of them confided in Irene who says she tried to keep her distance as much as she could. Of course, she got sucked into it and meanwhile, demands of the two women multiplied. Right about that time Irene and Olivia also had an argument over how Irene was favoring the MIL instead of Olivia. I am not going to argue if that was true or not. Who knows? That is when Irene talked to the BossMan to say that she no longer wanted to deal with the home stuff anymore. BossMan did not like it but he told Irene to stay out of it as much as possible and use the driver to run errands for both of the ladies.This was about two years ago. Olivia and Irene were not talking to each other at this point.Up until now, Irene utilized the driver to take care of many errands without a problem. We have hired a new driver about 5 months ago and the new guy is a bit different than the old one.The new driver is a nervous fellow and is truly being ill used by Olivia and the two helpers working at home. Last week he had been asked to do something which he did not want to or could not do. He asked Irene to do it and Irene blew him off. So, apparently he complained to Olivia about this and Olivia sent a very stern and mean message to Irene. Irene operates on a somewhat short fuse and sent an equally stern message back to Olivia, keeping the BossMan in cc.Come Monday, BossMan came in to work, noticeably upset. He really likes Irene and they had been working for almost 10 years together. He wanted to talk to me and said that he is compelled to let Irene go because of the way her message was worded. He felt stepped over.Now, I do not want Irene to be fired because, Irene has two kids at 4 and 12 years of age. Has a mortgage and a car payment. She is well liked by the team members and her leaving would be very upsetting.I told the BossMan that he should not take what Irene fired back personally and that we should figure out a way to keep Irene. He was reluctant at first but since he is a good guy, he somewhat relented.More on this tomorrow...Yesterday, I walked home (if you can call the studio apartment that) and managed to get in my 5,000 steps overall.Walked 10 minutes Sat 3 MinutesWalked 28 minutes Sat 8 MinutesWalked 5 more minutesNormally, this should not take more than 20 minutes. Until, I can walk this distance in 20 minutes and without stopping, I will keep my daily walking goal at 5,000 steps. Pushing too much at 50 can be harmful.However, leaving the car at work turned out to be a bad idea. I wanted to walk back to work this morning but, it was raining. So, I called the company driver and luckily he was able get me. Since it was raining, finding a cab would be impossible."},

However, I did chores around the apartment and spent both days constantly moving.I was able to get rid of more clutter but, I think a few more rounds of this activity is necessaryOn Saturday, I managed to order new glasses. I ordered a pair of sunglasses too. That is my birthday present for my 50th  birthday coming up in June.Progressive lenses are so darn expensive. If I were not working full time, I would consider using regular glasses for driving and reading separately. I am working so, one pair of glasses that I can wear all day long is much more manageable than two and I can afford them.I do not have visual coverage in my insurance and the Government pays only a laughable amount of money so, I do not even try to use that coverage.Yesterday, I brought lunch from home. It was enough for two meals so, I am having half of the veggie dish I brought today too. I walked 5,000 steps yesterday but it was more walking from store to store at a huge mall rather than walking at a steady pace.If the weather permits tonight, I will walk again, this time at a steady pace. My back hurt for a while yesterday night but the pain subsided later on."},

I do not care, if you have to take breaks every few hundred yards, if your back hurts or if you burst into tears like a spoiled kid. Chop, chop! Start moving!\"I have decided to start walking 5,000 steps each day and gradually go up to 10,000 steps as recommended by the doctors. I am going to check the indoor pool at the apartment complex. I found out that, they clean it on Mondays so, I can at least go for a swim on Tuesday and Wednesdays. I do not like pools thinking they are icky.Yesterday, I walked 5712 steps in total. 3504 steps were exercise related.I am going to share the tally of my exercise here every day so that, I have a record of it.23 min walk 7 min rest10 min walk 13 min rest14 min walkMy ultimate goal is to be able to walk for an hour straight without resting and walk over 10,000 steps every day."},

Good workmanship is a must so, I just do not go anywhere to get my new glasses. Both my eyes have different degrees. I also have astigmatism in different degrees in both eyes.

I use progressive lenses and they are so darn expensive. I desperately need a new pair of sun glasses too.I have been wearing glasses for 42 years and I probably could have bought a nice car, may be even a small apartment with the money spent on glasses all these years.Thankfully, I always earmark a certain amount of money for glasses every year for spring months since that is when I go to the eye doctor annually. Last year, my prescription had not changed so, I was able to save that money. This year, it will have to be spent.My current lenses were a bit scratched so, I guess it is time to get a new pair of glasses anyway. Tomorrow, I will be ordering two new pairs of glasses. Mom will help me choose.I do hate to spend money on glasses, clothing, home repairs, cars and etc. The only thing I do not mind spending money on, is travel. I love to travel but still, I budget my travels very carefully to make sure I get the best deals at the best possible prices. This is my only luxury.At my age, my friends are either paying for school tuitions or expensive home mortgages or may be both. Some of them go to expensive hair saloons, spend too much on new cars, dining out a lot and etc.I own my two apartments free and clear and the debts I am currently paying are not mine. I am paying them (30 months on the bigger one and  94 months on the smaller one) because I can and feel like it is my duty. I am currently driving a company car so, I have no car expenses. I own a 2010 Nissan Note that my uncle drives mom around in Ankara.I am spending about 19% of my income on two separate debt payments and saving 45%. The rest goes to living expenses, utilities, insurance payments, and a small amount for taxes on the rental property I have. Taxes are automatically deducted so, there are not tax payments. This set-up allows me to have two vacations per year and I am content with this."},

We will spend the weekend with them and on May 1st, we will catch the evening ferry from Cesme, Izmir to Chios Greece. I had been there before just for a weekend and loved it. It is a nice little island with very friendly people, great food, nice beaches. Much much cheaper than Cesme for sure.We shall be staying there until Friday coming back with the evening ferry. It takes about 35 minutes from Cesme to Chios.Then we shall spend Friday evening and Saturday with my SIS and BIL. Mom will stay with them. I shall come back to Istanbul alone.I have booked a rental car in Chios. They do not offer any automatic cars at all. Thankfully, I can drive a stick shift since, automatic cars became popular and available mostly after the 2000s in Turkey too.I am hoping to be able to take quick dips in water despite the fact that it is still too cold for most people.This is my \"vacation with mom\" of the year. Last year, it was Milan, Italy.Depending on mom's mood and our health, I am hoping to take her to visit Scotland next year. It is a place I would like to see very very much.

Also the eye doctor told me my eye pressure was higher than usual and she wanted to follow that because, that can lead to glaucoma. So, I must be back in a month.I made an appointment with an endocrinologist for the TSH and he wanted some tests suspecting Cushing's Syndrome. So, the tests will be done tomorrow.No wonder I was not able to lose any weight lately. Also, this is a likely explanation for my insomnia too.I am hoping that, I do not have anything bad.

I still have some more to eat but, the rest is going in a strawberry sauce barely sweetened with a little sugar and vanilla.I am done with laundry and am almost out of laundry detergent. I must make a list since, I see I am out a few other things as well. Like there is no salt either. Since I will be bringing mom on the weekend, I must stock up on some things.

The traffic was horrid and by the time I got home, I felt doing absolutely nothing.Bathroom cabinets are 1/3 done. Tomorrow is another day.All the curtains are down. Some of them are in the wash and some are already back up again! Unlike  my mom, I do not iron my curtains. They do not get wrinkled so bad and as soon as they are out of the washing machine, I hang them so, I can get away with not ironing.The electronical items are all in a big IKEA bag ready to be taken to work.I thought some curtains needed to be replaced but I am surprised to see that older curtains are still looking better than some of the new ones. Anyway, I have decided to postpone the curtain business till next year. Money saved!Actually, there is a curtain outlet and what I buy are generally very inexpensive so, we are not talking big bucks here. Once I had renewed the entire living room curtains at just USD 85 including sewing. My curtains hang from the ceiling to the floor so, we are talking about a lot of fabric. Many people praised me on how beautiful my curtains looked and could not believe how cheap they were. I tell them where the outlet is and all they have to know is the measurements before they go, select the fabrics and order them. Almost always, they end up not going and spending a lot more money for mediocre looking curtains. What can I say? They must be growing money on trees.I could not get a hold of the guy to put a new curtain rod in the kitchen. May be he quit? I do not know. Well, no rush.I think, I still want to go that art exhibit opening. There are a couple of curtains I want the cleaning lady to hang back up and then, I can take a shower and get ready. Depending on the traffic, I may leave the car on this side and cross the Bosphorus on a ferry and then take a cab to the Art Gallery."},

My walls are concrete and I need a power drill which I do not have.- Do one load of laundry.Tomorrow:- Wash all the curtains and put them back up (Actually, I would like to replace some curtains later in the year so, while they are down, I can take measurements)- Throw away junk and clean up the bathroom cabinets- Clear out all the old electronics, put them in my trunk to bring to work- Take a shower, dress up and head for the opening of the art exhibitionI am planning to sleep as much as I can on Saturday night late into Sunday. I will tell my family not to call and I will turn off the volume of my mobile phone.I think, this is enough for this weekend. I am definitely not cooking.

Sudden afternoon showers followed by sunshine that made everything sparkle in April. They are no more...Human kind must have seriously messed up the ecosystem. During the last few months, I have started having difficulty sleeping well. I sleep only a few hours every night and very lightly. I keep waking up for no reason at all. The studio apartment I am keeping to stay during the week is noisy so, I was blaming the noise mostly but, it is not just noise.When I stay at my primary residence, I get to sleep a little better but not as good as I used to.Can this be the footsteps of menopause? Can it be something else bothering me without me being aware of it?The other day, I looked at the mirror and was shocked to see how tired I looked. This weekend, the cleaning lady will come on Saturday. I will do my best to tire myself out just to see if I will have a good night's sleep at night. A childhood friend has an art exhibition opening on Saturday as well.

I will bring the rest to work to see if technical guys may make use of them.I am also going to bring an old printer which only works as a scanner and an extremely old laptop to work.I need to look through my books to see what can be donated. Anything that accumulates dust is my enemy ha ha! (insert evil laughter here)I think, I can give away some old towels and linens too since the drawers are overflowing.Bathroom cabinet is also one of my targets.You see, there is still quiet a bit to be done but handling them in small chunks truly works. Now, I do not see this as an overwhelming task. Also, I do not create a big pile of mess at once. One drawer, one box, one cabinet at a time with frequent breaks is easy. When I am done with a box, it goes back to where it belongs so, ne mess, no fuss, no kicking myself for being sloppy."},

Apparently business owner graduates have a group of their own to do business and help each other. It is a nice thought but, I do not know if it works well.

{"title": "My Budget Now", "date": "Thursday, March 30, 2017", "text": "I use an Excel File with several sheets. One sheet is dedicated to the budget, another one shows my Net Worth, another contains several account, pin, password info, another is vacation planning, some others are dedicated to following certain financial indicators like exchange rates of some hard currencies I invest in, the stock market historical data, gold prices etc. Needless to say the Excel is password protected.On my budget sheet, the top few rows are for my income. For the time being, I have a regular salary, a retirement income and a rental income there.Several rows are dedicated to monthly expenses and bills such as utilities, taxes, insurances, vacations, cleaning lady and etc. I have a general category for spending that includes all my grocery spending including personal hygiene items and clothing needs plus eating out. This entry is not exactly the same for each month. I know when I usually shop for clothing so, I bump up the numbers a little bit for those months. I have never been able track every penny and make a zero-based budget.My budget guides me not to over-spend and save each month. My savings are also on my budget so I know exactly what I am saving and how.I have an Emergency Fund, a TL savings account, a USD savings account, and a Retirement Fund in addition to a small stock portfolio in an investment account. Each month I allocate some money to all these accounts as soon as I get paid so, I do not overspend. If anything is left over at the end of the month, I put that sum into one of my savings accounts. For instance if the stock exchange is doing poorly, I buy stocks, if USD is comparatively lower, I buy US dollars, etc.I also have a row for gifts and a row for charity. I know when I will be buying birthday and New Year gifts so, I plan ahead. I also give planned sums to charities every month. This is so much easier to manage.With a click of the mouse, I can tell my yearly income and how much I need for the entire year. My forecast is accurate by +/- 2-3% which is sufficiently manageable.So far, this approach has worked for me. My budget extends to several years ahead. I know things may change but, I like to be able to plan and project big expenses of the mid-and long-term. By looking at my projection, I can calculate when I would like to call it quits and fully retire without having to work ever again. There are still a few years for that:)If you have a budget; is it monthly, yearly or longer term?"},
{"title": "My budget when I was a kid", "date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2017", "text": "For some reason, even when I was really little I liked to count my money, separate it into categories as to what I would like to do with each little sum.Both my grandparents were very generous and for the two religious holidays we celebrate, they both gave me the highest valued banknote in circulation. Imagine being 7-8 and receiving USD 100 each from your grandmoms for Easter. Other relations would also give smaller amounts and after the holiday, I would feel filthy rich! Lol!My mom still laughs at  the \"pleasure\" category my budget had. Well, I still have that category with the name of \"Misc. and Fun\"I do not quiet remember my exact budget categories but mom remembers it went like this:Books (I was an avid reader and although mom bought me a book every week, it would never be enough. If the book was \"thin\", I would beg her to buy two and usually succeeded at that)Clothes and accessories (Although mom bought me everything, every once in a while I wanted to buy myself something that I chose myself such as fancy socks, hair accessories or something small like that)School Supplies (Again, my folks bought what I needed but, I bought things I wanted.) I think choosing something on my own and paying for it from my pocket used to make me feel very grown up.Pleasure (could be used for anything from buying treats for myself or treating friends to ice cream to buying story books or little toys for my baby sister)Gifts (I would set aside money to buy gifts for Mother's and Father's Days and birthdays)Savings (Even then, I was a saver)I disliked sharing how much money I had even with my parents. I always thought it was a private matter and I still do believe that. So, I am amazed at the people who open their finances to others in their blogs. It surely makes their stories more believable and honest but, telling the world how much money or debt I had? Forget it! Not my thing. Only my sister has a general idea about how much I have.I will talk about how I handle my budget as an adult later. Do you have a budget? Have you had budgets as a kid?"},
{"title": "Married Life Finances Mom and Dad Style", "date": "Tuesday, March 28, 2017", "text": "Since I have always been on my own, I have made all my financial decisions myself. How is it with married people? Is it \"our\" money or is it \"your money and my money separately\"?A post over at One Family One Income gave me the idea to talk about how my mom and dad handled their finances before the days of personal computers, Internet banking and automated payments.In my country personal checks were never a thing; that is probably why it was so easy to get used to automated payments and internet banking once they became available. Even credit cards date back to very late 80s.So, how did my folks handle the finances?Both my parents were paid on a monthly basis as is the custom in this country. My father used letter sized engineering papers (square printed) as his \"spreadsheet\". Each payment and due date would be marked on it. They would bring in their salaries in cash, set aside the necessary amounts for each bill first. The remaining amount would be set aside for groceries and clothes shopping and etc. Since I was going to a private school, there was not much left to be saved but mom would always manage to save some money for the rainy days or surprise vacations. They would each take some pocket money.Since there were no personal checks, all bills had to be paid in person usually having to stand in line. Thankfully, there weren't so many bills in the past.We would not have much money for long vacations but, my dad's workplace had a couple of places ran sort of like a primitive resort at a low cost by the seaside and we used to go to one of those places where my folks later bought a summer apartment when my dad retired. We were always sent to my grandparents on my mom's side each summer. They had a house and a nice garden so, it was always a pleasure. Besides, my grandma on my mom's side was my favorite person in the whole wild world.The spreadsheet for the particular month and all the money left over from the bills would be kept in a tea tin. It was a purple tin may be Ridgways or Twinings, I am not so sure:) Small savings or may be a small Emergency Fund would go into a cigarillo box just to keep it separate.They worked for Government Agencies so, their pay was not great but, very stable. We lived in a company apartment my dad's workplace provided at a very small cost. It was less than a quarter of a regular rent. He used to walk to work because our apartment was in a campus where he worked. Mom and I and later, my sister had to take a bus into the \"city\" to get to work and school.They have sacrificed a lot putting us through a private school just because they believed in a decent education. Luckily we never were in the private school simultaneously. I graduated, my folks took a nice vacation as a late honeymoon and the following year my sis started school.As soon as I started working and earning money,  I started to contribute to our household income too. because, I was living at home, my sister was going to the same private school I had attended and my folks were making payments for an apartment for their retirement.Looking back, we were really lucky to have such great parents. So, rest in peace Dad and long live Mom!"},

Onions, bell peppers, garlic, leftover celery, Brussel sprouts and a small thing of broccoli. Just what I had on hand.I like it as it is or served with some garlic yogurt on top of it. Sometimes I take a cup of it and chop it into smaller pieces and add two eggs on it to make some sort of a veggie omelette or a frittata.Sometimes I prepare some pasta and mix it with it. Or add stir fried chicken.I never make the same mixture. It all depends on what is fresh at the grocery store at a good price. Stir fried veggies are such a simple yet versatile thing to have.This week I am planning to eat more veggies.

Since it is going to rain I asked her not the wash the windows from the outside. Doing everything in a day is not possible.The kitchen counters were a mess and it really is sad because, that custom kitchen had cost me two arms and two legs. As soon as the cleaning lady came in and started in my bedroom, I cut up my veggies and stir-fried them for Monday and Tuesday meals. Then, I started the dish washer. When she cleans the kitchen there will be nothing out of place.I am actually proud of myself because, I am usually very lazy as far as housework is concerned.I know that there are still tons of stuff that I need to get rid of. In the past I used to change jobs frequently and sometimes that meant moving. So, with each move, I used to get rid of unnecessary stuff every 2-3 years. Now that I have been living in my primary residence mostly since 2004, clutter is taking over. There has been a couple of years I worked in Ankara but I used to come home every month so, I had never really moved. These days, I am staying at the studio during the week but always coming home for the weekend.I must make a To Do List. I also want the cleaning lady come every two weeks. It is not that big a cost (here in this country) and since I am especially allergic to home dust, I think I should spend the money. Besides the poor girl needs to work especially hard when I do not call her on a regular basis. I keep noticing this and that to be fixed around my home. For instance, I need a new toilet seat cover which I will hopefully buy today.Also the floors desperately need to be changed but I think I may postpone that business till next year when I will need to have my walls painted. I will try not to stare at the floors:)"},
{"title": "Trying different things for breakfast", "date": "Saturday, March 25, 2017", "text": "In Turkey, a standart breakfast would almost consist of white cheese (similar to feta but not quiet so sharp), black and green olives, eggs, some variety of mostly homemade jam, honey, butter, toasted or fresh bread and tea, brewed the way we like it.On the weekends it could be much richer with additional varieties of cheese, some pastries, may be crepes, Turkish sausages and lunch meat type of stuff. Especially, if you go out to eat, they usually stuff you. Dried fruit, egg dishes, walnuts and such are served also.To give you an idea, a sunday brunch would look typically like this:Of course, we do not have such rich food every day. My daily breakfast is a cheese sandwich made in a sandwich maker, 4-5 olives and tea. May be some cucumbers and tomatoes.So, I have decided to try different things lately. For instance today, I had two hard boiled eggs and an avocado.I also like oatmeal, a habit I picked up living in the US. A typical Turk would not like it.Tomorrow is going to be a real treat. I had brought Organic Grade A Maple Syrup from my last visit to the US. So, I will be making pancakes and top them with Maple Syrup.It is possible to find Maple Syrup here but they are usually grade B and extremely expensive. So, whenever I travel to the US, I take two cylindrical detergent containers with me and put the maple syrup in them tucked in safely with lots of plastic bags. Never had a leakage.I also happen to like all sorts Peanut Butter Sandwiches, again a habit picked up in the US.Do you have different breakfast habits? What do you like to have for breakfast?"},

I had talked about this person at work being very childish and irresponsible right? Well, at about 9 p.m. she called in a frenzy. She talked about a mishap at work and blew it out of proportion such that I was totally upset about the unprofessional manner one of our technical people handling a Customer request. I was led to believe that we f.cked up big time and that both our partner and our Customer are extremely upset.Although, I did not think about this consciously, my brain kept me from a good night's sleep. I had a terrible night. Tried reading and it didn't work. Tried listening to an audio book to put me to sleep and nope, that didn't work either.So, I came to work in a not-so-great mood.We were supposed to address the issue the first thing in the morning and I started waiting for the promised conference call. A half hour passed and I found out that yesterday's caller was talking on the phone to the Team Lead and the person who was supposedly the cause of the problem was not there. I normally do not get cross with people but this time I did. I told them to get their act together and tell me starting from the beginning what the issue was and what kind of an action the Customer was expecting. They were a bit surprised and \"heart-broken\" because I was cross. Anyway, at the end of a half hour of discussions, I found out that the situation was not so bad after all.I drafted a heart-felt apology along with a new method to comply with requests from the Customer side so that, this type of a problem would not happen again.Why did I have to write it? For some reason a lot of educated people have trouble expressing themselves in their native language. It is such a shame that they were able to graduate primary school let alone High School or College.Sorry for the rant but I just had to let it out!I am hoping to catch up on my sleep over the weekend."},

I will still keep my budget modest.I will be taking three weeks off. A week off late April, early May with mom, sis and BIL. We will go to Chios for three days and then stay in Izmir until the weekend. That will be my vacation with mom this year.Later in the year, I will be going to the US for two weeks. I have already bought my ticket from Istanbul to New York at USD 470.-. That is a very good price.I also booked a ticket from NY to Charleston, SC at USD 204.- Last time I drove and ate away too much time. Not doing it this time. Besides, it is less expensive.Who am going to visit? Well, I have been friends with these amazing people since early 90s. The couple who live upstate NY used to be co-workers at a Turkish-American JV I used to work for. My friend living in SC now used to live in CT and she was also a co-worker at the same place. Over the years, her husband became a friend too and we have kept in touch in all these years despite the fact that I moved back to Turkey in 1992. Now that we have Whatsapp and Facebook, we communicate regularly. In the past we used to write long e-mails but they were not so frequent.The couple visited Turkey once in all these years and the others never made it here. It is a bummer but it is life... Work, kids, health issues prevented them.Whenever I get a chance, I like to go visit them. I am going to be 50 this year so, I do not know for how long I will be able to keep this up financially and healthwise."},

{"title": "No I am not spending another penny on real estate", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2017", "text": "The other day my sister called and said they found a real nice apartment right behind their apartment complex in Ankara and that the layout was great and so was the workmanship. Then she asked me how much would I be willing to shell out if they decided to buy it.I considered it for a moment and told her that now that I am paying off the debt in place of another family member just to keep one apartment and one house in the family, I did not have money to spare especially given that my job is also on shaky ground. I told her I could sell the apartment in Ankara and give her that money.Then it struck me that; I have no intention to go live in Ankara for the foreseeable future. My sister and brother in law already have a 4 bedroom apartment that they keep empty in Ankara and they are now living in Izmir due to their work situation without knowing if and when they will be able to return to Ankara. My mom is living in her own apartment and when we had offered her to move to my sister's apartment, she had declined. The same offer was made to her father-in-law who has also declined.So, can anyone tell me why we need to buy this apartment?I told my sister that there will always be apartments for sale in that new complex in the future. Why would we buy it now? To keep it empty or just to rent out?She agreed with me. I told her to look for something in Izmir, where they live now so that, they can get rid of paying rent. That makes much more sense. However, I know that the prices in Izmir are very inflated. Therefore, it is difficult to do that.Until the end of 2019, I am not open to any ideas to buy real estate."},
{"title": "Costs of Not Paying Attention", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2017", "text": "I am the kind of person who believes that everyone must manage every aspect of their lives. Am I good at it? No. I do not pay enough attention to my weight for instance.However I do pay attention to my bills, as to when they are due, whether there are charges that I do not recognize on my credit card, the tax calendar, my car, the tires and fluids and etc.Yesterday a friend of mine called and she told me she had found out several charges on her credit card statements that she did not recognize and that this had been going on for a while.This has happened to me only once. The crooks charge your card with a small amount pretending that they are one of the 3 large telecom companies. If it goes unnoticed, it becomes an automated charge on your credit card.I check my credit card transactions almost daily because the earlier you challenge a charge, the easier it is to get rid of it. It has happened to me once but I immediately recognized it since I do not do business with that particular operator. Even if I did, I would have still recognized it since I use one bank to make automated payments for those types of expenses. I do not use my credit card.I asked her whether she has a system to follow up on payments, upcoming expenses, savings etc. She said she did not. She asked me whether she could use my system. She is very welcome to use it but over time I have added several formulas, graphs and etc to it so she has to know how those work.I told her that once I get back from my travel over the weekend, I would sit down and help her with my chart so that she can use it. The key word is to \"use\" here. Unless you put in every single bill on it, you can never be sure of what is happening. I do not track my monthly grocery expenses. I just have a lump sum amount that would take care of groceries, eating out and non-food items. It is a set amount and I take great care not to exceed it. If I have money left over for that category, it goes to savings at the end of a particular month.I hope my friend can deal with those charges and get them lifted."},

Retired people get paid every quarter unless they opt to be paid their retirement pensions on a monthly basis. Mom likes to get paid quarterly. She is used to budgeting that way and saves quiet a bit of money each quarter.I love February because we get paid in 28 days :)My salary is paid on the last day of the month, my retirement pension is paid on the 24th and my tenant pays the rent on the 16th of every month.The large portion of my payments are due at the beginning of each month. Small expenses are scattered throughout the month. I diligently keep a budget and know exactly how much money should sit in my checking account for automated payments. Missing a payment because of sloppy tracking is a no, no in my book. After all, this is not rocket science.My largest income comes in on the last day of the month so, this makes it very easy for me to set aside what has to be paid out before the rent money and pension comes in. I also set aside money for expenses and the rest goes into savings directly.At the end of the month, right before I get paid my salary, I transfer the remaining balance in my checking account into savings and calculate my progress.Every month, I look at my numbers and enjoy seeing a steady upward trend in my savings.If I find myself out of the door when the company is sold, I will not be able to enjoy this any longer. So, I am trying to make the best of it while I can.I spoke to my boss this morning and he told me that he is now expecting the big company to give him an offer for ours. Yikes! This is too soon! I hope, the negotiations last at least until June. The big company has to go through some legal hoops since their stocks are traded both in Turkey and abroad. I just hope, that takes a looong time.After that, I will try to hold onto my job as long as I can. There will be a transition period, I am sure.

I told her I no longer wanted to continue the conversation and that I lacked empathy and if she is so persistent, I would be more than happy to wire her the said amount of money out of my very own pocket so that she can shut up. Or else, she can take the issue up to our boss. She said she would not think of going to the boss. Yeah! Right! As if she hasn't already done that. What a liar! Just yesterday, she had complained about me and the boss put his foot down and told her that what she wanted was not just to others and rules were rules. Yet, she is asking again even after the boss said \"no!\".What an idiot!

She has exceeded her limit for entertaining customers by about 25% of what is allowable last month. So, I have deducted that amount from the Expense Form and sent it to Accounting.She has written me several loooong e-mails as to why she did not know the procedure, why the limits are still the same and why, why, why.... All nonsense! I just cannot understand why she has trouble accepting her fault and shut up and move on. She wants me to let go of her mistake. How is that fair to others? How is that fair to my boss?On top of that, due to a sales goal achievement, a partner has offered to take one person on a weekend trip to a neighboring country. I had offered the trip to another sales person who actually achieved the sales quota but he declined. So, I had offered her the trip and she enthusiastically accepted. Today, I realized that she thought the company would pay the extra expenses. This is a little vacation. It is not like, I am making her go on a mission.

It is just bizarre, that is all.She also called our assistant and cried (literally cried, folks) on the phone telling her that I was not being fair to her.My boss, the owner of the company, being fully aware of the situation, sent her a firm message telling her what is what.I feel like going to Ankara, to the office, grabbing a fistful of money from my purse and throwing it at her!

{"title": "It's the little things and a non-inflated life style", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "I have been a frugal person most of my life. There was a period, I was not concerned about money but, I had a rude awakening and figured it out the hard way and went back to my frugal ways.It is always nice to put aside big chunks of money from a savings perspective if you can. However, many people do not realize the importance of little things. For instance, I have just changed my wi-fi and cable provider. I technically do not need a cable provider but when mom visits, her shows are important and I feel compelled to provide her what she needs. Right before the end of last year, I went through my routine bills and tried to find good year end campaigns to lure customers into changing providers. I found a good deal and signed up for it. Now, I am paying 30% less than what I was paying for wi-fi and cable separately. Also, I am getting one invoice for both things. Works for me!Last year I had also changed the cell phone company for me and mom. It was based on political reasons but I was able to get better pricing so, it was a double-win. I cut ff my relationship with a provider I dislike and lowered my bills. Mom uses a phone in my name and she is on the cheapest possible plan. That is still more than she needs.I like the advice the Ultimate Cheapskate gives. He basically tells you, when you are in your thirties and when you have reached a sufficient income level, stay there. Even if you make more money, keep your budget the same and bank the extra. I think, this is very sound advice.During the last two years, I had been earning real well when compared to the past. I have not let my spending get out out of control, despite the extra money. I splurged once with my kitchen renovation and may have surprised my family members with some gifts that they did not expect. That is all.So, when I looked at my Net Worth and Savings graph for the last 10 years, I have happily noticed that, I have bought an apartment and now own it free and clear, bought another apartment and still paying the mortgage on it and did two major renovations in my primary residence within the last ten years. The best thing is; I have more than quadrupled my savings during the last two years. I will probably be able to pull this income may be for another 6 months-2 years. So, I am in a super-saver mode now. Still, I have room for small indulgences in my monthly budget like a nice dinner out with friends, couple of  bottles of wine etc. I can save over 50% of my current income. However, this has happened to me just recently. Before 2015, I was never able bring in this much income and save at such a rate. So, while it lasts, I am determined to be smart about it.Our company is at the verge of being sold. It may or may not happen. If it does get sold, I have a feeling that, the new owner which is a big company may let me go in a fairly short time. My boss thinks otherwise. So, if I last until the end of this year, that is really good. If I can last another year, that will be wonderful. However, I would need to go back to consulting for a few years more since, I am paying a family member's debts to keep an apartment and a house in the family. I am not asking for any help at the moment from mom or sis but I know, they are ready to jump in if I lose my job.The ideal scenario for me would be to be able to work at my current job until the end of 2019. If not, I will probably have to work until 2023 doing consultancy. It is an irregular income but still, instead of eating away my savings, that is something."},

In addition to their sales goals, there are a couple of apps that they must use. If they do not, they are fined by a small amount deducted from their bonuses.So, this year, she did really well and earned a bonus of say USD 30,000 (that is not the real number). However, since she did not use one of the apps required, USD 750 was deducted from the above number. A normal adult would say \"it was my fault, now I have to make sure I pay attention to these things\" right? No. She has sent whiny e-mails to our boss and he put his foot down. He forwarded those messages to me saying that he had no intention to budge.I went up to him and asked if he had conveyed his message openly. He showed me the document he has sent her at the beginning of the last year and even forwarded me that message.So, today I had a discussion with her and I scolded a 50 year old woman that she was acting in a childish manner and she keeps doing this even when she knows that our boss loathes this type of behavior.Whenever there is an issue that she is not right, instead of owning the failure, she whines and sometimes even cries.

I helped my friend pick the shirts. When it comes to men's fashion, I am pretty good.I did some shopping too and after we were done, I dropped my friend at the Metro station and headed home. The rest of the weekend, I did absolutely nothing other than preparing myself food, coffee and tea. I rested and took it extremely easy.I should have taken care of some much needed tasks but just did not feel like doing them.I guess the best part of living alone is that, one has absolutely no obligations around the home. It is my life, my schedule, my budget... I am thankful that I have the skills, means and health to be able to make my own life. I hope never to be dependent on others even in old age. Amen!"},

I loved her more than anyone in my family. Literally, more than even my parents.She was a very frugal person since she always had a small budget to work with. She had lost her father when she was just two months old and never had extra money to spend on wants. She always had to operate on a modest budget from one income raising three children after she got married.She never purchased ready pajama sets up until she could no longer sew. She would buy flannel pajama fabric in bulk and would sew both my grandfather and my uncle their pajamas for winter and would use a lightweight cotton fabric for summer pajamas. They never had more than two pairs of pajamas for any season because they did not NEED more. When one set was washed, the other would be worn.When the pajamas started getting old, she would cut them up to use as rags for various cleaning jobs and would tear parts of the pajamas into strips to tie beanstalks and tomato vines.She would always salvage the buttons and zippers to use them again on other sewing projects.Despite being so frugal, she was no hoarder. She never owned more than necessary and never had to throw out excess which did not exist.She sundried apricots, plums, zucchinis, bell peppers and made her own jams from her bountiful garden, made pickled grape leaves to stuff. She knew her prices and would not spend more money for out of season produce.She was both a great cook and a great baker. She did not like housework but would do it impeccably and be done with it early in the morning so that she could have time for knitting or reading. Was an avid reader.We had a great routine when I was little. After lunch, she would listen to the news broadcast at 1 p.m. and then we would nap. We would read or do some art projects together until 4 p.m. to have our tea and while we had tea, we listened to children's plays adapted for radio. After that, we would head out to the playground and wait for my grandpa to come back from work and do some gardening before dinner.Life was simple, enjoyable and full of love. I had the best grandparents ever..."},

However, that does not stop me from making a yearly budget and plan my savings.How do I make my budget? I have a spreadsheet. Each month is a column and each row is either an income or an expense. I group the incomes on top of my columns. Each income ends up in a separate bank account so the rows are named in accordance with those banks. I also group the expenses in accordance with which banks they are on automated payment. This way, I can see at a glance whether I have enough money in a specific account for each expense.My income sources are: Social Security, Rent and current job.My expenses are:Mortgage payment for apartment #3Rent for the Studio apartment I reside in during the weekDebt taken over from a family memberElectricity, Heat, Water, Administration (Rented Apartment + Main Residence)Insurance (Apartments 1,2 and 3 plus car)Cell Phone (mine and mom's)Cable TV (mine and mom's)TaxesVacationCredit Cards (2)MiscellaneousSavingsCar MaintenanceHome MaintenancePersonal Retirement FundIn order to save for the future, I have a Turkish Lira Savings account, a USD saving account, a gold savings account and a Personal retirement fund along with a very small stock market portfolio. Oh and a few gold coins that I keep in a safe. All of them constitute my investment basket.Each month I allocate funds over several investment categories. This morning I bought 7 grams of gold with some leftover money in one of my accounts. Come January, I will be depositing a large sum to my Personal Retirement Fund so that I get the 25% match from the Government sooner than later. I take that very seriously because who gives you 25% interest these days even for a limited amount of money?The interest rate on TL is 10-11% and the interest rate on USD is 2.50% over here. So, when the Government matches my Personal Retirement Fund investment by 25%, it is practically a very high interest that money generates within a month.The tricky item for next year is my vacation time. My boss is relocating overseas and I was hoping to give myself a nice vacation in the United States for my 50th birthday in June. I cannot be gone for very long when he is not here. So we will see what we will do about that.I start making my budget usually by the end of November and keep tweaking it till the end of the year. This year I will have a very small amount of money allocated for house maintenance. I am planning something major in 2018 or may be even 2019."},

{"title": "Frugal Solutions", "date": "Monday, November 7, 2016", "text": "This weekend, after looking at various options to place the small music set in my studio apartment, I had an \"A-ha!\" moment. It was temporarily sitting on a ladder I use for cleaning top shelves and high places that I cannot reach. The ladder needed to go back to my master residence last weekend and the music set had to be taken off. So, during the weekend I decided to look for an inexpensive solution to accommodate it.I looked at several things to decide whether they would be worth the purchase and whether they could be used in the future. However, I could not find anything that met the specs. Then, it hit me! I could certainly move the 3 drawer chest to the opposing wall, put the music set on top of it and use a small folding coffee table that I had at home as a nightstand. I use the coffee table all the time when I am actually living in my master residence but as you may remember, I spend most of my days in the Studio close to my work. I was using the chest as a nightstand but it was too high anyway.So, I left the store with a stupid but proud grin and went home.My mother's old washing machine is hopefully going to make it's way to the studio this week. So, I will not have to haul laundry back and forth every week. The cost? Nothing. My company is sending a truck to take care of business in Ankara and on the way back it will have more than enough room to bring it back. I have been waiting quiet a while but it was worth it. I was not in immediate need of a machine and it wasn't costing me anything extra.There are aspects of my life which may not be frugal by most standards but, everything in life is a trade-off. I am spending money on the studio to save time and sanity. I am spending money on ready-made diet meals to lose weight and save my health.These things do not tempt me to spend money on unnecessary stuff. I am always on the lookout for frugal ways. This way, I can save money, give to others and still enjoy life."},

Not all of us exchange gifts either but gift giving has become a hassle during the last few years.When I travel to the US, I buy gifts for everyone but when it comes to Birthdays and the New Year, it is mom, sis, BIL and I who exchange gifts. Truth be told, none of us need anything. This year, I bought a watch for my sis which she did not need and took mom to Italy for their respective birthdays and will be giving a gold coin to my BIL. Gold coins are a popular gift/investment in this country.My mom gives gold coins to all of us but I think she is tired of doing even that.My sister is pretty terrible in gift giving. Last year she gave me a silver ring which I never wore because, it is really not my kind of ring and this year she gave me another silver ring which had a problem so that she needed to return to the store and I did not receive the replacement yet. She is trying but, buying gifts is not her thing. Some people are like that so, I am not criticizing her. My dad was a great gift buyer and so am I. Mom and sis? Not so much.Mom recently declared that we should stop giving gifts. To celebrate birthdays, we will only go out to dinner and be done with it.I am fine with this decision. I am sure when I go to the US, I will buy gifts for everyone but, that is my thing. I never expect anything in return. Whenever I am shopping, I come across things that they would like or need and I get them. I do not go out of my way for gift shopping. So, this works for me.I am so happy that after this last gold coin gift, I will be done with this. Yay!I also belong to a group of friends that play Secret Santa for the New Year. I think, everyone dreads picking a gift for me because I am overweight. It is next to impossible for them to find a clothing item. Even I have trouble finding clothes so I cannot blame them. I keep getting real nice, good quality shawls and scarves each year. This year I must tell them in advance that I do not need anything in black or gray. Shades of blue and green or a rich burgundy are all welcome :)"},

I am just hoping that the weather will be nice enough to spend time on the beach. This trip has been paid for months ago and the plane ticket was really very inexpensive. The hotel is an all-inclusive type of place and my only out-of-pocket expenses will be parking at the airport and may be a few extra drinks or something.I am looking forward to this not only because I will be seeing my old friends but that, it is an opportunity to relax a little as well.This will be the last trip/small vacation I will be taking this year. I was not a popular kid at school but had enough friends and High School was a pleasant experience in my memories. No traumas or anything....I got to know more people during these re-unions and made friends with them. It is always nice to get together and chat, share a few drinks and laugh a lot. In the past we used to have a formal night but not this time. I rebelled against formal dresses and most of the guys agreed with me. So, I am wearing a pair of jeans, sneakers and a nice top for the Gala Dinner. I may put on a little make-up but that's all. I no longer care about impressing other people. whatever makes me feel good, I do it. Fitting in is not an absolute necessity. I can be different and I am comfortable with that.Some friends of mine never bring bathing suits because they are fat. I am fatter and yet I love the beach and spending time in the water.

It was extremely tiring since I had to do all the driving but, also a great vacation in many ways.We landed in Milan on a Friday afternoon and got our car and headed towards our hotel. After check-in, we decided to have dinner somewhere in Milan and get a feel for the city.On Saturday, we went to Lake Maggiore and drove on one shore up to the Swiss border. It was absolutely breathtaking. We stopped at many little towns to enjoy the beautiful scenery.On Sunday, we visited Lake Como and went to Bellagio with a car ferry. It was also stunning but also very crowded. Como is the \"in\" place where many famous people own houses. We took a ride up the mountain and saw more spectacular views and took an alternative route back to Milan driving by farms and cheese factories.On Monday, we drove to Genoa and it's shore a little bit but were less than impressed. I think, we could have skipped Genoa. On the way back, we had dinner in Torino and totally fell in love with that city. It was absolutely very green and beautiful. If I had to live in Italy, that would be the city I would love to live. That was a fun day since we literally had breakfast in Milan, lunch in Genoa and dinner in Torino. I am very much used to driving in a very congested city but, the Italians drive like crazy on the Autostrada (Highway). They drive way past the speed limit.Tuesday, I did not feel like doing anything. We slept in until noon and then strolled around a mall. Had dinner in Milan at a really nice place where the locals would go.On Wednesday, we decided to go see Lake Iseo which we instantly fell in love with. I think Lake Como is highly overrated. If I could, I would own a place by Iseo. Such a beautiful and peaceful place. We drove all around it.Thursday was the day we decided to take the Milan Sightseeing Tour. The Red Line was the best. The Blue and Green Lines were just OK . The Duomo Cathedral and the Castle Sforzesco were magnificent. We were totally exhausted mainly due to the hot and humid weather at the end of the day.Friday was our last day of vacation so we went to Verona. Took the sightseeing tour there as well. Such a beautiful little city! I am so glad, we did that. It wasn't in our early plans. On the way back to Milan, we visited Lake Garda and had dinner by the Lake.On Saturday, checked-out, went to the airport and got delayed nearly two hours due to the air traffic not over Milan but over Istanbul and by the time we reached home it was already 7 p.m.Tried to take it easy on Sunday but there were loads of laundry and a lot of stuff to be put away and I think, I need a vacation to just RELAX."},
{"title": "Why spend money when it is not necessary?", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2016", "text": "I am planning to spend some money totally unnecessarily but it just feels right. How?Well, the studio apartment I rented had a very old and filthy junk of a washing machine. Although I have a machine at my principal home, it is not easy or possible to carry the work clothes back and forth every week. So, a washing machine at the Studio is a necessity. I had initially thought of buying a very low end machine and splitting the cost of it with the landlord.Then, I remembered that mom has an old machine that has very long cycles. She has been complaining about that for quiet a while now. I decided to ask her for her machine and offered to buy her a new one. I will shell out about 4 times as much money as compared to the above option but, this will make my mom happy. So why not?I am a born saver and a budget maker. I make sure, I have some wiggle room in my budget for occasions like this because I like to make my family happy. I know for a fact that my mom will never purchase a new machine while the one she owns is still working. However, each time she needs to use this machine, she hates it. While I have the means for doing this, I would like to do it.Now I am on the lookout for a fairly priced nice machine with short cycles. I will make every effort to score it at the best available price."},

I came to a realization that, if it were only me, I would be able to answer that question much more comfortably.However, I feel responsible regarding some members of my family and I think I should be prepared to help them if I have to. I have made many calculations and projections and came up with three scenarios.Scenario Number 1: Retire in March 2018 at the age of 51 with some savings and a rental home. This can provide a very modest living with no possibility of travel outside of Turkey. With this scenario, I will not be able to help others if family emergencies come up as much as I would like. So, I really do not like this one and 51 is too soon to retire anyway. If this scenario becomes reality, I will probably have to look for some consultancy or training work like I used to have.Scenario Number 2: Retire in March 2020 at the age of 53 with a good deal of savings and a rental home. This one will allow me to travel and help others if there is ever a need for that. So, this scenario is a good one.Scenario Number 3: Retire in March 2023 at the age of 56. Now that is a comfortable living with money to spend, to share and even save. 56 is a good age to retire and I will not have to worry about whether I should get a part time job or not.So, obviously I target the third option. However, it is not completely dependent on me. As much as I like my job and have no intention to leave it, I am not too sure if my job will be around for me till 2023. My boss wants to relocate to the US and he is looking to sell his business. I am sure the new owners will need me for a while but then what?So, I am just hoping that I will be able to pull in the same level of salary till 2023 at this job or another so that, I can comfortably retire and feel safe.Wonder what other people are making their estimations."},

There is a really old wall type air conditioner and I am guessing it needs to be serviced if it is working at all.The washing machine needs to be serviced as well.

It was a welcome opportunity with one drawback. I have to cross a bridge in Istanbul's traffic to go to work each day. I am spending way more time either on the road or at work just waiting for the traffic to get lighter.Initially, I thought about moving close to my work but this area is extremely expensive. I would have to pay a rent twice as much of a rent that I can possibly collect on my own apartment.I gave up the idea and decided to grin and bear it.However, lately, I have come to the realization that this is eating way too much time and I have no time to take care of myself. Besides, I started feeling constantly tired lately. This affects my work performance as well.I decided to consider moving yet again but in a different way. I rented a small studio apartment. This costs way less than moving and renting my place out.The studio I have rented has a full kitchen plus a washing machine. All I need to do is to get a bed, an armchair, a small wardrobe from IKEA. The cost is way less than moving my whole apartment. Besides, when I am done with these, I am sure we can use these things within the family. Or, I can gift them to someone who needs them. Our office will be in this location until the end of 2017. Before my rent is up, I will know for sure whether we would be staying here for another year or not.Next week, the studio will be painted and cleaned and I will be able to move by next weekend. The rent period will officially start by August 1.I am planning to stay close to work during the week and go home for the weekends.This will save me 4 hours of my life every single day. The monthly cost is around 6 per cent of my total monthly income so, it is not so terrible. I wish, I had thought of this before."},
{"title": "C-Level Titles", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2016", "text": "I have been working for over 28 years now and I just cannot keep myself from laughing at certain people who are so hung-up on their titles. They totally miss the fact that, they have no power whatsoever despite the flashy title. They could be called anything but, there is little they can influence. Yet they still want \"that\" title.Once a sales person had told me she only dealt with C-Level Executives and that she could not get any decision taken by others. I know that is not entirely true. If a sales person does not get the buy-in of certain people at an organization, her/his project is doomed despite the C-Level push.Having sad that, I must admit I am a Chief Operations Officer. I live with it.I recently came up with some C-Level titles of my own and just wanted to share them with the few who read my blog.Here we go:CRHO: Chief Raising Havoc Officer: This is a person who constantly creates confusion and disruption at the office. Even the stupidest unimportant thing becomes an issue that must be discussed.CCO: Chief Complaining Officer: This person can never be happy. Everything and anything is a reason for complaint. Nothing is ever their fault so that they can complain all the time.CSAO: Chief Smart-Assed Officer: Well, self explanatory I guess. In some companies they may be named CKIAO: Chief Know-It-All OfficerGotta go and resume my COO duties now. Have a fun day!"},

While I was home, I did a couple of loads of laundry and picked up clutter.Friday evening I went out with a couple of friends for beer and came home around 10:30.Saturday was a lazy day. I mastered making latte at home with a stove top espresso maker from IKEA and a battery operated hand held milk frother from Tchibo.I went out and did a little grocery shopping. The grocery store had a campaign so I was able to snatch 3 1 liter bottles of extra virgin olive oil at a great price. I will give them to mom.I am not cooking anymore other than weekends. There is a food service which delivers a 2000 calorie, diabetic menu for the whole day to my office. Since I get home very late at night, it makes more sense for me to have dinners at the office. We have a fully equipped kitchen.I am not diabetic but I need more protein than carbs so I order the diabetic menu. They deliver breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. It is a bit expensive than what food normally would cost me if I cooked everything from scratch but I never do that. Besides, I am not throwing away food that goes bad. Hopefully this will help my diet if I do not blow it over the weekend.Mom went to Izmir to stay with SIS and BIL for a while. This year she feels she is getting old so, she declined my offer of a Northern Italy trip. She doesn't feel up to it. I do not know what to do for a vacation.May be I will take a week on the Mediterranean early October. I cannot stand the heat before then. Late July I may take a couple of days off to spend in Izmir. I can go to the beach during the day and stay at my sister's.We'll see..."},

He is telling me I will keep my job since he will not be completely gone. Also also he is going to be relocating to the US for good by the end of the year so that is why whoever buys it will need me to run the business. He is going to try to be still in the picture from afar. I am thinking he may be too optimistic about this so, I better tighten my belt and save as much as I can.Even if he doesn't sell, he will still relocate to the US leaving me in charge. God knows what is awaiting me in the long run.So, I sat down and crunched some numbers. I need to work until June 2018 at my current salary level to be able to retire fully. By then, I will have enough savings to lead a comfortable yet modest life.If I manage to work until the end of 2019, That will be much better.The best scenario is to retire in 2023 when I am 56. That will be truly worry free unless something really drastic happens.As you may know I am already retired and this is my second career but with my current retirement income, plus rental income it is a tight ship.We will see what future brings..."},

To give you an idea;I had my kitchen torn down, had the piping replaced, had new flooring installed, had electrical layout re-designed.The kitchen order  I gave was delayed 5 (FIVE!!!!) weeks due to an ERP migration at the factory. Some idiots forgot to migrate all the codes necessary to build cabinets and an order could not be properly entered.Finally, the kitchen arrived... with missing pieces... Then I was told the counter-top would have to be installed a week later. That meant I had to re-schedule installing the new oven, the hood and the stove top.They delivered the wrong stove top. Another delay...Finally, I decided not to install the hood before the ceramic tiles so, that will have to wait until next week. The tiles will be put up on saturday...Meanwhile, I was swamped at work due to end of year issues. Caught the pneumonia but could not rest due to workload so that took a long time to heal. Then my allergies hit me badly because of the mess at home. The doctor told me the house dust mites are my worst enemy after an allergy test.All the kitchen stuff was put in random places. The cleaning lady was sick, I could not keep up with cleaning chores and ergo house mites!The kitchen will be completely done by next week and now the white refrigerator and the white dish washer look ugly in the new setting. However, I am not going to buy new ones before these die. They may look as ugly as they like to...Oh! and I am over the budget by about USD 2.000!Phewww!"},

I knew this prior to my visit but, what none of us knew was that she was to pass away on the second day of my visit.I did not know what to do. Initially, I thought staying with them through the funeral was what I needed to do. However, my girlfriend was so overwhelmed that, we had a heart-to-heart talk and she thought it would be best to change my plans to go to see my other friends down south rather than hanging around. She was having some issues with her daughter and she just had too much on her plate. So, I talked to my other girlfriend to tell them that I would be going to see them earlier than planned and she and her husband said they were thrilled to have me over earlier.I headed south and stayed in Roanoke over night. It was a long drive and I was completely exhausted by the time I reached the hotel. Both my girlfriends checked on me to see that I arrived in Roanoke safe and sound.The next day, it was a much shorter trip to South Carolina."},

I will write about my trip in a few posts.I landed at JFK on the 22nd of August. We got delayed at Heathrow so, we landed around 6 p.m. instead of 4 p.m. After going through Customs and gathering my suitcase, I took the Air Train to Jamaica Station and figured out how to get to the hotel I had booked in NYC. A nice young guy kindly helped me to carry my suitcase up the subway stairs. I am forever thankful to him since I was very very tired.By the time I reached the hotel, it was well past 8 p.m. I checked in and headed straight out to grab a bite.The next day, I basically walked around the city at my own pace and used the Subway to get to Chinatown, Little Italy and the Village. It was great to be able to walk in the streets of New York after many years.The day after, I decided to go to Staten Island. I had lived in Ny for over 3 years and have never been to Staten Island. So, it was a first. It was a nice day and I took in the sights of the new skyline of Manhattan. Had a nice lunch by the sea front.I walked around the Central Park, Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Plaza, Times Square, went in and out of stores and walked and walked.On Tuesday, I did a little bit more sightseeing and in the evening, I got the car I booked from an Avis very close to my hotel. I took the car and then collected my suitcase and bags from the hotel. I drove more than an hour towards north to visit my friends who live close to Poughkeepsie.As a child I used to read Trixie Belden books and used to wonder what kind of a place Poughkeepsie was. In some of the books that city is mentioned quiet often. It was fantastic to see my friends after 7 years. Stay tuned for Part II."},

I will probably have to get up around 5 a.m. in the morning.Yesterday, I had my period. I am glad because, it will be somewhat manageable on the day of my flight.

Believe me it happened more than once.I need to purchase a couple more gifts tonight and then I am done.I have decided to take my hard cover suitcase instead of the soft one which is a bit smaller. I still haven't decided on the duffel bag yet. I must take appropriate measurements of it. I think, it is oversized and a bit heavy even when empty. If I do not take the duffel bag, I may have to purchase another suitcase which I truly do not need. There used to be very inexpensive but gigantic suitcases in Chinatown NY. We could never use them more than three times at most since they fell apart quickly but, they were like 20-30 USD so, that was not a big issue.It looks like I am very short on casual summer clothing.

I do not plan to carry a wad of cash on myself, therefore, I am bringing a cash card that I will be able to use with a small fee for withdrawals. My bank charges USD 1.5 each time I use an ATM abroad regardless of the amount I take out. The down side is that they do not allow me to withdraw the USD sitting in my USD account but rather take out TL from my regular checking account, convert it to USD and sell me that money. This way the fee seems small but they make money over the exchange rate. Whatever... We are not talking about huge amounts here.So, yesterday I went to a bank close to my office and told the teller that I wanted to purchase some US Dollars and since I prefer to have small bills such as 20s and 10s rather than 100s, I asked them nicely if I can have the total amount in 50s or smaller bills.The teller took out a huıge bundle of various types of bills and told me he could only give me 50s while I clearly saw that, there were lots of 10s and 20s hanging from the bundle. I said: \"Well, can you at least give some 20s and 10s, may be about 150 USD worth or so?\" He said \"No. You see, if I give them to you I will not have much left.\" Huh? Well, HELLOOOO? What is a bank's job? Why do they provide you all those bills in the first place? To sell it to people who need it. Right? Apparently that is not what this guy thought.As I figured it would be meaningless to argue, I grabbed the 50s and went back to work.I purchase the currency solely from banks because, I certainly do not want to come accross counterfeit money. The safest thing is to go to banks but, they do not like to carry small bills.... or sell them in my situation. Sigh...."},

Temperatures were lower than normal but, starting by the end of last week, the humidity and the temperatures both rose and the wind died down quiet a bit.Mom and I were out shopping on Saturday for my upcoming US trip. I was looking for gifts for my friends and decided on Turkish towels, pistachios and Pistachio Turkish Delight (some sort of soft candy). We went to a large department store run by one of the biggest textile companies in Turkey and lost ourselves among soft, fluffy towels. I liked one kind and mom liked another kind so, we ended up buying four of one kind and three of the other. We also bought traditional hand-woven hamam towels (peshtemals) for every one of my friends. Those hand-woven hamam towels are great as towels, pareos, shawls, lounge chair covers and even as extra sheets when you do not particularly like the bed sheets at a hotel. They are so versatile. I own probably a dozen. They get softer and softer as you use and wash them and last a very long time.I will buy the pistachios and the candy later on. Saturday was a good day because, we were at an air-conditioned mall. On Sunday, we were supposed to go out for breakfast to Ortakoy and take a nice boad ride on the Bosphorus. However, it was so hot that we could not even dare to get out of the apartment. We stayed home and tried to relax. I do not have air-conditioning at home because my apartments is really nice and cool during the summer. During the hottest year, I might need an air-conditioner for a maximum of two weeks or so.

I will take it back at noon.It is always such a joy to get the car cleaned inside and out and enjoy the ride. However, that lasts about two days in this city where so much construction is going on. Very dusty!Istanbul is a giant construction site. Everywhere you go, you see high-rise buildings popping up. It is almost impossible to keep the car nice and clean for very long. Plus, it rained almost every week this year since the summer decided to postpone her appearance this year.I get my car washed every three weeks or so but, I always feel like at least the outside should be washed more frequently. It is not a lot of money. I can get my car hand washed inside and out for less than USD 10 including the tip.The area where I live is going to be the Financial Center of the city and HQs of several banks along with the Central Bank of Turkey which will be moving from Ankara to Istanbul. Why? Just because the President wants it so. There is no logic in this whole matter but, if I get started about the President, I may get myself in serious trouble. So, let's leave that subject alone.Istanbul is already overcrowded and congested. There is absolutely no point in moving more people into it.

{"title": "Why I never give up budgeting", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2015", "text": "I had a budget even as a young kid. I would plan how I would spend or save my allowances. I always had a \"fun\" category in my budget. I still do.When I read other blogs I see everyone has a different approach to budgets. Everyone also has a different way of dealing with gift expenses. For instance Gill from That British Woman posted \"How far do you think ahead?\" today which inspired me to write this post.I am not good at depositing a certain amount in a jar or box. The part of the reason is, I grew up in a high inflation environment. Although it is not the case now, I still like to have my money earn some interest instead of sitting in a jar. The inflation is still high in this country when compared to developed nations. I can earn about 10.5-11.75 % on TL deposits and about 2.30-2.50 % on my USD accounts per year.Here is how my budget works:I use an Excel Sheet on which the top few rows are for my income. I have a regular salary, a retirement income and a rental income there.Several rows are dedicated to monthly expenses and bills such as utilities, taxes, insurances, cleaning lady and etc. I have a general category for spending that includes all my grocery spending including personal hygiene items and clothing needs. This entry is not exactly the same for each month. I know when I usually shop for clothing so, I bump up the numbers a little bit for those months. I have never been ablo track every penny and make a zero-based budget. My budget guides me not to over-spend and save each month. My savings are also on my budget so I know exactly what I am saving and how.I have an Emergency Fund, a TL savings account, a USD savings account, and a Retirement Fund in addition to a small stock portfolio in an investment account. Each month I allocate some money to all these accounts right when I get paid so, I do not overspend. If anything is left over at the end of the month, I put that sum into one of my savings accounts. For instance if the stock exchange is doing poorly, I buy stocks, if USD is comparatively lower, I buy US dollars, etc.I also have a row for gifts and a row for charity. I know when I will be buying birthday and New Year gifts so, I plan ahead. I also give planned sums to charities every month. This is so much easier to manage.So far, this approach has worked for me. My budget extends to several years ahead. I know things may change but, I like to be able to plan and project big expenses of the mid-and long-term."},

Good thing that I had a relaxing weekend last week. This one sure looks busy.Starting in July, I will be working full time. Mom will stay with me till mid-August. I will take her back and then leave for the US for three weeks. I am kind of sad that we haven't been able to take a vacation together this year. I asked her if she wanted to go to Rome and she declined this spring. She loves the US but when she is with me I cannot stay with my friends and get to see them as much as I want. Also, she slows me down. So, although I had asked her if she wanted to go to the US, she declined. I must think of a nice vacation with her next spring. I know she wants to go to Greece or Italy.I am planning a small getaway to İzmir to see my sis and BIL next weekend with mom. Details on that, later."},
{"title": "Rental Apartments Fiasco", "date": "Friday, June 5, 2015", "text": "Yesterday, I met two brokers and saw 7 apartments in the area  where I work. I am no construction expert or an engineer but, most of the places we saw had problems. There were cracks on the walls and when I asked about them the brokers shrugged it of by saying that the buildings settled since the area was earlier a very arrid place (read swamp). That's not good.I know mom wants to access shops and everything easily but, the apartments in that area are built rather poorly, despite the fact that they are luxury apartments with very expensive rents and maintenance fees. They are built on former river beds apparently.Istanbul is very close to a fault line which is expected to produce a large scale earthquake anytime so, the strength of the construction is very important.It looks like there are only a handful condos out there which are sturdy enough and their prices are extremely high. May be I will have to get used to the traffic...Also, most of the apartments had open kitchen plans which I truly dislike. I cook a lot and use sauteed onions and garlic. I also bake fish quiet regularly. Open kitchen is a bad idea for Turkish Cuisine.The master bedrooms were mostly OK but the second/third bedrooms were extremely small.So, I will keep on looking around and learning about condominiums. I shall see if I can find something that is both sturdy and comfortable. Bah!"},
{"title": "Personal Financial Decisions and Income", "date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2015", "text": "I have worked for 25 years with full time jobs and fixed incomes. Then I switched to a consulting career and had to deal with a variable income scheme. Even then, some portion of my income was fixed so, it was not too bad. The fixed part was and still is enough to cover my fixed expenses.I am back to what will soon become a full-time job. I will still have my passive income so, this truly is a great opportunity to save like crazy. I am determined not to cave in to an inflated life style with the exception of a rental apartment.My current residence is too far from work so, I am planning to move closer to work. My apartment will not generate enough rent to cover my new apartment's rent in this new area. There will be a significant difference. It doesn't have to be that way but, as my sister and her husband had to relocate due to work, I like to have mom with me. We are practically living together 9 months out of a year. She needs to be able to go out and walk around a little bit and do some shopping in order not to be bored. Therefore, I am obliged to rent a place within a very specific area and that area is expensive. I consider this a small sacrifice though.This year I am taking a 3 week vacation in the US. I have planned and budgeted for this for a long time so, no it is not a mindless splurge. I will be staying at some friends for some of the time so, my hotel costs will not be a budget buster. I have a set budget and will stick to it.Although, our lifestyles inflate with the increase of our incomes, this doesn't have to be. I promise myself that, I will not be splurging and that I will be making wiser choices to tuck away as much as I can. I am not suddenly going to become tight-fisted either. I think moderation is the key in every aspect of life."},

Good food, lots of laughs and a good deal of walking around... Gill, I am sorry I did not take any photos. My bad!I have another set of old colleagues whom I see very frequently but lately, I started having second thoughts about the dynamics of this group. Something has changed and I am not sure I like it. This is really difficult to explain but, it seems like there may be something more than just friendship in some people's minds about some of the others in the group. There are 3 guys and 4 ladies including yours truly in this group.One of our girlfriends is getting a divorce and the other is not too far from the same situation with her husband. So, obviously these ladies are in a vulnerable state. They are very close friends. They seem to be having some romantic thoughts about their future sort of like a twentysomething would envision. Being a realist, I think they are opening themselves up for further disappointment.What bugs me is not just this. There are two guys in this group who seem to be interested in either of these ladies. May be both of the guys like the same person but, I am not sure. I am just feeling uncomfortable when around them. This started a few months ago when we even did not know about the divorce situation. There is nothing out in the open but, I sensed subtle signs.Last time we were together was a disaster. The girlfiriend who is getting a divorce got herself very drunk, totally out of character and, although I was ready to go home, they insisted on going to a bar after dinner. Two of our friends apologized and went home. I should have done the same thing but I was really worried that the remaining people had too much to drink and could put themselves at risk. Besides I had my car to take them all home as I  always do. So, leaving them behind with no car at night seemed wrong. Being the only sober person, I felt I had to hang with them. It was a huge mistake on my part. That night, I noticed more of what I had sensed earlier.One of the guys insisted on going to a particular place and made us walk for a good 15 minutes. When we reached his suggested place, at the entrance, I told them that I was ready to call it a night and that I decided to go home. The place did not look right to me and the three bodyguards at the entrance were just too much. When I anounced that I was going home, the rest of the people decided not to go in as well. So, our friend who suggested the place got pissed and started an argument with me. Unfortunately, I was tired and fed up so, I ended up arguing with him instead of keeping cool.Ever since that night, I was feeling that may be I needed a social break. However after yesterday, I realized that I do not need a social break but, rather a break from the group I have belonged to for such a long time.I do not want to get together with them as a group anymore and I have no intention of sharing what I feel with any of the others.Any suggestions?"},

The traffic in the morning is bearable but, in the evenings I cannot come home before 8:30-9:00 p.m. no matter what I do.I have made up my mind to move but I am still contemplating about the time to do this. The schools will be closed around mid-June and most people who intend to move will probably do so after that before vacation. However, the Ramadan starts in June and although I do not observe it, a lot of people will do. Therefore, it will be tough on moving people to work without food and water during the day. It will be very hot as well.Many people will go to their summer vacation spots during the Ramadan so, I am hoping that the traffic will be better. Besides at dinner time, many people are off the traffic to eat the first meal of the day. Therefore, I can take advantage of that time zone to drive back home.My vacation is between August 22-September 10. So, may be I should move before the vacation but after the Ramadan. This window is about one month. It should be sufficient for me to find a place and move. I will rent out my own apartment but, there is no rush in that.It would be best if I could rent a place starting in August and move before my vacation. This will also let me put away some money because a move may be expensive. Thank God, I have a small apartment and not a lot of belongings."},

{"title": "Yes Mom!", "date": "Wednesday, May 13, 2015", "text": "I do not know if anybody is familiar with the old British TV series \"Yes Minister!\" which later became \"Yes Prime Minister!\"Sometimes, my life feels like that.My mom is an interesting lady. She has a big heart, she is funny, she loves her family to the moon and back, she loves watching volleyball games and she is very very very tidy. This wonderful mom has one small fault (as for me). She wants everything her way, all the time and fast. She is very demanding when it comes to certain things like general housework or errands outside. When she has time to think things through, she usually comes around and agrees with me. (Don't get me wrong, I love my mom and hug and kiss her every day and tell her I love her all the time and I mean it but I am also getting old).A few days ago I asked her why we were rushing to go to Ankara on Thursday. I told her that I was tired because of all the driving I do and it would be best if we were to go to Ankara on Friday. After all, I will stay there for a week, take her to doctors appointments, do her shopping and everything else that she needs. She looked at me very seriously and told me: \"You never understand me, do you?\" I said \"Ok mom sorry if I missed something. We will go on Thursday as you wish\".Last night as I was coming home around 10 p.m., I noticed that someone broke my parked car's left rear-wiev mirror. I am now driving a company car and I had decided to take my own vehicle to Ankara so that my uncle can drive mom around when she needs it and whenever he is around. So, my own car is the vehicle I need to drive to Ankara.I went inside and told mom that the mirror needs to be fixed on Thursday before we hit the road. Meanwhile my car is stuffed with things to be donated to a charity in Ankara and mom wants them dropped off before we go to her home. Now, getting the mirror fixed may take some time and the road is around 5 hours. The charity place may be closed by the time we reach Ankara. I also asked her not to wake me up too early in the morning because I need my sleep if I have to drive for 5 hours and the repair shops are never open before 9 a.m. anyway.Apparently, she got upset because what she wants cannot be complied with but she also came to understand that Friday was a better option to hit the road. So, this morning she said \"Why the rush? Go get the car fixed tomorrow and we can go to Ankara on Friday on a timely manner and drop off all that stuff\".I said \"OK Mom!\""},
{"title": "Property Taxes and Retirement Funds", "date": "Tuesday, May 5, 2015", "text": "In my country property taxes are not as high as they are in the US. Although I do not understand why we have to pay taxes on our residences; since it is the law, I pay them. In my opinion, one residence should be exempt from taxes. Actually retired people who own just one home are exempt from taxes but, property is a popular investment item.Normally I pay the property taxes in two installments as allowed but, this time I just caved in and paid taxes in full for my residence, my rental property and mom's residence. Thank God, the property taxes for the other apartment I bought from my uncle early January, starts next year.You may be wondering how much I paid for three apartments.... I paid just about USD 450.- for all.My residence has the highest taxes, about half of the above number goes to my small two bedroom apartment since, Istanbul is more expensive than Ankara and my neighborhood is considered nice. Mom's home is a larger apartment which is also in a good neighborhood but, Ankara is cheaper.I also decided to pay extra towards my retirement fund since it will be matched by 25% by the Government. This way, I made the maximum contribution that will be matched by the Government. Early June, there will be elections in Turkey and I am afraid Government will stop making this contribution or at least lower it to a smaller percentage.Up until 2003, there was only Social Security in this country and now there is a supplemental system similar to 401Ks and/or Roth IRAs. I think ours is a hybrid of both. It is called a Personal Retirement System. I was skeptical at first but decided to join it in 2004.Since the funds and the companies who were offering this were new, I was lost for quiet a while and did not earn much on what I contributed. The first 3-4 years were lost years. After I started reading about the retirement funds in the USA, I understood the logic and strategy and started making meaningful contributions and selecting better funds. It will hopefully be a nice chunk of money in 2023. You can either cash all of it or get paid over a period of time until the funds are depleted. With today's rules, it seems to be a wiser choice to cash it but, who knows how it will be regulated in 2023?So, today I paid my taxes and made a good contribution to my retirement fund. I do not have to think about these things until January 2016. Happy!"},

It was not easy to adjust to a fluctuating pay but, I was able to manage it due to my passive income. Recently, I was not feeling very comfortable about working with the team anymore. There has been some issues that affected my motivation. I started questioning my decision to work part-time as a consultant.I like the flexibility, meeting new people and the work. However, it has certain difficulties such as fluctuating pay and the constant anxiety about new projects. I think I do not have a big enough nest egg to feel very secure. I own two apartments free and clear, have a small passive income and yet I am only 47.A couple of my old colleagues asked if we could go into consulting business together and suggested we do some brainstorming. Despite my second thoughts about consulting, I decided to give it a shot with my friends. That is something I will continue on the side.While all these were happening, someone I had done business in the past asked to re-connect. This is a very smart young man who is a sizeable business owner. We had done business in the past and started a habit of having a cup of coffee once or twice a year even our paths diverged. I was happy to re-connect and we chatted for quiet a while few weeks ago over a cup of coffee. He had been diagnosed with a bad illness and have been through some rough patches and he and his wife had a baby boy. So, he started having some anxiety issues about the future. You know my sister has been through some rough time too so, we established a new bond. He asked me my opinion on how to take his business to a new level. We decided to get together once again so that I could get to know his business a little better.He invited me over to his office a couple of weeks ago and we had another long conversation. He asked me if I would like to work with him. That was quiet unexpected. I said I would consider it but I could start part-time since I still have some consultancy obligations.When he sent me his offer. I was really surprised at his generosity. So, after I considered it for a couple of hours, I accepted to start working with him for three days a week starting this week. My only request was to take a week off in May for my and mom's yearly check-ups and 3 weeks off in August-September for an already planned vacation in the US.This is still too good to be true so I am praying, it is not a dream and I will be happy here."},

I also was able to rest because all that driving and long hours at work five days a week was draining me. I like to work part time.Anyway, tomorrow is my first day on the new project so, wish me luck!"},
{"title": "DOCTOR vs DOCTOR", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2015", "text": "A friend of my sister suggested her to see another doctor. Her own (now previous) doctor was also suggested by one of her doctor friends and is known to be very good in his area of expertise. However, he was a bit distant and did not provide much needed details for her that made her anxious. He was cool about the problem but was not very reassuring. Plus, everything we read on the Internet was pretty bad and we almost believed she would not be able to reach 60 (she is 41 now).Her husband told me that on several occasions he caught her crying thinking her days were numbered. This has broken my heart too.So, when a friend of her with the same diagnosis suggested her the other doctor, she decided to give him a shot. The new doctor spent close to 40 minutes with her examining her from head to toe, looking at her lab and biopsy results and most importantly talking to her and her husband. He said that second stage meant nothing, that he still has a patient living quiet normally since 1992 when he was diagnosed at the 4th stage. He told her to become more active and maintain a healthy diet. She has been already losing weight due to eating healthy and he told her not to overdo it and feel deprived. He also told her that her high blood pressure is more of a problem than her condition. My sister laughed at that because all women on my mom's side has high blood pressure and we accept is as the family norm and a part of our lives.My sister told me that her husband felt like getting up to hug and kiss the doctor because he was sooo upset and stressed about the possibility of losing her untimely. I think I can fly over and hug and kiss him too.My sister will see him in two months with her lab results so that he can assess the dosage of the medicine and adjust it if necessary. She sounded wonderfully happy on the phone. She absolutely loved this new doctor. What a relief! He gave us hope and brightened our outlook of the future.The personality of the doctor is so important for the patient to feel at ease. I am sure the other guy is excellent but he dis not speak much and was very brief in his dealings with her."},

Her husband was transferred there last December and she had refused to go there without getting her promotion. Unfortunately, she is still not getting the promotion although she has been promised \"soon\" as if she hadn't been promised that many times over already.Her husband had rented a small one bedroom apartment and they will make it do over there for a while before moving their own apartment which is a pretty big 4 bedroom. She is very hesitant whether they should move and rent the place out. They own it free and clear. To me keeping an apartment that big empty for a long time does not make financial sense but hey, it is not my finances.

Well, there are some new stuff going on...During the summer, business was slow and I was not bringing in any extra income to supplement my passive income. That was not a big problem because, my passive income covers my basic expenses and frugal budget. However, I need to save money for the future. So, 80% of the extra money goes towards savings in my book.We just started consulting on a very big project and the customer wants us five days a week! That is a full-time job I was not looking forward to. Besides, usually we have to stay until 8-9 p.m. for meetings.  I need to cross either of the bridges to get to work and the morning traffic in Istanbul is plain crazy.Today it took me an hour and a half for 25 Km or about 15 miles! So, I must get up very early. If I leave home by 6:30 a.m., I can get to work in about a half hour but going home late, sleeping very little and getting up early in the morning is a killer. When I made the conscious decision to leave a full time job, this is not what I had in mind.However, I do not expect this to go on forever. I work with two other people on this Project and we are pretty much on very different pages. I like a direct approach and taking on responsibility and acting because I come from Operations and my colleagues are very conservative and they like to keep a distance and create lots of pretty much unnecessary outputs just to show that we are working. (!?) Typical Consultants, I must say... The guys who hired us had made it very clear that they needed our experience to steer the project on their behalf. This is not what we are doing thanks to my colleagues. So, I am assuming the guys who hired us will soon fire us. That will make me feel terrible but, if the owner of the company whom I work with wants to run his business the way he does, he may as well be my guest.While we are working on this project, I will give it my 100%, tell my colleagues what I think is right but, I will not stress over this.If we fail as miserably as I think we will, I will review my decision to work with these people. I will most probably;Either look elsewhereor,Try to figure out doing something by myselfHowever, in order to work alone, I will need some cushion in my savings so that I can do some business development.

My apartment is strategically positioned so that my spare room gets some direct sunlight may be for a two hour window during the day. My living room, kitchen and bedroom never get direct sunshine. So, I have never needed an air conditioner. I have a portable fan that I used may be three summers in Istanbul during the last 14 years.This year is different. It is so hot an humid that the fan works many hours during the day. It is almost mid-August and usually this is the time when we start sensing that fall is in the air. Not this year! I have trouble concentrating on my work so I think, I will go to a Starbucks where I can work comfortably with the air conditioner running.Weather.com says it is 86 degrees fahrenheit and we feel it like 93! Yikes!I consider myself a nice and outgoing person. I love my family and my friends. I hate debt and being dependent on someone.I never got married. My ex-BFs were OK I guess, since all of them are happily (?) married for years now. Probably I am a difficult person to share a life with. I accept that.Although my friends tell me that I am a very nice and thoughtful person, I consider myself a bit of a control freak. I also think, I am selfish. I need a very big space for myself. I never ever wanted to have kids. Mom recalls that even when I was eight years old, I would say that I would never marry and have kids. I am 48 now and I guess, I have been pretty consistent about the life I chose to live.I had a very loving family and a great childhood so, my decision to never have a family of my own cannot be attributed to a bad childhood or a dysfunctional family. My parents were truly the best. I guess they did not raise me and my sis the traditional way. All we kept hearing was that a good education and being independent is the key to life and that we should always stand on our own feet. My sis is married because she does not like it alone but she and her husband decided not to have kids both due to some health issues and love of freedom. I cannot wrap my brain around living with other people. Mom comes to visit and stays for longer periods of time now that I am working part-time and even though I love her to the moon and back, I sometimes feel like I need my solitude.Why am I rambling? Well, I am and avid reader of many PF blogs and Blogging Away Debt is one of them. One of the bloggers there has two kids of her own and two adopted kids plus 4 pets. She is a single mom and has some debt that she has to get rid off. She has lately gone into some trouble about her housing situation and she had to make some tough choices. Once she wipes her debt, she is considering to adopt more kids. She is also home schooling her kids and working two jobs from home. That is so overwhelming for me. I admire her for being such a loving parent but, I just cannot imagine her life.I love my independence and I cannot imagine any other life. Some people have a different perspective on life and they are more giving, nurturing type of people. These life choices are so personal, so unique that I think that's what makes this world interesting."},

Yes, it will require me to work full-time for a while but that means more income which I really need.I am a big saver but sometimes certain family situations require me to step up and kiss some of my savings goodbye. That is what has happened recently. I do not feel regret or resentment because my family is really tiny and what I did made my mom happy. She is especially worried about this person I have helped and she felt relieved when I intervened. I love my mom and I wish her a long and healthy life. I do not want her to worry about anything.A big project like this will help me save at a very good rate and I really would like to grow my stash for rainy days.I am praying for this project. It can make a real difference in my financial life."},
{"title": "Keep losing...", "date": "Thursday, July 31, 2014", "text": "Mom and I went to see our dietician today. Finally we have both lost weight during the last month. She gave us new lists and a three day protein only shock diet to follow in two weeks. This little success boosted our motivation.Menu planning is easy for us. We eat very basic meals and always cook from scratch. We try to consume everything in season. Nowadays, we consume lots of string beans, zucchini, peppers, eggplants and tomatoes. We use only olive oil in our cooking. Our diet menu consists of a vegetable dish for one meal along with whole wheat bread and yogurt and another meal with a large salad and meat. Our breakfasts are pretty standard.The dietician gives us a variety of snacks that are easy to pack so that we can take them anywhere with us like date palms, dried apricots, figs or some whole wheat crackers. When we feel like it we can have two-three scoops of ice-cream as a snack.Buying in season has both health and taste benefits. Budget benefits are an added bonus.Mom will spend the next two-three months at her home in Ankara but we will keep supporting each other over the phone."},

We were on a hunt for white bed sheets. We like bigger sheets than the standard ones usually sold. If we go a bigger size that is too big and requires touch up.Mom wanted to buy the fabric and make sheets herself but, she was looking for a specific type which she could not find. So, I wanted to get fabric enough for an extra sheet for myself and two new sheets for my guest (mom's) bed. The seller told us if we had a half hour to wait around he could have the sheets sewn! What a surprise! I did not know that they did that. Mom decided to get a sheet for uncle's bed too. For just USD 45, we bought beautiful, crisp white sheets. 3 of them were about the size of a Twin Extra Long and mine was a bit bigger than the US Standard Full Size. So much cheaper than store bought sheets, much better quality too. I love the cool, crisp feeling.We also bought two fabrics for mom to sew me dresses. She makes simple summer dresses which I wear at home to keep cool during the summer.We walked a lot, even through the Spice Bazaar but, I hardly ever shop there.It was a hot, humid and tiring day at the Old City but was so worth it. We plan to go back in the Fall when the weather is nicer."},
{"title": "Finally.... The Dentist Edition", "date": "Friday, July 25, 2014", "text": "I admit that I hate going to the dentist. I postponed this dreaded visit until today but finally, I decided it was time. Social Security covers dental work only if you go the the clinics and hospitals they have an agreement with. Those places usually have long waiting lists and I personally do not like the attitude of the employees there. Of course, there are exceptions.I decided that oral hygiene is important and I can certainly pay for this out-of-pocket. I also decided to go to a private college's dental clinic not too far from where I live. This place was recommended by many people so, I thought it was worth a shot.I am so glad I went there. There are gazillion doctors, most of whom are faculty members and the place was very organized, full of employees with a professional attitude and full of brand new equipment. I initially thought, students would be doing the work supervised by doctors and I was a bit worried about that but a friend of mine said that was not the case and she highly recommended the place.I was taken care of by the Oral Diagnosis doctor first. She examined my teeth and ordered 3 X-Rays one of which was panoramic. She then checked the X-rays and told me that I needed a cleaning first. She also told me I needed two of my old fillings replaced and I should no more delay the implant I need in place of a lost tooth.So, I went in to get an appointment for cleaning but the nice doctor there told me if I could wait for a half hour, I could get my cleaning right away. I happily accepted her offer. Since I have one extremely sensitive tooth, she had to administer a small dose of anesthetic.After that I got an appointment for replacing one of my fillings for August 14. OK, I really do not like all that drilling but my mouth was in better condition than I thought.Diagnosis, X-rays, cleaning with ansthesia cost me a total of USD 134.- I think that is a very good price."},

{"title": "Reader Question from Derya", "date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2014", "text": "Derya wrote:\"I have been following you for over a year now and you have been a huge inspiration. I wont say we live totally frugally (hubby myself and 5 year old son) but I have certainly refrained from spending and have managed to save a large portion of our earnings. We managed to buy an apartment with a 5 year mortgage plan. I won't have a lot of cash left over but am definitely interested in any tips you have to grow money in TL. I'm also wondering if you think it's better to pay off the loan early or to save and invest the cash? Best wishes. Derya\"I think they did a great job by buying an apartment at a 5 year mortgage rate. As for paying the loan off early, as far as I know in Turkey there is a penalty for doing that. Derya should check her mortgage paperwork and/or talk to her mortgage lender. So, paying early may be a bad idea.Before starting investments, I have some questions:1. Does Derya have an Emergency Fund?  If yes, how many months of living expenses does that cover?2. When she mentions investments, how far in future she is thinking? Is she thinking retirement?3. Are there any major expenditure in the near future, say 1-2 years?I am assuming she and her husband both work so, can they survive on one salary in case one of them loses a job? If yes, probably an Emergency Fund of three months worth of living expenses may be sufficient. If not I would opt for 6 months and may be even more. Now this money will be sitting in a low interest earning savings account earmarked only for emergencies.I admit this is painful to set aside so much money to earn very little interest but when an emergency strikes, this provides an amazing level of peace of mind.After doing this, I can start investing for the future. The key word is future here. We are talking about a long time so any vacation expenditures or new car funds should be saved elsewhere, probably at low-interest savings accounts. So, investing for the future and saving for upcoming expenses are totally different.For investing for the future, Derya and her husband can do two things here in Turkey: They can both establish a BES account (sort of like a Roth IRA) that they should not touch before the age of 56, or they can invest in individual stocks. I have a very small individual stock portfolio. I mainly invest in BIST 30 companies. I put very small amounts of money and totally ignore the ups and downs of the stock market. This is highly risky and I do not intend to touch that money in the next ten years or so. This type of investment is always very very risky and I would hesitate recommending it. Besides people get caught up in tips and dreams of high returns in a short time and turn this into a dangerous form of gamble. Buying and selling frequently is a definite no-no!As BES is a fairly new system, people are skeptical about this. I am past 10 years in this system and I am 9 years away from my BES retirement. So, I maintain a medium-high risk portfolio. The government matches my contribution by 25% up to a certain level. The government match will not be forever so, I take advantage of this as much as I can. This also is affected a lot by the stock volatility but in the long run, I am sure one will get ahead. The trick here is to select medium-high risk funds when you are farther away from retirement and gradually move into lower risk funds as you approach your retirement date. What people do not understand is that the amount you save in this account is the amount you will be paid. There is no guarantee of money for a life time. Also, people would like to put in 100 TL every month and receive 1000 TL when retired. That is an illusion and it will not happen. Before stepping into a BES account, I would read everything about it and be realistic about my expectations.Gold and USD investments are also popular in Turkey but gold is very unpredictable. USD accounts generate very little return but, on the long run, that may be an idea.So you see there is not one single good investment idea. That is why I have a BES account, a small stock account, some gold (very little) and some USD besides a hefty EF."},

Every spring and fall I go through my closets and shoe racks to donate whatever I am not planning to wear so that those in need get what they can use in time for the upcoming season.However, sometimes I hold on to some real old pieces of clothing because they are so comfy around the home. This is especially true for some night gowns. I realized that I have holes in two of my favourite night gowns a while ago and yet I kept wearing them. However, I started feeling cheap about this recently, especially after our visit to mom's cousin. I am very neat when it comes to wearing things outside. I never wear anything with a hole or a stain. If I cannot fix it, it doesn't get worn, period!I have two small drawers for my night gowns and they are stuffed. There are some night gowns never worn. I usually keep two that are brand new just in case I need hospital care (old habit inherited from grandma) but I think I have 4 or 5 that are brand new.So, after mom goes back to Ankara, I will go through my stuff and cut up things that has holes and donate things that are still in good condition.Mom is actually great in doing this but she is very impatient and whenever we tried doing a purge together, she took down all the closets and dumped everything on my bed all at once and made this a whole day chore. I like to do things at my own pace. One closet at a time or a couple of drawers at a time. I do not like to do this all day long. So, I am not even mentioning my intention :)"},

It is not a fancy place. No pool or anything like that but it is at a very desirable spot and our apartments are still considered great investments. The buildings are 16-17 years old or so, last year we had to pitch in extra for insulation of all buildings and an external paint job. This year, we are paying for a new heating system. I am sure next year will be something else. I also had an internal paint job and tore down my bathroom last year. Now, the kitchen is awaiting for a complete renovation.

Her cousin is super nice and she doesn't let me help with anything.  I feel like we are causing her extra work and her not letting me help is making me uncomfortable. Mom's discomfort is due to the fact that her cousin's summer home is very very cluttered. Normally, mom considers my home cluttered but there is no comparison. Well, mom is a neat-freak and she just cannot stand clutter. She cannot help herself.Besides, there is a neighbourhood notion that we do not really understand or appreciate. Last night a neighbour called at 11:00 p.m.(!) and came to visit with her son. Mom and I were ready to go to bed so we just said hello and went to our room. Well it turned out that they came to say \"welcome\" to us! It is both a bit embarrassing and frustrating. I think mom and I have been city folks for so long that we do not understand the dynamics of small places. In Istanbul, I do not know any of my neighbours and I am fine with that. I certainly do not need people knocking at my door and conveniently inviting themselves at my bed time.So, I asked mom if she wants to stay longer because I intend to go back home even if I have to work next week. Now that I can fly, it is easy. She said \"no\" so, I am going to make up an excuse to leave on Saturday. Before we leave, I will take her cousin out to dinner as a \"thank you\" and to shopping so that she can replenish her pantry.

What a waste! I should have known better and kept up the good habit.Anyway, I went back to good old habits of setting goals and making budgets sometime in my mid-thirties. I had set myself a goal of buying my first apartment by the age of 35 but, I could only manage that when I was 37 due to some bad and hasty career decisions on my part.After I purchased my current residence 10 years ago, I did not set goals but kept saving money diligently. However, I did not know much about investing so, I probably missed some opportunities. Retirement Funds became available mid 2003 in Turkey and I decided to open an account. It is similar to US Roth IRA. Many people were skeptical about this new system but, having read many PF blogs, I decided to do it. Last year the Government decided that not enough people joined the system so, they announced that they will be matching contributions by 25%. Whoa! That is a great match! So, I decided to fund my retirement account as much as I could. Unfortunately, I cannot fund it up to the maximum allowed. I divert all my rental income to the retirement fund. I am short by about 27% each month. If all goes well this year, I may put in a lump sum before the end of the year.Speaking of rental income, I purchased my rental apartment back in 2011 when I had moved back to Ankara for about two years. My savings were not earning much money, the rents were too high and I did not want to stay with mom for too long so, I took out a very short term loan of 36 months and put in all my savings to buy a 2 bedroom apartment. That loan is paid of as of this past May.I am semi-retired and work part-time as a consultant. I collect SS (yes, my country is weird that way, the eligibility age is now much older but I was not affected by much, so I was able to retire at the old age of 45!) and collect rent. Those constitute my passive income which by the way is just about enough to cover my living expenses. So, any money I make through my part-time job is for goals and savings.My primary goal is to take a month-long vacation in the US driving from NY to Florida and visit some friends in 2015. My other goal is to tear down the entrance, the kitchen and the balcony and re-do those areas from scratch sometime in 2016-17. I have a 2010 Nissan Note which I hope to keep until the end of 2018 if not more and then, get a new car.Above are my goals and I hope to fully retire in 2023 when I will have full access to my retirement fund."},

However, she likes to spend money.A few days ago, I casually told her my observation trying not to offend her after she suggested we should look at some shoes that were BOGOF. I do not need any shoes for a very long time. She surely doesn't need new shoes either. She just wanted to get them. I said I was not interested in getting any and since she definitely did not need two pairs, she gave up the idea.She barely wears everything that she owns. Sometimes she even forgets what she bought and looks at similar stuff and when I remind her that she already owns a similar item, she admits, she forgot.My dad always worried about money. My sister and I went to private schools and even though both my parents worked, money was somewhat tight. We never felt deprived of anything but my parents needed to watch our finances closely. I think mom felt deprived during those times. She was a young woman who needed to deal with a worrying spouse. Ever since my dad passed away, she is in charge of her own finances and although she did well, she also did purchase pretty unnecessary stuff all that time.I was watching a TV show the other day and the young woman was telling that she had 78 bottles of nail polish and 27 lipsticks.

I had read his book earlier and tried using the techniques but, I was semi-successful.To make a long story short, I went to just one session and I started flying again. I actually flyed for the fifth time last night. Woooohoooo! Yay Me! I am so thankful to have such a nice and thoughtful friend."},

At that late hour I did not know what to do and could not turn to another mutual friend as to how, when, why, how about his wife, son, etc... I was shocked too. As far as I knew he did not have health problems and he was only 59.I spoke to him about a month ago. He sounded happy and we talked about meeting sometime in the summer where he lived with his wife.This morning, a mutual friend called to confirm the news. I am so sad... He was a good person, a good father, a loving husband, nice colleague and a good friend.It struck me that my only tie with my friends are mostly themselves. I do not know how to reach their spouses or kids. I am single and my friends would not know how to reach my family if something happened to me. Nobody knows my password for my FB account or mobile phone. What happens after we go?"},

We bought plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits. We go through tremendous amounts of vegetables. Mom and I eat a vegetable meal per day and vegetables shrink a lot when cooked. Tonight's dinner was broccoli and beetroot greens sauteed with onions and garlic. I topped it with plain yogurt. We also go through a lot of plain yogurt since every veggie meal is accompanied by that.Our other meal is either red meat, poultry, legumes or fish and sometimes eggs. We always have a salad with this meal.Our snacks are fruits, fresh steamed corn, crackers and sometimes fruit yogurt. Tonight's snack is strawberries.I have a little leftover from tonight's meal and it will be turned into a frittata on Monday. I like leftovers:)"},

We always have a vegetable dish for one meal and meat for the other. For instance, tomorrow we are having chicken and a salad for lunch. For dinner, we are having string beans cooked in olive oil.Last time I checked the cupboards and the fridge, I have noted that some staples will be gone soon so, tomorrow is a major shopping day. There are two stores of the same chain right by me but those stores are somewhat more expensive. However they always have better produce and meat. So, I shop there for meat and for produce when I cannot go to the weekly open produce markets all around the city. For replenishing staples like tuna fish, olive oil, cheeses and detergent, I go to another store which is 5 miles from where I live.I just checked the fliers of both chains and it does make sense to go to the one 5 miles away tomorrow so, off I go to check and finish my shopping list."},

New cell phones are expensive so it would be nice to have a fund saved just for these types of expenses. Small expenses such as a broken hair dryer or a new kitchen gadget usually comes out of my free spending+grocery budget but a cell phone is expensive.I have a fully funded EF so, may be I should set aside a much smaller say USD 1,000 fund for replacing broken items? Sounds like a good idea but managing so many small funds is a lot of work. I am thinking of changing the design of my budget a little. At the moment, I have an EF and a savings fund which will be allocated to new kitchen, new car and a US road trip not in that order and a small investment basket apart from my retirement account. There also lots of categories such as car related expenses, taxes, insurances etc. May be I should set aside the savings as a lump sum amount and ear mark certain percentages to different funds...

{"title": "Good Debt versus Bad Debt", "date": "Wednesday, June 4, 2014", "text": "I must have been born hating debt. I cannot imagine anything that is more depressing and limiting with the exception of serious health issues.I started using a credit card back in 1990 and I have never paid a single penny as interest. I have always thought of credit cards as a means of payment not as a source of loan. Credit card debt is a very very very bad form of debt.Student loans are not a part of life in my country but I understand it may be a necessary evil for Americans. The part that I do not understand is the expectation of income versus the amount of debt incurred. If you are studying to become something that will not enable you to pull lots of money, getting into debt for education does not make sense to me. Besides, if I am not wrong, going to state schools are less expensive in the US.Would I borrow money to buy a car? Ummmm... No! I never did that but then again, I was lucky to drive company cars most of my career, like 16 years out of 24. I bought 6 cars in my life, 3 used, 3 brand new all with cold, hard cash. I have a 4 year old car which I am hoping to replace in 2018 so, part of my current savings should be allocated to that. A car loan may be necessary for some but not for me. A car loan may be a good debt for some people. For most people I think it is bad debt.How about a home? Well, that is a big ticket item and it doesn't make sense to wait many years for home ownership. However, I would not be comfortable paying just 25% down even for a home. I once did that but, I had a property for sale and had a very solid full-time job. I closed the bank loan in less than a year selling my other property. If I were in my early thirties and if I had a solid job, would I take along-term loan like a 20 year mortgage? May be, I am not sure. Still that is a very long time for things going wrong.My thinking is probably due to being single. If I had a spouse, if we could live comfortable on one income, I might be willing to take more risks.I consider all debts bad with the exception of a home loan. It is a matter of postponing wants. Not an easy task with all sorts of things that are shiny and new around us, with people who seem to have everything but, living within ones means is the key."},
{"title": "But I want it NOW!", "date": "Tuesday, June 3, 2014", "text": "I want to renovate my entrance, my kitchen and the balcony. I would like to take out all the flooring to replace the piping underneath. I want to get rid of all the terrible looking kitchen cupboards and redo it with nice looking cupboards. I need more counter space. I want to change the tile flooring in the balcony with new and better looking tiles.I want all this............ now but, can I do it now? Well... Yes technically I can but, to do that I must dip into savings earmarked for rainy days. I just had my apartment painted last August and if I rip all the above apart, I would need these spaces repainted with all the renovation. Am I prepared for the hassle? No. Would I feel awkward if I spend my current savings? Absolutely! I would be terrified to know that I do not have my cushion for just in case.Besides, I haven't quite figured out what kind of new flooring I want, how much would I be willing to shell out for the kitchen and other details. My oven definitely needs to be replaced but not the fridge or the dish washer. I have so many pots and pans. Do I need all that much or can I get rid of some of those. I have checked IKEA kitchens and I know what kind of look I want. I must sit down, figure out a budget, add at least 15% to it.Right now I am saving a lump sum amount for kitchen renovation, new car and a road trip in the US, not in that order.Some people may prefer to get a loan for home renovation but with my fluctuating income, I do not see how I can get a loan from a bank. Besides, I am against borrowing for anything except for a home.It is difficult to postpone wants but it is necessary. I am 47 and I am not getting any younger. I do not know for how long I shall be able to pull in more income. When I will have to solely rely on my passive income, I do not think I will be able to buy a new car, do major renovations or take expensive vacations. So, while I can, I must save, save and save...I had my bathroom redone and my windows replaced last year. Those should last many years. Once I have my kitchen redone that also should last for very long. So long that I would not to replace them again. I do not think I will live here in this apartment till I die although, I have no plans to move out for the foreseeable future. You never know what life brings along so we'll see."},

I read how she had invested in solar panels, bought a new car, how she was a landlady. She was (and I am sure still is) a very sensible person. I enjoyed reading her very much. I am so sorry that she is now gone. I wish I could hear about how she did after she quit blogging.That's udy with a J: She recently quit blogging all of a sudden. I was actually happy that I had found her after she had to change her blog for some reason I do not know. I am so sorry that I couldn't even say goodbye to her. I admired her strong will and the wonderful kids she has raised. I loved the way she was attached to her family and her determination in eliminating debt.Wealth is Good: The owner was a smart young lady who did not have any money issues but rather blessed with wealth. Still she was careful with her investments and how she handled money.  She openly shared how she handled her income and windfalls. It was a pleasure to read her. She got into a serious relationship and apparently her significant other did not want to so openly share finances. So, she quit blogging.My Open Wallet: Madame X is a New Yorker. She still posts some updates but very few and far between. I miss her very much but I think she has a happy and busier life now so, I am happy for her.Moneyapolis: This was a blog where the owner moved to a new city and started a new life with her spouse. I miss her blog too.Northern Living Allowance: This blog is still active but after the owner moved to England, she posted only a few times. I am really curious about her new life and wish her the best. I was intrigued about her life in North America as well. It felt like we were long time acquaintances.Blogging Away Debt: This blog is active with new bloggers but I am so curious about the old bloggers and how they are doing, especially Tricia and Beks.There are many more that I miss and wish all of them well."},

The prices were pretty good though nowhere near US prices. We tried many pairs on. I ended up buying two pairs, she bought one. We also bought a t-shirt each. It was a good chunk of money spent and a splurge but, I believe it was worth it. I do not need to buy anything else this summer except for a couple of shirts and may be a pair of pants.I wear sneakers all the time and especially when my tendons are causing me trouble like now. I even wear them to work. I always apologize for wearing sneakers and explain that I have some feet issues. Never met a customer who was not understanding. The customer in Izmir is a very casual place so, they do not mind at all. The customer in Ankara is a formal place but they are nice and understanding people. Besides, I dress formally except for the shoes.I love outlet shopping in the US. The prices are amazing but I know one needs to be careful since not all merchandise is good quality. I remember picking up Crocs at 5 dollars for my sister. That is a price you can never find in here. My favorite outlet mall is Woodbury Commons Outlet Mall in NY.

I am now back home with mom and I realized that I was out of many staples around the kitchen so I had to hit the grocery store twice in three days. I got whole wheat flour, crackers, meat, fish, olive oil, onions, fresh green beans, eggplants, salad greens, coffee, bread, cheese, fresh apricots, milk, eggs and yogurtWe cooked some stuffed peppers and tomatoes and froze them in portion sizes. Also, three meals worth of meatballs went into the freezer. We eat one dish per meal due to our diet plan. One meal is always a veggie with plain yogurt and a slice of whole wheat bread. The other is a big salad, some type of meat with a slice of whole wheat bread.Now that we have enough meat dishes in the fridge, we only cook fresh veggies usually just once or twice a week. Sometimes we cook beans instead of consuming meat. Today I am going to start a home-made whole wheat bread and tomorrow I will make yogurt. I normally do not bake bread much. I make my own yogurt whenever I have a good starter and whenever I have time.We are feeding ourselves rather simply and in a healthy manner so I am very glad. I use only olive oil in my cooking."},

I do not count my residence, my rental property and my car in my net worth calculation. The market price for property in my opinion is not a valid estimate. Their worth is very much dependent on how fast you need to sell them, how many buyers are out there to buy them at the prevailing market prices, luck and many other variables.I tally up my cash, checking account, savings accounts (TL and USD), gold coins and my retirement account and calculate my net worth. If all goes well, I am planning to keep on working part time till June 2023 when I will be 56. After that I can retire for good. I do not know if I would like to do that though. Seems to me it is rather early but you never know what your health will be like.I know people are surprised that I am already semi-retired. This is due to two reasons: First, there aren't many full time jobs out there for me anymore. I am both expensive and too experienced. The job market in this country is cruel. After 45, one is considered old. Second, I am single and I have no dependents by choice. I have always loved my independence and my flexibility and made some OK decisions during the first 24 years of my career so that I can now work part-time and be happy with what I earn.

There has not been a new proposal given to a prospective customer since the beginning of the year. All we have are the current customers and that may not be enough. So, I have tweaked my budget carefully and things do not look terrible, however, I will be extra careful and try to sock away the same amount of money each month as if I will still be paying the debt on the rental property.I still do not have a new tenant. Once a new tenant moves in, I will be diverting that income to my retirement income.I am looking at different types of saving accounts offered by my bank. I think, I will set up a 5 year saving account in USDs. I must set it up with a minimum of USD 500 and I must add a minimum of USD 50 per month. The interest rate is 2.60. I do have a USD savings account but this one will force me to put aside some money every month as if I am paying down debt. The question is how much money should I put in that account every month.I will put the remaining amount that I will be saving in a savings account for easy access in case of an emergency or in case I need to supplement a given month's income.I am also contemplating to look around for a new job.

Then I drove by the tire dealer and passed it so I had to sit in traffic to go back there. I wasted precious gas today. So, I was stupid...Anyway, today I had errands to run. First, I went to the dealer to get the winter tires off and the regular tires on. Then I went to get my TSH checked. After that I went to have the blown headlight lamp changed. I came home and craved something sweet so I walked to the grocery store and bought some wafers, chocolate pudding and ice-cream and no, I did not eat them all.Here is a tally of what I spent today:Tire Change and storage of winter tires for 6 months:120 TLTSH Test: 65 TLHeadlight fix: 25 TLSweet stuff: 13 TLGas: 100 TL (Half a tank)Total: 323 TL roughly USD 150I am glad I spent the money to get my TSH checked because couple of weeks ago I had that checked and got a real bad result so I was worried and I made an appointment with an endocrinologist which was going to be a very expensive visit. Then I thought about my last visit to a specialist and suspected the result. (My thyroid had been treated with radiation and it has stopped working for good and the dose of the synthetic thyroid I had been taking has helped me maintain a very stable TSH level for a long time so there was no way, that result could have happened).So, I had another test performed and voila! my test was normal. Looking at the number I realized that the previous place made a decimal mistake which is a big mistake. Never going back there again!Tomorrow I am canceling the appointment. Soooo happy!"},

USD 1,000 to start an EF: Check!2. Pay of all debt using the Debt Snowball: I have two months left for getting rid of my debt on my rental property.3. 3-6 months of expenses in savings: Check! (Well semi-check!) I have 3 months worth of expenses in savings but, unless I have a whole years' worth of cash (minus my passive income), I will not feel safe. If I can bring in my \"forecast\" income by the end of the year, that may be accomplished.4.Invest 15% of income into ROTH IRAs and pre-tax retirement: We have what is called a Personal Retirement Account to which I am contributing that much. However, due to my age, I need to increase it. Besides, this is a fairly new thing (10 years) in this country so, what I have already accumulated in that account is not significant. Once the debt is gone, I shall divert my rental income property to that. BTW, there is no new tenant yet.5. College Funding for Children: N/A. I have no kids.6. Pay off home early: Check! I own my residence free and clear since 2005.7. Build wealth and give: I donate money on a regular basis so, that is taken care of. I already own a rental property as a part of my building wealth but, I must start a new car fund (2018), home renovation fund(2016) and a Dream Vacation Fund once I clear off the debt and put away a whole year's worth of expenses aside.All in all, I seem to be doing OK but, I do not feel that way. I am constantly worried about the future. For how long shall I be able to work? What if I get seriously sick? What if I become disabled? What if I live too long?I do not have kids. My sister is married but she doesn't have kids either. Our family is really really very small. Mom, uncle, sis, BIL, two cousins (unmarried, no kids) and their mom. That is all. We do not have much of a support system by way of family. Except for my sister and her husband, everybody else is just getting by. Noone is wealthy and their income streams are small too. They may need help in the future and that is also a concern too. Sis and BIL work for a state owned bank and their income is steady though not high and they already have some assets to rely on.

Cooking from scratch is fun: I get to try different things and modify recipes to suit my palate,3. I can control what goes in my food so that I can avoid sugars, bad fat, MSG, excessive sodium, etc.4. Home cooked meals can be made healthier.5. I can cook in large quantities and freeze food in portion sizes for lazy days.6. I can plan my menus around inexpensive and fresh ingredients.7. Cooking gives me a sense of accomplishment. Every month I go out with friends once. That is pretty much my only indulgence and it is built into my budget, yet, after every get together I cringe at the amount of money I spend. It is usually worth a whole week's groceries. I used to order food to be delivered quiet frequently when I was working full time. That was bad both on my budget and my waistline. I am glad I gave that habit up along with the habit of drinking coke and other fizzy drinks.Besides, I am a darn good cook!:)))"},
{"title": "Advice Needed! Parents please comment on what you think about this...", "date": "Thursday, March 6, 2014", "text": "I have never been married and never had kids so, I know what it is to be a kid but not a parent. Today a friend of mine called me to pour his heart out a little bit. He is a former colleague and a very good friend. His 21 year old daughter has fallen for a guy who lives in another country. This guy is 30 years old and they met online. He came to Turkey and my friend took him and his daughter out for dinners and really got out of his way to get to know this person. My friend is a more traditional type but he certainly outdid himself by agreeing to this relationship. After all, times have changed and children are more independent. Besides his daughter is 21 and will be graduating College this year.After flirting online and meeting each other both in Turkey an in Europe for a while, my friend's daughter found out that this young man was also involved with other young women (plural!). She found e-mails which were like photocopies of his messages to her down to the minute details such as naming future kids. What a jerk! So, her heart was broken badly and she sank into a big depression. My friend and his wife felt very helpless and they were very sorry for their daughter not knowing how to console her.Some time has passed and the man contacted his daughter on Valentine's Day and apparently sweet talked her into getting back together. They met in Holland last week and when my friend found out about it, he ordered his daughter to come right back and felt compelled to deliver an ultimatum. He told her, if she goes to live with this guy despite his cheating on her, she might as well forget her family. He believes a cheater will always be a cheater and I tend to agree with him. I lived through a similar situation when I was 30 and got pretty hurt. I still feel very ashamed of my bad choice.My friend went to see a shrink and took his daughter to her as well.I did not know what to tell him. After all, people seem to learn only from their own mistakes and if passion takes over, logic flies out the window. May be he needs to let her make a big mistake and pick her up when she needs support but my friend cannot even consider this option. As I said before, he is a more traditional type.So, parents out there, what do you think? What would you recommend my friend? I am not much of help in this department. All comments will be appreciated."},
{"title": "Some bloggers...", "date": "Wednesday, March 5, 2014", "text": "I am a PF blog junkie. I am always looking for new blogs to read about frugal ways, saving money, debt reduction and etc.I usually check out the blog rolls of my favorite bloggers and sometimes I get hooked to some of these blogs. However, sometimes I stumble upon some blogs that make me puzzled at the interesting thought processes of the bloggers. That is to put it nicely...I know people who budget, who keep track of every penny, who do not waste food, who shop wisely, who cook at home regularly, who brown bag lunches and snacks to work, who work more than one job to reduce debt and am truly inspired by their resourcefulness. It is both a joy and a learning experience reading their blogs.There are others who keep complaining about debt, credit cards, loans and etc. and who still cannot give up their lavish life styles and who keep making real bad choices. I know it sounds like I am being judgemental and I may be. Getting rid of debt or trying to live within one's means or saving money for some big ticket item... These all require careful budgeting, making sacrifices, working hard, making do or doing without. Throwing expensive parties for toddlers who will never remember whether their first birthday was catered or homemade, leasing brand new cars, eating out excessively and participating in expensive events are all choices and I think they are bad choices.I am not saying that we should deprive ourselves of every single joy in life while paying down debt. Differentiating between wants and needs is important. Determining what is important is not rocket science. Debt is not always the product of a careless and stupid life style. Unexpected things may happen, health issues may hit us, someone in the family may be in a real bad situation and we may find ourselves in debt. I do not consider mortgage bad debt because apparently, it is a way of life in the West and lately over here too. I do not know about student loans. Reading many bloggers, I am not sure if all student loans are worth it.Of course we need to replace things that break down which are beyond their economical lives, of course we must take care of our health and help others who are in really dire situations.I think I like to read people who make smart choices, who stretch their dollars and who are determined to get rid of debt or save for something for later. They are truly inspirational. I just cannot stand the bloggers who constantly complain and yet do not act wisely. So, I just do not read them."},

She came back in exactly 37 minutes.She said she did not feel a thing and the whole time she conversed with her doctor. The procedure itself seemed to have taken 5-7 minutes according to her. They used a US made lens. After she was brought back to the room, she was served a light breakfast and discharged. Her eye is covered and no drops or anything is given. Tomorrow we will go in for a check and they will probably prescribe some drops then. She did not complain of anything so, I guess that is a good thing but we will know for sure tomorrow. The doctor told her she would not need glasses from now on except for reading glasses but she has been nearsighted for the last 61 years and she wants to keep on wearing glasses in order not to feel naked. Lol! The doctor told her there are many patients like that.I paid about USD 200 out of pocket since she had the procedure at a private hospital and Social Security covered only a part of it. Had it been a state hospital, it would be free but, we like to have the option to choose doctors and sure glad we have the funds to do so at least for these types of smallish expenses.

My rental property loan is going to be all paid in May so, after May, I am hoping to divert all my rental income to my retirement account.Turkish economy is showing signs of weakness. There seems to be a crisis every 7-10 years so, I will just keep saving and spending carefully."},

One fish usually means at least a pound (454 grams), mostly more. None of the above are farmed fish. Farmed fish is inexpensive but not very healthy. Besides the farms are corrupting our seas so, I prefer not to buy farmed fish.I almost always broil the first three types of fish. I cook the mackerels in a non-stick pan with very little oil. Bonito is not very tasty if you broil it so, I saute lots of onions and tomatoes in a wok and then put in the sliced fish and cook it over stove top with a lid on.I try having fish two to three days a week in season when the prices are good. Fresh is the best but, after April, frozen fish is the only option."},

However, electricity is expensive and today I realized that my electricity bill is much higher than usual this month. Then, I remembered that turkey which required 7 hours of roasting time, and all those things I baked for the New Year dinner. Taste comes at a price for sure:)I have my freezers stuffed with pre-cooked meals so, I decided I should eat off the freezers for a while to decrease my electricity bill next month. I re-heat the pre-made stuff over my gas stove and it is much much cheaper. When I am cooking, I usually use my pressure cooker which also saves time and energy.I usually start stocking up on fresh fish in January because fish hunting period ends in April till September and fish is fresh and inexpensive in the winter. However, this year the weather was unusually warm up until this week so, fish supply is limited and fish is expensive. We are also alarmed about a possible draught this year which is a very bad news. Hopefully the weather will turn cold and bring in some much needed snow. This way, I can stock up on fish soon. Eating out of the freezers is a very good idea at this point to make room for the fish. Last year I bought around 30 pounds of fish and it provided a nice variety in my meal plans.My gas stove uses very little energy especially because I use the pressure cooker so often. Too bad turkey doesn't taste as great when cooked in a pressure cooker. Besides a whole bird will never fit in it.I am away from home today and tomorrow so, I will be eating out tonight. Mom is at my apartment and she is enjoying the pre-made meals which she contributed to making."},

Many people did not have enough space at their homes. Stackable models came out but they were really expensive so dryers never became popular as they are in the US. Although I have the funds to afford one now, I do not have the space.While I lived in the US early 90s, I thought they were the best thing ever. I basically owned two sets of sheets and only a few towels for the three years I lived there. Now I own way too many of those but for different reasons:) I admit, I have a thing for sheets and towels.When we were kids, since mom was working, she would often do the laundry during the weekend. There would be loads of laundry that would need to dry. In the summer time she used lines in our big balconies but, during the winter everything needed to be hung indoors. Mom is a creative woman so, all over the apartment there would be lines/ropes which I could not even imagine where they were tied to. She would yell at us to stay away from the fresh laundry which was pretty much impossible.Drying racks became popular early 90s and they were affordable and foldable so, space was not an issue. I have always owned a drying rack. I do laundry any day during the week so, my rack is sufficient. However, couple of weeks ago I ignored the laundry a bit and I was busy so, mom decided to help with it. I don't know where she found the rope but, I realized that she put it up all over the small apartment that I have. It was as if I was 10 again. She kept yelling at me to stay away from the fresh laundry:) Good times..."},

A third client would be great so, I am keeping my fingers crossed.There is no news from the real estate broker yet. No January rent from the tenant either. Tomorrow I am going to give the broker a call. He is probably not checking his e-mail regularly. An old fashioned guy...I better go pack my bag to avoid rushing in the morning.Whatever you imagined when you read the heading, it is not like that:)Today, I saw an unbelievable price on TP and I grabbed two 32 packs but alas!, at the self-checkout, I realized that the price was not what it was marked so, I asked for help. It turned out that there was a marking error. Now, if we were in the US, they would give me the products at the marked price as a courtesy. Not in this country... So, I left both packs there. I really do not need TP for a while but the price was so good, I wanted to stock up on it. Oh well...I bought the following for about USD 30.1 lt. EVOO (for salads)2 lt. Virgin Olive Oil (for cooking)1 dozen free range eggs1 kg. carrots2 packs of baking paper3 lt. milk100 count tea bagsThe fridge and the freezer are well stocked so, I guess there will be no more grocery shopping with the exception of some veggies this week.  The oils will last well over three months since I have some at home too. The eggs and the carrots will last for two weeks because, we eat them occasionally based on our diet lists. The baking paper will probably last till next year since I bake only during the winter months. The milk will probably last for two weeks. The tea bags will last more than 6 months because I brew tea and do not like the bagged stuff. It is just a convenience for when mom and I feel lazy."},

We are former colleagues and although we haven't been working for the same company for over 7 years, we are a pretty close circle of friends. There are 3 guys and 4 ladies including yours truly in our group. We keep in touch via phone all the time but make sure we get together at least every month.Our outings are usually of the expensive kind because, all of us like to eat and drink and Istanbul is a gem of a place. We almost never go to the same place twice in a year. Since it is only once a month, I do not mind the expense. It is pretty much my only splurge. Usually alcoholic beverages cost a lot because of the enormous taxes imposed by the current conservative Government. They cannot ban it as they would love to do but they keep upping the taxes so, our outings cost dearly. I usually do not drink so that I can drive some of my friends home and whenever I feel like drinking, we leave all the cars and use public transportation. We are all responsible adults with ages ranging between 42-54. Oh and btw, we always divide the bill among us equally because doing it otherwise would make us feel cheap. The guys are the bigger drinkers so they usually treat us to coffee afterwards or pay the parking tickets and try to balance the expenses out. It is cute.For the last 3 years we started a new tradition of gift giving for the New Year's (we do not celebrate Christmas, since we are not Christians but, we do celebrate the New Year and for some of us exchanging gifts is something we like to do. More religious types frown upon that but, I do not care).Yesterday night was our gift exchange night and we had a blast. We do have some pranksters in our group and they love their tricks. So, I ended up with a very elegant 100% wool shawl (my principal gift), a cute puppy bookmark and a couple of cute bowls and a horribly slutty looking sequined shirt which was my funny gift from the pranksters:)I have bought everyone funny multi-colored toe socks:)I am sure glad I belong to this funny, intelligent, thoughtful group of friends.

(26.45 lbs) and my weight loss is as shown on the ticker above.Some people are able to lose a lot faster but we were on and off the diet vagon and even when we were off, we had been relatively good. This has been more of a lifestyle change for both of us.Our next appointment will be in January 21st. Until then, we will stick to our plans. She actually added more food to my list because apparently I have lost more than she expected during the last 20 days.I am now allowed to exercise so, I will be using weights for my arms and Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds DVDs for exercising indoors.The key to weight loss is drinking plenty of water. If I remember to drink green tea that helps too. My dietician wants us to drink two cups of green tea each day but, since I do not like it, I tend to skip it.People ask me what my goal weight is. The thing is I do not know. I have spent the last 25 years fat/obese. I do not know what is a realistic weight for me. I just want to keep trying to stick to a healthy lifestyle with plenty of appropriate exercise. I would like to get below 100 kgs (220 pounds) but that will take a long time.I already feel much better about my body weight. I can walk long distances without my feet and back hurting. I do not feel tired all the time anymore. I can only guess when I shed about 40 more pounds, life will be much better.I am getting rid of all fat clothes. I wowed never to gain back the weight I have so far lost. I am not shopping either. I have enough clothes to wear until I get down to two sizes smaller. I am happy as of now."},

Unfortunately, in this country at my age, one is considered \"old\" for many positions.I will be financially free in May 2014 and after that even if I do not work at all, I could live with my passive income.

Yes, I make a budget, yes, I save money on a monthly basis but keeping a Price Book is a bit of a stretch. I do have a good memory though and I use that to my advantage.I know the unit prices of all sorts of detergents I use, paper goods, olive oil, milk and a lot of other staples. So, while grocery shopping I always compare unit prices and if there is a real good deal of something I regularly use, I stock up on that item. This works for me.Mom is currently with me until mid February or so but, I remember her mentioning that she was low on dishwasher tablets. So, the other day as we were walking the isles of a supermarket, I noticed a very good deal on dishwasher detergent and we bought her a large pack. She laughs at me for remembering such stuff but again, it works for me!Few weeks ago I snatched up body washing liquids at half price. They came in small bottles but the unit price was cheaper than the large bottles. Larger containers do not always mean economy. Also, I like it better when I have small bottles of a variety of fragrances instead of having to wash with the same thing for months. Another thing I have noticed is that I use liquid cleaning products more sparingly if they are in a smaller bottle. So, even when I buy large bottles due to a good price, I pour the contents to smaller ones."},

The problem is that I am short of cash so, I had to give up a part of my investments. I decided to part with 20% of my gold investment. I made 6% in 5 months on gold so, although it is declining sharply, this is a clean profit. I have sold the gold and put the money in my retirement fund. The government will match it by 25% which to me is a great deal.In 2014, I shall be paying the maximum to my retirement account.Unless the Stock Exchange plunges, I do not think I will be investing in individual stocks in 2014. I have enough risk exposure to stocks in my retirement portfolio. However, since I have 9,5 years to go before I can touch that money without having to pay extra taxes, I am comfortable with that.I will be basically purchasing US Dollars and keep a bigger cash cushion in a savings account.I also will not be purchasing any more gold.So, based on the above decisions, I have set my 2014 goals which I will be tweaking a little by the end of December.2014 is an exciting year for me because I will be truly Financially Independent by May-June. This does not mean that I will stop working. I think, I would like to work until June 2023 when I will be 56.Lately I had been contemplating whether I started to work on a part-time basis too early or not.

She acts funny as if she never really wants to learn this stuff yet, she has to at least a little bit.Her cell phone was one of those fool proof archaic ones and she absolutely loved it till it broke down lately. So, my thoughtful sister gave her, her old Samsung phone. It is a touch phone and it is smart. My mom? Not very much so... She is getting used to the phone reaaaaalllllyyyyy slooooooooowly...She bought a new TV (smart) this year and her cable service had to be upgraded. However the idiot who went to bring the new box and take the old one out screwed up big time and she ended up having two subscriptions with some period commitments. If you cancel either of the subscriptions, there is a penalty. Mom of course did not realize this when the installation was being done. I pay for that service and when I saw two charges on my credit card, I inquired about it and found out the whole stupidity.I had to call the cable company and pretend that I was mom because they want to talk to the member only and mom wants none of this mess. I was on the phone for several minutes and finally got the cable company understand that there has been a mistake and that it was not on our side.They told me they would take care of it and then they would inform me. I called mom and told her what has passed and told her that she would soon receive a call as to whether the problem was fixed or not. Did she listen to me? I thought she did but, apparently I was wrong. So, when the company called her up to inquire further about the membership numbers, she told them the problem was fixed! Why? Because, I took charge and talked to the cable company and for her that was it. So, a month later, I found out that the problem still existed, called the cable company twice again pretending to be mom and re-do the whole \"it wasn't our fault so why penalize us?\" thing.I gave them my number and took hers out of the cable company's system but, her home phone cannot be erased. So, I called her up again told her what was going on twice and told her if she ever receives a call she should NOT tell that the problem is gone. Ahhhhhh! I feel tired.

I took a cab home instead of picking up my car from where I parked because, I had drunk more than I ever do. Normally I drink only one glass of an alcoholic beverage and take charge as the designated driver. It was a very good night. We are having so much fun with this group and I hope to be able to do it for many years to come in good health."},
{"title": "Baked Falafel... Inadvertently:)", "date": "Sunday, November 17, 2013", "text": "Last night I soaked some chick peas. My intention was to cook them and use them in soups and salads for a while but I forgot to time the pressure cooker and my chickpeas turned very mushy.I scratched my head as to what I should make with them. I immediately thought of hummus but I don't have any tahini at home and also it is fattening. I like falafels but I never made them. I did not want to fry anything so I looked up baked falafel recipes and I found one which I could easily make. After the chicken came out of the oven, I put the falafels in and they turned out to be quiet good.I am all set for the week ahead.A not so close friend of mine contacted me over Facebook to say that she would be in Istanbul during the weekend and that it would be nice to see me. She called me yesterday and I was really feeling crappy due to my period so, I told her I could not go out at night, but we could have breakfast today. I guess her plans were different so we decided we could not get together this weekend.A bunch of old High School mates are gathering today and I really wanted to go but I am still feeling not great. Besides, tomorrow night I am supposed to meet with my regular buddies and that usually ends up to be an expensive night. I could not justify eating expensive meals out two nights in a row so, I called my school mates to say I will not be able to make it.Just a few minutes ago I was about to place a food delivery order online because I am not feeling well but suddenly I realized it is going to be both expensive and unhealthy. So, I decided to go to the grocery store which is like 2 minutes on foot to get my weekly food shopping done. I am now leaving this post to run to the store and I will complete it when I get back with a tally of what I had bought...............OK, I am back and here is what I bought for 44 TL roughly around USD 22-23:A Whole ChickenTomatoesSatsuma MandarinesYogurtBroccoliIceberg LettuceArugula3 cans of Light Ice TeaSpinach PieI am surely glad I walked over to the store. It would be pure laziness otherwise and I would have eaten in an unhealthy manner. I am not going to defend the purchase of Spinach Pie and the Light Ice Tea but every once in a while those should be OK. I have limited the consumption of sugar and artificial sweeteners significantly. I probably consume a can of light soda or iced tea per week. It shouldn't be so bad.The chicken, the broccoli and the salad material should provide me enough lunches and dinners till Wednesday when I will be travelling again. I think there will be even leftover chicken which I might end up freezing.So many choices we have to make within a day... I feel good about my choices today."},

I have a heavy case of my period so, as soon as I got home, I took everything out of my suitcase, dumped them on the floor by the washing machine, took off what I was wearing and added them to the pile and jump in the shower. After a nice relaxing short shower I went to bed and opened my eyes at lunch time.I am done with all the laundry as I am typing this. This is a no spend day for me so, I am eating out of my freezer. I do not have the stamina to go out and do grocery shopping for the week so, that will be done tomorrow. I  had the last of the homemade yogurt so, I must go shopping.I have been throwing out lots of worn out underwear lately so, I checked my stash to see if new underwear shopping is on the horizon. It turned out that it is. I took out 5 new underpants which brought my stock to under 10. I usually stock up on underpants when they are on sale and always have lots of new ones still in their original packages. I think I bought new ones over a year ago so, no wonder my stash is now so low.There are a couple of stores I would like to check out so, probably, Monday is a better day to do that."},
{"title": "Important Milestones in May 2014!", "date": "Friday, November 15, 2013", "text": "I have 6 more months to go on the bank debt for my rental property. In May 2014, I will be the proud owner of two apartments one being my primary residence free and clear. Both apartments are humble, small residences with 2 bedrooms. Right now I am paying more to the bank than I can collect as rent on the second property. However, finishing off the payments in 3 years was important to me.I am so looking forward to May. I will have a significant breathing room in my budget and will start saving for more home renovation, a vacation in the US and a new car in 2018.The best part is; after May 2014, my passive income will be just enough to cover all my living expenses. What I bring in due to the part-time consulting job will be icing on the cake.In my country, we did not have retirement accounts like the 401Ks or the IRAs up until 2003. The Social Security system was sufficient up until the l1990s but, due to poor political decisions, people could retire early and the social security system started showing signs of insufficiency. The Government raised the retirement age gradually but it is still low when compared to developed nations. In 2003, a private system was introduced as a voluntary supplement to the social security which is similar to the Roth IRA in the US. I joined the system in May 2004. The system requires a minimum of 10 years of active payment and a minimum of 56 years of age to take advantage of the full tax benefits.The Government is matching our payments by 25% to encourage participation to this system. Of course it does have a cap. They contribute a maximum of USD 127 per month. To me, that is free money to be snatched up. My mandatory 10 years will also be up in May 2014 but, I shall continue contributing to the system as long as the Government support continues. I am 9 years away from 56.Many people were skeptical about the system and so was I but, it turned out to be a good deal. However, it is not something I would solely depend on. I read a lot of US blogs and select the funds in my retirement account based on what I learn from them.Hope, I will reach financial freedom in May 2014, in good health too..."},

I was so happy an I immediately thought of replacing the hangers in my closets with those velvet covered ones and went to see how many I would need.The moment I opened my closet, I just looked at all the sturdy hangers that served well up until today and decided to give it some time to think this over. The note is valid for a whole year and what is the rush? Why should I throw away perfectly good hangers?I may actually end up buying something I truly need vs. velvet covered hangers that I want.Besides, I should take down my kitchen cabinets to see what items need replacing and what items can be given away. If I need something replaced, I can use the store credit for that purpose. If not, I can hold onto the note until something I truly need comes up.Oh the shopping bug! Go away!"},

I think it is my favorite dish but the leaves were not too great so some of them got wasted. I ended up with more ground beef mixture than I wanted so I rolled them into meatballs and cooked them in tomato sauce and added the remainder of the broccoli I bought last week. That is going to be tonight's dinner.Tomorrow night I am having some of the stuffed grape leaves and freezing the rest.I made patties with the remaining beef and used up the remaining parsley. I have 6 portions of patties in the freezer as of this moment.For tomorrow's lunch, I will take down the frozen eggplants which I believe spent too much time in that freezer. Tomorrow's lunch and dinner will help me in using up the yogurt I made. I also need to use up all the salad material before Tuesday. I will be on a business trip till Saturday.I snatched toilet paper and paper towels at a deep discount yesterday so, I am happy. I think the paper towels will last me at least 8-9 months. I use rags around the kitchen so not a lot of paper is wasted.I also came across a great deal on tablet dish washer detergent but, I passed since I already have too much on hand. Last year I had bought them at a very good discount and I still have at least 3-4 months worth of stuff.Today is a no spend day and I am hoping to make tomorrow a no spend day as well. On Tuesday I expect to spend a little and the rest of the week I get reimbursed for dinners. Breakfast is at the hotel, lunches are provided by the customer."},

So, I called up the company to inquire if there was a plan which would suit my needs better and save me some money. Starting next billing cycle i.e., December, I shall be paying 29 TL (USD 14) instead of the 62 TL (USD 31), I am currently paying. My new plan covers 300 minutes, 300 messages and 300 MB Internet. Took me all of five minutes on the phone and I feel satisfied. It is not a big deal of money but still something. Why pay for something you do not use? Right?I have a SONY Ericsson W995i phone that I had purchased back in December 2010. It is a great phone which has Internet, some nice applications such as a step counter, Facebook,water level, a navigator (that I do not use at all). I do not use IM apps anyway so, I do not really care it doesn't support Whatsapp or others. It is a walkman phone with an MP3 player and radio. If you only use it for calls and looking things up on the Internet, the battery still lasts for at least 3 days which is something you do not see with smart phones.Many friends of mine make fun of my phone and tell me to get a smart phone which to me are unnecessarily expensive. Well, unless this phone is broken beyond economical repair, I have no intention to buy a new phone. I had used my former SONY Ericsson W550i for four years and if I hadn't forgotten it in a cardigan's pocket which went into the washing machine, I would still be using it:)"},

They noted those as extras.It turned out that my alternator belt was in pretty good shape and they decided that it could wait until 105,000 Km. maintenance. I love my dealership.

The guy who helped me there saw that I was almost there for my 90,000 Km. maintenance, he told me about the promotion they were offering. Seems like a very good deal. Next week I am travelling but the week after next is a good time to take advantage of the promotion. I expect to save at least 30% off the regular fee. The package they offer does not cover everything that should be covered by a 90,000 Km. service so, they will do the additional work at the regular fee but the total will be inexpensive.I also went to the tire dealer to get my tires exchanged with the snow tires they stored for me. For a small fee they store tires and it is worthwhile because, I do not have any place to store 4 tires.A few days ago I took down the winter shoes to the lower racks in my shoe cabinet and stored the summer shoes on the upper racks. When a season is over, I take all the shoes down, clean everything, get things repaired if there is a need and put them away in good condition. This way I never have to deal with surprises. My go-to shoes for every night occasion, a suede pair with kitten heels needed fixing and cleaning so I got that done too.I tried on all the winter pants I had from previous years. It looks like I will not be able to wear any of the pairs I wore during the last two years because they are too BIG:) I am grinning ear to ear as I type this. So, I moved on to some almost new pairs two sizes small. I have three pairs even smaller which I hope to wear in the spring.The shelves in my wardrobe require attention so the next thing on my agenda are those. Tonight after midnight we are switching to winter time which means by 5:30 p.m. it will be dark from now on so, I think winter is here already..."},

{"title": "Homemade Yogurt", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2013", "text": "My grandmother (maternal) always made her own yogurt. She used to buy fresh milk twice a week from a farmer neighbour and made her own yogurt which was thick and a bit on the sour side just as I like it.Lately I had been reading a lot of articles and comments as to how store bought yogurt contains preservatives and how unhealthy those might be. I do not know if they are all true but, making yogurt for my grandma was such a simple job.  I have inherited her liquid thermometer and I remembered at what temperature she used to put in the starter to her yogurt. That inspired me to trying my hand in making yogurt yesterday. Initially I was going to buy organic milk and organic yogurt for a starter but using expensive ingredients in an experiment did not make sense to my frugal side. I bought Daily Milk which is a bit expensive than the other type that comes in cartons and would last for weeks. I used regular store bought yogurt for a starter and it turned out to be a major success!My yogurt tastes sweeter than my grandma's but it is still very good. So, next time I am going to use organic ingredients. After all, I need organic yogurt just once and after that, I will use my own yogurt to start the next batch. Since organic milk is on the expensive side, my homemade yogurt will not be frugal but it will be healthy. Being a yogurt monster, I deserve the best:)Here is my recipe:1 Lt. fresh milk (34 fl.ounces)2-3 tablespoons yogurtMix the yogurt well and set it aside on a counter top in a small bowl. (It has to be at room temp when you need to use it)Boil the milk while stirring it frequently so that the bottom of the pot doesn't get burnt. After the milk boils, keep stirring and boiling it down  for another 5-10 minutes.Take a thick and big towel lay it down some place that will not be disturbed at least 6 hours. Place a glass container in the middle of the towel. Pour in the hot milk in the glass container which has a lid but do not put the lid on just yet. Wait until the milk cools down to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Take a few table spoons of the cooled milk into the yogurt bowl and mix it well and slowly add the yogurt milk mixture to the milk and mix well. Place a sieve on top the glass container instead of the lid and gather and wrap the towel around the glass container to keep it warm. My towel was not big so I used three kitchen towels to wrap my yogurt. I left it for 7 hours. After that, I unwrapped the towels and just put the lid on the glass container and put the yogurt in the fridge. It should stay in the fridge undisturbed for at least 4 hours to set well. I allowed mine overnight. That's what grandma used to do. So, you can make your own yogurt today to be eaten for tomorrow for just a little work.I think I will be making most of my yogurt myself.If it doesn't set, you can always boil it for 15 minutes and whey it out to get some sort of soft cheese so, it is really not wasted.The heat of the milk may vary if you are living at sea level or at a high mountain level a bit. You may check that out on the Internet. I live pretty much at sea level."},

(Serious venting here so beware)", "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013", "text": "This was supposed to be a long and nice week spent with family by the Mediterranean. It started last Friday and turned into a nightmare yesterday evening. I am now at my apartment in Istanbul. I slipped out at 7 a.m. and drove 720 Km. to Istanbul stopping only to get gas.My mom is probably not going to talk to me for how long I do not know. My sister sounded understanding but I am not sure she understands me. My uncle... Well I do not care what he thinks of me. My brother in law may also be hurt for me ruining their vacation but, my vacation is ruined too.Yesterday night I threw a fit, a big one but I just could not stop myself. I just could not stop myself from being angry with... everything. My head feels like it will explode.This might be due to my last period which started 15 days late and which hasn't stopped in 21 days. This is a religious holiday week so I just made an online appointment with a doctor for Monday.I feel totally out of whack. I feel hurt and I want my family to understand that I do not like to be treated the way I am being treated by them but my mom is stubborn and I am sure she thinks she has no fault over what happened but she does. I love her. I go out of my way to do things to please her. I do not expect a Thank You because she is my mother and she deserves all of my attention. However, she wants everything her way. She scolds me like a child. If I am around she keeps ordering me around to make tea, to serve tea, to get this or that even though my sister and BIL are younger than I am. She treats them like guests and me like help I guess.All through Saturday and Sunday, I cleaned my uncle's filthy apartment. He does not live there all the time. He is very very very sloppy. He came and went to the place several times and did not clean a thing. There were foot marks all over the place and the toilets had never seen a brush before. I scrubbed the floors, cleaned all over the kitchen and brushed the toilets to get all the filth out. I even washed the windows because mom wanted so. I am not mentioning all the laundry he had left. We washed them and hung them to dry. Thankfully mom did not attempt to iron the shirts or make me do that. She is 70 and I do not want her to get tired over these things. I made sure she did not overexert herself. So, my wonderful vacation with the family started with non-stop cleaning for two days. As I was trying to figure out what to get for dinner on Monday night, mom got very impatient at the store. I had her call my sis and her brother to see if they would be able to make it for dinner and both said no, so I was trying to decide on something to fix for the two us and she just basically yelled at me to hurry up. I am 47 for Pete's sake! People turned to look at us. I was so embarrassed that I grabbed something and rushed ourselves out.I hung my face and as I was fixing dinner for us, my uncle pops in, hungry and then my sister calls to say they are famished and they are coming for dinner. I told her to get what I got from the store so that we could all have the same dinner together. She decided to go to McDonalds instead. Meanwhile I had been bleeding like crazy for 3 weeks and I was tired physically and mentally.Yesterday, my sister, her husband and I went to the beach even though I would not be able to swim. I just wanted to get away from home a little bit because mom was still angry with me for being upset because she doesn't think she yelled at me at the store.While we were out, I walked in the sand so my feet got dirty. When we got home, mom opened the door and she was still cross with me so I asked my uncle if he could get me some paper towels so that I would not bring sand home. He was standing 5 steps away from me washing something in the kitchen and he starts saying things like oh! how I know how to use people, how I start ordering things the minute I set foot at the apartment and what not and in return I said a few words to him and walked over to the bathroom. (I just could not believe my ears. I scrubbed the toilets in his apartment. Is that how he thanks me?) I went to the bedroom and sat on the bed to calm myself but I could feel the anger rising from my toes to my brain and I lost it. I just lost it and could not stop myself. I yelled at my mom, my sis and my uncle and blamed them for mistreating me, disrespecting me and hurting my feelings. For a second, I even considered jumping off the 6th floor. I still shudder at the thought. I wanted to leave immediately but mom and sis wouldn't let me go on a long road trip at night. So, early this morning I left while everyone was sleeping and I turned off my mobile phone. I cried while I drove and felt awful most of the trip.I was supposed to stay until Monday, and bring mom with me to Istanbul. I just could not wait until Monday. I just cannot handle anyone around me. I want solitude and I know mom will make me suffer for this. She is probably not able to comprehend how dare I left her like that. Now she has to go back to Ankara with sis and BIL. She will make me pay for this rubbing my nose into it... I want to go to sleep and sleep for a hundred years and wake up to a brave new world..."},

There are a few mini vacations that I plan to take with mom and one big one to the US but other than those, there are no splurges on the horizon for me. The 30th High School re-union is sort of expensive but only for two nights at a luxury resort. That's not bad.I would like to accumulate as much money as I can in my savings account for the next two years. Why?1. I need to re-do the entrance, the kitchen, the flooring and I need to change the doors in my apartment. This is going to be a very big expense. It is definitely a need and not a want. I am hoping to live in this apartment for as long as I can. The kitchen needed an update even when I bought the apartment but, I held back.2. I need to start a car fund. My 2010 Nissan Note is at 86,000 Km. I am hoping to drive it for as long as it is safe but I do not know how long that will be. Therefore, it is wise to start putting away money for that. I am hoping to keep my current car until 2018 if not more.3. I need a vacation fund.I am currently putting the maximum amount in my retirement account that is matched by 25% by the Government. So, my savings toward 2023 are consistently growing.I am targeting to keep enough money in my Emergency Fund to cover my expenses for a full year. I am halfway there. I already have a fixed amount of passive income. I calculate the difference between my budget and my passive income and come up with the EF number. I usually add another 10% to be on the safe side. Why is my budget exceeding my passive income? Because I have the rental property debt and some other payments.By May 2014, I will be done with the rental property debt and the installment type payments. That is quite a chunk of money. I am hoping to set up the above 3 funds with that amount.By June 2023, at the age of 56, I would like to rely solely on my passive income at that time and be financially independent. I am going to put every effort into making this possible."},

I look younger than my age and I think it's because I am fat.

No, there is no old flame that I need to impress or anything like that. Rather, I think there are really gorgeous looking women among my old school mates. Some of them did not look so well when they were younger. I hate Facebook for making me feel self-conscious.Lately I had been looking at my face with a criticizing eye and today I bought myself a night cream and an eye cream. I had done that before many times and ended up throwing all the creams out when I could not remember when I had bought them. I cannot fall into that womanly routine, where you cleanse your face and put on your creams at night. I do not know if I will make a habit of that now.I did not buy a day cream because I do not like the feel of cream on my face. It makes me sweat.I also took close-up pictures of my face and eye area to experiment if the creams really work. I do not really think they do but one can hope, right?My period has been delayed twice lately and I am thinking I may be entering menopause. I should see a doctor and I think I just realized that I am getting old and there is no turning back. I have never felt this strange before but, I feel like I have missed some things in life and there is no way of getting or doing them now. That is weird because I had always thought I had lived a nice and fulfilling life. Strange, very strange..."},

But after that, I saw that the radiator was dripping. I initially thought it would be something easy to fix but alas! Mr. Murphy made sure that at least 6 tiles have to be taken out, some more dust to be produced, the piping needs to be changed again. This also means the fresh coat of paint outside the bathroom will be damaged because of the piping. Yikes!The contractor was upset and he is prepared to fix the problem but I am traveling this week. Next week he will open up the problem area, fix it and leave it open. Since I shall be traveling due to a national holiday, I must find a friend who will be staying in Istanbul to check my apartment at least twice while I am away. Arrrgggh!When I return, hopefully, he will close up and I must have the entire wall re-painted. The paint will probably not match so, may be I should use a dark shade just on that wall as if it was done for aesthetic reasons...I have also discovered that the paint contractor did a sloppy job in some areas and called him to give him my feedback. He will come to fix the problems but, I do not expect much since some of the work cannot be redone. It will be like doing everything all over again and frankly, I do not have the patience for that.When I am ready to re-do the kitchen, replace the doors and the flooring, my entire belongings will be put in storage.

I keep moving stuff to the closed balcony which has been painted early this year.I am drained both physically and financially. I will be over the budget by about 1000 TL in general. The bathroom project was under budget by 400 TL but other things keep popping up here and there. For instance, I forgot about the carpets that need to be cleaned. It is not a lot of money but stuff add up quickly. I just called the cleaner to arrange for a pick up today.I am so looking forward to have the paint done and have the home put back together. There are some minor expenses I am planning but, I will not be doing anything major.I went to see the upholstery guy the other day. I must say he did a terrific job. He is keeping my love seat, TV Chair and dinner chairs until I get the apartment cleaned. That was one of the unplanned expenses but I think, it will be worth it.My apartment was not presentable for a very long time and all these repairs have become necessities.I am planning to re-do the entrance, the kitchen and the balcony tiles in 2015. I may end up changing the flooring in other parts of the apartment too because the floors are squeaky. The contractor I had hired when I bought the apartment did a clumsy job.

I love mom topieces but I have to admit, it is tough to live with someone if you enjoy beinga lone wolf.She manages to get on my nerves and I manage to get on hernerves every once in a while.

They are very tasty and they have very thin skin. I chop them in my food processor and add a little salt and then freeze them in zip-lock bags. On the way to Ankara to take mom back home, I think I will de-tour to Ayas to get some tomatoes by the case for mom, sis and myself.Yesterday we found awesome grapeleaves and we stuffed them today. We will freeze them after they are fully cooked. I bought many freezer bags and containers. We also stuffed peppers and tomatoes to freeze. There were 1 kg of grapeleaves and it took mom and I about three hours to stuff them. It is a lot of work but sooooo worth it.I will take an inventory of the pantry tomorrow. I think I have more dry beans than I can consume along with  quite a bit of bulgur. I bought 7 kgs of onions which will be difficult to consume on my own. I will share the extras with mom if she likes to have them.I once found a good recipe that had tomatoes, onions, carrots and celery to be used as pasta sauce.

It is still in working condtion and I would normally not replace it before it truly broke down. I caved in and got myself a 32 inch smart TV at a pretty good price. My reasoning is that mom has trouble seeing the small screen and she loves watching voleyball games but I think I wanted a new TV too.There was a huge line at the electronics store today. I was surprised to see the crowd so, I asked a sales person if they were giving away the stuff free. It turned out that \"some\" items were marked down by 30%. Of course the TV I bought was not one of those items but, knowing that the lady behind me paid more money for a smart phone than what I paid for the TV set made me feel a bit better about my purchase .Tomorrow I will have it set up. I am going to have the cable box changed as well since the one I have is not HD. More expenses...Oh well, my budget can handle small additions. The TV was already in the plans."},

Thank God!I bought 2 of my favorite hair-dye at a discounted price. I had one at home too so I am all set till the end of the year. I dye my hair every two months.I know the discount price for this particular dye and I am always on the look-out for that price. I see no reason in paying inflated prices. Here is a tally of what I bought:Hair Dye X 2Wholewheat Bread X 2Wholewheat Crackers X 2Small watermelonFresh ApricotsLiquid detergent (4 lt. bottle)Shampoo32 Pack toilet paperI dropped less than 100 TL(about USD 50) Not bad. The detergent and the shampoo will last me at least a year with what I already have at home.Then I went to another store to get a large bucket of yogurt (2.25 kg=5lbs) and 4 cans of sardines. I paid 18 TL (about 9 USD).Believe it or not that much yogurt lasts us only 4 days. Since I will be gone all week, it will last mom for the whole week.Tomorrow we need to buy fresh produce from a farmer's market. On Sunday I am off to Izmir. Again..."},

Other than that I have no consumer debt. I pay my credit card every month and never pay a penny of interest.Today, I received a call from Y and the nice young lady (read pushy call center agent) told me there was an advantegous credit package they have designed just for me (yeah, right!). I nicely (really nicely) told her that I do not need any loans. She kept saying but that was a really sweet deal. I told her again that I have no use for a loan. Isn't that enough reason to decline a loan? I guess at that point she understood that I am really a bad customer (they cannot make money over me) and we hung up.I understand banks when they have these campaigns over the radio, the Net and even on TV but why bother calling someone who has not once asked for a loan from your bank?CRM or no CRM that must be the question."},

I am no guru on this but having spent 25 years in the worforce in various companies and having hired many young college grads, I had some ideas which I shared with herShe and her daughter got into more specific questions and I told them there was not much I knew about those but I thought of an old High School buddy who is now a professor at my alma mater.I was very friendly with her when I was 14-16 but over the years we have gone our separate  ways and only communicated through a Yahoo Group the graduates of my High school set up. I haven't seen her in probably over 25 years. Yet, when I e-mailed her about the specific questions she e-mailed back telling me that she would set aside a whole hour to see my friend's daughter face-to-face. I was so thrilled! I never expected her to set aside such time since I know she is very busy and actually leaving for China for a whole month this Sunday. What a great friend!Then I thought about my other friends and I felt truly blessed for having them. Here are just a few examples of their thoughtfulness:-One of them took my sister to surgery while I was on a business trip to the US.-Another took me to the hospital when I had a massive vertigo attack-Quite a few helped me in finding new positions when I was looking for new jobs-One of them sent me his driver when I was too sick to go to the doctor's office and even set up my appointment himself.-One of them just recently offered to check on my mom while I am away on a business trip.- One cooked dinner and left it in my fridge for a welcome gift when I was returning from a long flight and took care of my plants while I was away.- Another met mom at the train station since someone had bumped into my car and I needed to file a police report.-One of them literally saved my life when I was poisoned by chicken and did not recognize the symptoms.-Two have rooms for me when I visit them in the US.I am very lucky to have them as my friends."},

Common sense tells me to take advantage of the 0 per cent interest but my heart tells me otherwise.I was supposed to find out how much those would cost but, the company who would give me an estimate drove me crazy by not showing up at the specified time zone, I cancelled them and made an appointment with another company.

May be I shouldn't call what I calculate my Net Worth. At the end of each month, I calculate my liquid assets: TL Cash, USD Cash, Gold and Individual Stocks. There has been a slow yet steady growth since September 2011. I was sitting on a large chunk of liquidity prior to March 2011 when I purchased my rental property. I lived in it for about a year and a half then I moved back to Istanbul to my primary residence and the day I moved out, my tenant moved in. I paid somewhere between 65-70% down and borrowed the rest on a 36 month loan. By May 2014, my debt will be gone. I am itching to close it now, but since I am going to re-do the bathroom and have the apartment painted, I do not want to be cash short.I keep looking at my numbers and I still do not feel comfortable about them. How much of a stash is enough? When can I be more lax about spending money? When can I take my dream vacation? I guess before May 2014, I will not be able to answer most of those questions. Whenever I think of \"the\" number my mind starts telling me: What if a big health problem occurs either with me or with family members? What if a disaster strikes and insurance will not be enough? What if this, what if that?"},

Well, I am happy. I just tried on a pair of jeans that were a 20 Tall and looks like I shall be able to wear them in a few months. I do not need to be shopping any time soon.I miss my friends in the US and I also miss New York. I have decided to plan a visit next summer. In the past, I used to go every two years and the last time I was in the US, it was 2010. I went to Las Vegas and Chicago and did not have a chance to see my friends or New York.I am hoping to lose at least 15-20 Kgs. by next summer. Going to the US will be my gift for losing so much weight to myself. At that weight, I will need some serious shopping. Woodbury Commons is one of my favorite places to shop and it is only a half hour away from both of my friends' homes.Starting on August 1st, I am saving for a trip in the US. My rental home debt will be gone in May and if I can save up enough money, this will be a totally guilt free trip. 3-4 weeks would be very nice. Even hoping for these makes me feel good:)"},

We sautee onions and tomatoes and add the well washed and cut of purslane and cook it. Couple of days ago I bought three large bunches of purslane hoping that it would make 4 portions. It took at least a good half hour and a ton of water to wash it. It was so much that, for a while we thought, it would not fit in the pressure cooker, then it SHRUNK! We ended up with 3 portions of a veggie dish:( Spinach and chard are like that too.I had also bought three large bell eggplants and they also shrunk to a 3 portion meal.According to our meal plan we must have a veggie dish for one meal and a meat dish for another. The veggie dish portion is 8 tablespoons so, you can figure out how much the purslane shrunk.Before I wrote this, I looked up purslane from the dictionary because I did not know the English word for it and found out that in the US, it is considered a weed and not eaten. That is an interesting fact. I like the salty and tangy taste of purslane. We not only cook it, we also chop it and mix it with garlic yogurt for a meze or a salad. Sometimes we also chop it in other salads as well.It is annoying to spend a lot of time preparing and washing loads of vegetable only to end up with a few portions."},

Now, I can button them up and most will be OK till I lose at least 7-10 Kgs.I wear jeans every day when I do not work so, I am wearing them out nicely and when I truly need new pairs of jeans, I already have three pairs in two smaller sizes. So, shopping is not on the horizon yet. After I am down two sizes, I may need some new clothes but I will keep my shopping at a minimum.This time, I am determined to stick to healthy eating.

I came back to mom's home to a ready dinner but the other is in İzmir so that meant a short flight (yes, I am back to flying but that's another story) and a hotel stay. I am feeling very tired and staying home (at mom's) today.I have already put in 9 days of work and there is 2 more to go. This is going to help my budget in a big way especially for the home improvements I am planning.On the other hand, my computer is showing signs of age and I must get a good hard drive to back up everything. The company I had been working with is planning to give me a new computer so, I will not have to buy one myself. I just don't know when though. Once they do, I would like to get an inexpensive tablet. I just need something to surf the Net, read the papers, look at e-mail and use as a GPS. There are some inexpensive ones which I had been eyeing for a while but I will wait a little longer, perhaps until after I am done with the home projects. I am not planning to exceed my budget but you never know when you take something down at home.I have a certain amount of money in my savings account and a portion of that money was earmarked for the home improvement projects but, if I can put in enough days of work until June, I will not have to touch that. That is something which will make me very happy! So, I put on my frugal belt and will not be purchasing anything that I do not truly need."},

When I went to the US to live there for over three years, my diet changed drastically to include at least two cans of diet soda if not more which resulted in weight gain. Top that with an inherited thyroid problem, you get obesity. For many years I struggled with my weight and although I lost some, I gained more. This year I hit an all time high as my weight is concerned and decided that this is it.Before I started seeing a dietician, I gave up soda and all sorts of artificial sweeteners. I may occasionally have a Turkish coffee with a little sugar, or a small dessert but, artificial sweeteners are out! I drink water with meals 90% of the time. I drink ayran with some meals and I love it. As for filter coffee and tea, I never use any kind of sweetener. I like regular milk in my coffee and that's it.Ever since I started seeing the dietician, I gave up sugar and white flour. I have two pieces of fruit a day and I consume only real whole wheat bread.My energy is up and my blood pressure is the lowest it has ever been. I see significant improvement in my health and I am very happy about it."},

This is the time when we purge, clean our closets, do some maintenance work at our homes.This is also a good time to look at your financial status to see if you are on track. Remember those plans made in December or January? Now is the time to check them out. You can also look at your budget to see if you can make any adjustments. After all, the price of fresh produce starts to go down and your monthly food bill may also go down with careful planning and leaning towards fresh produce. Days are longer, weather is better so the use of electricity and the heating bills are supposed to go down.Can you shop around for better terms for insurance? I did and saved a little. I also tend to use the public transportation more due to better weather and that saves me some on gas and car maintenance expenses.Better weather also allows us to have some cheap fun outside such as bike rides, inexpensive picnic meals and strolls around parks.Look at your budgets to see if there is a need for fine tuning. Anything that will help the budget is welcome."},

I reconsidered this \"want\" and instead of browsing the menu further, went to load some laundry.Then I went to the kitchen and looked what I had on hand for dinner. I had meat patties in the freezer and lots of salad ingredients so, I decided to have what I had on my diet menu plan instead of Chinese Food. A big salad, 4 meat patties, 2 slices of whole wheat bread was what I had.. Delicious and satisying.I took the money that I would have spent for Chinese Food from my wallet and put it in a jar which I will call my Great Getaway Fund. I am planning something big in 2014 or 2015 and will not reveal the details just yet. I can only say that I am planning a very long stay at some place I love.Every month, I will gather the money, count it and exchange it for some foreign currency (wink, wink:) and put it in the bank in a special account. I can do this all online so the jar will be symbolic. So, basically after I count the money, I will purchase the foreign currency online and put the money in the jar in my purse.I also cooked some artichokes for Monday and Tuesday dinners.

Then, I decided to head back home but I came accross a Michelin tire store and decided to see if they carried what I needed for the summer.

Total cost is only 1,000 USD and the payments shall start in July. I always pay my credit card in full. To this day I never paid a penny in interest. Although this is unplanned spending, I can make room for it in my budget.It is a blessing that I can still afford these occasional splurges despite being semi-retired.Now the biggest expense ahead is re-doing the bathroom and having the entire apartment painted. I think, I would also like to change all the room doors and ddor frames. There are only 6 doors to be replaced. Once I am done with this, the only thing remaining is re-doing the kitchen. I am planning to do that in 2015, not earlier. I would like to be done with home payments before I incur any other big expense. After I am done with the kitchen, I will be all set as far as my apartment is concerned for at least 15 years. I shall probably have the apartment painted just once during that time. The paint we use is washable so every spring the cleaning lady brings her sister and they wash the walls together. It is a tough job but after they are done, the apartment sparkles."},

My friend told me about one of them in particular which made my heart ache for his kids. I remember that guy when he was head over heels in love with his present wife. He basically worshipped her and wanted to get married as soon as possible. When they got married, he was the happiest person on earth. Apparently, within the 6-7 years I have not seen this person, his wife had twins and this guy had to switch jobs a few times. He has resigned from his last job for no good reason and spent the last two years pursuing a dream depleting the family savings and having fun while his wife, and her parents kept pressuring him to get a decent job.Recently my friend and this guy got together over a cup of coffee and this guy told my friend that he will soon walk out of his marriage because having a family was \"just too much\" for him and that he wants to have his own life... It is not like he wants a divorce from his wife, he wants a divorce from all his responsibilities!Excuse me! Is that so easy to leave your family to be free and to live the life of your choosing? Why did you get married and had kids in the first place? Even if you get a divorce, the kids are still yours too and you have to provide for them, you have to \"be there\" when they are growing up. I am very upset about that nice girl who became his wife. I do not understand whether he has any conscience or not. He may have understood that the life he chose was not what he wanted but, this does not qualify him to walk out on his kids.I do not have kids but I was very lucky to have an excellent set of parents so, I know a thing or two about families..."},

So, I do not wear things that are falling apart. The only excepiton to this are my cotton comfy nightgowns. I gave one to mom the other day when her nightgown was in the wash and she asked me where I got it because it was so soft and thin and I started laughing. It is probably 10 years old so over time, it has lost it's thickness. You cannot buy one like that. You have to wear it down yourself:)I like to have an easy wardrobe with neutral colors. My winter pants are black, navy and charcoal gray. All my tops go with these three basic colors. My summer pants are beige, pale green and tan.

I have bought the place in 2004 and even at that time, I wished I could have updated the bathroom and the kitchen. However, I had run out of money and I could only do the floors and the walls.My bathroom is really tiny so re-doing it will not cost an arm and a leg. I have not budgeted this for 2013 but, I can certainly make modifications in my budget to fit this. Besides, the whole apartment will be painted in 2013 so, re-doing the bathroom before the paint job makes a lot more sense.I am planning to get rid of the tub which I never use. Mom is getting old so taking a shower while standing is an issue. She likes to sit on a plastic stool while she is lathering. I am going to need new shower doors, new tiles, a new bathroom vanity, a cupboard on top of the washer, a new toilet, new faucets etc. Need to crunch the numbers to see how much it will cost. I usually add 20% on top of my calculations because once you start tearing something down at home, Murphy makes sure additional issues pop up.I think I will play with my budget until the end of April to see if I will be able to bring in enough extra income to cover the expenses. If I can, I will start the project early May. It will be done in 10 days or so during which I will need to stay at a friend's because I have only one bathroom. The paint job will have to be done in July. That one is already in the budget.As for the kitchen, That can wait for another year or may be even more..."},

I can cancel 72 hours prior to check-in.All I want is to take advantage of the sea for four days. It seems short, but we really do not like to stay at the same place for long. Mom especially hates that. We shall be driving down there so, on the way back we may  stop at some other place if we feel like it.I must have been a duck in a former life. I love staying in the water for very long especially if it is cool. I do not like the Mediterranean because the sea is very warm between June till October. I prefer the Aegean Sea, especially Cesme, Izmir. The water is cool and there is always a nice breeze at night so yu can sleep comfortably. Bodrum is much warmer but I think, it will be just perfect in late May.I wish, I were born in Canada, Alaska or some northern European country; some place where weather never gets too hot. Istanbul can be brutally hot in the summer but thank God not for very long. May be 2-3 weeks usually late July-early August.Anyway, I already started looking forward to this mini vacation:)"},

Although, I did not enjoy flying anymore, I flew many more times. recently the level of my discomfort has been on the rise. I don't know why. A month ago, I had a panick attack and could not fly to my destination. After that, I flew to Izmir and back last week. This week I flew to Izmir again but could not fly back today!!!!!!!!!!!! While landing to Izmir we had a short but severe turbulence and I freaked out. Today, I was supposed to go back but at the airport, as we were waiting to board the plane, they told us that the plane would be delayed due to TECHNICAL reasons.What are those reasons? No one tells you that. It was to be delayed for 10 minutes and later that became a half hour. I was supposed to fly with a friend and despite his reassurances, I just could not make myself fly... If there weren't a delay due to those unknown technical reasons, I was going to fly but as we got delayed, I got more nervous every minute.Now I am on a bus at night and it will probably take 8-9 hours to go back to Ankara. I know this is way more dangerous but...What am I gonna do? If I cannot fly, my life is ruined. God help me..."},

There will be further discounts as we approach the spring but, I had to buy some basic pieces. I bought a pair of navy pants, a grey top, a dark red top and a grey and dark red cardigan to go with the top. All four cost about USD 170.- (308 TL) I know it is a lot but, when you are a consultant, the professional look is important. Besides, the pieces I bought are pretty good quality which means they will last a long time. I am pretty tall for a Turkish woman (5'9\") and my legs are very long so, finding a fitting pair of pants is difficult lengthwise.I must also buy a pair of new black shoes during the sales period. I will do that when I go back home to Istanbul. I love the wingtip oxfords that I have but, they are getting worn out so, hopefully I will be able to get a new pair for next year.During the last few years I was making do with turtlenecks from Land's End and LLBean with some sweaters.

I am glad that I sat down to make these calculations because, honestly I was not thinking it would be tight at all. It always pays to do the math I guess. Of course, the consultancy income may be more than what I estimated but, that is not something I will count on.So, here are my goals:1. Contribute the maximum to retirement that will be matched by the Government by 25% from Feb.13-Dec.13.2. Have a mini vacation with Mom.3.Have a vacation with friends from the US if they can make it to Turkey this year. (This may be a little on the expensive side but, I am thinking of ways to make it affordable already).4. Have the apartment painted.(Not a big ticket item).5. Keep on paying the rental apartment debt.I had posted that I would work on Thursday and Friday and was  very happy about that. Unfortunately, the Customer postponed the scheduled visit.

{"title": "Can you say \"No\"?", "date": "Friday, December 28, 2012", "text": "I chatted with an old friend of mine couple of days ago over a cup of coffee. For a long time, I have always thought that her family was taking advantage of her just because she is a really really nice person. They step on her like a door mat all the time and I have known her for over 20 years. To me, it is sad.As usual she was complaining about her sister and her parents and suddenly I realized that, her family is not the real problem. It is her inability to say \"No\". She feels bad when she refuses them so she almost never declines anything.There is nothing wrong with saying \"no\" when you do not want to do something. I am not talking about being selfish here. I am just saying if you will feel bad about something later and resent it, do not accept it in the first place. There is only so much one person can do within her/his schedule, abilities, patience and stamina. It is absolutely OK to say \"no\" when you know you need to.I never had her kind of problems with my family because I think we all have a sense of sharing the load when things must be done. Besides, we can openly tell each other whether we can do something or not without getting anybody's feelings hurt. We know and accept what each other likes and dislikes. This does not mean we do not argue, we do but, we never stop talking to each other or apologize.I love my family to the moon and back but that does not mean that I would always accept anything and everything they may ask. I know they feel the same and it's OK."},

It would be expensively furnished and decorated and would be kept closed most of the time. The room would be barely used and some women even covered the furniture with throws or sheets so that the furniture wouldn't get dusty or fade.  Even as a kid, that was such a stupid thing for me.

An EF is for emergencies only and paying a debt less than 9,000 USD in 18 months is a wiser thing to do while building a stronger EF and investing in my BES.I must keep reminding myself that my contributions to the BES are much more valuable than reducing that small debt. After all my contributions will be matched by 25% by the Government, come 2013. This is something they are doing to lure people into setting up and funding personal retirement funds which I have been doing since 2004 a little after the system became available. I know it will be for a limited time once enough people start understanding that social security will not be sufficient and start contributing. I am sure the amount the Government is matching starting in 2013 will be reduced. Until then, I should take full advantage of this and it means maxing out my contributions.So, stop itching!"},

I am short on my cash goal, the Emergency Fund: (Well... If need be, Gold and USD can easily be converted to cash). I think it is worthwhile to mention that my EF is sizable. It is not a small one. Right now, it is a few months of my living expenses. My original goal was to make it 8-9 months worth of living expenses but, alas!I own the apartment I live in free and clear. No mortgage on that. I owe less than USD 9,000 on the rental unit. That debt will go away by May 2015 if not sooner. I am already in my semi-retirement so, it is important for me not to have debt.

I called the real estate agent and it turned out that the tenant was having trouble with my account number which is weird so he sent the rent to the real estate agent and he forwarded it to my account. OK fine. I gave them another account number.December rent was again delayed. I called the apartment management to see if the monthly maintenance fees were being paid or not. They weren't paid either. So, I called the real estate agent again.He talked to the tenant and again he is having trouble with my account. So, he sends the real estate agent 3 months worth of rent plus the overdue maintenance fees with interest. Weird huh?Now I have December, January and February rents. Until March, I will not have to worry about rent.I have to go back to my calculations to see if I can close the smallest debt with the highest interest AND make maximum contributions into my retirement account next year. If I can, I will."},

Sometimes I totally make up new meals like the one I made tonight.I had leftover lentils cooked with a bit of ground meat. I had pre-cooked red kidney beans and had some leftover broccoli. I put them all in a pot, added some tomato sauce and sprinkled it with some cajun seasoning and let it simmer for about 5 minutes till the broccoli cooked. I had them with some whole wheat crackers because I was to lazy to make rice or potatoes to go with it.It was a good dinner. Lentils, red beans and broccoli... Healthy and hearty in this cold winter day.Oh yes! The winter finally arrived here. We saw some snow, a lot of rain today and it is pretty cold outside."},
{"title": "Financial Choices", "date": "Monday, December 3, 2012", "text": "I had mentioned that the debt I had taken out for the rental apartment was three parts. Here is what is remaining:Debt 1: 5,903 TL at 12,60%Debt 2: 8,693 TL at 11,52%Debt 3: 7,350 TL at 11,03%I can only earn around 7,5% interest on my savings account. Earlier, I had decided to pay Debt 1 by mid-December. Then, it hit me! Starting January, the Government is going to match 25% of personal retirement funds!Our system is a lot different than what you are used to. First of all we have a Social Security System which is not doing real well. I am barely past 45 and I was able to retire this year. So, obviously this system is not sustainable in the long run. Few years ago they pushed the retirement age in increments but, the effects will be seen much later. Therefore in 2004, a legislation passed for personal retirement. This is thought to be a supplementary system for the Social Security. Up until this year, I would document my contributions to my employer and I would receive a tax refund. A lot of people could not take advantage of this so the Government decided to match 25% of all contributions. Of course there is a cap.In lieu of the above, doesn't it make more sense to contribute more to the personal retirement and get the 25% government match? It is free money so, why not take it?Yes, I would like to see the debt gone earlier but, the logical thing to do is to up the retirement fund contributions. In the personal retirement system, the earliest date that I can be eligible to retire is when I am 56. That is still 11,5 years away. As long as I can contribute to the system, I will receive the Government match. Not bad huh?The debt will still be paid as planned."},

It is sad how people envy each other and can be influenced so easily. I even caught myself thinking what product was making Demi Moore's hair so great. Silly!Many years ago, I was the head of a team of 7 people. The company was not doing too well and the HQ decided to downsize our unit and finally merge with another. Once this has been made public, I gathered my people and advised them to avoid frivolous spending because, almost all were looking to buy a house or a car at the time. Nobody was expecting to see the changes happen in less than two years but still, I personally wouldn't want debt on my shoulders if I had to leave the company so, I felt it made sense to warn them.In less than a month, 3 of them bought brand new cars with 36 month payment schedules. When asked, one of them said instead of buying an apartment, she decided to get a new car so that the debt would be less. Yeah, really clever.In about ten months, things have rapidly changed and since I was upper management, I was offered a nice package if I resigned on my own along with the other managers. I took it. The team members stayed with the new company and were gradually let go sans any package.The money I had received was substantial. Since I had been driving a company car prior to parting ways with the company, I did not have a car of my own and needed to get one.I could have easily bought a brand new car with cash but, instead I called the leasing company who provided our company cars knowing that it would be returned to the leasing company. I asked them if they could offer a price on my car and they were happy to give it to me at a very competitive price way below the market rate. I knew that they already had quiet a bunch of second hand cars and selling them is hard work.This was in 2006 and the car was a 2003 model. I was the only driver and I knew it was in good condition. A year later when I joined a new company which gave me another company car, the leasing company helped me again selling the car at the same price. I am still grateful to them.I think it pays to be nice and ask for things. You never know how much help you can get."},

{"title": "When NOT TO visit Istanbul", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2012", "text": "Many people think that Turkey is an exotic country probably warm all year round with deserts and camels and everything. Not so! First, thank God we have no deserts (they are not exactly fun) and the only camels you will see are for tourists only. Second, the country is between latitudes 35° and 43° N and longitudes 25° and 45° E. This means we enjoy all 4 seasons here in this country.For detailed info you may check out  Wikipedia. Another fun fact: There are a few skiing areas within 4 hours of driving distance from Istanbul. I think the worst times to visit Istanbul are between late October- late March. It is usually pretty cold with lots of rain and some snow. July and August are also terrible choices unless you want to melt your brains.My favorite time frame is between early April-mid June. In the spring you can see beautiful lavender colored flowers and tulips all over the city and taking a boat trip along the Bosphorus will present you with stunning views. Since it is not so hot and humid yet, it is possible to take long walks and spend lots of time outside. You can make the most of this city if you walk around especially in the historic peninsula.Mid September- late October is another good option to see Istanbul. The weather is mild and quiet nice during early Fall.Istanbul gets some snow during the winter but it does not last long as it does in mid Anatolia and eastern Turkey. Since Istanbul is a coastal city, the climate is somewhat milder. However, even a mild precipitation cripples the city traffic beyond comprehension. So, if you ever want to visit this very historic and cool city, let me know. I can give you some tips as to what not to do. As for what to do, I know you guys do a lot of research before visiting places, so may be you can give me tips about that!"},

{"title": "Don't Go Window Shopping", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2012", "text": "When I was living in Ankara, I would take my mom to a mall almost every weekend since there is not much else to do in a place as boring as the capital city of our nation. Besides, mom gets tired very easily therefore, a mall where there are many options to sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee seemed like a good choice to spend time.Even if we had nothing to buy, we would always get something we thought we \"needed\" or spent money on coffee and a dessert or ice cream or a bite to eat. Do it every weekend and it adds up real quickly.Now that I am back in Istanbul, I am not spending time at malls at all. In the last two months, I think, I have been to a mall just once to buy myself a couple of tops I needed. I ended up buying nothing because I could not find anything appropriate. I was in and out in a matter of 20 minutes. Had I chosen to window shop the rest of the mall, I am sure I would get something I actually do not need or at least sit down a for a cup of coffee and a desert.Mindless wandering at a mall without a real purpose will make you spend money however trivial it may be. After all money does not grow on trees.So what do I do when mom is visiting Istanbul? Istanbul is on the Bosphorus so it's very scenic. I sometimes pack a thermos full of tea, something to eat and we go sight seeing. Yes, taking the car means spending money on gas but it is not all that much. Besides, I plan my grocery shopping around these little excursions and save money on gas. We almost never go to malls here. My mom does not stay longer than three weeks so the expenses I incur while she is here are minimal and she likes to treat me as well. These visits are mini vacations for her.I will go to Ankara for the New Year's and I am hoping to take her back with me. I am sure she will like that. I do enjoy spending time with her."},
{"title": "Boiling Pasta", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2012", "text": "They say that the water you boil your pasta in has most of the vitamins and nutrients in the pasta and by throwing it out, you are wasting it. I do not know if this is true but wasting water does not make sense to me anyway.I usually cook my pasta in very little water and by mixing the pasta frequently, I let the it absorb all the water and if it is not cooked yet, I just add some more water. This way there is no water to dump when you are done. However, sometimes it is not easy like when you are using large pasta such as penne. I then use more water but take the pasta out and use the remaining water to make a soup. This is an especially good strategy when I am making meat filled dumplings (manti).I have a water saving strategy for the shower as well. The hot water is centrally heated at my apartment. They have these meters that they track our usage and the Apartment Management bills us depending on the usage. I have realized that I let at least half a bucket of water run before I can comfortably step under the shower. So, I keep a bucket by the bathtub and save that half a bucket of water to later dump in the toilet. It is so easy. I am probably saving very little money but knowing that a large portion of the human population has very limited access to water, these tactics make me feel like I have done something that has value.Our apartment complex is still under the big insulation project. Finally, they started painting the exterior and the interior of my building and the paint smell is giving me a gigantic headache.I have put plates with vinegar around the apartment. It is supposed to help with the smell, supposed being the operative word here.Whenever I open the windows more paint smell come in and they haven't even painted the back side of the building yet.Any suggestions to deal with the smell of paint?"},

It is even frowned upon by some, since it looks like a Christian tradition. I do not care what anybody else thinks. It makes me happy to decorate my home and give gifts to my family. I like welcoming and celebrating the New Year.However, we are not into excessive number of gifts. We usually buy one gift per person or may be two. I like giving practical gifts such as clothing items. This year I am buying gifts for the following people:MomSisBILUncleBIL's mom and dadCleaning Lady (that will actually be a baby gift for her third grandkid)I am going to establish a budget for each person and will try to stick to the overall budget I will set.Even though, I will be visiting them, I will end up cooking and that also means grocery shopping. I like roasting a whole turkey and neither mom nor sis does that. They make side dishes but since I like the Thanksgiving menu so much, I prepare traditional American side dishes as well. At the end of the day, we end up with plenty of leftovers, full stomachs and happy people:)When I was living in the US, I used to spend Christmas with my American friends at their home and it was a lot of fun. I still remember how the kids attacked piles of gifts and ripped the packages in a matter of minutes. The first time I saw how many gifts they were getting, I was amazed. Then I got used to it too:)"},

If I reach for a \"want\" item rather than a \"need\" item, it makes me think twice.Mom gave me some cash today. Apparently, I have done some shopping for her few weeks ago which I have completely forgotten. She is funny that way. Whenever I shop for her, she insists on paying. I think I can make the cash in my pocket last until the end of the month.My sister and my BIL had unexpected expenses lately due to her MIL's situation so, I offered to make a double payment to them. The debt I have for the rental apartment was three parts. Since both of them are in banking they could get a better rate than I could for one part of that debt. So, they took out a loan and I pay them every month. My sister accepted that offer. I have also decided to close the smallest part of the three part loan so, hopefully by 11th of December, I will have shaved a very good portion of my debt.I will post the numbers later on.

I had been using a real old wash machine which used tı belong to my mom. It was old but it was a great machine. Now, I have one of those energy efficient machines which use very little water. It just bothers me that with so little water, does it really clean the clothes? Then I remember that my clothes do not get really soiled or dirty. Well, I am still getting used to it. Also, the new machine is a bit smaller than the old one so, a full load is somewhat smaller too.It feels like after I empty the hampers they start filling up by themselves as soon as I turn my back.

So, since it is not a part of my daily life, I decided to have this blog in English in order to meet blogging buddies and keep it a part of my daily routine. Is it much harder than writing in Turkish? I do not think so. Of course my vocabulary is not as rich as my vocabulary in my own language but still, it is not that hard to write a blog in English.I remember the first day I had arrived in the US. In fact it was the very first time I was abroad, the very first time I was on an aircraft and the very first time I was away from my family, alone. (and I ended up in NY!)I have checked in to my room at the hotel and turned on the TV. There was commercial of Shop-Rite and I could not understand a word of it! It was so strange to my ears... After all, I had learnt English at Turkish Schools taught by Turkish teachers. I was not exposed to the American accent much. The guy who interviewed me for that job which landed me in NY, spoke a very \"clean\" English so, the interview had gone very well but the stupid commercial made me depressed!The next day at work, they placed me in the cubicle of a dear friend who had a very strong Boston accent! He was a wonderful person and he loved to listen to my adventures every weekend, but that is another story for another post.I think in about two months, I have acquired a nearly NY accent and my vocabulary expanded. It was a very good experience. My strength comes from the fact that I imitate others well and I am not bashful. I do not care if I make mistakes and if people correct me. I learn the correct way and move on. Some people are embarrased to make mistakes and their lives are harder in a foreign country.

{"title": "Changing the windows... ", "date": "Saturday, November 10, 2012", "text": "It looks like I need to be spending some money changing my windows. My apartment is about 15 years old. It is a sturdy building but not without problems. Looking carefully into the water leakage problem, I have realized that, some of the problem is due to outside wall issues and some is due to the current windows with roller shutters that I have. Outside problems will be fixed by the contractor as promised by the management (I hope) and I have decided to renew the windows to take care of the other problems.To be honest I was using the shutters only when I left home for prolonged periods of time and at night when I wanted to keep my window open. I am on the entrance floor so, the shutters provided some security. The shutter boxes into which the shutters roll up are a mess. They get very dirty over time and it is not easy to clean them. I have decided to get rid of it all and get brand new windows without shutters. For protection, my new windows will be inward awning with a lock mechanism. There are three windows that need to be replaced so, I will be spending something in the neighborhood of 2,300 TL. (approximately USD 1,285). Furthermore, I will have brand new screens fitting each window. I think it is a good deal. The money is going to come out of the house repairs fund I had been setting aside. I knew my apartment would require some repairs sooner or later and was prepared for that.I will buy a storage closet for my balcony in the next few months and I will have the entire apartment painted in the summer. I was preparing to do that in the spring but the contractor told me that it would be best to have the apartment painted in August because when the walls get the humidity once, it is not easy to get rid of it completely. Hopefully I will not need to spend any more money on the apartment until 2014 except for a few minor things here and there."},

My favorite season is the Fall so, I am hoping to do this in October-November.During my last visits to the US, I went to Las Vegas and Chicago but, I miss NYC very much. I would like to spend some time around NY or may be; spend the entire time there.However, I would like to see Seattle very much also. I am thinking of a road trip from San Fransisco to Sacramento and then to Seattle. I like San Fransisco a whole lot so, it wuld be nice to see it again. I have been to Sacramento just once and since it was a brief business trip, I could not see much.So, I may fly to NY and fly over to SF and spend 7-8 days doing the SF-Sacramento-Seattle thing, go back to NY and spend the rest of the time around the tri-state area. This is a more expensive option than, just staying around NY. If I spend the entire time in NY area, I will probably stay at an extended stay type of accomodation with a small kitchen and spend way less money.This vacation can only happen if I can average at least 6 days a month doing consulting work between now and next September. So, I will just keep my fingers crossed, hope for the best and look for inexpensive car rental and accomodation options starting early spring. I can buy the airline ticket with my CC points so, that is not a concern.It is amazing that there are 5 daily direct flights to NYC from Istanbul nowadays.

Hopefully this time I will do it.Weekend did some damage to my pocket but it was not too bad besides, it was planned. I get together with a group of friends every month and those nights are usually expensive. We almost always have an excellent time and these meetings happened even when I was living in Ankara. I would set a date and everyone in the group (6 people) would keep that date. We were colleagues until 2006 but then everybody started working for different companies but our ties were so strong that we kept seeing each other.Today, I steamed some cauliflower, made rice and green lentils. So, for tomorrow, I do not have to worry about what to cook. I think I will freeze some of the lentils for later.I am thinking about making pizza on Wednesday. I bought some whole wheat flour and I would like to try baking a bread and since the oven will be used anyway, I can have pizza for dinner.Now, I must go get some work done."},

I must claim expenses and then, bill the company.Rent Income: Between the 1st and 3rd of each month if the tenant pays on timeAlso a friend of mine is paying me back for a trip I had to arrange for her with my credit card. She called me to ask if it would be OK for her to pay on Monday and I agreed since it is not a significant amount. The credit card company divided the whole cost of the trip into five installments so, I had told her to pay in installments too.I actually do not like it when the credit card company has these promotions where they divide the payments without asking me first.So, I thought, I would have enough money for the early bills this month, but I think I miscalculated a little bit therefore, I must deposit some cash to my account tomorrow.I think I must keep extra cash in my account. I really do not like to do that though. I rather like to see my money in my savings account earning interest.I must get used to paying more attention to my account balances and automated payments from now on."},

To them, apples were no more the apples they knew, bread was not as tasty as the bread they used have, nothing was ever anything like they knew when they were young. Mom sometimes does the same thing.Is it really so? Or, is it people's taste buds changing over time? Today, I made some sort of a very simple pastry my grandma used to make. It smelled the same, yet did not taste the same. Or so I thought...Is it us? Or is it really the ingredients? Does everything taste better for kids? Do we develop a more refined palate over time? Do we get spoilt?But, the most important question is: Am I getting old?:) :) :)"},

We just had some rain, may be a couple of hours, not more. Early this morning I walked into the guest room to get something and realized that there was  quiet a bit of water. It is a laminate surface and luckily I had not put the carpet back which I had rolled and put away while I was not living here. The carpet is nothing fancy but it still is a handwoven Turkish carpet and it belonged to my uncle before he had passed.I ran to get towels and dried it off and started looking around the window to see if there is a leakage but, it was all dry. Then I examined the wall further and realized that the water is somehow seeping through the wall! Don't ask me how, I don't know.The stupid contractor is totally behind the schedule with the insulation project and before they were able to complete the whole apartment complex, rain season started and I am the one who has to suffer!As soon as the clock hits 9:00 a.m. I am calling the super and showing the mess I got. I do not care if they have to re-schedule their work but that wall gets prioritized. This has never happened before and I am in shock as to how that could happen. I am very very pissed. If they do not act quickly, I will have a lawyer friend call the management office although, in this country lawyers are not as scary as their US counterparts.I hate to say this aloud but, I am not sure if these idiots will be able to fix it. I am so glad that I have postponed the interior paint project till spring. Before everything is fixed outside, I am not painting the interior and ending up with chipping walls. Arrrrrgh!"},

Mom is trying to help them out by staying with them a few days to cook and supervise the cleaning lady but, there is only so much she can do and she is old too.Actually mom had an episode of a nose bleed herself too but luckily hers was not so bad and possibly due to the blood thinners she has to use.I came back yesterday and it took me 7 hours to drive back which usually takes no more than 4 hours. I drive a stick shift so, imagine driving in stop and go traffic for over two hours as I approached Istanbul. I need pain killers for my aching legs but I need to work so, I do not want to feel drowsy. There was a religious holiday and a lot of people went away and it looked like everyone decided to return on the same day. Today is a national holiday but I guess people wanted to come home a day early and rest.I was totally drained but as soon as I got home I hung up my flag for today. October 29, 1923 is the day Turkey became a republic and a new country. At that day, the new constitution replaced the old Ottoman constitution by the Turkish parliament. It is a big deal for those of us who are keen  followers of Ataturk, his principles and ideals and who believe in secularism and the modern Turkish Society. I am not going to talk about politics here but I do not like where we are headed for the last few years and I do not appreciate the present prime minister.I had cooked for long holiday but since I had to go to Ankara, I took all the food to my sister's which she really appreciated.

I agree with that because, I realized more than once that whenever I shopped hungry, unhealthy snacks hop into my cart. That's bad. However, when I'm full, I tend to not buy even necessary things because they do not appeal to me. I came to realize why that happens.I do not plan menus at all because, my mood changes even during the day let alone the week. Being a Gemini may have something to do with that but, I do not know really. When I tried to come up with menus for the whole week, I almost never stuck to that list. That means many things get thrown out. That's very bad.So, my shopping list would have entries like fruit, veggies, meat but does not go into details as to which fruits or veggies or whether I should buy chicken, red meat or turkey. I look for good prices and fresh looking veggies and fruits. When I am full, nothing looks good. So, I end up buying very few items and when I get back home and when it is time to cook, I have not much to cook... Now, how do I deal with that?"},

I dye my own hair and have a very simple cut so that it only needs to be trimmed may be twice a year.You guessed it: It is that time of the year. Actually, it is way past the date I should have had my hair trimmed. I postponed it for too long and now my hair is unnecesarily long. During the summer, I could get away with air drying it but from now on, I need to blow-dry it because it is getting cold. Besides coloring it is also a hassle.

So, I have decided to make my own pizza at home and tried a few recipes and came up with this simple recipe for just one person:Dough:1 cup flour (next time I will try half a cup whole wheat, half a cup regular)1/2 package dry yeast (4-5gr.) (about 0.15 oz. or so)1 table spoon olive oil1/2 teaspoon brown sugarPinch of saltWarm water enough to make a soft doughSauce:Tomato sauce or pureeOreganopinch of saltgarlic or garlic powderI knead the dough a couple of minutes and then shape it into a ball and put it in a bowl in some place warm.When the dough doubles in size, I knead it for a few seconds and pat it onto a pan, on baking paper. No rolling pin is necessary.I place the pan in the oven at around 400-420 F or 200 C for about 6-7 minutes.I take out the pan and put the sauce on the semi-cooked dough and put my toppings. On the top I sprinkle the shredded cheese. I put this back in the oven till the pizza dough is nicely browned for about 15-20 minutes. If I make more, I tend to eat more so this is a perfect size for a filling portion of pizza.It is also very easy to double,triple or quadruple this when you have company or if you want to freeze some dough for later.I like vegetables for topping and use what I have on hand. If there is not much, then it is just a cheese pizza:)"},

I put in three hours of solid work which was really good. I started to get a better understanding of the project at hand and I started moving a lot faster with what I have to do.I went to IKEA to exchange some covers I had bought for the love seat and also to pick up a couple of items for mom. After that I went to the REAL right next to IKEA to look at suitcases but I was neither impressed by the quality nor the prices. I picked up some trash bags, Himalayan Salt, hair color and diswasher detergent. They had the store brand on sale so, I am going to give it a shot. It was significantly cheaper than the other detergents.I dropped by the Pharmacy to pick up my thyroid medication and came home. After resting briefly, I pickled the peppers and the beets I had bought last week. The beets will be ready in 4-5 days but the peppers will need at least three weeks. I made myself dinner and I would like to work another couple of hours after I post this. So, I am pretty happy with what I have done. Oh! And by the way, I walked 5000 steps doing all these chores. I know the ultimate goal is 10,000 steps but after a very sedentary life, I cannot change my ways so drastically.It also rained quiet a bit today and I feel the temperatures are falling fast.

{"title": "Working At Home: Pros and Cons", "date": "Sunday, October 7, 2012", "text": "Working at home is quiet a new thing for me so it does have some challenges. When you walk into an office building, just merely going in there sets the tone for the day and one can concentrate on work with fewer distractions as opposed to working at home. When you are home, there is always something to do around the house such as putting another load in the washer or cleaning the top of the kitchen counter or any other chore you may imagine.Remember when you were a student, before exams you probably procrastinated as much as possible figuring reasons not to sit down and hit the books real hard? (If you don't... Well we are not all nerds, some people will remember that!!) I find myself in the same situation. Part of the reason is that I am being brought on board a project which has been going on for over two years and the documents I must go through are not complete and it is rather boring. And may be I needed a bit of a down time before I started working. There are still tons to do around the house but this is not a big and real excuse so, I need to pull myself together.So to be true to the header here are my pros and cons:Pros:1. You can work literally in your pajamas or comfy home clothes.2. You do not need to wear make-up or shave every day.3. You spend way less money on work clothes.4. Costs associated with going to work is way down and limited only to those times you need to show up at a customer's office.5. You eat at home more so that is less costly and more healthy.6. You can set your own schedule most of the time. Work at night, sleep in until late.Cons:1. It is distracting.2. There is no socializing with co-workers.3. Most of your friends are working regular jobs so, socializing with them is also limited.4. I tend to snack more often when I am bored so eating can spin out of control.Pros outweigh the cons so I am most determined to make this work. Here is my plan:1. Get up fairly early every day i.e. not later than 8:00 a.m max.2. Make the bed everyday and never walk around in pajamas or nightgowns. Always be in presentable clothes so that if the door bell rings or if I need to rush out, I can.3. Set a specific time to sit down and work both in the morning and in the afternoon and stick with my schedule.4. Spend at least an hour outside even when the weather is bad.5. Pull out the menus the dietician gave me and stick with those meals and snacks.6. Go to bed at midnight, the latest.I wonder how other people cope with this situation. May be I should look up some blogs on the issue."},

That is what her doctor thinks anyway.I went grocery shopping today and have everything (but coffee) that I need till Tuesday so I do not need to get out of the house at all. If I feel up to it, I may walk to the Starbucks nearby and buy some coffee to make at home. I used to buy Kenya coffee but recently I think I need a bolder flavor so I must remember to look at their web site. I drink one or two cups of coffee a day. If I am outside and if I feel like one, I might have Turkish coffee but I never make it at home.

I still do not recommend anyone to try to use the public transportation during the rush hours (yes plural in this city!).However, if you are flexible as I am, there are plenty of options in this overly crowded and busy city. For instance, tomorrow I have a few errands to run around the city. Here is what I am going to do:I will take my car to the Kozyatagi Metro station which is about 5 minutes from my home. I will take the Metro (the Tube if you are British, the Subway if you are American) all the way to Kadikoy. I will hop on a ferry to Eminonu or Karakoy and walk to pick-up my prescription glasses. I will then take the Tram to Kabataş and ride the Funicular to Taksim where I will get on the Metro to Mecidiyekoy to visit a friend at his office. Then, I will probably take a taxi to Okmeydani to a hospital in order to visit a very close friend who will be out of surgery hopefully by then.The best thing is that I use an Istanbul Kart on all these vehicles which makes it real easy.If I take my car, all these are still doable but the amount of time I would spend just sitting in my car and the stress of finding a suitable place to park does not make it logical. Besides, I love having tea on the ferry crossing the Bosphorus and I will make sure I will post some photos later in the week. And of course, this not only saves time but plenty of money as well."},

Yesterday, my new colleagues called me to see when I shall be available to participate in some of their projects. I told them I will be available starting with the week of 25th of September. The sooner the better. Since my new work schedule will be flexible, I am a bit nervous about the income stream. I think the first 3 months will be a good indicator of what to expect. Today was a short one. I had my e-mail accounts closed, handed the laptop over to IT, made a round of goodbye visits to each department and took off:)I was originally planning to work here until at least early 2014 but there are a few people who make this place miserable and poisonous. My mom and sis are a bit upset that I am once again leaving for Istanbul although they do not say so. I understand they would like the family closer together but, I just cannot stand this city. Most of my good friends are back in Istanbul and my life was better there. Now that I will have more time to myself, I can come to visit more often and mom can always come to stay as long as she wishes. I never wanted to settle here. I may sound a bit selfish but life is short and I do not want to postpone things. Job opportunities in this city are hard to come by and not well-paying. Istanbul is a very difficult city to live in for some people but it is perfect for me. The traffic is dreadful, the city is too big and expensive, jobs are very demanding and yet I love that!I do my best to spend quality time with my family and I do not feel bad that I am leaving. This year I have taken two vacations with mom and one vacation with sis and BIL. I have spent at least three weekends of each month with mom and sis. So, while I was here, I tried to make the best of it. So my old apartment and my new life; here I come!"},

My cousins run a gift shop so, I should get something that they do not already sell at their store. Probably I will get a small appliance that they can use.  After all, they can always exchange it if what I get is redundant or if they need something else.There are two types of kitchen appliances I think: 1. Really useful ones and 2. Stuff that occupy valuable counter space.I have a small toaster oven, a sandwich maker and a food processor. I also have a regular cooktop and a regular size oven. These are all I need and everything is used very often. I do not have or need a microwave oven. I do not need a coffee machine. I used to have one and gifted that to a friend who owns a bed and breakfast. I have a small plastic contraption in which you can fit a filter and pour hot water over a single cup. I once thought, I needed a bread maker but, 100 years ago when women made their own bread, they did not have bread machines, right? Besides there are good \"no knead bread recipes\" out there so, I will give them a shot when I feel like baking my own bread. I would like to make real whole-wheat bread not the fancy stuff that gets gobbled up like cake.My mom uses a small electric chopper but I find chopping with a knife easy and less messy. I hate cleaning up the electric chopper. Besides, I certainly do not cook as much as mom does.Some kitchen gadgets are also useless for me. I never needed an an egg separator or a melon baller. I can successfully separate the eggs and cut up melons with a regular knife thank you very much! I hardly ever use the potato peeler although I own one. A few good knives are well worth the investment on the other hand. I do not like clutter in the kitchen and I do not have enough counter space so, I try to do without many of the fancy appliances out there. From a frugal point of view, I do not think you can ever re-coup the investment for many of the fancy appliances and gadgets."},

I may become a landlady within a few weeks who knows?Today I need to go buy a gift for my cousins for their new home and then go home and do some more packing. I should start packing some fragile stuff along with most of the kitchenware. I do not have a whole lot left to do so, I feel good about this but, when I go back to Istanbul, I will probably need at least three days to sort out old stuff, separate things to be donated and arrange closets. Summer shoes need to be taken care of, put in boxes and moved to the upper shelves. All cupboards and closets need to be wiped as well. My kitchen needs a thorough re-organization and cleaning.I must have the apartment painted next spring. The walls are really dirty and I do not think wiping them will help at all. Every year the walls used to be wiped down but during the last two years, it could not be done due to my absence. Also, a couple of walls have humidity damage. Thankfully this year our apartment complex is going through an insulation project and the walls will not be affected as much in the coming years. I am not much of a home-maker type or a domestic type. I actually hate all sorts of housework with ironing on top of my list but, moving back HOME:) and the changing season has this strange affect on me. I needed a fresh start and now that I have the opportunity, I would like to do it right. My apartment is rather small so, I have to figure out a smart way to make a small office corner for working from home. A friend of mine has his own business and he already offered me to work at his office whenever I want or need to. So, hopefully, I will be able to establish a new routine.I would like to start exercising on a regular basis and start watching what I am eating. However, I do not want to overwhelm myself either. Moving, starting a free lance life, starting an exercise and diet plan all together is not possible. So, I will try to make small changes and stick with them at first to test the waters."},
{"title": "New Life...", "date": "Saturday, September 8, 2012", "text": "I will be entering a new phase in my life. I will have a fixed amount of money coming in every month which is about 1/3 of what I make. I will also have a rent income which will hopefully help a little bit. Then the rest will be flexible depending on the projects. I will be working as a free lance consultant affiliated with a Consultancy Company but I shall not be on their payroll. They will try to guarantee me a minimum of 4 days a month. If I work 9 days a month, my total income will match what I am currently making. So, why am I giving up a steady income stream while I have the debt? For peace of mind, for flexibility and for my sanity. I no longer want to be a part of the rat-race. However, this new life-style is unchartered territory for me so I am trying to build up a cash cushion to handle the fluctuating income stream. Once my apartment debt is paid, I will have a lot more breathing room so anything and everything I earn on top of my passive income can be spent on home renovation projects, travel and other things.I keep referring to my debt as apartment debt, not mortgage because it is not a mortgage. In my country there is a stupid regulation that penalizes you when you pay your mortgage earlier. Since I had 75% as down payment for the apartment, I had decided to take a consumer loan with a slightly higher interest rate which does not penalize you when you pay it earlier. Since my siblings are in the finance business, they came up with three sets of debt schemes minimizing the interest load. It worked out pretty well because right after I took out those loans, the interest rates increased. Actually, the current rates are much higher than my debt with the highest interest rate of 12,60%. Think 15+%.I will have to see what the new income stream will be like during the next 6 months to make/modify long-term plans. My goal is to wipe-out debt and build an EF of a whole year's worth of expenses. Once I reach that goal, I will be extremely relieved."},

I offered to share his resume with a few headhunters that I knew. She told me, she was headed to the Beauty Parlor for a pedi and a mani and that she could send me the resume only in the afternoon and I caught myself thinking \"isn't it time to tighten the belts a little bit? I would cut back on Beauty Parlor visits, if I were her\". This sounds rather judgemental isn't it? After I hung up, I sat down to write this post because I felt bad about even thinking of judging her. Thank God I am not a big mouth to spill any and every thought. Everybody has different coping mechanisms with each unique situation. There may be a ton of other factors that I do not now about her life and her financial situation. After all she has a successful business and they can probably get by on what she brings in while her husband looks for a new job. Family help is also possible in their case. May be by going to the Beauty Parlor, she feels better about herself and not depressed so this has real value for her.I am frugal by nature, and I like to budget. I like total control over my finances and that makes me feel good. My sister sometimes thinks I am a control freak. I may very well be one but, that is how I feel secure, comfortable and good about myself. I had already shared the amount of debt that I have. It is not a lot. Actually it is a very small debt that I can absolutely handle but, it still bugs me and I try calculating how and when I can pay it earlier. I am the way I am and I do not think I will ever change. It is not my place to judge others for their financial decisions and it is not anybody's business how I handle my financial matters. This applies to all life choices not just finances. So, breath in and exhale and... do not judge others."},

It was a fairly easy job because everything was already neatly folded. I also did two loads of laundry and hung them to dry. I always use a drying rack. I have never owned a dryer and never needed one. I will end up having two drying racks when I move back home since I already had a drying rack back in Istanbul. I had divided the pots, pans and the other kitchen hardware between homes so, they will not constitute a problem but some items will double.When I come to think of owning more than one item of household goods, I think I have:4 irons2 hair dryers2 gas cooktops2 sandwhich makers2 wireless phones 2 laptops (one is broken beyond repair but I do not know how to get rid of it)2 broken cell phones (see above)2 vacuum cleaners (I tend to like the old one better)2 ironing boards2 drying racksAnd, um no, I am definitely not a hoarder because I purge my wardrobe every season, giving away the things that I do not wear and I also give away old pillows, blankets and sheets. Besides my apartment does not look cluttered at all.Useless items must go but, I will hold onto some of the above just in case the one in use breaks down. After all, I have already paid for these and it is not like they will go bad or anything. They will just take up some space which I can handle. I live alone and I have enough room for everything. The Fall is the season I love best and it always gives me the sense of renewal by means of getting rid of useless stuff, making room for items that will add a cozy and comfortable charm to my living quarters. I also like to clean out the fridge, use up what is in my pantry to make room for fresh and new things getting prepared for the winter. Some people clean out their wardrobes after a certain season and donate the items belonging to the previous season. I do the opposite. After all, winter garments will be most needed during the winter. So, it is a good time to donate winter stuff now."},

The answer is \"bite by bite\". So, today I will pack clothes and accessories I shall not need within a month, do a load or two of laundry and look at the kitchen cupboards to see if I have enough boxes and tapes and bubble packs.I have already found the carrier company to handle moving my stuff, thanks to a co-worker. Only a couple of things shall be sent to Istanbul, the rest will go to Antalya. There is an apartment co-owned by my uncle and mom.I went grocery-shopping after work today. I knew there was not much to eat at home due to my very long vacation but I also did not want to overspend without checking what's on hand either. So, I quickly grabbed some fresh fish, bread, canned fish for another night and some non-food stuff and came home.I was famished and feeling tired so, I quickly grilled the fish and gobbled it up.

It sort of sounds scary but, my soon to be ex-job was absolutely draining. It was not always like that. If it were still bearable, I would keep working probably until May 2014. That would put me in a safer cash position. I decided to take a risk instead of feeling frustration.I will have a steady income stream just to keep me make my ends meet through Social Security. If I can find a good tenant for my investment apartment, that will also help a bit. Anything I earn on top of these will go to savings and travel, home improvement projects and a car upgrade in the coming years. I will share my plans later on.I have 26,483 TL remaining debt (non-mortgage) on the investment apartment so, it is not too bad. My monthly payments are 1,350 TL and I am hoping to clear that debt earlier than 2014.When I start earning from my new venture, the first thing I will try to clear up is that debt. It consists of three pieces: Debt 1: 6,945 TL at 12,60% interest Debt 2: 10,228 TL at 11,52% interest Debt 3: 9,310 TL at 11% interestMy first target is Debt 1 of course. I hope to clear that before the end of this year. If I can close it by the end of the year, I shall probably save about 900 TL in interest. Not a lot but still....So, stay tuned.

Every month I go to Istanbul to meet with a group of friends. My original plan was to go every two weeks but, that is not very frugal and I need to save money to go back to Istanbul for good.I stayed with mom for about 7-8 months when I first came here. She had both her knees replaced in December 2010 and needed my assistance before and after the surgery for a while. Later on, I decided to invest my money in an apartment here in Ankara in the early spring in 2011. I bought a two bedroom apartment and took out a short term loan of 3 years. It is minimally furnished and now I am living in my new apartment.I am still not sure if I regret my investment decision. I have mixed feelings about it since, I hate debt of any kind. I am sure in the long run I will not regret it. It will be a source of additional income.I am trying to live frugally and socking away most of my income to build a healthy emergency fund. For me that is a whole year's worth of expenses. Once I have that kind of money aside, I feel stable and happy. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen soon enough. I may have to stick to my job here in Ankara until next year. That is one huge year doing something I do not like anymore. Initially, I was happy but things have changed.

Being the frugal soul that I am, I decided to check the same hotel at Expedia. Lo and behold, I booked the same room at 85 USD. Now, the current exchange rate between GBP and USD is 1.4542 in Turkey. There is a savings of roughly 45 USD per night!I used to work at a very large multinational company and they encouraged us to use the corporate rate codes even for personal travel and believe it or not some people actually used them! The travel/purchasing departments do work out real good deals with hotels, car rental agencies but they usually get a rebate at the end of a quarter or a year because they are profit centers! So, using corporate rates benefit only a small part of the company. Yes, of course there is still contribution to the bottom line but all profit centers are evaluated separately. A smart manager would choose to keep her costs down and not use corporate rates.I love Expedia. I have always been satisfied with their prices and service whenever I needed to change my itinerary or cancel reservations. Their policies are very clear, there are no hidden costs or traps.

{"title": "Never Owned a Dryer, Never Needed One", "date": "Monday, September 28, 2009", "text": "In my country laundromats are not common. Usually school campuses might have them. It must be something about the culture I guess. Most people own washers but not dryers. Owning a washer was quiet an expense in the past so most people would not spend any money on dryers at all. Therefore, they never became popular until recently. Even now, most people do not buy them. I can afford one but have no place to put it. We own front loading machines and many people stack them; washer at the bottom, dryer on top. In my case even that will not work.However, I never needed a dryer at all. I am so much used to using a drying rack in my spare bedroom that, I never felt I needed one except for a brief period during late Fall and early Spring when the Central Heating is off. During those periods, it takes a little longer than I like to get my laundry dry. You might say that it is easy for me to dry my stuff since I am single and there is not much laundry when compared to a family of four or five. Well, when I was growing up, mom had a semiautomatic machine and we were a family of four. Since mom worked, Saturday was her laundry and cleaning day and after an exhausting day of these activities, she would hang the laundry on lines she would put all over the apartment and at the back balcony. I still remember the acrobatic moves we had to make so that the fresh laundry stayed fresh. Nowadays, I see lots of commercials about dryers and all those commercials claim that the dryers are very frugal in terms of electricity usage. Well, I do not have that cost now, do I? So, how can buying a dryer be frugal?"},

It sure is not \"hip\" or \"cool\" to be frugal in today's consumer world. I have a different opion on the matter. Frugality allows me to spend money on things that are important for me. I like to make budgets and stick with them. I like to save money for rainy and stormy days. I also like to take nice vacations which can be quiet pricey. Not replacing an old but working TV with a cool new LCD or plasma, buying a used car instead of a new one, replacing old bulbs with CFLs and cooking from scratch are frugal choices. I do not care to impress anyone with my possessions. For me important things in life are family, quality time spent and experiences gained by travel and socializing. For you it may be driving the best car you can afford to buy or giving your time and money to charity.We may be different when it comes to our values and I do not think it is logical to argue on them. The problem is wanting to have everything. If you want to have the best car and the biggest house and the luxury clothing and that Rolex watch and to travel the world, then this is a problem. Economics 101 usually starts by stating the obvious: There is a \"Scarcity of Resources\". It is no wonder why many people have huge credit card debts. They just want to have everything NOW and they use the money which seems to be available right away without considering the consequences.Do not get me wrong, I am not against credit cards. I use two cards for everything which allows me to track my spending. I have never ever paid a penny of interest or late fees on them. For me credit cards are a simple method of payment not a money source. If you know your values, then you know how to spend your money. Frugality makes that only easier."},

She was a very frugal lady and always recycled and re-purposed everything. During her time \"going green\" or \"conservation of nature\" were not popular topics but she probably was the \"greenest\" person I have ever known.

Nowadays I am trying to consume the contents of my freezer to make room for tomatoes, sauces and veggies for the winter. I am not going to overdo it like two years ago. I had frozen so many packages of string beans that by April there were still some left and I could not enjoy the fall and winter veggies at all. The effort of trying to empty the freezer had me eating curious combinations of food. Chili with zucchini anyone? It actually tasted very good. There is a large open market close to where I live on Saturdays. So, this Saturday, I will go and get tomatoes, grape leaves, green peppers, string beans and red beans. I stuff the grape leaves and cook them before I freeze them in portion sized aluminum containers. I heat them up in a small toaster oven and have them with plain yogurt. Yum!"},

Sometimes I find myself glued to my TV chair zapping endlessly hoping to find something good to watch. Here is what I have planned for the weekend:Saturday:-Catch up on PF blogs.-Look at the contents of the fridge, salvage everything that may go bad in a few days.-Work on the material required for the new venture (i.e. study at least 4 chapters and take notes)-Do a load of laundrySunday:-Go for a walk-Study at least 2 more chapters and take notes)-Back-up old files, clean-up the laptop and activate Skype again. (I dislike all kinds of instant messaging but this is the preferred type of communication of my new colleagues in the consultancy venture)And there is a new book I started to read last night by my bedside. These should be plenty to keep me occupied."},
{"title": "Business Card Collection!", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2009", "text": "For how long does a sane person keep old business cards? In my case, it was forever!...Until yesterday.Now that I need to do some networking, I went through more than 1500 cards collected from suppliers, colleagues, customers and friends since 1997! You could actually follw certain people's careers: Salesperson at XYZ Inc., Sales Manager at XYZ Inc., Director of Sales at PQR Inc., etc. etc...I kept about 50 or so. I know I still have a bunch dating back to 1988. Thank God, I will not have to look through them. In the process, I also saved some notebooks which were barely used. I threw out the used pages and they are like brand new. Waste not, want not! I probably have enough notepads, notebooks, post-its and a variety of office supplies to last me at least ten years. No kidding!"},
{"title": "Testing the Waters for a Freelance Life", "date": "Thursday, August 27, 2009", "text": "For the last few years, I had been contemplating about a second move in my career. I am 43 and would like to work at least until 60. However after 45-47, I think one should be able to work in a different pace. For me, this may be possible by doing consulting work and training. To be honest, I am scared. I think, I still need to have a full-time job till I am 47-48 so that I can continue saving money. Right now, I am living on my savings while looking for a new job. I hope, my job quest will end latest by the end of the year but there are no opportunities at the moment. (Gotta think positive, think positive!)Meanwhile, as I have mentioned in my previous post, there is an opportunity to become a certified trainer late October, early November. Until then my friend, his partners and I will be trying to find clients for our business. Although, we cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel yet, I am glad that I have something to do and feel like I am working. You can read only so many blogs and books while at home. I hate not having a job not just because of the negative cash flow but rather the inactivity and laziness.OK. I need to go now and work on a list of possible clients and do some research on freelance life. Any suggestions are welcome (although since this is a new blog and that I have not advertised it's existence, I am not sure how many readers there may be out there in the blogosphere)."},
{"title": "Hiatus is over...", "date": "Tuesday, August 25, 2009", "text": "I had frozen this blog of mine for a while. I have not been active on my other blogs as well. I guess summer laziness had set in. Since my last post, a few things happened. I went to Cesme, Izmir for a short vacation. The beaches were incredible and I just stayed in the water for as long as I could. Must have been a marine creature in a past life.I bought a used car from a relative. It is chugging along and taking me to the places I need to be. Gas is expensive in Turkey fluctuating between 7-8 USD/gallon. The car I bought is a 2000 Civic with an automatic transmission. So, it is not very economical but the buying price was right and I am not using the car every day. I have also started to think about a freelance career in training and consulting. I am still looking for a regular job while I am playing with this idea and actually doing some work on it. If I cannot find a DECENT job in the near future, this is my fall back plan. This type of work was in my plans for after 2015 or so but an opportunity just presented itself and I see no reason why not to grab it. It is very difficult to get your first job as a trainer. So, this one will be my test bed.I will soon be attending two trainings abroad for my certification. I will incur the flight, accomodation and misc. expenses myself. I will not pay for the classes which are not cheap. My investment will be my time and expenses of my trip.I will make sure to post about the costs associated with this trip and my money saving tactics.Although this summer was much cooler than usual, I did not play tourist in Istanbul after my visit to the Museum at all. One gets lazy when at home. The apartment sucks you in and you do not want to do much at all. Days have gone by without doing much of anything but reading."},
{"title": "No car...Oh my...", "date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "text": "Ever since I have got my driver’s license in March 1987, I have been driving. So, being without a car is a new and somewhat painful experience for me.For the last 10 years, I always drove a company car and after I quit my most recent job, I decided not to buy a car for a number of reasons:1. I am obese and I need exercise… Lots of exercise.2. I live in a part of Istanbul where public transportation is quiet good.3. Being a frugal person, I like to avoid the costs associated with owning a vehicle at least for a while.I am sure, I will want a vehicle in the summer for a vacation. My uncle has a 9 year old Honda Civic which needs a little bit attention and fixing. I might be able to borrow that car since he drives another vehicle he owns. Anyway, ever since I am carless (is this a word?) I had to walk to my dietician. I walked briskly for 30 minutes from my apartment to the hospital where my dietician works. She told me to walk a lot slower because, she does not want me to injure myself. I am quiet heavy. On the way back, I took a “dolmus” (read dolmush) which is a minibus for public transportation. You can only pay in cash on a dolmus and usually the drivers are nuts and they allow you to stand if the vehicle is full which is something they really should not do. It is extremely dangerous given the traffic in Istanbul and also a traffic violation. The one I took had empty seats and that’s why I took it. I usually avoid this type of transportation. However, it was only 75 kurus which is three quarters of a Turkish Lira (less than 50 cents US) so it was well worth it.Today I needed to do some grocery shopping and although there is a small one right by my apartment, I wanted to go to another. This grocery store has a free shuttle service from where I live so that cost me nothing. The distance? Well, if I wanted to walk there, it would probably take 50-60 minutes. Since I need to walk to and from the bus-stop, I tried not to buy too much stuff which would be very heavy. I walked for over an hour today and this is quiet good but I will still get on my stationary bike for at least 20 minutes before dinner. I have to make sure, this free time that I have now is well spent."},

{"title": "Dolmabahce Palace", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "text": "I took the above picture at the Aviary at Dolmabahce Palace... I finally went to see Dolmabahce Palace! Yay for me!I am surely not gonna get into any detail as to when it was built, who lived there and such. There are tons of resources on the Net for you to learn all that if you are interested and here are a few of those:1. Wikipedia2. Palaces of Istanbul3. Turkey Travel PlannerI took a dolmus (read dolmush) from where I live to Uskudar coast. I took a motorboat from there to Kabatas (read Kabatash) and the palace was about less than half a mile from Kabatas. It is a pretty big place and probably would take a whole day if you wanted to tour all of it. I took a combined Selamlık and Harem Tour. Selamlık was basically the offices of the Ottoman Sultan. He accepted visitors, ambassadors and government officers, held meetings and entertained at the Selamlık part of the Palace. Selamlık was meant only for men. Harem was the living quarters of his family where no other men was allowed to enter.You can see the Western and particularly the French influence in decorations. For my taste, it was too much but, I guess it just had to be spectacular and very rich at the time during the Ottoman era. I loved the park surrounding the palace and I guess, in a couple of weeks the flowers will be in full bloom.The entrance fee is 20 TL (little less than 12 USD) for the combined tour and believe me it is worth every penny. I relaxed, took a long walk in the park and also toured the palace. I need to go back there to see a couple of pavilions I could not see because I was really tired.I will post more pictures..."},
{"title": "Frugal Istanbul", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "text": "I had been contemplating about setting up a blog in English for a long time. This sure is a tough job for someone whose native language is not English.I already have a blog in Turkish and write some articles for another as a guest writer.Anyway, now that I have ample time due to quitting my job recently, I decided to take a shot at this.I know it sounds not only stupid but also very un-frugal to quit one’s job given the worldwide economic crisis but, there is only so much stress I was willing to take. The level of stress was so high that, I started having nightmares, my weight and my blood pressure went completely out of whack. I decided to quit and devote all my time to taking care of myself and looking for a new job.I have been living in İstanbul since August 2000 but, there are many places I haven’t been to yet. Now that I do not have a car anymore (I had been using a company car), I will go around İstanbul like a tourist and share the experience. I will of course make frugal choices and set a grugal example for all who would like to see İstanbul on a budget. This blog will not only be about frugally touring Istanbul though. I have many other things in mind to share so, we will see how this blog will take shape. I am also on a quest to lose weight and get healthy. This will also be a subject I would like to share here.Comments will be moderated. This blog is intended for family appeal, therefore the content and comments will be kept appropriate for all ages. I hope you will enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing."}
