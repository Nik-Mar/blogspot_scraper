{"title": "It started with the mackerel pate!", "date": "Thursday, October 19", "text": "I LOVE mackerel pate so when I saw a SW recipe I decided to try it. I was very sceptical as I have never used a crab stick before. The recipe was :-  \"One tin of mackerel in sweet chilli sauce or could be tomato sauce, 8 seafood sticks and a good dollup of quark/ fromage frais/cottage cheese. And season to taste. Blitz in a processor or stick blender. Makes a lot! \"                                       I gave it a try- and indeed it made quite a lot. We had it as a starter and I had lots left over.I chilled the remainder in the fridge and on Sunday made some scotch eggs with the mixture.I grilled the scotch eggs as the mixture was cooked. Amazing! I took a couple to a fellow SW friend - yes they were a hit!                                                                                                           I had some with a green lentil salad.I had made a vegetable soup - pease pudding, couple of veg stock cubes so I blitzed one in - amazing chowder.Further uses - as a filling in a baked potato.Will add more ideas.  Really pleased!"},

Ceramic tiles were the thought for the past few months but have now decided to go for tongue and groove for behind the units/drawers up to the Rayburn where we will have a metal sign due to the heat generated from the Rayburn. I also fancy being a bit more adventurous with colours - dark seems to be the fad and with the white units this should work?The shelf was replaced with wall cupboards as was theshutter cupboard.Off to look at more colour charts! Watch this space!"},

The company are established customers of ours and we have visited their premises a couple of times when we toured Scotland on our motorbike. It's all very technical stuff and obviously conversations are on another wavelength. One of the main scientists sounds like Adam Clayton - the bass player in the group U2! Now I suppose I am a bit of a fan when it comes to U2 so when Les the scientist starts talking with Jon I close my eyes and imagine it's Adam Clayton as it's the nearest I will ever get to be near him or be in the same room, be it a laboratory!  Over the years we have built up a rapport with our customers and I always pack in some sweets with the order and a scientific quotation! We always get a comment! Jon is visiting a new customer on Thursday which is a great start to February.At home I have the task of finding some wall tiles for the kitchen -  will take before and after photos but don't hold your breath it may be a while. The tiles will go from above the sinkAcross the back of the Rayborn to the wall cupboard. The colour of the Rayburn is a possibility for the tiles but the grout will be a very dark grey due to the dust from the Rayburn.I did feel inspired by the egg cups - will trawl a few tile shops over the next few days!Tomorrow is Slimming World - hopefully it will be my 14th week in target - ironically a group of us are going out for pizza afterwards to celebrate the various successes we have between us.Zumba today, tomorrow and on Friday.Meals this week - I prepared a cottage pie and a bolognese sauce yesterday so this will see us through the week.Meeting on Wednesday - village hall stuff! Least said the best but let's get it sorted!Jobs at home - cupboard sorting! Before and after photos to help me with the mammoth task!"},

This afternoon I let her have a snack whilst I cleaned out her shed. We got our new settee a few years ago vowing to keep it dog free!I am 13 weeks at my Slimming World target. Quiches are a fabulous meal - this one I made yesterday (Wednesday) 5 eggs beaten up with a tub of fat free cottage cheese. I added cooked mushrooms, spring onions, celery, a tin of chopped lean ham and lots of peppers. Absolutely awesome! Discovered some jalapeno pepper essence and it certainly gave it a kick!We had a tootle over to Whitby on  Monday - it was very quiet but very cold. Must make a note not to go on a Monday as quite a few of the shops were closed.Had to laugh when Jon put the shopping away - spring onions and brussel sprouts in the fruit bowl lol! We do have lots of fruit though and it's good to see we actually eat it all and none end up being thrown out.Yes - no dogs on the settee!We have been to the beach but not as much as we should!

When the previous neighbours moved out and I saw that the new people had moved in I took a welcome card to give to them. Glyn was on the drive and said that his wife was in the house and I should go and introduce myself, which I did. It turns out Anne and I have known each other from over 20 years ago when I was doing my wedding stationery and Anne had a shop selling fascinators and hats so we would meet up at various networking events and wedding fayres.It has been great to have good neighbours we had the neighbours from Hell for a couple of years but thank goodness they moved - they lived next door to Anne and Glyn! When Anne and Glyn first moved in and we realised we knew each other I didn't mention the neighbour from hell - a week or so after they moved in Anne invited me for a cuppa. As I walked over the threshold Anne said \"Right, tell me about him next door!\" Yes within their first few days he had caused problems - but as I said they have moved now no doubt causing problems!Meet ShirleyI have known Shirley for years - we met at pottery class. It was just a flash in the pan for me - pottery but Shirley still goes and has produced some amazing pots. Shirley and her family moved here again just over a year ago. It will be great when we get back to the busy village hall events - just waiting for the AGM and we can get things moving!"},
{"title": "Wednesday 26th January", "date": "Wednesday, January 25", "text": "Everybody needs a Brenda! This is my friend Brenda. Many years ago I taught her nephew and when Jon was looking for somebody to sweep up at the workshop I suggested Chris. He swept up for Jon for over 5 years and when he applied for college Jon wrote him a reference.We kept in touch with him long after he left college and often helped out in the workshop or with any projects Jon had on the go even though he was working fulltime. The family never forgot and so when his auntie moved to the area from West Yorkshire she made friends on Facebook and became a regular visitor at the workshop at a time when we were moving premises. Brenda became a great friend and I introduced her to Kitchen Therapy and Walking Footblall, she also loved helping out at the village hall.Last year we were going away and she offered to look after our house, in particular to look after the dogs. Brenda not only kept all the dogs happy she hoovered every day and power-washed the patio!This photo was taken over Christmas when we went for supper and drinks with Jacky and Keith. Anne and Glyn also went - Brenda is so kind and offered to taxi us all. Everybody needs a Brenda - but she's ours!"},
{"title": "24th January", "date": "Tuesday, January 24", "text": "Tuesday - Zumba first thing with the gals. I drove this week so Anne and I travelled in together, meeting Jacky and Sharon there. I must admit I am getting \"into\" zumba as I become more familiar with the moves. Easington is a relatively new class, just a couple of miles away new faces too. Class is an hour with a period set aside for toning. Must admit I ached after last night's session - as did Anne so I am hoping it is doing some good. Last Friday I went to Walking Football. I hadn't been for quite a while following an injury I sustained during a session. It was quite severe and I had to go to physiotherapy for a few sessions, at my own expense. I had attended the sessions from day 1, encouraging others to go too - I was even instrumental in a bit of match making! (Still going strong and gloriously happy I add too!) As the group has grown and developed the pace of the game has increased as has the speed of the balls etc. I think my confidence and strength has decreased and I am thinking about not going for a while, sticking to zumba instead! Yes there were new faces there but with no proper introductions not many knew me. Let's see.When I was a Member Pioneer for the Co-op one thing I did learn was the roles we play when doing any community initiative/project. One important role is that of a \"connector.\" We don't have to organise, manage and attend everything that comes along but we can \"connect\" I look at the people who I connected with and introduced to Walking Football, it now being an important part of their social life and I am happy with the part I played. They have grown and developed over the past year whilst I took time out. Maybes accept and move on Denise?Tuesday is also Slimming World and that means weigh in. I am 11 weeks into my target and let's just see what the scales say! Looking back at some photos I can see the difference and will continue with the regime! Chilli featured heavily this week due to a culinary incident in the kitchen. The good thing however is Jon is enjoying chilli soup!Photos below 1993? 1996, 2002, the last one is me last Christmas."},

I met Shirley at pottery class so it's appropriate for me to sign the book with a personal poem.When you open up this package Shirley, on Christmas Day.Think about when we first met it was over a pile of clay!I was relatively new to pots so I was making the gaffsYou supplied the encouragement we had so many laughs.Now we are neighbours as well as life long friends Just shows the benefits of pottery certainly knows no ends.+I am not going to call it a New Year's Resolution because it's not new year anymore and January is just flying out the window like it hasn't got a care in the world for those around it like me!I decided to write something every day but that idea went out of the window so I am clawing any good intentions back and making a start today. It is 3.30pm and I am going to write for 30 whole minutes!My life seems to be a series of incidents, the most recent being yesterday in Asda!I was shopping with my pal Brenda who is taller than me - as most people are. As I was stretching up to look at the clothes the rail came unhinged sending clothes everywhere in the aisle. Ofcourse we were laughing but managed to get the rail sorted and Brenda was able to hang all the clothes back up easily. This had brought attention to ourselves so we moved on to the gents coat section where I found a jacket for Jon. Yest again the rail system was designed for an average 7 foot shopper and as I scrambled through the small sizes I came across a medium - sending several small ones onto the floor again! Having decided this was perfect for Jon we made our way to the self check out via the vegetable section! Being a brussel sprout type of gal I noticed some rather succulent specimens so I got 2 bags. At the check out we scanned everything and it was here Brenda suggested we have a cuppa. Obsessed as many are with the notion of not buying plastic carrier bags, Brenda came up with the idea of stuffing the sprouts into the jacket pockets - which I did. I made sure I had the receipt as we made our way to the cafe.We had our tea/soup in Brenda's case and made our way to the exit.The alarm was so loud it startled both Brenda and myself - so much once again we started laughing. I could see some ex-pupils looking on with interest and an ex-teaching colleague passed, laughing at our situation. Security arrived and ascertained the alarm had gone off because there was a security tag on the jacket which WOULD have been removed at a conventional manned check out, but because we had decided to go to the self check out, the tag had remained on the jacket. The security guy by ths time had the jacket and was unzipping the pockets - can you imagine his face when he came across the sprouts? Thank goodness I had the receipt and I also pointed out that if I was to shop lift it wuld have been for something far more valuable than 2 packets of sprouts - possibly a turnip or some red cabbage! He didn't seem to have my sense of humour but Brenda and I found it hilarious - remember the alarm was still clanging out at this time.The receipt was sufficient evidence, the tag was removed, the alarm ceased and Brenda and I left the building!3.45pm."},

I used a 425g tin together with 3 beaten eggs to make waffles. I then added some M&S Chunky Steak and believe me it made a great steak bake - so healthy too.Egg waffles are really easy too - 2 eggs with a generous teaspoon of cottage cheese."},

{"title": "WRITING PROJECT", "date": "Monday, March 16", "text": "#WritingSomethingEveryDay Needed another adjective for accidental!We became accidental hen keepers in 1991. It was a result of an accidental encounter with a neighbours hen by our border cillie Tess. To cut a long story short (which I will expand upon at a later date) we found ourselves owners of 2 hens, Madge and Mavis (named after our mums) and a cockerel Maurice (named after my uncle who drove trolley buses and frequently set his trousers on fire when he dropped his fag end in his bid to control the Austin A35. The hen keeping had begun and continued for some years. Careers and business interveened and we had a break from the chickens but in 2009 it rekindled. We were looking after our neighbours hens whilst they were on holiday and as a fee we were told we could eat the eggs. Any hen owner will tell you there is nothing like fresh eggs and once tasted our memories were evoked and we wanted some of the action and the hens were bought.  On the bench from the left, Mabel, Margie, Bev, Olwyn. Next to the bench May, Behind the bench Eva. We bought them from a local farmer when we collected them it was raining heavily and as we drove home in the pick up I kept looking in the mirror and seeing six little pairs of eyes peering out of the crate which the farmer had allowed us to borrow. I thought the best thing to do was to put the crate inside their new temporary house and open the lid, ensuring the house was secure. The following morning the hens were out of the box so we opened the roof and left them to their own devices. We kept checking on them every hour or so and each time we  could see they had gained more confidence as they became more familiar with their new surroundings. It wasn't long before 2 of them found a gap in the fence and made their way to the goose hut where they spent most of the morning. Later this afternoon they had worked out they wanted to be back with the others so we caught them and gently put them back, making sure the gap was sorted.First Egg October2009 When I went to clean out the henhouse Idiscovered the very first egg the girls had delivered for us. I was not surewho was responsible but suspected it was May.We did not eat it, though tempted, we marked it and left itin the nesting box to encourage the others to lay.The hens were definately showing their personalities. Firston the scene, front of the queue was always Little Eva followed by May. The twodominent ones were Mabel and Olwyn. WhenI would put them in for the night it was Mabel who would sleep in the tree ifgiven half a chance. They both stretched their necks towards the tree whengoing in for the evening and I wonder if they are casing the joint for futureescape plans! Margie and Bev were always the first into the henhouse and seem tobe the most placid.We were very happy with the way they are all getting along!Their favourite snack was to be the elderberries and the wind fallen apples.

{"title": "2019 at a glance January to July", "date": "Sunday, January 5", "text": "It's quite a while since I wrote anything on my blog so whilst it is just January 5th I figured out it was not too late to have some organisation of the mayhem I have as my everyday life. Whilst I am organised when I am planning anything when it comes to basic stuff I have to have a list for everything. 2019 then this is what I did.....January saw me re-elected as Secretary on our village hall committee and Jon re-elected as chair. I also started as Member Pioneer with the Co-op a role which sees me do 16 hours a month linking with local community activities and groups. I get paid for this and the 16 hours is a laugh really but nevertheless it is recognition for the vital role volunteers play in the everyday life of the incredible communities around us.In February I was also re-elected as Chair for the Friends of Loftus library. I alongside other residents campaigned heavily for the saving of Loftus library and we were successful. Now our role is to ensure we get more footfall in the library by planning regular events and activities. During the first few months of 2019 we had considerable work donein the house, mainly the snug and large room. We had decided to use the space better by creating a dining room and back room instead of one large room. The building work was completed and the decorator started work on the snug ready for our new settee to be delivered in March.April was a busy month with various community activities including circus skills workshop in half term organised by the Friends of Loftus Librery, the Klondike Cycle race, televised showcasing the various villages where the route circulated, including ours, Easter crafts throughout half term in the library and the village being recognised as Dementia friendly. The Scarecrow Festival preparations started and a radio interview with Zetland FM.May saw the annual Bluebell Walk take place with the hall providing home made soup lunch for the walkers, more workshops in the library, workshops at our local organic gardening project, scarecrow workshops and youth club activitie linked to the Co-op Member Pioneer Project. One of the highlights was working with local artist Mackenzie Thorpe in a Dementia home where I led a scarecrow workshop.June saw the arrival of our new motorbike, a Moto Guzzi V85TT. After a 10 year stint visiting the Isle of Man TT Races we had a change in 2018 and circumnavigated the country on our Moto Guzzi California. There's a tale to share - watch this space. July was all about Scarecrows with 12 villages groups taking part. A local business Sabic donated £1,000 which enabled us to transform the hall, using a series of canvases to the world of Harry Potter. In future we will be able to hire the hall for Harry Potter themed events so the £1.000 was indeed an investment. The East Cleveland Scarecrow Festival now has its own website - currently being updated but you can find it here.August saw us visiting the many scarecrow festivals taking place throughout East Cleveland. I am always humbled to see the domino effect our first scarecrow festival has had across the borough. September was another busy month and an investment in Loftus by Middlesbrough Football Club Foundation. An office has been funded with plans for future community projects. I am really excited about this as I was invited onto the steering committee - watch this space. The launch event was fun! There was more work with Co-op Pioneer projects, helping out with various groups in the community.October saw another first - a Mental Health Awareness Day on 10th. One of my aims as Member Pioneer is to connect with groups so basically I emailed/phoned a few of my contacts and brought them together for an event in Loftus Town Hall.November - workshops contiued throughout the month in Loftus Library and a first for the village hall. We held a Comedy Night which in my opinion was one of the best events we have ever held in the hall. One of our neighbours is a professional actress and is setting up a new companr this.December came round all too quickly the first being the busiest in the history of volunteering I can tell you. Christmas workshops continued.Monday 2nd/Tuesday 3rd was a huge multi-agency clean up of local overgrown woodland. In my role as MP for Co-op (member pioneer not any MP lol) I supplied tea and coffee with cakes on the Monday for 15 people and soup for 45 on the Tuesday.Christmas dinner for the village (28 full meals) and on 7th we had a Christmas Craft Fayre with our annual visit from Father Christmas. 13th - Friends of Loftus Library Christmas Coffee Afternoon.All in all a very busy year. Bring on 2020!"},

From working with other village hall groups we have good relations with our local W.I. One of these days I'll join, but Cynthia and Anne agreed to act as judges and what an excellent job they did too. We had 5 entrants - all from the village. £2 per submission - some entered more than 1 category and winners received a tea for 2 voucher at our local tearoom, together with a wooden spoon and teatowel. They were all really excited - so next moth we will have another competition - savoury theme. Cheese scone.The appleas have been prolific and as we were holding a cider festival on Saturday night we kept the apple theme running through the day. One neighbour baked some apple pies and another neighbour gave us some leeks he had grown. We took leeks, and apples to our butcher who made them into our very own Village sausages. They flew off the shelf and sold out. Definitely do this again next November's coffee morning.In our local co-op one of the workers told me about his hobby of making cider! He was really keen to be involved - basically a couple of months ago i dropped off a few carriers of our apples which he and his pal turned into the most delicious cider I have ever tasted - it was so popular last night at the Festival!Life slows down this next week and today my feet are certainly up!"},

Amazing lengths of nettle roots pulled out on Sunday - using these in a green solution for plantfood - came across a very interesting article re stinging nettles hereBev together with the other 2 gals continues to give us regular eggs - treat today of mealworms.Jon did a wonderful job on cleaning the Rayburn. I think this will be lit today or tomorrow - coal ordered so I think Summer is leaving us, certainly looking at the falling leaves scattered everywhere.Off to a presentation this afternoon - remember I asked for votes?Watch this space!"},

Back in 2002 we were visiting the Scottish Motorbike show and I bought a duck back pack. I fell in love with him and has since travelled evrywhere with Jon and I when we go out on our motorbike adventures.One project I am proud to share is ABC Wednesady - a little idea I had many many years ago. Each week as we worked our way through the alphabet we would post a photograph and sometimes a few words. The project took off and spans the globe with  many contributions each week. It is currently in its last chapter under the team I am part of before entering a new level. When I read that Liz  had joined in it made me think again. Liz is a blogging friend of many many years - as are many of my other blogging friends.

The enormity of the task of catching up leaves me quite speechless so here's a whistlestop tour/account ramble!April - one of our most successful weekends so far—the book folding workshop and lunch was a great success, those of us who attended found it relaxing and very therapeutic. We will certainly be planning another one later in the year. Ally Miles from Margrove ran the session—seeing us all make hedgehogs from old books—next time we will be making a fairy house. The following day, Saturday we held a coffee morning.The May Coffee Morning was well attended and together with the proceeds from the workshop, raffle and games saw us make an astounding profit of £437.17Following on from last year's Scarecrow Competition we decided to run another this year - but thought other villages may want to have a go...so as a result of regular scarecrow workshops held in our village hall a new inter-village initiative was launched!We celebrated the Queen's Birthday in our village hall.As a result of our \"Clean for the Queen\"  it was noted that we don't have a bin in the village. With the new legislation and council initiatives regarding both litter and dog waste it seemed  an ideal time to check out the possibilties of Liverton having a bin. The idea was put  forward at a Neighbourhood Action Partnership meeting and it has been confirmed that we are indeed getting a \"Barnsley Bin\" - similar to the photograph below, from Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council. It will be situated at the road end of Handale and will be emptied regularly. A full inspection/survey will be carried out by the council as will the siting of the said bin.On a sadder note, in late May as I pulled up outside our house I saw our cat had been ran over. By the extent and nature of her injuries we felt it was a result of a vehicle travelling at an inappropriate speed - quite possibly speeding. At our scarecrow workshop I mentioned this to Councillor Mary Lanigan who is going to organise some flashing 30 mph signs for our village.A positive outcome of little Puss's death but hopefully it will mean cars do slow down and respect our village life…We can only hope!June saw our annual pilgrimage to the Isle of Man TT Races - as ever the weather was awesome, the company exceptional and the hotel superb - we are all booked up for next year.June was a special event - my 60th! Lunch out with my pals and later a steak with Jon at our favourite restaurant. A BASH was in order! Ofcourse I did my own invitations :- Wording as follows:-On Saturday 2nd July I am havinga bit of a bash tocelebrate my 60th birthday. The fun will commence at 10am in our village hall  with a coffee morning/mid day lunch and lots of my amazing baking!At 2pm we will be having a party on our paddock, where the very wonderful Chris Middleton will be twinkling the ivories, whilst my lovely guests will enjoy Afternoon tea—featuring even more of mywonderful baking.At some point we will stagger over to the village hall for a bit of a knees up involving music, alcohol and fun.I am blessed with good family, friends and neighbours and request no presents, instead I will have a donations box for a charity close to our family’s hearts.I had an amazing day and raised just under £1,000 for Leuka charity - for research and development for the treatment of Leukemia.July continued to be busy with village life and sadly we lost one of our hens, Mabel.It was all so quick - one minute she was pottering round the garden, the next thing we knew she had taken ill, declining over the weekend. A trip to the vet confirmed she had suffered a stroke which had left her paralysed. Needless to say we ended her suffering.August saw the launch of the East Cleveland Scarecrow Festival - here in our village.Great success -  we have received great backing from our local radio station Zetland FM and I have been interviewed on a couple of occasions specifically about the Scarecrow Festival and I am talking next week about keeping chickens - speaking of which....Bev is 9 and a broody girl so we have just placed some fertile eggs under her - the adventure has begun as we await the results."},

The village, like many other communities took part in the national \"Clean for the Queen\" campaign in preparation for the official celebrations for the Queen's 90th birthday in May. We will be holding a village tea party where all the village will be invited to the village hall for afternoon tea on May 15th.Our local Asda store sent their community worker (2nd left) and the community offer from the borough council came too, supplying high visability vests, litter pickers and plastic bags.So...considering we have had a flood, were without running water and torrential rain we had two productive events and raised £100 for village hall funds."},

Jon more or less leaves colours up to me and I know we have a decent quantity of both grey and white emulsion to hand so no prizes for guessing my thoughts.I don't buy \"Housy\" magazines anymore - whilst they were often a source of inspiration and encouraged me to tidy up, inevitably I flicked through them once and found many the same. As we have worked our way through the house more often than not we will visit a showhouse for inspiration and to see what the  current trends are. Last weekend we did just that.In one showhouse I spotted a desk. As I have been sorting out my various crafty stuff and the piles of paper etc for my card making I have used the big cupboard in the porch to store things away, ever realising the potential the room had to be mult-functional. Yes a porch is great but as we have such a lovely open view of the garden I felt it was a shame not to work in the porch, but not to have everything everywhere, so the desk gave me an idea.To look at it (yes I bought one on-line) it's not imposing but it's the perfect size for my laptop/sewing machine. When I am working (as I was yesterday) the stool next to the desk is ideal for my printer - as the big cupboard is right next to the desk stuff can be put away when I have finished and the tesk doubles up as a console table.The view from the desk is inspiring too - yesterday Puss was in her favourite spot for an afternoon nap!I brought down a wicker chair which is comfortable when working at the desk - when not in use with the desk I just move it against the back wall.Above the chair I have used picnic baskets for further storage. I am so pleased with these - only costing £5 each from  the charity shops - so much nicer than plastic containers.Jon is busy at work so I am not sure when we will make a start on his room but in the meantime I am happy to have a place to potter in and keep warmABC Wednesday - E for enterprising!"},

I have never been able to reach the top shelf and so we've decided to have some shelves fixed inside, removing the rail.It's an ideal storage space for hoover, cleaner and floor washer.To the right as you come in from the hall are the current coat racks.......above where a radiator once hung. We are re-locating the hooks (and adding a couple more) to the wall to the right on entering from the porch door (main entrance.)All of the pine woodwork is to be white gloss.This is the main door entrance adjacent to the kitchen door.The door blind needs replacing and I may hang curtains - still debating.The porch has a 5 foot window overlooking the garden.Again I am thinking about putting curtains up to add warmth.This window is to the right when entering from the main door - as shown in this plan.The porch is currently Pale Hound colour but we are changing the scheme to link to the colours from the hall - a grey. I am excited about changing the colour and wonder how brave I will be - will I go as dark grey as I dare?I find experimenting with colours quite exciting.....watch this space!A new round of ABC Wednesday - I am using this round to share the home improvements we have planned for 2016.

As we don't tend to use the porch a great deal, chosing to use the kitchen door as an entrance, we were blissfully unaware of the rainwater coming in from the flat roof extension. About 5 months ago the local roofer \"patched up\" the corroded felt but after the heavy rain a more permanent solution was needed, so he replaced it all but now we have to have the ceiling repaired, possibly replaced. We will know when the decorator comes next Monday. The carpet needs replacing so we are replacing the hall carpet too. Once everything is finished, together with some additional storage we will use the porch as the main entrance.

{"title": "Y is for Yule.", "date": "Wednesday, December 30", "text": "December has certainly been a busy time for the village. We were encouraged to apply for council funding to help with the purchase of some christmas lights and a tree. Whilst we have lived in the village for 25 years I have never known of  a village christmas tree. For a few years there was one at the local pub but this hasn't been the case for the past few years.The town council received some funds specifically for Christmas decorations - we were the only village without any form of Christmas display and as other communities had been given funding in the past we were optimistic our application would be approved - which it was. The town council supplied the tree and lights and the borough council provided funding for the icicle lights and electrician's fees. All work had to be super approved etc. so we were really pleased with the results. There was a lot of decisions to be made, organising etc. The choice of light colours and style fell on my shoulders but I knew it had to reflect the traditional village idyll - I think it did.The lights were installed and on November 28th were switched on at our Christmas Coffee morning.Another first for the village - a visit from Father Christmas. My friend Karen and I organised this event which was a success bringing funds for the Village Hall.No sooner had we tidied away from the event, it was time to celebrate yet another first. The village hall Christmas meal. As I have shared here in previous months, I have been involved with village hall activities as I am now back on the committee. These events whilst raising funds have really brought the community together. All our events have been supported by the village. People attend and or supply prizes and baking ingredients. We decided to cook a meal for the residents of the village - a traditional Christmas dinner and for those who couldn't attend - a meal would be delivered.We had a wonderful day - December 9th Karen and I cooked for 30, 12 delivered. Another neighbour provided entertainment so we had a sing song after the meal and a bingo session. It was a great success - we'll do it again in 2016.Another first - with some of the proceeds from our fund raising events we paid for children under 12 to go to a pantomime. Parents paid a reduced ticket price - partly subsidised by the funds  and we paid for the transport.Not long after this I fell ill with the dreaded Christmas cold - which I could deal with, the dreadful chesty cough was another matter. It left me feeling really drained and with no energy for any Christmas preparations. Fortunately it was just Jon and I on Christmas Day so I didn't have the pressure of cooking for 8 people.I bought a small turkey crown and piece of pork - it kept us going for 3 days! I prepared the vegetables knowing I had sufficient again for subsequent meals. Whilst I enjoyed our Christmas dinner during the period of my cold I lost my appetiti but found salmon sandwiches were a godsend and happily tucked into them on several occasions.Our new member of the family remember?I think it's safe to say she has had an enjoyable Christmas - certainly better than what was on the cards if we hadn't taken her in.Bing and Sadie have had an enjoyable time too - Their daily adventures on the beach ensure they sleep well!2016 approaches - a lot to look forward to........... Watch this space.Y for Yule (ABC Wednesday)"},

It proved very popular with 22 joining up. It was led by a local baker, Ed of Backyard Bakery. He discussed his philosophy with us and we had a great morning. We all came away with some bread which we baked at home as we only have one oven in the hall.I made soup for lunch and it was great to see everybody getting along and having fun. There was a range of people attending - neighbours, people who had heard via facebook and a few of my friends from pottery class.Saturday was our Pumpkin Fest. Children carved their pumpkins, we served refreshments/lunch, guess the name of the wizard, guess the weight of the pumpkin,  traditional skittles and a raffle.The proceeds from both events gave us a total of £420 for our fundraising.We are currently working alongside the Town Council to secure funding for Christmas Tree lights. Usually the village pub has a tree but past years have seen this not take place. At a local council meeting we were invited to discuss the lights in the borough. Our village have none so as they have been given some funding they encouraged us to submit a bid - which we have done. We feel the tree should be outside the village hall as this is the focus of the village. Watch this space as we await results. The decorations and tree need to be in situ by November 20th so when I say quiet, I may be this week (and I have a cold) but life will once again get bust very soon.ABC Wednesday Q for Quiet."},

Reading other blogs the wordde-clutter does seem to crop up on many occasions, together with downsizing and recycling.We have lived in our house now for 24 years - the amount of possessions we have between usis quite a huge amount. Jon's workshop is a mile up the road and whilst he has a large shed and garage at his disposal here, he also has a workshop where for 21 years he has collected a large collection of machinery and tools for all aspects of the business.One day we will downsize but the project needs to be organised - long, medium  and short term plans need establishing and become part of our day to day living.Any suggestions?"},
{"title": "Catching Up", "date": "Monday, July 27", "text": "A few months ago one of the girls from Slimming world asked me to organise her wedding stationery. The theme was blue - to match the bridesmaid's dresses. The order was quite a big one re numbers - this is what I came up with.I added embelishments ie \"Wedding Invitation\" but you get the gist.RSVP's and addressed envelopes included.I know a lot of money can be made from weddings so I suggested I helped her with the reception flowers. I incorporated the table numbers - there were 14 tables in all. Total spent on flowers £35. The blue carnations were artificial - but when placed amongst the real flowers it difficult to tell them apart.The seating plan - individual table details attached to the decorative heart I keep for resources - last time I used it was for our silver wedding celebration back in 2013.I had a few bits and bobs floating about which I added to the postbox. As Joanne and John had been living together for a while they really had everything they needed - so contributions towards a honeymoon were requested.I enjoyed creating the invitations etc. and one of the guests has made an appointment regarding her own wedding stationery etc so it will be another large commission. Whilst the wedding itself is a few months away by agreeing a theme early on makes the job more manageable, The seating plan is always the last thing I do as changes can take place right up to the last minute. I find it quite rude of people to leave the bride and groom hanging on before they let them know if they are attending, this is why I use a design that is easily managed.I have also been busy with a lady's 90th birthday invitations. 20 in all, but she wanted something special - she loved the butterfly idea I often use.Needless to say we didn't include \"Wedding Invitation\" - just leaving the front blank. The customer loved the invitations which is all that matters.Whenever I do a wedding commission I order extra materials - which tend to mount up so once in a while I have a good clear out and pass the surplus materials over to people I know - an effort to cut down on clutter!ABC Wednesday - Catching up and clutter issues!"},
{"title": "Bev and pals.", "date": "Tuesday, July 21", "text": "Our hens love the company of humans - this photo was only taken a couple of weeks ago, sadly we have lost Olwyn, pictured here on the right.As you will recall we lost Eva a short while ago which I wrote about here and then there was the attack on Bev, which I wrote about here.We had no idea what had attacked the hens but to our horror we found out on Sunday evening.We were sitting in the lounge when through the window as quick as a flash we saw a movement in the garden. Bev scattered away but Olwyn fell victim to next door's dog. We flew outside - the dog disappeared as quickly as he had arrived - through a gap in the metal fencing between the two properties. It had all proved too much for Olwyn who had staggered behind the greenhouse, but as Jon picked her up she died in his arms.Hens often die of shock and whilst her suffering was short it proved too much for her.The very awkward matter however is we had to speak to our neighbour - Robbie, who I have known from when he was 12. We are very close and ironically I let their dogs out for a run whilst Robbie and Emma his partner are at work. Emma looks after my hens when we go away.We went round and spoke to Robbie (Emma was away.) I left Jon with Robbie, investigating their fence, returning home to ensure Bev and Mabel were okay. As it happens they were fine. I ushered them into their shed and dealt with Olwyn.Of course I blamed myself for not getting the hens in sooner - but it was a nice night and they do enjoy a wander round the garden pond at that time, catching any flies hovering above the water.We were both upset.Yesterday morning on his way to work Robbie called round. He was  noticeably upset and said how badly he felt about everything. He offered to buy me some more hens but I explained our 2 Bev and Olwyn are 5 and any new hens would be a major issue and would be best just left together.Allowing our hens to be totally free range has it's drawbacks - but we wouldn't have it any other way. Robbie has fixed the fence and we all carry on as normal.Olwyn did have a limp but managed to live as normal - always keeping up with the others.Bev and Mabel developed a close bond when they both had their broody moment a few years ago, which I wrote about here so they will be just fine together.So now we know what has been attacking our hens - it was right under our noses and we didn't suspect it for one minute.Life is getting back to normal here in the Nesbitt household.B - Bev and pals ABC Wednesday."},

Friends Dorothy and Keith had an \"Aunt\" Peggy. Peggy died a few months ago and when Dorothy and Keith were sorting/clearing the house they kindly gave me some of Peggy's baking stuff including this lovely Royal Worcester Pie dish. They also gave me lots of baking tins which I have put to good use. Peggy was a WI member and avid baker, whilst I have never been much of a baker I must admit I have discovered the joy of baking cakes and I am sure part of it is down to wanting to ensure that Peggy's baking legacy lives on.Keith and Dorothy were very kind and donated lots of Peggy's baking items to the village hall. To keep the memory of Peggy alive each month when we have our coffee morning/lunch we will have a \"Peggy's Pie Special\" the coming May event will feature an Apple Pie.For inspiration the girls on the library van found this book for me so I am currently reading through and getting some ideas.There is a very interesting recipe - with cheese pastry!This is what Angela Boggiano says....Apple pie without the cheese is like a kiss without a squeeze.This is an old Saxon proverb and they certainly knew what they were talking about. This pure apple pie is complemented by the best ever pastry. The old combination of cheese and apple makes absolute sense and, believe me, is wonderful.

Add the butter and use your fingertips to rub it into the flour and sugar until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the egg yolks and cheese, adding a little water if the mixture seems too dry. Use your hands to form the mixture into a smooth dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes.Place the apples in a saucepan with the sugar, lemon juice, and 2 tbsp water and cook for about 15 minutes until softened. Leave to cool.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a sturdy baking sheet in the oven to heat.Rollout two-thirds of the pastry to 1/4in/5mm thick to fit a 9in/23cm pie pan or plate. Fill with the cooled apple mixture. Rollout the remaining pastry to make the lid, brush the edges of the pastry shell with water and top with the lid, pressing down to seal. Trim with a knife to make a neat edge and crimp the edges with your fingertips, if you like, make a hole in the top of the pastry and dust with superfine sugar. Place on the baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden. Leave to stand for about 15 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving with cream.Watch this space!P is for Peggy - ABC Wednesday."},

Numbers so far :-  258.35          Coffee morning 1  223.41         Baking Stall at Village Market  359.41         CoffeeMorning 2   The Biker's initiative is a new idea. 3 times a year the Oliver's Mount Racing Circuit in Scarborough holds racing weekends over Saturday and Sunday. The road leading to our village is off one of the main roads to Scarborough, the A171. Many bikes pass the end of our road. The prices are quite steep and the food stalls are limited choice (mostly pies and burgers) but pricey. My partner in crime, Karen and I decided we would try something new and hatched a plan. We used facebook to advertise the information. We also used an old wheelbarrow as an advertisement on the main Moor Road to Scarborough. There are strict rules re using signposts to advertise - but this method is mobile and therefore within the law.The venture was new because we had to buy raw ingredients (bacon, sausage, bread) which would incur costs and there was the question of what to do with them if not sold.The weather has been dreadful but despite the odds been stacked against us the bikers came, not in their hundreds, but they came and after expenses we made a profit of £138.It was great to catch up with some dear old friends Barry and Trish will bring their fellow bike mates to the next event - Barry is the leader of the group and will pass the word.                                  The bread  left over (fresh rolls made by our local baker and delivered on Saturday morning) is now in the freezer and will be used up when we serve soup at our next coffee morning/lunch. A local farmer gave us a carrier of leeks which I blanched and froze - the next soup will be leek and potato.There is also a pack of sausages left over - again in the freezer which I will make into scotch eggs, again for the next time. I made some corned beef slices - these are now frozen and will be offered with a salad for the lunchtime menu.Our next coffee morning will incorporate a plant stall but it is 6 weeks away.......and now we have our wheelbarrow we are thinking........May Bank Holiday weekend???????Watch this space!ABC Wednesday - M for money and N for new!"},

(If you are making this by hand, bash the nutsto a rubbly powder with a rolling pin and mix with the dry ingredients; thencream the butter and sugar together, and beat in some dry ingredients and eggsalternately and, finally, the milk.)6.                            Dividethe mixture between the 2 lined tins and bake in the oven for 25 minutes, oruntil the sponge has risen and feels springy to the touch.7.                            Coolthe cakes in their tins on a wire rack for about 10 minutes, before turningthem out onto the rack and peeling off the baking parchment.8.                            Whenthe sponges are cool, you can make the buttercream.9.                            Pulsethe icing sugar inthe food processor until it is lump free, then add the butter and process tomake a smooth icing.10.                       Dissolvethe instant espresso powder in 1 tablespoon boiling water and add it whilestill hot to the processor, pulsing to blend into the buttercream.11.                       Ifyou are doing this by hand, sieve the icing sugar andbeat it into the butter with a wooden spoon.12.                       Thenbeat in the hot coffee liquid.13.                       Place1 sponge upside down on your cake stand or serving plate.14.                       Spreadwith about half the icing; then place on it the second sponge, right side up(i.e. so the 2 flat sides of the sponges meet in the middle) and cover the topwith the remaining icing in a ramshackle swirly pattern.15.                       Thiscake is all about old-fashioned, rustic charm, so don’t worry unduly: howeverthe frosting goes on is fine. similarly, don’t fret about some buttercreamoozing out around the middle: that’s what makes it look so inviting.16.                       Gentlypress the walnut halves into the top of the icing all around the edge of thecircle about 1cm apart.Cherry &Almond loaf cake Ingredients  ·                                200 grams natural-coloured glacecherries·                                250 grams self-raisingflour·                                225 grams butter (softened)·                                175 grams castersugar·                                3 large eggs (beaten)·                                2- 3 drops almondessence·                                100 grams groundalmonds·                                6 tablespoons milkMethod1.                             Preheatthe oven to 170ºC/gas mark 3/325ºF.

Pour the batter into your tin.Pop into the middle of your oven and close the door.Cooking time will vary depending on your cooker, but it should take around45mins. When it’s done the top should be nice and shiny and it should haveraised up in the middle, I take mine out when it’s still a little bit wobblybecause it gives a good squidgy middle later.

I have made all the cakes up and they are currently in the freezer, awaiting an icing session on Friday.So far I have:-2 coffee&walnut cakes1 traditional victoria sandwich1 chocolate  cake1 lemon drizzle loaf cake1 chocolate orange loaf cake1 chocaholic loaf cakeWhat are favourite cakes out there?I am definitely enjoying baking, made even more satisfying by the fact my friends Dorothy and Keith had to clear the house of very close relative who died just after Christmas. Peggy was an avid baker and was a member of the WI. I have some of her tins and dishes and an electric whisk.

{"title": "Injury and Instigation.", "date": "Tuesday, March 10", "text": "Last Thursday  I returned home around 3pm to find black feathers scattered over the back lawn. Following the death of Eva my heart sank as I feared the worse. I spotted Bev hunched up next to her companion from labour days, Mabel. On inspection I saw that she too had been attacked. Brought her into the porch and settled her in a large garden trug. Phoned the vets and got her in at 5.20. The extent of the wound was quite deep - but discussing the options - one being to put her to sleep - we decided she needed a chance. The vet stapled the wound and Bev bless her didn't complain at all. In fact she was quite chatty and toddled round the table.We knew the next 24 hours was critical. She slept the night in the trug, in the porch and on Friday after a few phone calls I was given this dog cage from the lady who we got Sadie from - she happens to be a dog breeder. She found this cage and has given it to us. It is ideal for Bev - she can walk about and lie in the sun.Every day we apply cream to her wound and will be taking her back to the vets on Thursday. Fingers crossed!Meanwhile my other 2 hens are only being allowed out for a couple of hours in the afternoon - when we are about. Today however, the sun is out so an ideal opportunity for me to let them out whilst I potter in the garden.I mentioned the Village activities not so long ago. Last year a monthly coffee morning took place - the ladies who ran it have stopped doing it now. A neighbour friend and myself have decided to re-launch this monthly activity so are busy marketing and advertising as the very first one is this Saturday, 14th March. I have set up a Liverton Village page on facebook and we are generating a lot of interest.

The particular photo above was taken a couple of years ago. The best time to capture the heather in all it's glory is the last Sunday of August. I used this photo some years ago when I chose 12 of my photographs to depict a year in and around our village. We have been in the village now for over 20 years and I must say how much we enjoy living here. I started to blog back in June 2006.  During that time I have posted endless photographs about matters dear to my heart.This current blog mrs nesbitt's space was the replacement to my first blog mrs nesbitt's place. I don't know what went wrong - technical issues far beyond my little brain could deal with - so I started this one and all seems to be okay.In the village we are entering a new era with a new Village Hall Management committee. Jon was elected chairman and I am a member of the committee. Whilst I have been a member in the past, we have new neighbours here and they are buzzing with ideas - so I feel very positive about the coming year. Social media has really developed over the last few years and we are embracing it in an effort to promote the village. I came up with the idea of the village blog and I have also set up Liverton Village's own FB page. It is all in the early stages but all ready we are creating interest in our Village Spring Market.As I was composing the various posts on the Village Blog I was using the photographs from both my blogs - downloading and saving in various folders which were then so easy to upload. When I looked back there have certainly been a host of events that have happened whilst we have been here - so I am making some more folders so my photographs are organised - a first time for everything eh?My contribution for ABC Wednesday - a fun way to connect with creative people around the blobe."},

You guessed correctly. Sadly I didn't realise at the time as I was too busy cleaning the carpet, wall and settee. The following morning when I switched on my laptop I knew something was wrong.I frantically tried to clean the keyboard but it was quite obvious the damage lie deeper within the workings. Frantic research and the laptop battery was removed and all placed in a bag of brown rice in the airing cupboard for a few days.Meanwhile I have been loaned a laptop so I am back on-line.Then there is the sad news to share of Eva.I let the hens out as normal yesterday. We were out for a couple of hours but when I went to lock up the henhouse, whilst the other 3 were inside Eva seemed hesitant and was standing by the open door. I noticed some severe damage to her back - a definite attack. I don't think it was a fox as it would have either taken her away or savaged her. I have no idea where the attack took place. I know around 3pm I had fed the hens some noodles. Only 2 hens came when I called. Mabel was inside the hut laying an egg, Bev and Olwyn were eating the noodles but there was no sign of Eva - as is often the case.She managed to walk up the ramp to the sleeping area but I knew she would be attacked by the other hens - this is what they do when they sense weakness/injury and I knew it was a severe wound.I brought her into the kitchen and we settled her in a nice warm box.She passed away sometime between 4am and 6am as I was checking on  her.It is a comfort to know that when attacked she made her way home."},

A few weeks ago we were sitting in the snug when there was an almighty BANG from the kitchen, blowing the tripper switch in the fusebox. When we went into the kitchen there was a horrible smell coming from the laundry cupboard - from the washing machine. Jon asked me how old it was - by looking on my blog  Here I was able to tell him it was just under 3 years old. The problem was inside the motor - the commutator to be precise (Jon's analysis not mine!) Jon fixed it but it was a temporary measure. Whilst we paid £169 for the washer a new motor would be £120 but the motor was a cheap inferior one. Trouble with a motor malfunction is that it can cause a fire. We decided to look in the sales and go for a Hotpoint. We were pleased with £229 - a mere difference of around £60 but with 10 years parts warranty we felt this was a good buy. Jon is familiar with Hotpoint but let's hope it wont come to that.It is very quiet!ABC Wednesday - B for Bang!For more fun visit the ABC Blog - click on the link at the top of my sidebar."},

I gave one to a friend. The idea is to cook jacket potatoes. I didn't have great expectations but how wrong was I? Depending on the size and quantity of the potato(es) and a bit of experimenting perfect jacket potatoes are the result every time. At Christmas I experimented with some parsnips - cooking them in the bag for 5 minutes then putting them on a greased oventray(frylight) spraying with frylight and cooking for 20 minutes - they were awesome. Even Jon said they were the best he has ever tasted. Last night I washed and peeled a large potato - cut into chunky chip sizes - popped in bag in  microwave for 5 minutes - then put them on a greased oventray(frylight) spraying with frylight and cooking for 20 minutes- result - best chips I have ever tasted.Crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle - just like my mum use to make.  The bag can be washed and is ready to go!Good news - I have found an online bargain!

Bing is currently under strict orders from the vet, to take it easy. This is due to an incident on Boxing Day. We were on the beach and Bing was doing what he does best, chasing after his favourite ball. He was so focussed on the ball he collided with a little whippet. The clash sent him to the ground with screams of pain. He got up and walked okay but in the following days he would yelp if he moved his leg in a certain way. We took him to the vet and after a thorough examination was prescribed anti-inflammatory tablets. These finish today but tomorrow will be gentle walk - just round the garden....slowly building up to longer walks.I have been taking Sadie to the beach but following last night's snow I decided to take her up Handale Lane...she loved it."},
{"title": "The Archers", "date": "Tuesday, January 13", "text": "I've been quite busy of late, what with this that and the other but before we know it, ABC Wednesday is back for another round....16 would you believe. Basically a group of us post a weekly contribution with a particular letter of the alphabet. The group is scattered all over the globe and has been going for 8 years. I am humbled to think I started it off all those years ago and it is still going strong to this day, now with Roger  at the helm and a great team. myself just being part of the team.  Friendships have come about this project as well as visits and meet ups. I sometimes have a theme for each round - last round was based on my garden this round however I am just going to see what pops up!A then has to be The Archers. I listen to this programme every day. We don't watch any soaps on TV, this is the nearest to it I suspect. We live in a farming community and I can identify with some of the issues. I listen to Radio 4 most of the time - I don't  like a quiet house and some music stations have a lot of adverts between the songs. Definitely a Radio 4 fan and most certainly an Archer's fan!This is how the BBC introduce the programme.You must enable JavaScript to play contentFirst of all, what exactly is The Archers? Well, it's a radio soap opera set in the fictional English village of Ambridge. It aims to provide essential drama from the heart of the country.So what does that mean you'll be hearing? Ambridge is a twenty-first century village, with all the pressures of modern rural life. You'll become involved in the characters' personal and business struggles, their love affairs and all sorts of village activities from saving the local shop to the annual fete. There are plenty of lighter moments too.These characters then... Several of the main families are farmers. At the heart of the programme are David and Ruth Archer at Brookfield Farm. David once had cause to regret employing a handsome cowman, but they're pretty stable nowadays.Their cousins Pat and Tony Archer farm organically at Bridge Farm. That's a dairy farm as well, but they also keep pigs and grow vegetables. They sell their own yogurt, ice cream and cheese.At the opposite end of the farming scale are well-off Brian and Jennifer Aldridge at Home Farm, which is the biggest in the village. That little boy who lives there is Brian's son from a torrid affair. When his mistress died, amazing Jennifer agreed to take Ruairi in.The Archer family is related to the Aldridges, and to several other Ambridge families, including the Hebden Lloyds - she runs a riding school and he's a vet.If that all sounds a bit posh, there are lots of less well-off characters too. Most of them live and work in and around Ambridge - on the farms, in the local pub The Bull, at the village shop, at Grey Gables hotel or St Stephen's church.Those sons of the soil the Grundys are particularly good value, both for the scrapes they get in and the fact that Emma Grundy isn't Ed's wife, as you might think, but the ex-wife of Ed's brother Will.You can look up all the current characters in the Who's Who section of the Archers website.By now, I expect you're keen to know how you can hear the programme, and it's very easy to start, because the episodes are only thirteen minutes long. They're broadcast on BBC Radio Four every day, Sunday to Friday at seven p.m. And they're repeated the next day at two p.m. - except on Saturdays.Or if you want to catch a whole week's worth in one go, there's an omnibus edition, on Sunday morning at ten a.m.Over on Facebook there are a few Archer's groups, I am a moderator  of the Ambridge Addicts Group. We discuss current story lines etc. and all in all often the drama far surpasses anything which occurs in the programme."},

Whilst I love vegetables sometimes if I fancy a few together it can be a bit of a faff on - so when I heard about a \"Singing Turnip\" recipe at Slimming world I had to give it a go. Place turnip in microwave - full power for 15 - 20 minutes, turning once.

{"title": "Sewing for England", "date": "Tuesday, November 18", "text": "My neighbour Anne is my curtain guru. Whilst she has been away for a few days I decided to embark on the task of altering the new curtains for our bedroom. ...... there was a hitch! I cut too much off and had to join up the curtain length with a seam. I did that and am now hemming both curtains. All the time I was going through the various actions  it would seem there was an alternative......to remove the rufflette  tape and cut from the top - thus saving the bother of re-hemming. This was pointed out to me by a friend as I pinned the hem. I was informed that the hem will never be as good as the original one.Well hindsight is a marvellous thing but in one way I have enjoyed the whole process of re-stitching, pinning, bleeding and altering the curtains. Today the wardrobe arrives - sometime between 12 noon and 6pm. I will receive a phone call when the delivery van is approximately 1 hour away.

It has been a garden ornament for 20 years but Jon restored it for me....he made a new roller and a new handle, stripped all the metal parts and sharpened the blades. It cuts perfectly!The lawn is Jon's domain and loves nothing more than to sit on his lawnmower and spend a couple of hours getting the perfect cut - but for small area, or round trees this is perfect. It is a Ransom Henley model.The weather is very changeable at the moment - I do have more bulbs to plant which I need to do as soon as possible. The carpet fitter is coming tomorrow so I will shortly be able to get the room sorted. The wardrobe arrives next week so we'll be assembling it from the flat pack state it arrives in and organising the space. I am really pleased with the washstand - it has been just an ornamental piece for years, but it is an ideal height for my sewing machine and for working on my laptop -getting rid of the 2 desks was a worry as I thought I may have to use the dining table for any projects - but no worries there, the second bedroom will be the ideal place.Thursday is a day I have set aside to get our bedroom back to normal - with the addition of the new curtains and bedding. I did have a blonde moment involving the curtains. Don't ask me how it happened all I know is I cut the curtains......too short! After a massive panic I attached the various pieces, pinned, tacked and machine sewed them all together...now I just have to hem them - my next job after getting the room emptied for tomorrow.Watch this space!"},

We had a dado rail fitted but to be honest we didn't get the height correct.Our house was built in 1956, an ex-Police house. The 50's doors were replaced with your average colonial doors still popular today. Last year all the doors were revamped by re-positioning the handles and door furniture. They were also painted white.BeforeAfterLanding before.....and after.....the door to the left of the photo is the second bedroom. Door to the right is 3rd bedroom, Jon uses this as his office/study.....next to be tackled.I must admit I look at any doors now as I feel with such a design the handles have to be in this position. Strictly speaking the dado rail should be around the same height as the handle and ours are too high. If they had been in the correct position we may have considered keeping it, but the room needs re-plastering so we are removing it and going for the same style we have through the rooms we have revamped.The wallpaper has certainly aged - stains have started coming through from the original wallpaper paste but 20 odd years is good going. Yesterday I was looking at wardrobes and measuring up - hence the various scribbles on the wallpaper so I could envisage where the wardrobe would fit.In the end I went with this one from Argos. The dimensions are Height 2060mm Width 1490mm and Depth 580mm.  Reduced too to £183.99 - Delivered Tuesday November 18th.  I want the room to be clutter-free because after all the view is what it's all about!"},

I have lost count of the exact number of bulbs I have actually planted as I clear out old grass and squeeze a few bulbs in at each opportunity. Often a session sees me plant anything up to 50 at a time. I have done the sessions in a slightly erratic fashion - initially starting by the gate nearest to the house, then the end nearest to my neighbour as Emma was in the garden and we were chatting, then I tackled the middle of the space as I had a different selection of tulips and so my reasoning continues in a hap hazard fashion such I put down to the Mrs Nesbitt approach! I am planting a selection of bulbs, mainly Narcissus, tulips, grape hyacinth and blue bells. It is very addictive and due to the wonderful tool called the internet I can source sound suppliers, indeed as I write I have 250 bluebells on route. I also have about 230 tulips, 130 mixed narcissus to keep them company!I spent most of Saturday planting, Sunday was a lovely day so we had a tootle over to Scarborough on the motorbike. Whilst I wore my leathers I was well wrapped up with my fleece tights courtesy of Asda.To think that only last weekend when I was planting away I was wearing my shorts! The sudden change in temperature saw me scrambling for suitable clothing at the drop of a hat - but I think I am sorted now. Warm jumpers seem to be on the cards now.When the days are wet (like today) I continue with the clearing of the second bedroom ready for the plasterer coming on 27th. I plan to clear the room by Friday 24th leaving me Saturday and Sunday to strip the wallpaper. When I read that last sentence I try not to feel a hint of panic if I stick to my guns I should be on plan as I know next week is busy but I'll carry on. I have decided on the colour anyway - sticking to the Farrow & Ball colour scheme I am going for Tunsgate Green as I want to keep the room light.

Today however the weather is cooler and whilst we are expecting it to be sunny later at least it gives me time to catch up on what's been happening.In our back garden we have a shrubbery which we have added to since moving here. It's home to an old crab apple tree and various shrubs, roses and flowers. I am looking at changing this somewhat, but at the moment it's okay...ish.  One of my favourite shrubs is the Hydrangea - the large established one on the right was here when we moved in. These two new mopcap ones were a bargain at £7.50 each at B&Q. Like many garden centres bargains are in abundance right now - can't wait to see them develop over the next few years.Beyond the shrubbery.......Down the stone path between the laburnum tree and raised shrub bed.....Is another large area of the garden - my favourite part to be honest. The established plum trees, originally part of the orchard on the village green  (where our house was eventually built) line the stream which runs through the bottom of our land. I have spent many days clearing, weeding and thinning out this area. Still a way to go but I must admit I do find weeding quite rewarding. Pulling the nettles - feeling the roots popping across the garden and eventually coming out in a huge clump! The stings are an added pleasure - NOT! It comes back to us not using any chemical weedkillers due to the hens. Whilst they are suitable to use where pets are brushing amongst them - it is quite a different matter when the hens EAT the weeds etc, digest them and then produce eggs which we eat. To prove my point - along came Bev to find some grubs for a quick snack!In the background is another area of weeds which I am working on - this is the bottom area of the paddock and whilst it is on a slope we need to have it cleared. There is also another dry stone wall. Again this was overgrown when we moved here and I spent one summer digging out the huge clumps of grass and earth.  As I was weeding away I could hear a scratting sound - looking through the greenery I saw Eva enjoying a paddle in the stream, catching treats from the surface of the water. Wherever I work in the garden a HEN always seems to be close by!   So onwards and upwards...lots to be getting on with.Week H in my garden challenge - I am getting there!"},

This is an area the hens love to scrat about in, often flicking the gravel under the garage , making it difficult to open the doors, this should stop this. I think it finishes the wall well and as moss grows over the pebbles by this time next year things should look even better.This is the part of the drive I have to finish.Of course I was being watched by Eva who had nipped through the fence for her morning walk!Sadie checks over a geranium for the photograph!Thank you Sadie - beautiful.Back to the GRINDSTONE for me!

{"title": "F is for Front Garden/lawn", "date": "Tuesday, August 19", "text": "The front part of our garden is my next task! On Sunday after asking questions and reading up on the matter it became apparent that our ornamental cherry tree is dead. I can't remember if there were any leaves on it last year, but there aren't any this year and the branches keep snapping off in the wind. The blue tits nest here every year so we'll have to think of something to replace it. The lifespan of such a tree would appear to be between 20 and 25 years. I have seen 1950's photographs of the front garden and bold as brass is a young ornamental cherry tree - so I think it has done well. Jon will be dealing with it - logs etc but we need to think about the blue tits.   Looking out from the kitchen window in the middle of the front hedge is where the original gate was to the house. Our house is an ex-police house so the gate would lead visitors to the police office situated at the back of the house - now part of our lounge.    We had the turf laid to make it more lawn mower friendly. Jon made the bird bath for mum. This area is now one I am making into a little piece of paradise for bird visitors. We aren't sure what the \"trees\" are but they are an ideal place to hang feeders etc. Notice Eva making an appearance!   The pond at the far right of the photograph is a project all to itself. Originally we had it built for the geese. It's a sloping gradient to a depth of about 50cm. I have been doing my research about ponds and thanks to an Alan Titmarsh programme I found out we don't need a pump, self oxygenating plants will keep the water clear and we will add various plants. I am experimenting with a small pond idea in a little barrel. All seem to be getting along fine. I'll keep a close look out and if all continues well we will use these plants in the large pond.    In front of the bird interest area is the area where the gate was and this is what I want to transform.﻿ The borders want sorting too - I am going to be very busy. ﻿  To the left of the area is a holly \"tree\". It was the same height as the hedge some 23 years ago but as the birds love it so much we have allowed it to grow. ﻿ I am not sure how long this is going to take me - but I am on the case. Being realistic I may have something to share by the letter L...could be \"L for Look at this then!\" Watch this space!My F take on the ABC of the Nesbitt garden projects!"},

{"title": "The duty of a responsible pet owner", "date": "Monday, July 21", "text": "Ella's health has deteriorated rapidly since I took these photographs a week ago. We must remember Ella is at least 20, possible older than 25. We adopted Ella from a rescue centre and when we got her she was not young.About 2 years ago we discovered a cyst, which we promptly had drained. The vet explained there was nothing sinister about it, just a build up of fluid. The cyst gradually returned the same time that Ella was due her annual vaccination ready for her spell at the cattery coinciding with our annual holiday. The vet explained that the effect of the  drugs used for her vaccination would be affected if the cyst was drained and recommended we leave the cyst as it was not suspect. We did this.I must explain at this point that Ella absolutely hates car journeys of any description so we minimise any unnecessary distress - just the one journey a year to the cattery when we go away. This year however a neighbour looked after Ella whilst we were away. The journey to Margaret's house was a matter of a couple of minutes....no cat transporter, just a blanket on my knee. Ella had a lovely time with Margaret who fussed her and as she said \"Gave her some love.\" Ella had developed a few more lumps, found grooming difficult and was sleeping more and more. I didn't want to distress her by taking her to the vet. She was of a very good age and any treatment would probably finish her off, the car journey alone would be a nightmare for her.Over recent weeks Ella has slept even  more. For the past couple of days she has not eaten anything, the last she ate was on Friday when I cooked her some liver, she enjoyed it so much. She has slept ever since.This morning she left her bed and went outside. After a few minutes in the sunshine she returned and drank a fair amount of water. She then made her way to her bed where she sleeps. The way she sleeps indicates she is in pain, I suspect kidney issues, possible tumours and some dementia.She just wants to sleep.I made the phone call to the vet this morning and now I await his call. He will call when he is on his way, Jon will come home and we will ensure Ella has no more pain and distress."},

It is comforting to know there are others who understand.Last Friday whilstout shopping I noticed a noise coming from the front of my car - a sort of mechanical noise. To cut a long story short - it was the clutch. The car is now at the garage awaiting a day on the ramp to discover the nature and subsequent fixing of the problem. The outcome of this means I am without transport as we have no bus service in our village. Jon uses the van for the businessand whilst my neighbours would not see me stuck I am making the most of the situation. The dogs have not missed their beach fun as we have been taking them in the van. My shopping routine has changed and I made a weekly visit rather than daily top ups and will do an online shop for delivery later this week.Today the weather has cooled down, so I decided to take 20 photos around the garden of jobs I need to do over the next few days. No pressure on myself whatsoever - I will tackle as I go along, but I thought this would be a good way to organise my tasks. So here are the befores.......watch this space for the afters."},

Over the past weeks this has been the case.The change in the weather means I have been able to do more in the garden, a great place to be.We have a very large garden which to be honest leaves me feeling rather helpless as there is always a job which needs to be done. Jon's passion are the lawns and we do want to turf a few more areas so the task of mowing is easier.This is our back garden - the shrubbery recently weeded and awaiting turf.We have an ASSORTMENT of trees - scattered around the various areas which are as follows:- Front Ornamental Cherry Tree Hawthorne hedge Holly Tree Shrub area Ornamental Grass Lady's Mantle * Aquilegia * Hedge/Shielding at side of house Small boxptype shrub, very overgrown Elder tree x 2 Horsechestnut Tree Sycamore Tree Lilac In back garden 3 pine Trees Various conifers...dwarf??? 2 established older apple trees 1 younger apple tree (Discovery) Laburnum Tree Perimeter Hawthorne May Blossom?

A frothy haze of tiny, chartreuse yellow flowers appearing from June to September above softly hairy, rounded, pale green leaves, which catch water droplets like pearls. No garden should be without this charming perennial! Ideal for groundcover or edging paths, it tolerates a range of adverse conditions including heavy clay and, once established, is drought tolerant. Position: full sun or partial shade Soil: moist, humus-rich soil Rate of Growth: fast-growing Flowering period: June to September Flowers: greenish-yellow Other features: excellent cut flowers Hardiness: fully hardy Garden care: Cut back the faded flower heads and foliage in August and the plant will often produce a second flush of flowers. Alchemilla has a tendency to self-seed freely, so to minimise the spread of the plant remove the seedheads carefully after flowering.The garden is a great source of inspiration and I aim to have a sense of achievement as I make my way round the various jobs and tasks which need to be done......one step at a time.ABC Wednesday a new round."},

{"title": "Terrific Tomato Pasta.", "date": "Wednesday, May 28", "text": "We go to the Isle of Man on Friday for the TT Races, my ABC Wednesday contribution is a little late as we have been so busy, but as with all of my contributions for this round I wanted to share something that had been a success here in the Nesbitt household, cheap and something I would cook again.Planning meals is an essential part of my losing weight, together with regular exercise and a healthier lifestyle. I walk the dogs every day, attend a Zumba fitness class once a week as well as a total toning session. This is a manageable activity programme for me. I enjoy the beach walk - every morning, it sets me up for the day. A group of us are there, everyday and whilst the dogs play, run and exercise together, we pass the time chatting and walking - discussing everything from The Archers, Menus, the price of potato crisps in Asda and what jobs are on the list today. I also enjoy my Zumba and Toning classes - simply because the instructor is an inspiration - hilarious yet the results happen.Often I plan my daily meals whilst out walking but there are times when I find myself unprepared or at a loose end as what to cook for dinner. These are dangerous times in a diet as becausesuch things happen when I am hungry it is so easy to reach for something which may be instant and filling but not a good choice for the diet. I have got a jacket potato down to 10 minutes in a microwave - 10 minutes is a good time to chop up a salad and get a decent filling together. Whilst this suits me Jon prefers a more substantial choice and that is where Bachelor's pasta Sauces come in! I can get a Bolognese from start to finish in a matter of 15 minutes. Basically I boil 3/4pt of water and pour over the sauce mix. Microwave for 15 mins. Meanwhils in a pan frylight onions, mince (optional) peppers, mushrooms, chopped celery and any other veg floating around. When pasta is cooked stir into pan and add lots more chopped tomato and spring onion. It makes TONS and is TERRIFIC so so so TASTY! Now frylight have a garlic seasoned spray I often spray some thinly sliced French bread with thefrylight and pop into the oven for a couple of minutes - sprinkle parmesan on for a kick!Sitting here writing this has made me so hungry - this is an ideal supper  for tonight - there will be enough for tomorrow night and it is an ideal way to use up anything lurking in the fridge!Tata for now!For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},

All ingredients were given a final stir then popped into a flan dish which I had sprayed with frylight. I sprinkled some parmesan on top and popped into the oven at 200 for 20 minutes. Awesomeness!

{"title": "R is for Rice Pudding - My version.", "date": "Monday, May 12", "text": "One thing which never ceases to amaze me at Slimming World is the originality and strangeness of some of the recipes. I wonder who on earth puts some of the ingredients together? I was experimenting with a Rice Pudding recipe - using cream soda. One of the gals had tried it out and thought it was too sweet and sickly - so I tried my own take on it, but using lemonade instead of cream soda. I didn't have any pudding rice so tried long grain rice. Basically I put some rice into a microwave dish and topped up with a can of diet lemonade. Microwaved on full power for 10 minutes and checked to see the lemonade had not dried up. I added another can and microwaved for a further 10 minutes then left to stand for 10 minutes then stirred in a tablespoon of crème fraiche. Tasted absolutely gorgeous. Comfort food in a matter of minutes. Tip - use a large microwave dish as the lemonade rises a lot!  This is my T contribution for ABC Wednesday - I am really enjoying this round."},

As we speak I have a quiche in the oven for my dinner tonight - ham, mushroom, sweetcorn, pepper and spring onion. On Monday I made the most of a cooked tuna steak and used that in a quiche, together with rocket, sweetcorn and red onion. Basic recipe is as follows:-1 carton fat free cottage cheese4 eggs - beaten.Basically mix together the cheese and eggs then add any vegetables of choice. If using frozen veg make sure it is defrosted and drained to remove the excess water. Add any other ingredients ie lean meat, chicken, tuna then put mixture into a flan dish that has been sprayed with frylight. Cook until \"set\" and golden brown. I LOVE quiche at room temperature, definitely not straight from the oven, however when desperately hungry I can manage it when hot. Serve with salad.

No appetite despite a dish of cat food which the dogs normally love. I took her in this morning for another scan and had to leave her so the vet could give her a good examination. The vet phoned me at lunch time to say the scan had shown a tumour and Freida's spleen would have to be removed. There was evidence it was on her kidneys too. There were options - 1. Operate and find the extent of the tumour. 2. Medication to ease the pain but leave the tumour to grow. Concerns - anaesthetic with Freida being old the vet was concerned about this as with a blood supply issues......Freida was asleep when the vet was talking to me, asleep and peaceful. \"Let her go.... she is at peace.\" Responsible pet ownership is hard - but when it comes to such moments the pet must come first.In her time with us Freida was devoted and faithful and had a great role in bringing up Bing.

{"title": "M is for Meat Free Mexican Chilli!", "date": "Sunday, April 6", "text": "﻿Like many others I try to be economic with the food shopping. I despise waste and love a bargain. As I have explained on endless occasions (just tell me to shut up about it :D) I attend Slimming World on a weekly basis to keep track of my weight. Whilst I am at target I still feel it essential to keep an eye on matters as we don't want any issues ballooning, ie me! From time to time we have a taster night where we all take along a dish for the supper table. The condition is that the food must be an appropriate choice, ie which ties in with the Slimming world regime. A few weeks ago on one such occasion I made a Meat free chilli - straight from a packet! Price of packet - 74p! It is totally syn free. I added extra vegetables it was definitely one of the favourites of the night!  ( Syns is shorthand for synergy – Slimming World believes it’s the synergy between the three components of the plan, ie. Free Foods, Healthy Extras and Syns, that makes Food Optimising effective at enabling weight loss. Nevertheless, many of the Syns are effectively what other diet plans would call treats. But Syns also includes foods found in the Healthy Extras, allowing you to eat bigger portions of these foods if you want them).﻿"},

{"title": "Indian Curries Take 2", "date": "Tuesday, March 11", "text": "For the letter I in my ABC Adventure I have got to ramble on about my favourite food - and that is Indian curries. We have an excellent restaurant in Guisborough which we have used for nearly 25 years, needless to say we are well known there both for takeaways and restaurant meals. I enjoy cooking curries for friends and family when we have occasions to celebrate or just a supper event as they can be prepared in advance allowing more time to spend around the table chatting.I have recently bought an electric spice grinder so as I await its delivery I have looked up some of our favourite curries and found a healthy version of the recipe. The family are coming round for Mother's Day on 30th March so I am going to prepare a selection in advance for the freezer, so on the day itself I will be able to spend time round the table and leave the curries in the heated trolley - a godsend on such an occasion!Balti is more a style of cooking than one particular curry. The word balti can be translated as \"bucket\" (i.e. a cooking pan) and some say the style of cooking is indigenous to an area of northern Pakistan known as Baltistan. A balti pan is basically a karahi which has the shape of a Chinese wok but with 2 small round handles on either side of the pan instead of one long handle. In specialist \"Balti Houses\" the balti is a meal in itself which contains both meat and vegetables and is eaten straight from the karahi using curled up pieces of nan bread. In standard Indian restaurants the balti is more of a stir-fried curry containing plenty of fried green peppers and fresh coriander  Medium hot.Ingredients:Serves: 41 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon ground turmeric 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon fenugreek leaves 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 2 teaspoons ground cumin1/2 teaspoon chili powder Frylghtl1 large onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped1 tablespoon ginger, minced 14 ouncetin of chopped tomatoes,1 cup water 1 teaspoon sea salt 3bay leaves1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom powder lemon, zest of 1/2 lemon, juice of 1Healthy Chicken Balti1 Measure out the 8 spices into a bowl (first 8 ingredients). Warm up a largeskillet or pot (ideally cast iron) and bring to med-high heat. Gently roast thespices in the dry skillet -- watching the mixture doesn't burn, keep stirring.After about a minute it will become fragrant and begin to get dark - take itoff the heat and pour back into the bowl - set aside.2 Put the skillet back on the heat, add frylight and bring back to medium highheat. Add in the chopped onion and cook through until translucent. Once theonion is cooked, add in the ginger and garlic and mix well - watching thegarlic doesn't burn. Next add the spice mixture back in, followed by the tinnedtomatoes.3 Mix in about 1 cup of water - you want a thick sauce, but not too paste-like.Add in the salt, bay leaves and cardamom seeds.4 Grate the zest off of the lemon, add to the pot, along with the juice from1/2 of the lemon. Save the other half for later, you may want to add more. Letit all simmer on medium-low.5 For a nice smooth sauce, remove the bay leaves and blend until smooth (animmersion blender works well).Bhuna is first and foremost a cooking process where spices are gentlyfried in plenty of oil to bring out their flavour. The dish \"bhuna\"is an extension of that process where meat is added to the spices and thencooked in its own juices which results in deep strong flavours but very littlesauce. The restaurant bhuna is a well spiced curry with a thick sauce. It isoften garnished with fried green peppers (bell peppers) and shredded onions. Usually medium hot .Ingredients2 large onions, sliced 600ml chicken stock  2 tsp turmeric 3 cardamom pods 1 x 2.5cm piece cinnamon stick 4 black peppercorns 4 cloves 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tbsp peeled and grated root ginger 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp mild chilli powder 3 garlic cloves, crushed 4 skinless and boneless chicken breasts, sliced  275ml fat free natural yogurt, bought to room temperature Salt 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves, to garnish Put the onion and 425ml of the chicken stock in a large, heavy-based saucepan. Cover the pan, bring to the boil and then boil for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat, uncover the pan and cook gently for 20 minutes, until the onion is tender, golden and syrupy.Add all the spices and garlic to the pan, and cook for 3-4 minutes. Then add the chicken and cook for a few minutes to coat in the spices, then stir in the remaining chicken stock. Cover the pan and simmer very gently over a medium heat for 20 minutes until the chicken is cooked.  Transfer the curry to a large serving bowl. Add 4 tbsp of the cooking sauce to the yogurt and stir well. Gradually add the yogurt into the curry, stirring continuously. Season to taste with salt, and serve immediately with boiled rice Biryani is not a curry at all but the curry connection comes from themixed vegetable curry with which it is served in most Indian restaurants. Biryani originated in Persiaand, at its simplest, was rice and meat baked together in the oven. The cooksto the Moghul emperors took the biryani and transformed it into a courtlydelicacy by adding aromatic spices and other exotic ingredients. Traditionally,biryanis are baked in the oven for some time so the aromatic spices and juicesfrom the meat permeate the rice. In the Indian restaurant, however, all thedishes are made to order and the poor chef has to find a way of preparing thebiryani in double quick time. So the restaurant biryani is often just pilaurice stir fried with chicken Mild.Vegetable BiryaniIngredients          Frylight1 small cauliflower, broken into     small florets2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and     cubed1 large onion, sliced1l hot vegetable stock3 tbsp hot curry powders (Madras is good)1 red chilli, seeded and finely     choppedlarge pinch of saffron strands2 tsp mustard seeds (black or white)500g basmati rice140g trimmed green beans, halved2 lemons, juice onlya handful of fresh coriander leavesPreheat     the oven to 220C/gas 7/fan 200C. frylight a large roasting tin or     ovenproof dish and put in the oven for a couple of minutes to heat     through. Add all the vegetables to the tin, except the beans, Season     with salt and pepper and return to the oven for 15 minutes until beginning     to brown. (Add some of the stock to prevent drying)While     the vegetables are roasting, stir together the stock, currypowders,     chilli, saffron and mustard seeds.Mix     the rice and green beans with the vegetables in the tin, then pour over     the stock mixture. Lower the oven to 190C/gas 5/fan 190C. Cover the dish     tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes until the rice is tender and the     liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the lemon juice and check the seasoning, serve.A famous Parsee dish. Interestingly the dhan part of the namemeans rice and a dhansak is traditionally served with a pulao of fried andspiced rice. An authentic dhansak will made with lamb and contain vegetablesand many different types of dhal (the sak in the name). The curry housedhansak is often referred to as \"hot, sweet and sour with lentils\".The \"hot\" is chilli powder, the \"sweet\" is sugar and the\"sour\" is lemon juice. Curry houses commonly use masoor dhal (splitred lentils) but some restaurants now use chana dhal to good effect. If it isdone well the dhansak is an excellent curry with contrasting flavours andtextures.Dhansak is a popular Indian curry made from meat and lentils, flavoured with spices including cumin and ginger. It is mild, sweet and rich with just enough heat to satisfy most tastes. And best of all it benefits from being made a day in advance as it tastes even better the next day. I like to serve this with Raita and Fresh Tomato Relish, as well as hard-boiled eggs, poppadoms, rice and, of course, mango chutney.SERVES 6 (Mary Berry's version)Frylight1kg (2lb 2oz) diced lamb (shoulder or leg, or a mixture)2 onions, diced 25g (1oz) fresh ginger root, peeled but left whole4 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped10 green cardamom pods1½ tablespoons ground cumin1½ tablespoons ground coriander½ tablespoon ground turmeric1 x 400g can chopped tomatoes200ml (7fl oz) beef stock75g (3oz) dried red lentils3 tablespoons clear honeysalt and freshly groundblack pepperPreheat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/Gas 2.Heat Frylight in a large frying pan.

Bring to the boil, then cover and place in the oven to simmer for 1-2 hours until tender. Check the seasoning and serve.The dopiaza is a classic Indian dish dating back at least to Moghultimes. The name dopiaza broadly translates as \"2 onions\" or\"double onions\". Some traditional versions of the dopiaza use twicethe weight of onions compared to the weight of meat but a classic Indiandopiaza is more likely to use the onions in 2 different ways, fried and boiled,at different stages of the cooking. The restaurant version has small friedpieces of onion in the sauce and then larger chunks of lightly cooked onion areadded towards the end of the cooking. Medium hot.Chicken DopiazaIngredients:1 kg chicken (with bones)3 tsps coriander seeds2 tsps cumin seeds3 large onions choppped fineFrylight2 tsps garam masala1/2 tsp turmeric powder2 tbsps garlic paste2 tbsps ginger paste2 large tomatoes chopped fineSalt to taste3 tbsps fresh, chopped coriander leavesPreparation:Heat a griddle or small, flat pan on a medium flame and gently roast the coriander and cumin seeds till aromatic.

Sauté until this batch of onions is soft and translucent - 3-5 minutes approximately.Add 1 1/2 cups of water, stir and bring to a boil.Reduce flame to a simmer and cook till the chicken is tender. This dish, when cooked, requires that the gravy only be enough to coat the chicken thickly. If it is not so, cook to reduce the gravy to required consistency.Garnish with coriander and serveJalfrezi is not a traditional Indian dish as such but, like the bhuna,is actually a method of cooking. It literally means \"hot-fry\" but isprobably better translated as \"stir-fry\". The term jalfrezi enteredthe English language at the time of the British Raj in India. Colonialhouseholds employed Indian cooks who would use the jalfrezi method of cookingto heat up cold roasted meat and potatoes. But the restaurant jalfrezi is not aversion of the Anglo-Indian dish. Oh no. The Indian restaurant chef uses thejalfrezi method to stir-fry green peppers, onions and plenty of green chilliesas the basis for a curry with just a little sauce. The chillies make thejalfrezi taste very fresh but also make it one of the hotter curries on therestaurant menu.   Chicken JalfreziServes 4Ready in about 45 minutesIngredients4 chicken breasts1 onion1 red and 1 yellow pepper2 garlic cloves1in piece fresh root gingerfry light1 tbsp medium curry powder1 tsp each of ground cumin and coriandersalt and freshly ground black peppera handful of fresh coriander400g can chopped tomatoes Place the chicken between sheets of clingfilm and flatten with a rolling pin. Remove the clingfilm, cut the chicken into strips and set aside. Prepare the other ingredients. Finely slice the onion, dessed and slice the peppers, crush the garlic and grate the ginger.Spray a pan with fry light and cook the onion, peppers, garlic and ginger for 6-8 minutes. Add the curry powder, ground cumin and coriander. Season and stir fry for 1-2 minutes.Throw in the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes. Roughly chop the coriander and stir into the pan along with the tomatoes and 100ml water. Cover and simer for 15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Serve. A traditional korma will have a long slow cooking. In fact, korma is notone particular dish but rather a method of cooking similar to braising. Becausekorma is a cooking method there are a wide variety of dishes that could bedescribed as \"korma\". Many kormas call for the meat to be marinatedin yoghurt and then the meat plus marinade are braised on a very low heat untilall the juices condense down into a thick sauce. The restaurant chef has tocook to order so doesn't have time for long, slow cooking. The korma you findin Indian restaurants usually contains ground almonds, coconut and thick cream.It is often described on restaurant menus as being \"very mild\" but agood korma should not be bland.  This is a diet-friendly chicken korma from the Slimming World book Curry Heaven which I adapted slightly. You need: 2 chicken breasts half an onion, diced Fry Light 1 bay leaf 1 cinnamon stick 1/2 tsp crushed cardamom seeds 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1/2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp mild curry powder 1/2 tsp ground ginger 1 clove garlic, crushed 200g tin chopped tomatoes 100ml chicken stock 3 tbsp. fat free natural yogurt Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and fry in Fry Light﻿ Remove from the pan when cooked, then fry the onion and garlic and add the spices; fry for a couple of seconds then pour in the stock.Add the bay leaf and cinnamon stick and tin of tomatoes and cook until reduced a littleReturn the chicken to the pan and stir in the yogurtServe with rice and vegetables. The curry house Madrasis a restaurant invention which started life as simply a hotted up version ofthe standard restaurant curry. Because it is a restaurant invention rather thana traditional recipe the Madrascan vary considerably from one restaurant to another. The restaurant Madras canbe hot or very hot, red or brown, a hotter version of a plain curry or quiterich in tomatoes. Mostly though it comes with plenty of sauce and is stronglyspiced . It is the standard restaurant hot curry.  Beef Madras 2. from SW Curry Heaven.Frylight1 onion chopped 4 cloves 6 cardamon pods 2 fresh chillies (I use Asda frozen) 1 tsp dried ginger 2 garlic cloves peeled and crushed (I use Asda frozen) 2 dried red chillies 1 tbspoon medium curry powder 9oog braising steak – all visible fat removed 2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground cumin 250ml beef stock Salt.

It wasoriginally a Kashmiri dish but is equally at home in the Punjab.An authentic rogan josh will be made with lamb and may, at its most elaborate,contain dozens of spices. The Kashmiri and Punjabi versions do differ (theKashmiri does not traditionally contain onions or garlic) but they are bothhighly spiced and share a deep red colour derived from the liberal use of driedred Kashmiri chillies. The curry house rogan is also red but the colour comesfrom red peppers and tomatoes rather than Kashmiri chillies. The restaurantrogan is characterised by its garnish of tomato pieces and fresh coriander. Itis usually medium hot. Lamb Rogan Gosh Ingredients 1 onion, peeled and chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped Frylight 1 tsp each of ground coriander, paprika, ground ginger and chilli powder 454g/1lb lamb steak, all visible fat removed and cut into bite-sized pieces (I used shoulder with all fat cut off) Approximately £8 in price 400g can chopped tomatoes 1 bay leaf 2 x 2.5cm/1in pieces of cinnamon stick 4 cardamom pods 3 cloves 198ml/7fl oz chicken stock 2 tsp artificial sweetener Method 1.

Stir in the chopped coriander and serve immediately. Chicken tikka masala is the all time most popular dish on the Indianrestaurant menu and what the restaurant diner really needs to know is whetherthe restaurant is providing a good example of the dish. And what is a goodexample? Well, the chicken tikka pieces should be aromatic and slightly smokyfrom the tandoor. The masala sauce should be well spiced but not hot, rich andcreamy and have a hint of coconut. Tikka masala usually has a deep red colour,gained from the use of artificial food colourings.   Chicken Tikka Masala Serves 4Ingredients500g boneless chicken (cut into cubes)1 tomato cubed1 onion cubed1 red bell pepper cubed1 green chilli diced2 tomatoes chopped1 cup fatfree yogurtChopped coriander leaves1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp. gingergarlic paste1 tsp red chilli powder1 tsp cumin seeds1/4 tsp turmeric1 tsp fenugreek leaves1 stick cinnamom3-4 cloves3-4 green cardamomsPinch of mace3-4 bayleaves1 tbsp chopped cashew nuts (add syns)1 tsp salt(to taste)Lime juice1 large finely chopped onion1 tbsp ex v olive oil (HE b choice) frylightMethodWash the chicken and cut into cube size pieces and set aside.

Take half the marination and in a separate bowl coat the vegetables (cubed onion, tomato, bellpeppers). Use the other half of the marination to coat the chicken.Soak some wooden skewers for 30 mins to avoid burning when ready for use. Prepare your chicken skewers using the chicken and vegetables, alternating.  Now spray a griddle pan (you can use a normal frying pan) with frylight, cook the skewers rotating to cook both sides.  Any extra vegetables can be placed on top of the skewers to cook alongside.

Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.The vindaloo was originally a Portuguese dish which took its name fromthe 2 main ingredients which were \"vinho\", wine/wine vinegar, and\"alhos\", garlic. Over time it was spiced up, hotted up and otherwisechanged by the indigenous peoples of the ex-Portuguese colony of Goa. Not many restaurants produce an authentic Goanvindaloo not least because the pork used by Christian Goans in their recipewould not be acceptable to Muslim chefs. In some restaurants the vindaloo isjust a pumped-up Madrasi.e. the same recipe but with lots more chilli powder. Other restaurants haveinterpreted the \"aloo\" part of the name as meaning potato andintroduced diced potato to a hot standard curry with added lemon juice fortartness and black pepper for extra pungency. Very hot.  A Chicken Vindaloo, doesn't have to always be blow your head off hot, you can control how much heat you like, by the amount of chilli you add. This recipe is syn free on extra easy.

Previously we had walked up the village lanes with my neighbour, but as the farms and stables became busier it was so much more practical to jump in the car and drive the 5 minute drive to the beach, where Bing had more space and freedom to burn off some of his energy. More importantly, it gave him the opportunity to mix with other dogs.Whilst there are a few dogs and owners who come down frequently two brothers, with their dogs go every day.Their dogs are Taz the little whippet,and Juno the large black Labrador.Since Julie we have met up each morning and the dogs really play well together. Paul and Al stay for about an hour and the dogs have a really good run around after each other, with other dogs and chase the balls.At Christmas we received cards from both of them and the dogs of course.Paul, Al and I have a chat about what we are doing later in the day and any plans for tea.

Basic good honest cooking....no spices, no curries as some don't like - a take on a shepherd's pie, but what a take! Absolutely delicious and healthy too, complying with the conditions I set myself and Jon had to like it and I can tell you he wolfed it down.Last Wednesday at Slimmingworld we were discussing meals we had enjoyed during the week. One of the gals, Carol had made this and her enthusiastic report made me want to try it asap - which I did on Friday. I hope my enthusiasm encourages others to give it a go - you will thank me for it I can tell you. Personally - this is the way forward for pies. Forget shepherds - give me cowboys!Cowboy Pie!

{"title": "B is for Beef Madras", "date": "Tuesday, January 21", "text": "This is one of my favourite recipe books. Last year, for Mother's Day I made a selection of curries for the family when Jon's mum came for the day. It was a great success - whilst I cooked quite a lot it meant I had sufficient to pack in the freezer for subsequent meals for Jon and I. At Christmas it came to light that it was one of the best meals our godson had tasted. He has his own flat now and enjoys experimenting in the kitchen, so last week for his birthday we bought him this book.The recipe I followed from the book was for Beef Madras :-Beef Madras2. Frylight1 onion chopped4 cloves 6 cardamon pods2 fresh chillies (I use Asda frozen)1 tsp dried ginger2 garlic cloves peeled and crushed (I use Asda frozen)2 dried red chillies1 tbspoon medium curry powder9oog braising steak – all visible fat removed2 tsp ground coriander1 tsp ground cumin250ml beef stockSalt.Chopped coriander to garnish (I use Asda frozen) Spray pan with frylight . Add the onions, cloves andcardamom pods. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes.Add the chillis, ginger, garlic and dried chillis andstirfry for a further 2 minutes.Add the curry powder and beef chunks and stirfry until meatis sealed.Add the ground coriander and cumin and stock.Transfer to oven and cook for a few hours OR transfer toslow cooker and cook all day.(I cooked it in the Rayburn - all day!)Serve with rice.We ate this on Sunday - it was hot.We had the remainder last night - as always it tasted even better.The recipe did not contain tomatoes and the liquid I felt was not enough.There are endless Beef Madras recipes out there which I have been reading, but yesterday whilst shopping I bought I am going to make a madras curry but will devise my own recipe. The Schwartz recipe contains vinegar - which Jon doesn't like so my recipe will be something like this:-900g braising steak - all visible fat removed.1/pint beef stock1 tin chopped tomatoesLots of onionsA couple of tablespoons of Schwartz madras powderOn Rayburn cook initially on hotplate then transfer to oven for rest of the day, checking and adding more liquid if required.Watch this space.I am enjoying my cookery adventure as part of my ABC Wednesday contribution, really making me branch out and experiment.For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},
{"title": "Crafty matters.", "date": "Saturday, January 18", "text": "I am full of good intentions.........so when I saw this new magazine I decided to take advantage of the introductory offer. I have a couple of sewing machines and thought this would be the gateway to great projects. After receiving 12 issues I decided to stop my subscription before the price rose....why you may ask? Because I hadn't opened the 12 issues I had received. So today I have opened them all and filed them away. Each issue contains instructions to:- 1. Make a square for a seaside themed quilt.2. Make a home themed object for the house.3. Make a gift.4. Recycle something into a gift/product.5.Sewing skills6.Stitch school7. Templates for the various projects. As I have 12 issues it would seem I have enough sewing projects to see me through the year. Full instructions come with each of the projects so we'll see how I manage.  I also received various tools of the trade to help me along. The scissors I will keep for my sewing projects - all too often they end up in the general kitchen tat drawer never to be seen again!I have a lovely sewing box my sister in law bought me years ago - I will dig it out and organise everything.We wont be doing any further house decorating until after February as we have our holiday to pay for which will use a fair amount of our hard earned money - we only have two bedrooms to decorate which is quite a small project compared to some of the work we have done over the past couple of years. However I am going to beaver away with the de-cluttering and organising of the books and craft materials.....I definitely have sufficient materials to keep me going for the next year so I am setting myself a target of using everything in the house rather than buy anything new....so I am organising for Britain! I feel copious lists coming on!I was lucky enough to win this book, kindly donated by Maria It is absolutely bursting with ideas which I am going to try. Again, making full use of what we have in the house......and that's quite a lot of stuff!I am not one for making New Year promises but as the month is panning out I have my cookery challenge and now my organising project to keep me busy - ideal tasks for a wet day....oh and did I mention I have enrolled on a pottery class?

{"title": "A is for Adventure.....Cooking Adventure.", "date": "Tuesday, January 14", "text": "ABC Wednesday - Round 14, how time has flown. For this round I am going on an adventure - A cooking adventure. Each week I will cook a recipe I have never cooked before. Conditions of the recipe must be no fancy ingredients I have to travel the globe for, must be healthy and tie in with my Slimming World programme, be the time of food both Jon and I like ie not arty farty and I must have the recipe in my collection of recipe books/slimmingworld magazines.Over on facebook my longtime blogging pal Crystal Jigsaw has started a new group. A small, friendly group where we share what we're having for tea (or lunch, brunch, breakfast, supper, and those snacks in between). Lighthearted, fun, informal and a place to dip in and out of whenever the mood takes us. Share recipes and suggestions, tips and advice, but strictly no lecturing on what's good for you and what's not. So I have decided to link all together - everybody is welcome.I will also have an independent reviewer - my neighbour Emma. I always pop in to her house when she's at work and let the dogs out for a run and leave her light on as it's dark when she gets in from work - so I will have her tea ready now each Tuesday night.To kick start the first week then it is A for Analucian meatballs. I looked through a few of my recipe books and whilst there was countless renditions of Avocado(very high in calories) and  Aubergine recipes(Jon doesn't like it)  I found this recipe in the August/September issue of Slimmingworld magazine.Analucian meatballs  600g pork mincesmall handful fresh coriander finely chopped1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped, salt and freshly ground black pepper, frylight, small handful fresh flat leaf parsley finely chopped for garnish. Note - M&S spice jars are big enough to fit a teaspoon inside to ensure accurate measurement of spices.Put all except parsley in bowl, season and mix with fingers until well combined. chill for 1 hour. Roll into bite size balls and put in frying pan sprayed with fry light over medium heat and stir fry for 6-8 mins until browned all over and cooked through, I cooked off a sample and it tasted very nicely spiced.  Whilst the recipe says to serve with tomato sauce. (Tomato Sauce = 400g passata, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 2 tblsp tomato puree and 1 deseeded finely chopped red pepper, place in pan and bring to boil, reduce heat to low and cook 12-15mins or until pepper has softened.  Whizz until smooth and serve with fresh parsley.)I will be serving mine with this with lots of extra vegetables.So, A in my great Adventure is Analucian meatballs. Next week it may well be Baked sardines with potatoes!Watch this space.To join in the ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar and if you feel like sharing our fun group on facebook follow the details from Crystal's blog."},

{"title": "Yule time - Family event 2.", "date": "Monday, December 30", "text": "Having had our Christmas Day at my sister in law's house it was my turn for a buffet. To be honest the buffet idea was my own suggestion as I didn't want to have a sit down meal after the lovely time spent on Christmas Day. Maureen had told me how stressed she had been about the whole Christmas Dinner as she has such a small kitchen (due to be revamped/extended in 2014) and felt it was her turn to do the dinner. Last year Maureen  had some family business to attend to following the death of her partner's mother resulting in them not being with our family on Christmas Day and Maureen had really missed our traditional get together hence her wanting us round at their house. A buffet sounds so innocently simple yet I could hear the stress in my voice every time I complained to long suffering Jon about the kitchen. At one point I apologised to him for being so unreasonable - it was all so disorganised for me, despite my lists and plans. Another reason for doing my own buffet was because I wanted to make sure the food was decent - ie alternatives to pastry and fatty foods which we tend to get if we buy prepared buffet food - no, mine would be healthy yet tasty.I made some potato sconeswhich I then filled with cream cheese and smoked salmon, quiche without pastry, good old egg sandwiches, pork sausages and scotch eggs. At one point I had thought about making something along the lines of an M&S product which was fish, on a potato  with mushy peas, but came to my senses when I pictured the obscurity of such an operation with an hour to go before the family arrived.Deserts - thank you Asda!Next get together is Friday - at the other Mrs Nesbitt's!Watch this space.For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},

Now the nights are drawing in I will endeavour to learn a few more skills and make use of my sewing machines.Watch this space!"},

Our initial plans were to head towards Hull on Saturday - but as we headed over the moors it was clear we were heading in the wrong direction - it would seem the best weather was literally at home, so we turned round and stayed local.Sunday however was truly glorious. The forecast was excellent for the North East Coast, so we headed out and followed the coastline. We decided to venture further than Bridlington which we find too commercial. Jo, had written about a little adventure hereso we decided to head for Fraisthorpe. As soon as we pulled in I realised we had been before....so after a quick toilet visit we headed further North and as we were tootling along we passed a sign \"To the sea front\" so we followed the road and came to a lovely little gem - will definitely be a picnic stop on future expeditions. Willsthorpe.       Back on the motorbike we headed towards Hornsea and had an ice-cream. The views were wonderful.      ﻿WE had wanted to go further but time was pressing on so we headed home via Scarborough.A wonderful afternoon - we will go there again and head towards Withernsea.For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},
{"title": "Comfort food : Rice Pudding.", "date": "Thursday, September 19", "text": "One thing which never ceases to amaze me at Slimming World is the originality and strangeness of some of the recipes. I wonder who on earth puts some of the ingredients together.....so I was experimenting with a Rice Pudding recipe - using cream soda! One of the gals had tried it out and thought it was too sweet and sickly - so I tried my own take on it, but using lemonade instead of cream soda. I didn't have any pudding rice so tried long grain rice. Basically I put some rice into a microwave dish and topped up with a can of diet lemonade. Microwaved on full power for 10 minutes and checked to see the lemonade had not dried up. I added another can and microwaved for a further 10 minutes then left to stand for 10 minutes then stirred in a tablespoon of crème fraiche. Tasted absolutely gorgeous. Comfort food in a matter of minutes. Tip - use a large microwave dish as the lemonade rises a lot!"},

{"title": "Bet you can't read this without laughing!", "date": "Saturday, September 14", "text": "A few years ago an article appeared in the Independent...........I still laugh!When John and Denise Nesbitt moved to the North York Moors four years ago, they were ready for a rural life. They had even gathered a collection of geese, chickens and dogs. But what they hadn't expected was to be given custody of some rusty official Home Office apparatus under the stairs.  \"I thought they were having us on,\" says Denise as she recalls their move into what was once the village police house. \"The previous owners showed us around and then said, 'Oh, and by the way, you have to operate the nuclear warning'.\"With their move from Guisborough to Liverton, the Nesbitts had inherited new roles as United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Officers. In the event of a nuclear attack, it would be their job to warn the locals. Although in urban areas electrical signals attached to the town hall and fire or police station were the norm, in rural areas, emergency planning sometimes relied on the goodwill of ordinary villagers.\"It's ridiculous,\" says Denise. \"You think of all the billions of pounds the Government spends on nuclear warheads and defence, but when it comes to telling people about it, it's down to a housewife sitting in a cupboard under the stairs.\"A grey BT receiver box connected the Nesbitts' shoe cupboard direct to the Home Office, and a small one-way radio transmitted an intermittent beep showing that it was operational. Three times in one year, the Nesbitts received a letter giving them a week's notice before the 8pm evening drill. On these occasions, Denise, John and Tess, the border collie, were required to take their places under the stairs and tune in the radio to receive a very special announcement. Denise loses her Cleveland accent momentarily to impersonate: \"This is the Home Office Early Warning Test\".During the drill, the announcement would be followed by a number of test signals. \"Attack Warning Red\" was indicated by an unearthly warbling, while a high-pitched pip meant \"Fallout Warning Black\". \"Attack Message White\" signified all-clear.In the event of The Real Thing, the Attack Warning Red signal would be followed by an announcement instructing the Nesbitts to sound the alarm - a hand-cranked air-raid siren kept in a wooden crate in the outside toilet.John gives me a demonstration in the garden. It takes about 20 minutes of minor repairs and a can of WD40 before he's ready to sound the red alert (imminent danger of attack). Even so, he has yet to get the siren up on to the roof, as would have been standard procedure. Eventually, John is ready to follow the mildewed instructions for Red Warning, to be signalled by \"a rising and falling note lasting for one minute\".Today, the instructions read like a macabre Blue Peter \"how-to\" feature. But in an emergency? \"We wouldn't stand a chance,\" admits Denise. \"Given that you've got about three minutes to do the whole thing.\" \"Besides,\" adds John, \"the handle fell off after the first couple of weeks.\"When John reported the loose handle one December, a police officer called round to carry out an inspection. \"I told him he'd have to come back after Christmas,\" says Denise. \"I was using the crate to stand the tree on. The policeman just said 'OK', had a cup of tea, and went.\"Clearly the Home Office was confident that no self-respecting superpower would launch an attack during the festive season.In 1992, Kenneth Clark, then Home Secretary, wrote thanking Mr and Mrs Nesbitt for their participation but said that now the Cold War was over, please could he have his siren back? The Nesbitts simply locked the outside toilet and denied all knowledge. \"We didn't want to give it back, they were only going to dump it.\" Rather than allow a bizarre epoch of home front defence to fade into techno-oblivion, Denise resolved to act as its guardian.Although there is currently no threat of atomic attack, a new early warning system is being developed, as yet with no deadline for its installation. The scheme will make use exclusively of professional broadcasters, so there will no longer be a place in that flurry of technology for the great British amateur. But in the meantime, should anyone wish to update Dad's Army for the nuclear age, the Nesbitts would be happy to help write the scripts.Independent 2005   Copyright 1995 Newspaper Publishing PLC"},
{"title": "Mrs Nesbitt's Curry.", "date": "Friday, September 13", "text": "I have been experimenting in the kitchen and have come up with my own curry recipe.Depending on personal taste and level of heat liked 1 teaspoon of the following spices + 1 teaspoon of garam masala. From watching Rick Stein's curry expedition it would appear that different regions have their own versions of garam masala. I have my own version but I can't tell you what's in it.......not because it's a secret - I forget what's in it.... but it's yellow! A while ago I had a spice revamp/clear out and put all the various spices into one big jar! Mrs Nesbitt's own Garam Masala - I can never reproduce this to taste exactly the same - such is everyday life here in my kitchen!  Getting back to the plot - mix all spices together.Cut two chicken breasts into pieces and put to one side. (Away from Dog's noses!)In a pan cook through some chopped onion with  oil of choice. I use Frylight - or water.Add spices and water to reach a paste stage and add more water.Add garlic - again according to personal taste and who you are with - I use the prepared frozen cubes - so easy and convenient.Add diced chicken and cook through - usually 5 - 10 minutes.Stir in chopped veg of choice - I always have a bag of frozen chopped peppers in the freezer.Add Passata - until mixture is nice and thick and chicken and vegetables are covered. Crumble in a chicken stock cube.Simmer for 5 - 10 minutes until all veg is hot and mixture is thick. Add more water or passata if needed.Just before serving stir in a Mullerlight Coconut Yoghurt.It will look like this and taste amazing!I made this only a couple of nights ago and Jon said it was the best curry I had ever made, and it's all my own take on a curry.I served it with  rice."},

This piece of art is not just about Freddie Gilroy but represents all the normal people that were pulled out of an ordinary life and forced into a very extraordinary and dangerous one during the World Wars. Ray Lonsdale, sculptor from County Durham said:\"Scarborough is a unique town and I am pleased that my 'Freddie Gilroy and the Belsen Stragglers' will be on show there for residents and visitors alike to look at and enjoy. This piece is almost a war memorial as it depicts the lives of all those who suffered during the World Wars\".\"I hope that people get enjoyment from my sculptures but also reflect on the sensitivity and emotion which I have tried to convey through my work.\"The sculpture is located near to the Oasis Cafe on Scarborough's North Bay.Ray also has 'High Tide in Short Wellies' sculpture on the beach front near the Coble Landing in Filey and an exhibition in the Arts Bank at Saltburn-by the-Sea . As we headed over to Whitby from Scarborough there was a definite change in the weather and rather than turn right for Whitby we turned right for home. It was a race against the approaching rain but we arrived home just before the rain arrived.I think Summer is on the way out but what a wonderful few months we have had.The hens enjoying a dust bath yesterday."},

I phoned the fitter and left a message on the answer phone.The drops continued!When we arranged for the fitters to do the job one of the major reasons was that they would do everything. The last thing Jon wanted was to return home after a busy day at the workshop to face issues with the bathroom - and there he was on his hands and knees investigating the problem. After a while he identified the problem - the hot water tank had sprung a leak.  Just at that moment the fitter returned my call a  and spoke to Jon.  He came over straight away and he and Jon worked to secure the problem. It would seem that the tank had eroded over the years. We have been here for 22 years and it was here when we first arrived. When the chaps were working in the airing cupboard yesterday they inadvertently disturbed the pipework and lo and behold the tank sprung the leak. The tank was drained and the dripping stopped. We all felt it was a blessing in disguise - the leak would have happened sooner or later - so if it was going to happen it was best it happened when we had a house full of bathroom fitters rather than weeks or months down the line in our lovely new bathroom!I wasn't worried at all as I have full faith in the assurances we have received from the fitters - I have friends out there battling major health issues right now and would give their right arm to have a tank problem as their only worry. The new tank is being ordered as we speak and the chaps have gone to collect it. Yes its going to cost but a tank is a tank, we need a tank and we are getting a tank. A tank is a tank! We have a toilet but can't use it properly - so we use the neighbours and last night enjoyed a welcome bath there too. We only have tonight (Tuesday) to rough it - so we will pop next door again and look forward to a lovely bath in our new bathroom tomorrow night. Today I will use the neighbour's washer to deal with the huge pile of towels used in the mopping up process. Oh to have good neighbours eh? I text'd Emma this morning and arranged to use her washer after her load had finished - I will peg her washing out when I let her dogs out for a run round the garden in a little while.Meanwhile Bing had an exciting day on Saturday - strangely enough he digested the bathroom fitters catalogue!Oh and he nibbled his water bowl!Yes a fair share of excitement here in the Nesbitt household!For more ABC fun and frolics follow the link on my sidebar."},

We daren't let her out on the morning we take them to Scarborough in case she didn't return in time and this would have our plans out of the window. So - we pack the dogs, bedding, food then bring Ella's transport cage into the house and try to get her in with minimum fuss! (Easier said than done!) We then head out to Scarborough hoping....1. The road wont be too busy  2. We don't get stuck behind a slow moving vehicle...or 3.

Freida will have a rest from puppy rearing and a break from Elsie.We have taken them for their various boosters and kennel cough treatments at a cost of £94. The boarding fees alone will be approaching £350 so hopefully we may have a few pence left for the odd meal whilst we are away! lol!I was quite worried about taking Ella to the vets. She has a cyst which fills up with fluid on a regular basis. We take her to get it drained but it returns. She is well over 15 and we don't want to cause her any unnecessary stress...so when I discovered more lumps I was very concerned. The vet gave her a full examination and concluded that they were not causing Ella any pain or discomfort and it would be wise not to have them drained at the moment as the process would interfere with her immune system and the booster's impact would be decreased - so we will attend to this on our return.The hens will stay in the henhouse but will be let out and locked away at night by our neighbour.

{"title": "R is for Rearing a German Shepherd Puppy.", "date": "Monday, May 13", "text": "Bing is nearly 7 months old. We made the decision to get a puppy as we know Elsie and Freida are not getting any younger and would be able to help out with his upbringing. We wanted a puppy so we could have some input into his personal development. Neither of us have had a puppy before so it has been a learning process.Thanks to the internet there is a wealth of information out there so when I came across the following article by a leading dog breeder/psychologist it was of great interest. Raising a Confident Puppy     By Yuliya Matvyeyeva \" Different people have different needs and may look for different characteristics in a dog. However, everyone will agree that they want a confident German Shepherd Dog, a dog that will not hide behind the owner each time it comes across something new. A big portion of a dog’s confidence is genetic. There are dogs that are born to hide under the bed at the first sound of a thunderstorm. The only thing you can do to prevent this is to do your homework and get a dog from proven bloodlines. But even when you get a puppy from sound parents and bloodlines, it is your responsibility to raise your puppy in such a way that his confidence is developed to its full potential. Just assume it is a 50/50 situation - 50% of your puppy’s confidence comes from his genes, and 50% comes from the way you raise him.While proper socialization is the key, there are other necessities in order to help your German Shepherd puppy develop into a confident dog: respect your puppy’s social needs, avoid physical punishment, and protect your puppy from other dogs. The following guidelines for raising your German Shepherd puppy are very important- whether you are raising a future Schutzhund dog or a family pet.First of all, you should respect your puppy’s need for a secure nest. It should be the only place in the house that is “his.” It should be like a castle for your puppy. Puppy is first and foremost a pack animal, and in the pack, every dog, even the lowest in rank, will not be rudely bothered when it’s resting. For a healthy state of mind and some sense of security, every social creature needs to have a place where it can go and not be bothered, the place that is theirs. You should not brusquely pull your puppy out of his nest. If you need your puppy to leave the nest and come to you, use treats. Show a treat to your puppy, crouch down, clap your hands - he will gladly come to you. THEN, you can pick him up and do whatever you intended (after you give the treat). Never punish your puppy in any way, even verbally, when he is in his nest.I think we can tick that box!Another rule you should follow is to avoid physically punishing your German Shepherd puppy. In nature, young puppies are “untouchable.” They are not attacked or punished by the adult members of their pack. This is why you have probably seen a little pup fearlessly biting on the ankles of a huge adult dog, which will only try to evade, and never hurt the puppy. In this case, the puppy is not fearless, he just “knows,” due to his instincts, that he will NEVER be hurt by another pack member. And the adult dog is not helpless - it just CANNOT hurt the puppy (even though it probably wants to!). It doesn’t mean, however that the puppy should be allowed to do anything and never get corrected. There are certain situations, especially if you have a dominant puppy, when you should show that you are a leader who must be respected early on, but that is a different story. A puppy should never be physically punished for such mischief as chewed up shoes, digging holes in the yard or puddles on the floor. Bing pushes his luck with both Elsie and Freida but they keep him in order and all get along so well. The third rule that applies to all puppies, regardless of whether they are being raised as Schutzhund prospects or not, is that you should not allow other, especially older, dogs to bully your puppy. Often, a dog that has been attacked at a young age will grow to be dog aggressive. Sometimes just one incident is enough. The dog will then think that the best defense is to go on the offensive, and will show aggression towards any dog he meets. This problem is very difficult to fix. In nature, if a young puppy is attacked by a strange adult, this usually means the death of the puppy. This is a very traumatizing experience that may lead to a loss of self-confidence, and some puppies actually never get over it, even when they grow up. This is why it is extremely important to protect your German Shepherd puppy from such occurrences. The best thing to do is to avoid the company of adult dogs, that is - do not take your pup to dog parks, or to friends who have adult dogs (unless they are known for their absolute tolerance of puppies).  Remember, for your German Shepherd puppy you are the ultimate leader and it is up to you to provide the proper environment in which he can grow and reach his potential. Your kindness, patience, and lots of quality time spent with your puppy will help to establish a very strong bond which will make your life together more enjoyable for both of you.We are fortunate to have a secluded beach only a couple of miles away so Bing can enjoy real exciting adventures with Freida and Elsie.All in all - I think we are rearing Bing in a way that is making him a well balanced, happy, loving pup."},

Nevertheless still can see results.I find removing dandelion roots very therapeutic.Again still some finishing off but a big improvement.  The front lawn is looking much better - the prepared, dug over area in between Jon and Elsie will be turfed.  A good morning's work.....then the rain arrived.

{"title": "The Garden", "date": "Wednesday, May 8", "text": "We have been busy in the garden of late. Whilst we have managed to have a great weekend out tootling on the motorbike we have also put some hours into the garden. I have rambled on many occasions about how I often feel overawed by the sheer scale of the garden I have been looking through some previous projects we have undertaken and feel quite enlightened.  This was the dry stone wall many years ago. I spent an entire summer pulling out the grass and weeds.   Even then, although the succulents I planted brought lovely colours and interest to the wall, the surface area was a constant weeding project. The field on the other side of the fence is where the horses graze and pop their heads over...so we can not plant anything which could cause them harm.... So last year we did this.    Just spotted a weed below! Looking onto the front lawn the bulbs we planted are coming through - I can see a lawn edging afternoon is on the cards.Again here - the Euphorbia needs some tall flowers amongst the vivid greens.We have been busy clearing another area in the front lawn - this will be turfed with a small bulb interest around the base of the trees. We are not sure what the trees are but they are a popular spot for the bird food and are just opposite the snug window. At the side of the house, overlooking the paddock we have removed old shrubs and again this area will be turfed - linking the garden to the paddock. This is where we sit on an evening - a sun trap.At the bottom of the garden - an old tree root Jon winched out. The hedge has been cut back and will grow thicker.The hens love to roam freely - the pond is another project. Originally for the geese, now we have no geese we want to do some work on the pond area.The bonfire increases in size by the minute.This was the back shrubbery a couple of years ago...Now cleared and awaiting turf.Whist out on the motorbike we spotted this garden clock in a sale.....The area at the base of the cherry tree wants digging out again for bulb interest.So whilst I see there is lots to do I feel  more relaxed and organised when I see the progress we have made."},

We do chain him up when we are working in the garden - for the safety of the hens which seem to fascinate him - they are laying wonderful eggs at the moment, regular too, so we don't want any disturbances there thank you.Jon has been working really hard in the garden - pulling up old trees and pruning hedges and shrubs back. We are making changes to the garden - a wayward shrubbery has been pruned and more turf will be put down.....more turf = more mowing on the new mower!Freida is a great role model in the garden and Bing is happy to follow her example.It will be interesting to see how the garden develops over the next few weeks - it has been great to be outside, making the most of the good weather."},

As it wasn't so long ago we had a lovely Sunday Roast for Mother's Day I decided to do something different.I bought this book, a bargain at £4.99 and it is fantastic!Normally I follow my own recipe when making a curry but for once I am following the ingredients and method to the letter.The reason I am being so precise is because I have decided to have a theme of a \"Curry Festival\" or as I am calling it a \"Curry Fest\" so I want to cook a variety of curries - each with a distinct flavour. If I cooked a range of curries from my own recipe - which is basically shake a few jars into the pan/casserols - they would all taste the same. Yesterday I bought a few new jars of various spices and am now beavering away in the kitchen.Using crushed corriander I tossed some chunky carrots into a simple brown rice I had cooked - was lush. This was just an idea - nothing mentioned in the book.As we all have our own preferences regarding the heat of a curry I am making sure the curries vary too. Last night I experimented with the Lamb Rogan Gosh.  Note I didn't use lamb steaks as I wanted a slow cooked version (no hassle and all that!)SW Lamb Rogan GoshIngredients 1 onion, peeled and chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped Frylight 1 tsp each of ground coriander, paprika, ground ginger and chilli powder 454g/1lb lamb steak, all visible fat removed and cut into bite-sized pieces (I used shoulder with all fat cut off) Approximately £8 in price 400g can chopped tomatoes 1 bay leaf 2 x 2.5cm/1in pieces of cinnamon stick 4 cardamom pods 3 cloves 198ml/7fl oz chicken stock 2 tsp artificial sweetener Method 1. Fry the onion and garlic in frylight until soft. Add all the powdered spices and fry for 1 minute (add a little water if it gets too dry). 2. Add the lamb steak, tomatoes, bay leaf, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, stock and sweetener and simmer for 30-35 minutes until reduced. (or transfer to oven if using shoulder and cook for several hours) 3. Remove the bay leaf and cinnamon sticks. Stir in the chopped coriander and serve immediately.We tried this last night and it was beautiful.Looking in my freezer I discovered a packet of low far pork sausagemeat so I used it in place of the the turkey mince in another recipe from the book....Turkey Shami Kebabs 794g/1lb 12 oz lean minced turkey 1 small red onion, peeled and finely grated 1 tsp peeled and finely grated ginger 1tbsp medium curry powder 1tsp finely grated lime zest 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely choppped 3 tbsp chopped coriander 2 tbsp chopped mint 2 tbsp fat free natural yoghurt salt and freshly ground black pepper low calorie cooking spray red onion rings and lime wedges, to serve 1.

The people at Puppy Class have commented how quickly he is learning.Like many other dog lovers/owners we watched Crufts. The Agility Class is one of my favourites. It would seem that training can not commence until Bing is a year old as his muscles and bones need to be fully developed. At The Dog Club there is an Agility Section which I am hoping to join when Bing is old enough. We are going to build some low hurdles for him in the paddock so he gets the basic idea to jump. We will also look into buying a tunnel...again so he gets the idea he plays with it by running through it.This puppy was 6 months old when this video was taken............hmmmmmm watch this space!For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},
{"title": "Memories from my teenage years...1Books (1)", "date": "Monday, March 11", "text": "As a 14 year old this was one of the books I studied at school. I have no memories at all about the plot, characters or setting. All that I know is it was about aeroplane fatigue in the world of a quantum mechanics!How utterly inappropriate for a young teenager eh?A brief synopsis just goes to show what a ridiculous choice it was. Amazing I was not put off English Language for life!Plot summary The anti-hero of the story, Theodore Honey, is engaged in research on the fatigue of aluminium airframes. His current project, overseen by Dr. Dennis Scott, is to investigate possible failure in the high aspect ratio tailplane of a new airliner, the fictional Rutland Reindeer. Honey, a widower, in addition to his work, must bring up his young daughter, Elspeth. The events are narrated by Scott in the first person. Honey is unimpressive in appearance and is so intensely focused on his work that his relations with the outside world—never that good to begin with—suffer badly. Throughout the story, people judge him by that appearance, or by his varied and unconventional outside interests, such as pyramidology -- the study of possible esoteric interpretations of the Pyramids. Honey has predicted, by a (fictional) theory supposedly related to , that it is possible for an alloy structure to fail long before the design life customarily predicted by design standards. He is using a spare tailplane from a Reindeer aircraft in a fatigue test. Honey's theory predicts that the metal at the root of the tailplane will fatigue and fail with a crystalline fracture. For Honey this seems merely to be an esoteric and engaging problem in pure science; for Scott it is a concern of the first magnitude, as Reindeers are crossing the North Atlantic daily, carrying hundreds of passengers. Honey's prediction becomes all the more alarming when Scott links it with the recent crash of a Reindeer carrying the Soviet ambassador, which had total flying hours close to Honey's estimate, and which crashed in northeastern Quebec. The crash report, including photographs, is inconclusive, and Scott feels that the remains of the aircraft must be physically examined."},

Bing enjoys his drinking water and there is always a bowl handy in most rooms.One thing I must sort out is his car sickness. On both occasions of me taking him to puppy class he was sick in the car. I have a feeling it may be because he can't see out of the window and is generally disorientated by the motion of the moving car. On Sunday I had to go to Pets at Home to buy more food so I didn't give him any food until we returned. Whilst I heard him retching he wasn't actually sick....well at least not on the way there!He sort of had a look round the treat section!He knew which food he wanted however!Tomorrow is puppy class and our Nephew 1 is coming along, (to help rather than be trained lol) I am hoping if he holds Bing in the car it may help with the sickness - we will just see.

{"title": "The vending machine says NO!", "date": "Sunday, February 10", "text": "Yesterday we had a tootle over to B&Q Stockton. As previously mentioned the Nesbitt DIY project is back in fashion and Jon is refitting the fitted wardrobes. Obviously designed for the average 8 foot giant the top part left me straining on my tiptoes to hang anything on the rails or access the upper shelves. Jon has designed a shelving solution which will allow me to use all of the space.......tidy bedroom on the agenda!Saturday nights are one of our favourite nights of the week and we often have a special meal. Last night I was cooking Steak Diane and whilst I  didn't want to spoil my appetite,  when I spotted some of my favourite sweets in the vending machine I decided they would curb my hunger pang. Jon had wanted a bottle of juice his favourite being Orange Luckozade. Seeing the favoured juice in the vending machine I pressed the appropriate code only to be informed it was sold out. I was looking at a row of the favourite drink but each time I typed in the code the same message came onto the display. I did try to catch the machine out by random code pressing at different speeds but no joy. After a few minutes of frustration I went for a bottle of Oasis. Having sorted (sort of ) Jon's request for his second favourite choice of juice I moved to the next vending machine - sweets and sanacks.The sweets were 70p. I had used all my change on Jon's juice so asked the checkout assistant if he could change my coins. He pointed out he was not allowed to do this. I did point out it was rather silly to have a vending machine next to the checkouts if no change woukd be given. I rummaged through my pockets and managed to find 50p, 10p and 2 5p coins. Hurray!I put the coins in only to have the 5p coins rejected - several times despite the information clearly stating 5p coins were acceptable. I returned to helpful salesman of the year and asked him if he woulkd exchange 2 5p coins for a 10p coin, pointing out this was technically different from him giving me change for the vending machine.....I just wanted to minimise the amount of 5p coins in my purse. He did so and yes I did detect a smile brimming up on his little face.Returning to the vending machine I inserted the coin and pressed the appropriate code - I think it was D3. The machine whirred into action and my sweets moved forward.......and promptly stopped. Yes the machine was jammed. I had paid 70p and no sweeties.Returning to my new best friend it didn't surprise me when he said that the machines were nothing to do with B&Q but he would give the machine a slap. He did so - nothing. The machine was very heavy but he did do his best to resolve the situation and what a strong chappie he was too. Sadly to no avail. By this time we had struck up quite a rapor and we were both seeing the funny side of my predicament but as I explained to him it would appear that I was not meant to have the sweets and in any case I was on a diet.Returning to our van Jon drank his juice and we returned home where Jon carried on with the wardrobe project and later we had the Steak Diane and mighty fine it was too. He is continuing today and it looks as though my wardrobes will be fully fitted out later this afternoon. I can then lift all the clothes back in and being the sad blogger I am I will even take photographs and share here. The question is....should I organise the clothes according to their colour, material or type?Watch this space.....well the wardrobe space! lol!"},

I will be taking it back - I do have the website for the toys so may strike up a letter.Bing was absolutely fantastic on the lead. It helps that I walk with my neighbour who took Freida's lead.

{"title": "C is for Chewing.", "date": "Tuesday, January 29", "text": "What's it going to be a silicone cupcase, a bed or a chew.......a cupcase!When we decided to look for a German Shepherd puppy I did a considerable amount of background reading. Chewing is a major feature of the development of a puppy and should be encouraged. We bought a selection of various chewing toys and Bing uses them all. Ofcourse he has his favourites which, if left to his own devices would happily munch through my UGG boots, Jon's glasses, computer wires and coal! The minute we see him going for any of these we have a firm NO and immediately throw him one of his own proper chews. On a night time if we are in the snug we are constantly watching Bing to make sure he isn't chewing something he shouldn't be. We tried to ensure the house was puppy safe but I can assure you Bing will still route out something he fancies, all power for the course!Here he is enjoying one of the proper chews. After a good chewing session he sleeps for a couple of hours.....infact as I am typing his head is on my boots and I can hear him snoring. (I wont disturb him by videoing him yet again - he has had quite a video session so far and it is only 10.30am! lol!He continues to grow and by the end of the week he will be ready for his new collar. He has a Cage which he uses when he has his meals. This is for his own safety and convenience rather than anything else. One of the areas of conflict with any group of dogs occurs over food. He would quite happily walk away from his food and seek out either Freida's or Elsie's, so he eats his in his cage allowing Elsie and Freida time to eat theirs.If we have to leave him, be it just for a couple of hours we put him in his cage, but I put a variety of small snacks which he has to \"find\". This detracts him from the fact he has been left alone, but he still has the company of Freida or Elsie in the kitchen which must be a reassurance. He never soils his cage, again whilst we are toilet training him, and he is doing very well, we do not want to cause any set-backs. Whenever we return we immediately let him out into the garden so he can relieve himself.Other C's  he has to deal with are the chickens and the cat. Whilst he is allowed outside without his lead first thing on a morning, when the chickens are in the garden he wears his lead and I ensure he stays by my side. As for Ella the cat - Bing is on a steep learning curve. Ella stands her own ground and if he gets too close when he is barking at her out comes a warning paw! Ella however does not scratch him (yet) and seems to treat him with an understanding.

My car is going nowhere - whilst the roads are clear we fear for the snow drifts which can come from nowhere in no time at all and turn a perfectly visible road into an extension of the ditches which run so dangerously close by. The North York Moors are an incredible landscape and drifts are always to be considered when out driving. Jon's workshop is only a mile away so he has walked to work a couple of days and I as stated have stayed at home.   I do however pop into next door and see that Ted the Springer has some exercise along with his sister Gem.Our neighbour Emma works long hours at a local nursery so I always switch the heating on half an hour before she is due home and leave a light on. Much better than coming home to dark cold house.Emma's adjoing neighbour keeps ducks and geese so whilst Ted and Gem are having a run round it is also pleasant to watch the ducks in the stream.A few nights ago the weather was particularly bad and it took Jon several attempts to reverse the van up the drive. I had cooked a heartwarming casserole and the icing on the cake would have been a bottle of wine.....which we hadn't got........ a neighbour came over with a bottle of wine - so much appreciated after such a gruelling ordeal.Normally I go walking with another neighbour, Anne. Whilst Bing is now able to go outside for a walk, the mounting amounts of road grit and salt at the sides of the road deem it unfit and dangerous to do so. Ann and I keep in touch daily - so when she asked me if I wanted to go shopping in their 4x4 I jumped at the chance. We didn't hang around in Guisborough and on returning home Malcolm, Ann's husband collected Jon from the workshop at 4pm, saving him another walk home.Today, Jon managed to get to the workshop but the compound made it really difficult to manoevre the van. Jon parked up the van but needed help to get the snow dug out so he could reverse up to the doors in order to load some railway couplers which he needs to deliver asap. I turnrd to my mobile phone and contacted a couple of my pals from Slimming World who live near to Jon's workshop. Result - Claire's son Zak would help Jon out. Jon nipped home for another shovel and when he returned to the workshop Zak was waiting, with a shovel.Neighbours.......we are truly blessed!"},

We start puppy training on Wednesday afternoon. Should be fun.I must say how much easier the task of settling in a puppy with the aid of two older dogs has been. He needs to go out frequently for his twinkles and Freida always goes first, Bing follows and they go for a wander round the garden. He has settled well into his routine and as I type here he is laid on my slippers, snoozing away. He is fed 4 times a day, small portions of high protein puppy food, which ofcourse is 4 times the price of normal dog food but we took advice from the vet. Bing is gaining the necessary weight for his age, so this is good enough for us.He has his mad half hour then flings himself onto his bed and sleeps away for England.We bought him a good selection of chews and toys which he uses constantly. Amazingly we didn't buy one thing which he doesn't use, such is his disposition and zest for fun and contentment.We borrowed a large cage from our neighbour so if we go out, never longer than a few hours, he sleeps inside. When we first brought him home we took it in turns to sleep downstairs, in the snug which ajoins the kitchen. This was because he was paper trained and we didn't want him to have any accidents. Gradually the amount of times he needed to go outside decreased. Now we let him out last thing at night and he sleeps through until 7am when he needs to go outside, again with Freida or Elsie.We bring him upstairs for a couple of hours and he sleeps through to getting up.very pleased indeed.......his bed however (originally Ella's) will soon be too small for him!"},

As ever the receptionists made a big fuss about him, as did the vet!She examined him and informed us he had gained 3.5kg in two and a half weeks, which is good and also that both testicles had dropped!!!!!!!!!  He is on a special puppyfood which is specifically aimed at larger breeds. High protein for his growing bones.  He has two modes really - a mad half hour then sleep time!  He is growing by the minute. I can tell by the floor tiles. This was him today....﻿and the day he arrived   The Alsatian Dog comes from Germany and was bred originally for herding and guarding sheep. It's origins can be dated back to the 1700's. The Alsatian Dog is also known by the other names of the German Shepherd Dog and the Deutscher Schaferhund.The advent of the two World Wars influenced the history of this dog. The association with Germany was unpopular following the wars and the breed was therefore given the name of the Alsatian Wolf Dog after the German-French border area of Alsace-Lorraine. The term 'Wolf Dog' was then dropped as it was believed that this would also prove to be unpopular. Finally, in 1977, the breed name was changed back to the German Shepherd Dog. The word Alsatian is often mis-spelt as Alsation.The Alsatian Dog's coat is normally a shade of solid black, grey, tan, gold and white.The coat is normally medium, straight and hard. Bing is quite distinguished with his white paws and white mark on his nose.Dogs in the Herding Group ( sometimes referred to as the Pastoral Group ) include the Alsatian, were developed to perform a variety of tasks relating mainly to the herding of livestock. The types of livestock that these dogs are associated with are quite diverse and include sheep, cattle, reindeer and any other cloven footed animals. The Herding groups of dogs are eminently suited to these pastoral tasks as many of the breeds have a weatherproof double coat to protect them from the elements when working in severe weather conditions. Their natural abilities have been fully recognised and the initial livestock herding function have been extended to include police work and Search & Rescue amongst other duties.Bing has done lots of socialising in his 12 weeks. Next week he will start attending puppy socialisation and training classes.The chickens by the way have met Bing! We dont allow him free run without his lead as his curiosity may lead to a confrontation with Ernest who protects his gals.

Today, Sunday - a very cold day, ideal for such projects saw Jon working on our bedroom. Modifying the fitted wardrobes so we can optimise the space available.....so stuff needs to be moved...from room....to room......to room!Somwehere along the line everything seems to end up in one room...the spare bedroom.Being a brave type ( nay foolish) whilst Jon was working away (and when I wasn't fetching/carrying/locating the tool he had mislaid - there were several!) I took the brave move of opening the spare room door.Yes there is a fair amount of clearing out to be done......and it would seem I am on the case.Having thought about it for so long, once I started the rest seemed to fit into place.I have stashes/piles/heaps of projects and materials I have planned for........last year I started with all good intentions and sewing would seem to be the flavour of the month with me........    but being realistic I know I lose patience with such matters. My flair has been with papercrafts and my wedding stationery is what I really adore and enjoy - and achieve good results too. I have paints which I SHOULD use but never seem to do so. I always enjoyed art but never seem to explore this wonderful medium anymore. I read blogs of people's sewing projects and I always feel inadequate and as though they are part of a little part of paradise I will never discover. Yet I know there are other areas of creativity and art which can bring enjoyment and what is more important to me, contentment so I am going to stop beating myself with the stick of inadequacy and accept we are all good in different areas.I have stashes, piles nay HOARDS of materials well intended for greater things....I am going to spend time, as I sort, de-clutter and plan for the redecoration of the 3 bedrooms and new bathroom, organising the various treasures and then sell them at a craft fair.Today I have sorted 2 huge bags of tat and rubbish to go to the tip tomorrow.Yes DIY is back on track!Watch this space!"},

{"title": "Z is for Zygote.", "date": "Tuesday, January 8", "text": "My ABC based on the Nesbitt chickens has now reached Z.Some science is called for!In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's eggNext week ABC enters Round 12. My theme this time is Bing...watch this space!"},

It was a new purchase this year, our previous one was in a sad way and every year saw more branches take another bashing - it was over 20 years old too. As the lounge was decorated last year the previous colours of the tree - gold and red did not go with the new colours of Brassica and Hound Yellow see here so I bought some silver baubles and planned to buy some purple ones too, so was rather thrilled to find some reduced to 50p for a box of 12 in Homebase on Boxing Day! Whilst too late for this year they are now packed away for next year. Looking at the photograph of the lounge (link above) I definitely want some purple curtains for the winter months as the current ones would be such an uplifting change when Spring arrived.The Sales have been advertised everywhere and I am pleased to say I have bought a couple of Christmas presents for 2013 together with some Christmas Cards I saw which gave me an idea for the ones I am going to make in a couple of weeks. Watch this space.2013 is certainly going to be a busy year here in Nesbittland. We have our annual tootle over to Isle of Man for the TT at the end of May/first week of June where we celebrate both Jon's birthday and our wedding anniversary. It is our Silver Wedding this year and we are planning a rather spectacular bash for close friends and family, so I will be in my element sorting this out. We thought long and hard about going on a special holiday of some sort and decided on touring the wine regions of France. This should be a hoot!Bing continues to grow and develop into a fabulous little man. He has his second vaccination in just under 2 weeks, then after a week I will be taking him to puppy training classes. Both Elsie and Freida are helping him settle in. He has had a couple of warning nips from them both but they get along really well. He is absorbing information all the time, we are so pleased with him.His ears are creeping up!Watch this space!"},
{"title": "eXceptional Yokes!", "date": "Tuesday, January 1", "text": "I missed last weeks ABC round as I was ill, but fortunately I can cover 2 weeks in one go!Our hens are still not laying and whilst the day has been much better today ie no rain or snow the temperature was very low, infact one of the coldest days so far. The hens will not lay until they feel Spring is on its way and when they do start laying again my all time favourite will be boiled eggs. with soldiers!Have you ever had a hard boiled egg that had a green yolk or a yolk with a green to grey ring around it? Here's a look at the chemistry behind why this happens.....I remembered this when I looked it up. When I sat my O Level Domestic Science it was one of the questions. I answered well because I passed. The theory was much better than the practical which was a disaster - but I passed! Answer: The green ring forms when you overheat the egg, causing hydrogen and sulfur in the egg white to react and form hydrogen sulfide gas. The hydrogen sulfide reacts with iron in the egg yolk to form a grayish-green compound where the white and yolk meet. While the color isn't particularly appetizing, it's fine to eat. You can keep the yolk from turning green by chilling the eggs as soon as they have finished cooking. One way to do this is by running cold water over the hot eggs as soon as the cooking time has elapsed. For more ABC fun visit the link in my sidebar!"},

{"title": "The good, the bad and the indifferent.", "date": "Friday, December 21", "text": "GOODBing is settling in well. He is using the newspaper for his jobs, is getting along well with Elsie and Freida and his overall character is absolutely fantastic. He loves to sleep at our feet and is a lovely little soul to have round the place. He is fascinated by Ella and barks at her - but we are not worried as we know Ella will keep him in his place and remind him who is boss.Today (Friday) is his 8 week birthday. To celebrate we took him to the vet for his first injection and a dual flea/worm treatment. We received a puppy pack with a free sample of puppy food. We have always fed our dogs a mixture of wet and dry food but with Bing he will be on the Pro plan puppy food.We have introduced him to his cage - often he will go into it for a lie down. This will be for when we have to go out. We have not really been far since we brought him home as we wanted him to settle in - which he has done. We had thought he would cry a lot when he was first plucked from his original surroundings and his little family, but to our amazement he settled in straight away.BADI have managed to catch the flu and have been feeling dreadful for the best part of the week. Jobs which needed to be done have been half heartedly attempted and abandoned. Fortunately Jon is now on his Christmas break and is helping out. He just advised to leave until I feel better, good advice and I am following it. I do feel slightly better today, thanks to a dose of \"Day Nurse\" by taking it every 4 hours I know it will see me feeling better day by day.INDIFFERENTBecause I have felt dreadful I had a sense of indifference about certain little niceties associated with Christmas. Each year we have a village carol service in the village pub. This normally puts me in the Christmas mood and it gives me inspiration to do all the christmas preparations with enthusiasm, but I didn't go as my throat was very sore so I missed out on some Christmas spirit. Normally I make my own cards, but this year I could not summon up the enthusiasm or energy to do this normally cheering job. I know many people do start to make cards with plenty of time to spare but because I am not such a person I do mine in December. The long and short of it is I bought this years cards - again without any enthusiasm so when I come to write them out the task lacked any enjoyment because I didn't really like all of the cards, trouble with buying a mixed box I guess. So in January I will sit and make some cards! Infact I think January will be a very crafty month."},

{"title": "V is for Vegetables", "date": "Tuesday, December 11", "text": "I grow herbs, vegetables, fruit and flowers alongside my hens as season follows season. Vegetable-growing works well with hens. Think back to the Second World War, when many families grew veg and kept chickens. Nothing goes to waste as you can always feed surplus vegetables to chickens. You must plan where to grow your vegetables and how to protect seedlings, young plants and some vegetables if your hens are free-ranging. Netting is an option, as is a vegetable cage. Low fences are also an idea – you can get rolls of green, sturdy chicken wire 2ft high – hens can't really fly over these. They fly onto fences, such as post and rails, because they can perch on rails on their way, but they can't perch on chicken wire. Alternatively, you can use raised vegetable boxes, tunnels, cloches, containers or hanging baskets. Some people mulch around precious plants and seedlings with rough gravel, use crinkly lawn edging or twiggy sticks – all should prevent scratching feet. Another idea is to use an edging of box or rosemary but this would, obviously, take some time.To a large extent, what hens eat in a garden depends on how much grass they have access to. The more land they have to free range, the more likely they are to feast on weeds, wild herbs and grass and less likely to eat precious plants, flowers and herbs. I can't emphasise enough how important grass is – my sister in law bought two 20-week-old hybrids recently which had been kept in a barn and put them in a run with grass and they went crazy, pecking at it ferociously as though it would be taken away at any moment. If hens have only a little space to roam and a small area of grass and greenery they will soon eat all the grass and anything else green. It follows that if you keep your hens enclosed and let them out to free range every so often they will eat anything that's green, including vegetables, herbs, weeds, beech hedges and some of your flowers. Our hens won't touch snowdrops, crocuses, primroses, violas, buttercups, daffodils or tulips. Other flowers they shouldn't be interested in include lavender, roses, asters, camellias, dahlias, azaleas, hydrangeas, chrysanthemums and iris. Most evergreen shrubs, especially prickly ones, are unlikely to be eaten. Strong-smelling herbs such as rosemary, mint, lemon balm and feverfew are not attractive. Mine don't eat parsley or chives but I know of hens that do. Hens shouldn't touch carrots, parsnips, leeks, onions, potatoes, squash, pumpkins and courgettes. Climbing beans should be fine, once established, as they won't be able to reach most of them (protect seedlings). Hens love surplus sweetcorn. You could also grow sunflowers and feed them the seeds. Spinach, chard, kale, broccoli, cabbage and lettuce (except for spicy oriental leaves) will be popular; beetroot leaves are relished and my hens also eat beetroot and love Jerusalem artichokes, which I let them nibble on when I have a surplus. They shouldn't, however, eat the leaves, so this is a good vegetable to grow. On the berry front, hens love strawberries, raspberries and all edible berries except blackcurrants. I managed to video my hens stripping elderberry branches - a whole 16 seconds before my camera packed in!"},

The gals are cuddled together in a pile in an effort to keep warm. Ernest remains at the opposite end of the henhouse, next to the door. I was talking about this with my neighbour who explained that penguins also keep warm this way.“The emperor penguins secret is huddling. Really just an extension of the \"be big\" method of surviving extreme cold. Emperor penguins have developed a social behaviour that when it gets cold, they huddle together in groups that may comprise several thousand penguins. That way for most of the group, where their feathers end, instead of all of them having to face the biting wind and relentless cold, most of them have another warm penguin blanket to shield them instead. The surface area of the group is greatly reduced and a great deal of warmth and body fat conserved. Of course it's not quite so great for the individuals on the outside of the group as they only have a part of their body protected and warmed by the other penguins. So there is a continual movement of penguins from the outside of the group to the centre so displacing the warmer and more protected penguins to the outside where they will take their turn in the worst places against the wind and raw cold.”Fascinating!We learn something new every day!For more ABC astounding facts follow the link in my sidebar!"},

The torrential rain and flooding outside our front gate meant I did not let them out to scrat around as I normally do. When cars were passing our house yesterday huge waves of water were actually being caused and coming over the hedge where the hens like to search for grubs. I had visions of them being washed away!  I ensured they had plenty of dry sawdust and water inside their henhouse and at around 3pm I let them out to have a good feed. They are governed by the light – so once the day starts to draw in they make their way to bed.     Today however I let them out at 11.30am and it has been a joy watching them forage in the garden, drinking from the water pools left behind by the awful weather conditions we have had. They have had a great day and have had porridge, mixed corn and some vegetarian sausages so they have had lots of their favourite foods and around 4pm they will make their way home – where once again there is a fresh layer of shavings and sawdust on their perch.

Only yesterday when out shopping Jon picked out a cheese selection. Now I am aware of being in control of the shopping - it is indeed a rare occasion for Jon to come shopping - I prefer to go it alone - usually on a Friday with my MIL, the other Mrs Nesbitt. Even then we part company at the door, meeting by the car to load and return home. I know if I bring home tempting delights it will not do my diet any good and I am so close to target. Yesterday however I did feel sorry for Jon - bless - he has to eat what I bring home and so if he wanted a cheese selection then why not - he works hard enough. We brought home the selection.........It appeared in the snug at about 8pm and the blue cheese was lush! I limited myself to a very small amount and didn't make any trips to the fridge...so good.There had been talk in the slimming group about Laughing Cow's latest edition....but as ever a weekend scouring the local Tesco's was useless.

Whilst they are not practical for walking in the dirty weather we have I wear them constantly on all other occasions.

My MIL likes to give me money towards something she knows I really want....so when I came across this websiteI decided another pair would be ideal - but this time I would go for a leather upper rather than suede.Boots purchased online and I waited.But when the postman came knocking, he wasn’t armed withsheepskin-lined Sundance II boots in black, just an ominous-looking letter.‘Notice of Goods Detained,’ read the missive, bearing theUK Border Agency logo. ‘We have detained your parcel containing “UGG” bootsbecause we believe they are counterfeit, pirated or patent-infringing goods. Wehave contacted the owner of the Trade Mark, Copyright or Right Holder and askedthem to determine whether this is the case.’A second letter was enclosed in the same envelope, from Deckers, the ownersof the UGG brand. They’ve examined the boots, confirmed that they are fakes andnow plan to destroy them. ‘As the goods are counterfeit and were not purchased froma genuine UGG site we are not in a position to offer a refund,’ it concludes. I have contacted our bank and have filled in the necessary forms to get my money back. I have forwarded all e-mails to and from the company so now I am just waiting to see what happens!   Watch this space."},

{"title": "Overflowing - a hen drama!", "date": "Sunday, October 21", "text": "Every night I check on the hens to make sure they are all inside their hut before I lock the door and drop the hatch. Now the nights are drawing in they are usually all inside by 6pm. Ernest by the door with Mabel, Olwyn, Bev, Eva and May at the far end.On Thursday night however Ernest was on his own, Olwyn, Bev, Eva and May at the far end of their perch. Darkness was descending rather quickly for my liking so, armed with the torch I went in search of Mabel. Calling her name I was greeted by her squawk - obvious she was in some sort of distress. As I made my way to the bottom of the garden I could hear the sound of the stream. Normally this just trickles quite quietly through the village, but with all the rain it had overflowed and was quite dangerous to a hen. Still no sign of Mabel yet her cries were becoming more animated when I shouted her. I made my way round to the other side of the stream, via the neighbours garden. Shining my torch into the trees I was greeted by two large eyes peering through the branches. In her evening stroll Mabel must have been freaked by the sound of the water gushing through the garden and found safety in the tree. I returned home to collect Captain Marvel, (Jon) and the cat carrier. Jon scurried up the tree, torch in hand and grabbed a somewhat startled Mabel, put her in the cat carrier and we brought her home. Her clucking was quite loud and agitated but at least she was safe.We released her inside the henhouse and a few hours later I checked in on her and all was normal.  Ernest by the door with Mabel, Olwyn, Bev, Eva and May at the far end.                   Update - Thanks Glo for this wonderful inspired response!

{"title": "M is for Moulting.", "date": "Monday, October 8", "text": "Well there I was saying how lovely our hens eggs were when the production line stopped. One quick look inside the hen house determined why - they are moulting.Chickens moult for a number of reasons but the annual moult usually occurs in the autumn and is triggered by a decrease in daylight length (less feeding time thus reduced feed intake), combined with the end of an intense laying period.During the summer months the hens lost the smaller feathers closer to their body in an attempt to cool down. The larger feathers will usually have been developed in the previous moult and after a summer's use they begin to look rough and lose some of their colour. The shorter day length is a natural trigger to renew all their feather in preparation of colder times to come. In this way the moult is a way of conserving energy over the winter period that would otherwise be spent keeping warm.The renewal of feathers requires protein. It is not possible for the bird to assimilate enough protein to maintain egg production as well as renew feathers. With the onset of winter there would naturally be less food available to support chicks, so it is therefore a good time to close down egg production, renew feathers and build up body reserves for the following spring.Hens that have been laying heavily for 11 months will moult easily in the autumn since this is the natural moulting time. If they have had artificial lighting and finish their intensive laying period in the spring, they do not moult as easily and may carry on egg production until the following autumn...jury still out on the artificial lighting, but for now it will be vitamin supplements for the gals and lots of lovely food.Apparently dried cat food is good for them! Yes - it contains the essential amino acids required to keep the girls healthy - will have to give it a try!Watch this space!Update -This morning I mixed some dried cat food with the hen's porridge and corn. They enjoyed it - so much they stepped on their food dish and scattered everybody away a couple of times. Mabel (large dark brown one) showed she is moulting by the absence of  clumps of feathers."},

As the weather is colder I ensure they have a nice porridge mix, rice and corn to warm them up and keep them happy.  ﻿ Our hens continue to lay their eggs and whilst production may drop slightly, we should have sufficient for our breakfast. Eva was waiting to go inside and lay her egg.  ﻿Ernest was tootling about with Bev - so I knew who he was waiting for.......Mabel -here she was inside. My garden bucket is very attractive to the hens. They are attracted to the colour red. This is why so many of their feeders have red trays. ﻿Once Bev had done her work Eva popped in to do her bit for the Nesbitt breakfast table, as did the rest of the girls. Bev is always the last to lay, prefering the afternoon to the morning.I was reading the weekly newsletter from the  local farm where we get our boxed vegetables,who have just installed lights in their henhouses to extend the hours of light the hens receive each day, thus ensuring the egg production is at its most.

Yet the hens love to be outside - having said that, having just checked the henhouse  (6.30pm Tuesday) they are all in for the night. Around teatime I always throw them a small supper - tonight it was bread and kale. Whilst I have witnessed some hens eating raw kale ours prefer it cooked - and with bread! lol!  It is quite amazing what the hens will eat..... This is a list of everything youcan feed a chicken. However, everybody's chickens have their own tiny brainsfull of likes and dislikes, so while one person's chickens may come running forgrapes or watermelon, another person's chickens may turn up their pointy littlebeaks at it. Anything on this list is worth a try.   Treat  Type  General Opinions   Apples  Raw and applesauce  Apple  seeds contain cyanide, but not in sufficient quantities to kill.   Asparagus  Raw  or cooked  Okay to feed, but not a favorite.   Bananas  Without the peel  High in potassium, a good treat.   Beans  Well-cooked  only, never dry  Also,  greenbeans.   Beets  Greens  also.  .   Berries  All  kinds  A  treat, especially strawberries.   Breads  All  kinds - good use for stale bread or rolls  Feed  starches in moderation.   Broccoli & Cauliflower  .  Tuck  into a suet cage and they will pick at it all day.   Cabbage & Brussels Sprouts  Whole  head -  Hang  a whole cabbage from their coop ceiling in winter so they have something to  play with and greens to eat.   Carrots  Raw and cooked  They like carrot foliage too.   Catfood * (see bottom of page)  Wet and dry  Feed in strict moderation, perhaps only during moulting * (see  bottom of page)   Cereal  Cheerios, etc.  Avoid  highly sugared cereal such as Cocopuffs, etc.   Cheese  Including cottage cheese  Feed in moderation, fatty but a good source of protein and calcium   Corn  On cob and canned, raw and cooked  .   Crickets (alive)  Can be bought at bait or pet-supply stores.  Great treat – provides protein and it’s fun to watch the chickens  catch them.   Cucumbers     Let  mature for yummy seeds and flesh.   Fish / Seafood  Cooked  only.      Fruit  Pears, peaches, cherries, apples      Grains  Bulgar, flax, niger,  wheatberries,etc.  .   Grapes  Seedless  only.For  chicks, cutting them in half makes it easier for them to swallow.  Great fun - the cause of many entertaining \"chicken  keepaway\" games.   Grits  Cooked      \"Leftovers\"  Only feed your chickens that which is still considered edible by  humans, don't feed anything spoiled, moldy, oily, salty or unidentifiable.      Lettuce / Kale  Any  leafy greens, spinach collards, chickweed included.  A  big treat, depending on how much other greenery they have access to.   Mealworms   Available  at pet supply stores or on the internet, although shipping is expensive!  A huge(!) favourite treat, probably the most foolproof treat on  the books.   Meat scraps of any kind.  Not too fatty.  In moderation, a good source of protein   Melon  Cantelope, etc.  Both seeds and flesh are good chicken treats.   Oatmeal  Raw or cooked  Cooked is nutritionally better.   Pasta / Macaroni  Cooked spaghetti, etc.  A favourite treat, fun to watch them eat it, but not much  nutrition.   Pomegranates  Raw  Seeds  are a big treat.   Popcorn  Popped,  no butter, no salt.      Potatos / Sweet   Cooked only - avoid green parts  Starchy, not much nutrition   Pumpkins / Winter Squash  Raw or cooked  Both seeds and flesh are a nutritious treat.   Rice  Cooked  only  Pilaf  mixes are okay too, plain white rice has little nutrition.   Sprouts    Wheat and oat sprouts are great!  Good for greens in mid-winter.   Sunflower Seeds  Sunflower  seeds with the shell still on is fine to feed, as well as with the shell off.  A  good treat, helps hens lay eggs and grow healthy feathers.   Tomatos  Raw  and cooked.      Watermelon  Served  cold, it can keep chickens cool and hydrated during hot summers.    Seeds and flesh are both okay to feed.   Yogurt  Plain or flavoured    A big favourite and good for their digestive systems. Plain is  better.  For more amazing facts and fun follow the ABC Wednesday link in my sidebar."},

We went along to the salesroom and I had my first sit in the VW Transporter. It seemed very large. Whilst it was Jon's decision and that decision was based on a business need I just felt it was a tad too big for me - considering my vehicle - the Toyota Hilux 4x4 was also a large one.I suggested to Jon I got a run-around small car - suitable for my tootling about to the shops and also for my shopping expeditions with Mrs Nesbitt Senior. At the ripe old age of 82 a smaller car was more suited to her needs too. We started looking around for smaller cars - the Toyota will stay - such as the winters may deem necessary! One thought would be to tax the pick-up for 6 months of the year - but when we did our homework and found cars which are taxed at £20 a year we could tax the car all year, the pick-up just if we have a severe winter. After weeks of research and haggling we came away Citroen C1 - 4 years old but with one previous owner a 60 year old gal who regularly had it serviced and who bought a new car every 4 years from the Citroen dealer in Sunderland. Low mileage too!£20 a year to tax and a top mileage to the gallon statistic! We collected the car last week and we have been thrilled with its performance and well impressed with the miles to the gallon - I think 56 was one day's average!Next stop was Jon's work's van. With my car secured and bought it was ideal to use when shopping around for the best deals.

{"title": "H is for Hybrids!", "date": "Tuesday, September 4", "text": "Our chickens are Hybrids.Hybrid Chickens After the 2nd World War people’s demands and expectations changed and they wanted fresh eggs all year round, as they now had refrigerators to keep them in. This meant there was a massive demand for eggs pushing prices higher. The hens being kept at the time were unable to reliably produce 300+eggs a year each.Unfortunately the demand for plentiful cheap eggs also produced the development of what we now know as the \"battery cage\" system. Genetics were just becoming “the in thing” in the scientific world and known good layers were crossed using genetic formulae to develop the hybrid chicken that would continually lay well for 2 years.The majority of today’s hybrid hens are actually bred from well-known utility laying breeds such as the Rhode Island Red, Marans or Leghorns. In recent years more people have wanted to keep a few birds in the garden so that they can collect their own eggs. This phenomena seemed to coincide with people becoming more aware of where the supermarket eggs came from. The first commercial hybrid was what we call the “Warren” a mainly brown chicken.(Mabel and Olwyn)Chicken breeders were quick to realise that we didn’t want just brown birds in our gardens but that some us did want hens that laid all year. So they started breeding chickens that are still primarily a hybrid but are much more varied in colour. There is now a large variety of hybrid chickens available. Ambers, Blacktail, Bluebelles, Columbine, Copper Black, Rangers, Rhode Rocks, Speckledy, Sussex, White Stars.If you buy two similar looking birds from 2 different breeders, the chance is they have been “named” differently, as breeders name their own hybrids. One thing is for certain, in that all will be prolific egg-layers. More recently differently coloured eggs have been added to the qualities available from hybrid birds. A Maran genetic based hybrid such as the Speckedly, will produce brown or brown speckled eggs. Whilst Columbines bred from selected strains of the Cream Crested Legbar, has a high percentage chance of laying a blue egg. Fenton Blue hens have been bred from the Cream Legbar will produce a blue/green egg.  (Bev)The list is in fact almost endless, as every country around the world will have breeders with their “own” hybrids. When buying a hybrid chicken you will be paying a fraction of the cost of a breed bird. Hybrid chicken prices do vary dependent on where the bird originated from. Many will have been hatched by commercial hatcheries and done so by the thousand. Many of these chicks will be sold as early as one day old to a second “breeder”, to be \"grown on\" and eventually sold to us as POL/point of lay hens at around 16-24 weeks of age. Some of the “grown on” birds are now being sold to a third party, garden centres, before eventually reaching the back garden hen keeper. As you can well imagine, purchasing hens through these outlets is one of the most expensive ways of acquiring your hens. I recently saw Warrens marked at £25 per bird in a garden centre, yet a near-by breeder of Ambers was selling POL for £16!For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar!"},
{"title": "G is for...Gizzard and Gravid.", "date": "Thursday, August 30", "text": "G is for Gizzard.Following on with my ABC of life with the Nesbitt chickens we come to G!Some technical information today!A Gizzard is a compartment in the chicken's digestive system that grinds up food. It is lined with keratin and uses small stones (grit) to break the food down to smaller pieces.Many other birds have this same organ.The digestive process is as follows…The beak moistens food with Saliva.Food is not chewed.The oesophagus takes the food down to the crop to be stored.After a chicken has eaten, the crop will feel full and bulge.Food from the crop slowly passes down to the proventriculus. The proventriculus mixes the food with acids and digestive enzymes.Food is then passed through to the gizzard where insoluble (flint) grit has accumulated. ( As our hens are free-range and allowed to forage wherever they please - they have sufficient grit in their natural diet. From time to time I add some grit but this is rare).Food is ground down by strong muscular action in the gizzard.From the gizzard, food is passed through to the small intestine and is reduced further with enzymes from the pancreas.Bile produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder helps to break down fat.The intestines digest the food, taking nutrients from it.Water and the remaining undigested food is absorbed in the large intestine. The caeca are a pair of tubes that allow fermentation of undigested food to take place. This is emptied every 24 hours or so and is a light brown (mustard colour) froth. This can often be confused as diarrhoea by the novice.The cloaca / vent passes a combination of faeces and urine, together with eggs from the oviduct. This is the only rear orifice chickens have. The name cloacae means \"common sewer\". Eggs travel through here to exit the body. Sperm enters here, and urine and faeces also exit the body through that pathway, hence the name.(Sorry were you eating?)Gravid, A bird that is about to lay an egg is called \"gravid,\" just like a woman who is about to give birth.A female chick is hatched with one functioning ovary and all of the eggs (as in female gametes, not shelled eggs), that she will ever have.Once she is sexually mature, she will lay one shelled egg about every 24 hours during each laying cycle.A laying cycle lasts about 21 days.The female gametes are called follicles. A number of them will develop at a time; the largest will get fertilized if sperm are present.This large follicle is the egg yolk; it is intended to be nourishment for a developing embryo, and is referred to as a yolk sac. Whether fertilized or not this yolk sac passes through a series of organs to become a shelled egg. Its first stop is an organ called the infindibulum, wherein that sticky membrane surrounding the yolk sac (called the chalazae) is deposited. This takes about 15 minutes. The next stop is an organ called the magnum, where the albumin, or egg white, is formed; this takes about 3 hours. Next it goes to an organ called the isthmus, where shell membranes are formed; this takes about one hour.The last stop is the uterus, or \"shell gland,\" and this is where the shell is deposited and becomes mineralized. This last step takes the most time, about 20 hours.Then the egg is then ready to be laid.Fascinating eh? Now you know. For more amazing stuff follow the link to ABC Wednesday in my sidebar!"},

{"title": "F is for Food & Feeding (Chicken stuff)", "date": "Tuesday, August 21", "text": "Continuing my saga of ABC with the chickens in the Nesbitt household!Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Breakfast for the chickens. A mixture of mixed chicken corn, porridge and white long - grained rice. There are some who say chicken food should have XX% of this and XX% of that, but only on a Friday in August etc, but I tend to go down the route of a 'base' proper feed (mixed corn) and anything else they would like, because if they don't want it - they won't eat it! In the early 50's, a left over of WW2 where 'self sufficiency' was just a way of life and not an alternative like it is today, rationing was still going and the open market amongst neighbours was a terrific 'local economy' in it's own right. My grandparents wouldn't have a clue about XX% of vitamin X. They fed the chickens with what they had and that was usually a mixture of corn and left overs - potato and other peels boiled up and thrown in the Pen.The chickens were happy and they laid eggs! hat's the thing really, which I know from my own experience of getting my first hens, putting them in a hen house built by Jon and then wondering what the heck I do next ? Will they starve? will they die?, are they too hot, cold etc. The list goes on.But after a while you realise they are pretty good about anything you do and you'll soon know from lack of eggs or general health that it maybe (maybe) something to do with you.There are basically two types of feed; 1. Mixed Corn, probably the most essential and 2. Layers Pellets.Before we continue - Layers Mash is the same as Pellets but crushed up into a powder and especially easier for very young chickens. There are also Layers 'Crumbles' which is a kind of halfway house, but my local Farm Supply Merchants don't sell it, so I assume there isn't much of a market for them.So it's a bit the same as a baby growing up Mash to Crumble to Pellets.In the mornings I feed them what amounts to about a handful each and in the afternoons, about the same. Teatime is treat time – egg noodles, rice noodles, spaghetti etc. You should bear in mind though that mine are in a large open area in which they can scratch around and find their own bit and pieces.During the summer I have the benefit of the Kitchen left overs  and they are spoilt on almost a daily basis with jacket potato's, bread, sandwiches (not meat) etc.In the winter we boil up all our left overs and peels and this goes in as well.The only other thing is grit. This can be purchased in Farm Suppliers, maybe good garden centres.I also use the shells of the eggs I’ve used in the kitchen and roast them til they're nice and crunchy brown, then crunch them up into a grit like condition.This is a common and known method and is not scorned upon. Our chickens are not fond of greens – this is probably because they have such a large area of grass to please them. Over the past few nights we have made the most of the weather and have been having BBQ’s. We see the hens searching the grass for insects and the like – often until dusk when they will make their way to bed.When we do feed them it is always interesting to watch them eat all the sunflower seeds first!Whatever we feed them, nothing beats the tranquility of sitting in the garden and watching them eat away!Happy Hens!For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},

Often when I open the door she is there, waiting and ready to jump into the kitchen - in fact she has been known to make it to the snug, where she was happy to perch on the settee! As explained in previous posts, we name our pets for significant reasons, usually after somebody we know, ie our pets all have human names. In the case of Eva, she is named after Jon's Aunt Eva but has also taken on the personality of the 50's singer 'Little Eva'.Eva -  quick to jump into the kitchen and let others know where the action is!Always under the garden seats looking for food. Eva - loves a nibble of anything going! Eva - loves a cuddle!(Please note my hair has been rescued and tamed since this photograph was taken) I guess it shows that Eva is my favourite chicken!For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},

{"title": "D is for....Dustbath(and Drama and Drenched!)", "date": "Monday, August 6", "text": "Continuing with my ABC based on our chickens - D is for the dustbaths they enjoy so much! Here is a short video I recorded way back in the days when summer meant sunshine! The distinct sounds of their contentment are quite clear. Chickens don’t bath their bodies with water the way humans do, they use soil to clean their plumage (feathers) and this form of bathing is very vital to their health.  Chickens really enjoy taking a dust bath to clean their feathers and help with mites and other parasites that like to feast on chicken and sap their energy.Dustbaths help remove excess oil from the chickens feathers. Dusting is also a method chickens use to cool off when it’s hot.Whilst our chickens have a variety of places they enjoy dustbaths - mostly in the hedge or in a patchy area in the neighbouring field, another good source for a  dust bath to help control lice and mites is wood ash from our Rayburn. Wood charcoal can very beneficial and an important supplement for our chickens. Charcoal has the capabilities to absorb toxins and is capable of absorbing up to two hundred times its own weight.  Extensive research suggests that animals consume it for its medicinal, toxin-binding properties. The charcoal is also a laxative and so then can work twofold and move the impurities it absorbs out of the body. If worms or worm ova are present, it can to some degree help move them out of the body as well.Our chickens also from time to time are seen eating the wood ash as well as charcoal. Wood ash is highly soluble in vitamin K, followed by calcium and magnesium. Vitamin K is useful for blood clotting in poultry.  Wood ash has a very nice texture to aid in dust bathing and adding it to our chickens dust bath to eat and dust in must give our chickens a double-benefit!(For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar.)It is also a treble offering for D's this week following our motorbike adventure on Sunday. The weather forecast (why do we listen?) stated that the better weather would be over towards the Lakes and not too good here on the North East Coast! Like utter fools we decided to have a little tootle over to the Lakes. The weather was LOVELY here, but we feared this would change. We packed a picnic and headed over towards the Lakes. As we made our way along the A66 we noticed the BLACK sky above the area we were heading, even lightning at one point, so we changed route and headed along to Hawes. Whilst we had stopped for our picnic we had put on our waterproofs, it was so lovely at Hawes, we removed our waterproofs and packed them away. After a cup of tea we set off for home - normally about an hour. Just outside Hawes we came to our first road hold-up. This is how the North Air Ambulance reported the incident.\"Yesterday afternoon we airlifted a 65-year-old motorcyclist near Bainbridge in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire. The man had collided with a car and sustained a severe leg injury. Our doctor and paramedic team worked closely with a Yorkshire Ambulance Service road crew on scene. The man was then taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, a journey which took just 15 minutes. We wish him a speedy recovery.\"Having stopped and enquired that there was nothing we  could do, we continued along our route. It soon became obvious we had misjudged the waterproofs situation. We pulled up and dragged on our jackets and over-trousers - not easy in the rain. Once again we set off and in a matter of minutes we came across floods! We made our way through the huge puddles across the roads and just when we thought that we were managing, an idiot in a large 4x4 thought it was hilarious to overtake us at speed, midst the flood sending a torrent of gushing water over both us and our motorbike! (We did report him to the police!) Jon managed to remain in control of the situation and would you believe we then came across SNOW!The conditions were reported here in the local press.Again, Jon's experience and skill ensured we made it home, but what a DAY!"},
{"title": "C is for Cockerel!", "date": "Monday, July 30", "text": "Following the ABC of the Nesbitt Chickens brings us to C  our cockerel, Ernest.A common misconception is you need a cockerel if you want to keep chickens for eggs. Hens do not need a male around to lay eggs. Just as with human females, releasing an egg and having a period, female chickens do not need a cockerel to produce an egg. It happens whether or not there is a male around, the only difference is that it won't be fertilised if there is no male.In the past, in fact when we first kept chickens back in 1990 we did have a cockerel and went through the whole experience of raising chicks. The cockerel we had back then was named Maurice and he had 2 hens for company - and other favours (wink wink!) This increased to about 10 and then he became quite rough with the girls and he had to be dealt with!When we decided to keep chickens again we decided against a cockerel. A couple of years ago our neighbours borrowed Mabel and Bev - who at the time were broody. Their own eggs were not fertile so they were given some fertile eggs to hatch. Bev lost interest and walked away from the eggs but Mabel stayed and indeed hatched a chick. Sadly the chick died in the snow but Mabel meanwhile had developed a bond with the young bantam cockerel. This bond lasted a few months and when our neighbours moved from the village they asked us if we would keep the cockerel - who was \"in a relationship\" with Mabel. Being a Bantam (banty) he is small, so not large enough to properly mate with the hens so any fertilisation can not take place, we don't have the worry of raising the chicks and both the hens and Ernest are happy.Like all our chickens he has a proper name, Ernest was the middle name of the neighbour who gave him to us.Ernest is a faithful soul and when Mabel goes into the hen house to lay an egg he will wait outside.The cockerel is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn (\"cock-a-doodle-doo\")  Ernest can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory. However, this idea is more romantic than real, as a cockerel can and will crow at any time of the day. Ernest usually starts crowing at about 5am in the morning and we hear him throughout the day - not too much and in any case things like this are tolerated here in the village. Ernest has several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. One particular sound he makes which I find endearing is his patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks. When I feed the chickens with tit-bits Ernest will call the hens over to share anything he has obtained. A lovely way with his girls I would like to think!"},

{"title": "Bev the Broody Hen!", "date": "Monday, July 23", "text": "Continuing with the ABC of life with the chickens in the Nesbitt household........B!Bev is our black hen - she lays blue eggs. I named her Bev after the mum of the ex-pupil who built our hen coop a few years ago. He had just finished a basic joinery course. I had known him since he was 7 and obviously knew his mum too. Bev had jet-black hair so it seemed appropriate.  Bev (left) is a broody hen this means she will get the urge to hatch some eggs, subsequently sitting on them for however long they take to hatch. The incubation period for a hen's egg is around 21 days. However - one slight snag is that our eggs are not fertile - (more of that next week).The main reason we keep our hens is for eggs, so whilst Bev is broody it means our egg production is down. Fortunately she has not been too aggressive and has allowed me to lift her off the eggs when I collect them. Broody hens can sometimes prevent other hens from sitting in the nesting area but again Bev has allowed the other hens to go into the hen house, often cuddling next to them, as seen with Mabel below. A few days ago I noticed the rear end of one of the hens disappearing into the hedge...........they have been secretly laying eggs away from the hen house! Looking at the colour of the eggs I can tell Olwyn, Eva and May are laying eggs together.  This morning I captured Eva in action! For more ABC fun follow the link in my sidebar."},
{"title": "All Change!", "date": "Tuesday, July 17", "text": "Many many moons ago I started a fun blogging project - known as a meme. I had an idea whereby bloggers could post a specific alphabet related subject - be it a photograph, image, text, poem or whatever. We would work our way through the alphabet, week by week. It started about 5 years ago - a long time for anything blog related but here we are, Round 11!However there has been a significant change in matters - this round I am not managing the project as I have done from day 1. A few rounds back I found I could not run the show alone and enlisted a team to help with the running of such a fun project. Believe me there is a lot to do and for the moment I am passing the reins over to Roger who has been so supportive and helpful throughout his time as team member. I am still a team member, but feel Roger is the man to take us forward.So..................this round of ABC Wednesday will be based round my chickens, I know so many of you find the everyday happenings of life in the Nesbitt henhouse so uplifting and fun....so watch this space! A is for........Accommodation!3 years ago when we first got our hens they started off in a small cosy purpose built house. In these early days - before Ernest joined the family there was just enough room for all 6 of them. Hens are social creatures, remaining faithful to their family group and enjoy cuddling together - for both warmth and safety. Here from the left we have may, Bev, Olwyn, Mabel, Margie and Eva. This sleeping/perching order was the same every night.When our faithful gander, Jo sadly passed away his rather superior shed became vacant. The hens by this time had progressed to shed number 2, here to be seen on the left but often observed the empty shed on their travels. so eventually they moved in! Shed 2 became chief log store.Despite having luxury accommodation should the door ever  close the girls would happily sleep on the roof! Hens originate from warmer climates and would happily perch in trees - not to be encouraged here in chillier UK! Many a night has seen Jon encouraging the girls out of the branches and into the safety of a warm henhouse.Inside the henhouse the girls like a quiet place to lay eggs, often sharing the space together.On average each hen lays 1 egg everyday - sometimes every other day, but sufficient for our needs.Due to windy weather Jon modified the shed so the girls could come and go as they please without worrying that the door would slam shut.The hens love to look out of their window from thir own window seat.We keep a bag of woodshavings inside the henhouse which we clean out every day, allowing the hens fresh bedding each night.With the arrival of the woodburning Rayburn we use the rear of the henhouse for storage.Here the hens settle in for the night.I hope you enjoy my ABC Wednesdays and gain an insight into life with the Nesbitt chickens.Any questions - just shout out!For more ABC fun visit the ABC Wednesday Blog here"},

{"title": "This and that!", "date": "Saturday, June 30", "text": "Yesterday was my birthday. We had a long chat about what to do, ie should we go out for a meal, but in the end I decided I would prefer to have a meal at home. We had to make a journey to a farm shop Wakefield in order to deliver a tool re Jon's business, so I prepared a beef casserole and left it in a low oven whilst we went about our business.We had been to the farm shop before - here and what a FANTASTIC place it is too! Whilst Jon was in the workshop I busied myself looking round the fantastic cheese selection, wine cellar and fresh produce. I came away with some fantastic cheese and vegetables for our meal. I also bought some WONDERFUL rose wine and a portion of sticky toffee pudding as it is one of Jon's favourites. By the time we returned home I was so pleased with my decision to eat at home - it was quite late and we were both very tired. Jon had insisted on doing all the driving, being it my birthday, so all I had to do was prepare a few vegetables, chill the wine and serve up! Fantastic! I must admit my healthy eating plan took a bashing when I HAD to have a small piece of sticky toffee pudding when Jon had gone to bed! I helped myself to a very very small  portion.......then another very very small portion ......then another very very small portion ......then another very very small portion ..until - as if by magic the whole portion had disappeared, right before my eyes..no doubt showing up later on my hips!!!The shop have a special offer on each Friday so with the 2 steaks I bought I received a free sauce - which we are having tonight.....diet resumes on Sunday!The weather continues to be quite naff! It is very consistent however - a couple of hours sunshine followed by a downpour,  ideal conditions for weed growth!We did make a dash for the blue skies today only to see the same sky turn black and the heaven's opened - our bike gear is drying off as I speak!"},

The ferry crossing - where we ALWAYS are taken in with the breeze, forgetting the sun's rays penetrate.....(so midweek we both have sunburn) the journey to Port Erin and the lovely break we enjoy in the hotel.We spent a couple of days away from the racing due to bad weather - quite by chance I came across the novels of Rebecca Shaw and I have not been able to put them down since I arrived home. To date I have read about 15!!!!  Yes I am a speed reader and HAVE to finish a book in a day - today however I read 2! Put it down to the weather!The books are based on village life and I would urge anybody familiar with such a setting to read at least one. The first one to read is the above.

Amazingly we managed a tootle over to Whitby on Thursday and I had a manic weeding session whilst the sun shone. Sufficient time for me to fill the green wheelie bin ready for collection - I found this satisfying. The garden is in need of some serious attention - Jon managed to cut the lawns and I am itching to pot on my tomato plants - which I am doing whenever the rain stops.I have been spending time reading - Rebecca Shaw is my current favourites.

Typically the sun is shining today after raining all day yesterday when I was trying to dry everything.So life is back to normal - Jon is very busy at work and I am just looking at the garden as it has grown so much whilst we have been away. Sadly all I can do right now is look and plan as both Jon and I have come down with a terrible cold, so my energy levels are quite low and all I can do is to take the \"Day Nurse\" capsules every 4 hours.

{"title": "Guess what?", "date": "Thursday, May 24", "text": "I know this will come as a surprise......but the rehomed hens now have a new home! They will LOVE it here!   Heaven!A safe enclosed secure gardenand a lovely house.My friend Julie called round last Friday. I was showing her the hens when she told me she had always wanted to keep chickens. It just seemed it was meant to be!Alice, the orange hen is very much in charge of the other two - Isabella ( now Bella) and Sophia - (now Doris). I had noticed Alice being quite protective and getting rather confident with my own hens - who in all fairness were doing well in sharing the garden with them. We have one third of an acre so there was always room for both sets of hens - but from time to time there would be squabbles.I hadn't been aware of Bella and Doris having a weak leg problem - a change of diet and better environment was improving their conditions but nevertheless I did not want them to be threatened or unnecessarily challenged. We go away next week - so the care of all the hens will be down to my neighbours and I can't expect them to give the hens the attention they need in this transitional period. Whilst I knew all would be OK when Julie said that she wanted some chickens we both felt the best place for the new girls would be her garden.Julie spent the weekend preparing the shed for them and buying the necessary stuff that goes with keeping chickens. On Tuesday evening I took the girls round and we settled them into their new home.On Wednesday Julie called me to say they were enjoying the garden - so I went round and took the photographs.From the state of the inside of the shed we could see where they had been nesting and were enjoying the garden. The tortoise was following them round and at one point all had been sunbathing!As a true animal lover I knew the decision was best for the hens - all of them. Mine are now back to normal and the re homed ones are now in such a lovely lovely place, so much better than their original run at my sister in laws. Their egg production had increased whilst they were here so I know they are happy and content.Keeping hens brings its rewards and now Julie is experiencing the same -  a joy shared is a joy doubled!"},

This is one of the easiest ways to transport hens - they immediately settle down - which they did.We made sure they had plenty of water and grain and left them to get use to their new surroundings.Tonight, when our hens are tucked up in their won house we will let the new girls have a wander round the paddock - they will by now recognise this as home and will return once the light starts fading.Our girls dont eat much green food ie lettuce and cabbage leaves as they enjoy rummaging in the grass clippings. The new girls however LOVE greens as they were use to a coop where they soon ate all the grass and enjoyed daily treats of lettuce etc. I fed them some lettuce today and they ate it with gusto.

A great prize promotion was planned for Saturday and Sunday, ie this weekend. I registered both Jon and myself and today we tootled over to our nearest Honda dealer. There was a range of the latest Honda motorcycles to drool over! I liked this one.........This one too - but apparantly the engine is a strange one (Jon's words) - we did try one out a couple of years ago....and didn't like it!This is a big tourer.This was another one I liked!Anyway.....we took along our reference numbers from the Honda competition website...........The chappie typed in Jon's reference - Jon won a Honda retro T-shirt.He then typed in my reference............. look what I won! It just so happens we need new helmets so when my helmet arrives from Honda Jon will buy a matching one. Peter, the manager, who we know quite well said he would sort us both out and Jon could have a good discount! Good eh? A great start to the weekend I think.

Little has been done to it and it has recently been sold. It is to become a holiday cottage.﻿ The horses are always a pleasant sight so early in the morning. There is lots of activity at the duckpond too.  A mother and her ducklings left the bank as we passed and swam towards the rushes.In the distance we could see the horses being put through their paces on the galloping circuit.We decided not to go any further as we know there are a couple of new young horses and we didn't want to distract them from the task in hand - to become a race horse.As we made our way home we saw Howard bringing breakfast for the horses. I popped in on Anne and Malcolm to wish them a good journey! I will miss Anne so much. However they are away for 8 weeks and our own holiday preparations have also started. Both Freida and Elsie are booked into their places of residence - Freida with Auntie Joyce and Elsie with Auntie Jill. Ella despises travelling so I am checking out a local cattery today which will make her slightly happier when we are away. I love the anticipation and planning for a holiday, so roll on 1st June when we will be making our annual pilgrimage to the Isle of Man and all it has to offer! Watch this space! For more ABC fun, follow the link in my sidebar."},
{"title": "L is for Lengths", "date": "Tuesday, April 3", "text": "After a great few days around and about life is now back to as normal as life can ever be in the Nesbitt household. Hubby is busy at work and I am continuing with my quest to shed some more weight, ready for my new bike leathers.My fitness regime commences each morning at 9.30 when I go for a 2 mile walk with Freida, together with my neighbour. To walk to the farm and back is exactly 2 miles. On a good day we may do it twice, covering 4 miles often we do a 3 mile version, but certainly each morning we always do 2 miles. If Anne isn't free, Freida and I do the walk and talk the talk. I must say the time and distance does fly by - when I have Anne to talk to. The distance is over the farm lane and it is good to see the horses - feeding at that time of the morning - so they rarely come to the fence.Once home I get ready for the gym, a short car journey away. I do not enjoy the gym - I find it boring and very tedious. I have an exercise programme which involves the rowing machine, jogging machine, cycle and a couple of others which I may or may not use depending on if I can be bothered how I am feeling. I usually spend just under an hour in the gym before making my way to the swimming pool. I enjoy swimming - the pool is partitioned off into 3 sections, slow medium and fast. I stay in the slow section and try to do 32 lengths each time I visit - a distance of half a mile. The best part of the session for me, is the hot shower - then I know my gruelling morning keep fit regime is over, home for my boiled eggs!Well, call me LOOPY but I have signed up for the Big Splash for Comic Relief!I was LURED into the decision by an advertisement on TV! I found myself saying to Jon, \"I am going to do it!\" and before you knew it I had registered and signed up for this event, in an effort to raise funds for causes organised by both Comic Relief and the Marie Curie Cancer charity..I have a couple more weeks left to train up for this event, so watch this space.Thanks.For more ABC fun please visit the link in my sidebar."},

A few months ago I was thinking about New Year's Resolutions - whether it was something I had eaten or a knock on the head I don't know what it was but I felt I wanted to develop my sewing skill (s). I suspect the main reason was it was during the winter months and I had been impressed by the many bloggers who can do wonders with a needle and thread and foolishly I felt inadequate when I considered what I could achieve.I set myself a task of making something every month. Last month I made a cushion, which believe it or not is still being used.I was only thinking the other day, that whilst I may not sew I can design and produce cards and stationery. Still a creative outlet for my thinking and ideas and I am ALWAYS making something - there is ALWAYS something in the pipeline. Only yesterday I produced the wedding invitations above for a current commission and after getting fabulous responses from the bride and groom today I will produce another 60! This is normal for me - so I do feel this is adequate and acceptable for a target and certainly an achievement.So yes - I will adjust my sails and carry on!Watch this space!﻿For more ABC adventures follow the link in my sidebar.﻿"},

{"title": "World Wide Web Stuff.", "date": "Sunday, February 19", "text": "A good sign that I have been busy is the fact that I have not blogged since the wedding report from last weekend. I have been on some lovely walks, been pottering at home and yesterday we even managed a tootle over the moors on the motorbike. Today however, the weather is not so favourable so after getting all my household chores out of the way I decided to update my other blog.I don't have a website at the moment and really am just considering if it is worth the money. I have had a website in the past, but there was a problem with the timing of the domain name - which for some strange reason ended up as a blog of no real commercial focus. A website is a pressence in the Big wide world web....but a blog has the same function surely? A blog is something I can manage and changes quickly, a website is not so easy - for me anyway. Whilst I am sure I could eventually work my way round a website I question if the time and effort is worth it. With social networking sites out there I feel a mixture of my blog and facebook would be sufficient to let people know what I can do and where I can be contacted. My customers tend to be local in anycase. Many of my previous customers are on Facebook and are my friends - all endorse my work so I think I am doing enough to market my work. At the end of the day it is a profitable, thoroughly enjoyable hobby.Any thoughts?"},

{"title": "A New Era!", "date": "Friday, February 10", "text": "Yesterday it was decided that the washer was finally homeward bound to the great washing machine heaven! Whilst Jon can fix and make parts where necessary it was beyond any of his divine intervention. For the past few months I had noticed a slow yet marked decline in the overall performance of the machine - ofcourse I put it down to various factors - washing powder, nature of stains etc but at the end of the day I knew it was the washer. Funny it seems - when Jon is really busy at work I wonder what is going to go wrong - because something always does..........and only a few days ago I thought that the washer had not conked out for a while.........so yesterday morning when I got up I noticed not only had the washer stopped the clothes were grubby, the spin programme had not worked and the washing powder was still in the dispenser. Each of these signs indicated a different fault........so when Jon came home and assessed the situation it was decided we needed a new washer.In the 23.5 years we have been married we have had 2 washers - washer/dryers to be precise. Our first one was a wedding present from Jon's parents. Our house then was a small modern detached house and we both worked, hence the decision to go for a washer/dryer. Should we need a dryer we had one. I rarely used it. This lasted us for about 14 years - Jon rebuilding motors, making new parts etc etc. When we replaced it - we went for another Hotpoint. Jon knew his way round Hotpoints, infact at the time he was making the moulds for the Hotpoint washer seal and extrusuin hoses. Again we went for a washer/dryer and yet again I hardly used the dryer.We went to our local Curry's and assumed we would just buy a similar replacement. A Hotpoint Washer/dryer would be £349 or £399. There were none in stock so we would have to wait a week. No immediate problem - I am blessed with great neighbours and indeed yesterday shortly after a statement on Facebook one neighbour rang and offered me the use of her washer! However we had decided we wanted to bring a washer home with us - handy you see having a white van! Some models were available to take home - so this allowed us time to think. Strangely both Jon and I announced at the same time \"Do we need a washer/dryer?\" We have an airing cupboard and I am a great one for drying clothes in the kitchen when the Rayburn is still giving out heat - as are the radiators. The house is a warm house and I dry clothes overnight. The Rayburn has 2 radiators it heats up as an overspill when the central heating pump is switched off - our bedroom and the bathroom. This means they are always hot - ideal for drying clothes....so we decided to go for a washer. When the sales assistant was talking us through the various programmes available I told him I didn't need 14 programmes - 3 or 4 would be sufficient. By this time we weren't bothered about the brand either......so we went for this one, the cheapest in the shop for £169. Essentials C510WM11 Washing Machine gives you great cleaning performance that's amazing value for money.With a capacity of up to 5kg per load, the C510WM11 can handle your everyday washing with ease, even featuring a variable temperature and special setting for wool items to keep your clothes in the best possible condition. Rated \"A\" for energy consumption and wash performance, this machine may not use much electricity but it's certainly able to deliver powerful cleaning results!The Essentials C510WM11 Washing Machine focuses on delivering exactly what you need—good, reliable washing that leaves your clothes looking good as new. For the price, this is very hard to beat!Just sounds the job! We brought it home and Jon plumbed it in straight away - my first load was in a few minutes later! So easy to use - a result I would say!"},

In the context of ceramics, for example, an appliqué is a separate piece of clay added to the primary work, generally for the purpose of decoration. The term is borrowed from French and, in this context, means \"applied\" or \"thing that has been applied.\"Appliqué was first discovered when clothes ripped and needed fixing so they used to sew over the top of the rip patches of different material otherwise known as patch work.In the context of sewing, appliqué refers to a needlework technique in which pieces of fabric, embroidery, or other materials are sewn onto another piece of fabric to create designs, patterns or pictures.  B is for Buttons..... This technique below is called \"yoyoing\".....I am still experimenting!

It has been in the porch for a couple of years and it was only when talking over this and that with my good friend |Jill did I think to get it out and use it - so we are sharing it and bringing it to life.........Jill is further down the road than I am, but I am here at the beginning of my adventure........Watch this space!For more ABC fun click on the link on my sidebar."},

{"title": "New Year Stuff!", "date": "Sunday, January 8", "text": "Over the past few days I have been doing some hand sewing - the lounge curtains to be precise. My talanted neighbour, Anne is an absolute whizz with anything fabric, in particular curtains and helped me (well did) pin the hems on the curtains. My job was to hand stitch them and I must say how much I have enjoyed doing them. Quite theraputic I must say, especially with the radio for company. Obviously each curtain took a while and indeed I have one more to do today, but having a break I have found and bought 2 interesting books - thanks to one click buying from Amazon. I reckon by the time I have finished the curtain and lining and  ironed all the curtains I will be ready for another little project, ideally and hopefully the books will be a source of inspiration. I think it will be a great project for New Year.....reading many blogs that feature knitting and crochet projects always make me feel inadequate - I can't knit or crochet......my mum spent endless hours trying to teach me. I did consider trying to learn YET AGAIN but felt the sewing idea was a better option as I have the basic knowledge and would not be liable to \"throw the towel in\" when things did not go to plan - as I fear would be the case with a knitting or crochet project.I certainly have an idea for some cushion covers..........watch this space!Infact I have joined in here....."},

This week I expect another gain but how much I have no idea.....you see it was not my fault!Although we can travel a few miles to Tesco, Asda and Sainsburys our nearest supermarket is the Co-operative, referred to as \"The Co-op!\" Whilst the availability of certain foods is sparse and limited, on the whole it is a handy store. I rate the animal welfare standards it promotes as well as ethical practises - so whilst I could shop cheaper -  compromises have to be called for. It is only a couple of miles from the village ....fuel consumption is a big factor too.Each day at around 5.30pm a decent selection of foods are reduced due to sell-by dates. A couple of people spend the afternoon in the pub then go into the Co-op and stand over the assistants as the food is reduced. I know these  people from my time spent in teaching. I do not support their idea of a lifestyle - pub and  children do not go together well in my eyes, especially during school hours!!!On New Year's Eve I was shopping, it was about 3.30pm. I know many of the shop assistants well and have a good rapour with them, so when one of them called me over  keen to tell me she was reducing prices - early as it was New Year's Eve and I could have first refusal, before \"that chap\" came in!.....well what a time I had - and surely it would have been rude not to. We love cheese - Brie 29p......individual mince pies, pack of 12...29p. Litre of double cream...19p.... to name but a few!So...........there you have it.

Here are the canvas prints taken from my photographs of our ferry crossing in 2008 when we nipped over to Holland. Our wonderful Mackenzie Thorpe prints given to us by Dorothy and Keith - just match so well!!! The doors - soon to be replaced!! Yes our wonderful, adored friend Spud came round on New Year's Eve to fit the carpet!!The delay had been the paintwork but in the end the doors were fitted and we moved in! This room had always been cold - it is the extension after all. The doors were the original front door (external) so are not standard size for internal doors. We had so many problems replacing them we just went for a re-paint - but to coin a phrase \"You cant make a silk purse out of a sow's ear!\" The opening may not be standard, but hell spells I am married to a precision engineer! An engineer \"engineers things and makes them work!\" So Jon will \"make the opening standard\" and we will get new doors!We are over the moon and warm too - the Rayburn is doing a wonderful job keeping the room warm. Our Christmas present to each other is a TV and we just need a unit and some bookcases.So eh? Aubergine carpet - who saw that coming eh?Happy New Year - and here's to good gifted friends - like Spud!

The fog was thickening by the minute as you can see from the photo I took of the road home.Once we reached the road home from the Moor Road the weather cleared and the fog lifted.The next few days will be quiet, New Year’s Eve will be the next event – we are holding an “At Home” for neighbours and friends – our neighbours are doing the same, so we will be popping in and out of each other’s homes during the course of the night.We have had a delay with the lounge progress, but we should be back on track over the next couple of days. Working with colours of Brassica (purple) and brilliant white means there can be no grey areas (no pun intended) and the margins have to be spot on. As we were not at home on Christmas Day this was not a problem. Having one of your best friends as a carpet fitter is a joy I can tell you.

Friday seemed to be threatening snow but our visit to friends for dinner on the moors went without event  (well travelwise anyway) and my anxiety over driving was soon put to rest as the roads were only wet. Saturday brought about a rare but treasured meeting up of life long friends - normally scattered over Europe and America, we were all in one place at one time - so a lunch was called for!Dorothy and Keith are over from France and Steph is spending time here at home away from a hectic time over the pond.

Many vanilla slices are made of confectioner's cream - not a patch on the traditional custard in my opinion!I have good days and bad days with the Shingles - and the house progress gets me down - I am helpless, so as a treat I made myself a small bowl of custard and ate the lot!

After months of smooth operations the Rayburn just was NOT playing ball. Jon dismantled various bits to uncover this....... An hour later the same part looked like this...... The main chamber did look like this..... eventually looking like this.... Ofcourse it goes without saying to say that during the whole operation I was cold, very cold but all seems to be working well now. It had been a build up of creosote from the logs - who would have thought it? Towards the end of last week I was not able to  feel warm and i kept putting it down to Shingles - when all along it was the Rayburn. Jon had to practically dismantle it - fortunately this is the type of thing he strangely enjoys!!!! Not so much the dirt and discomfort - but finding out why something is not working to it's expectations. Now it is all sorted we have a warm house.I must admit things seemed to crash around me on Saturday and I felt everything was getting on top of me - the house was in a state of mess whilst the decorating is in progress - the washing was building up as the weather was dreadful and the house was cold - but I know we are not having everybody round this Christmas Day - which took pressure off.

Christmas card commission is awaiting approval from the client so again will share this later.Friday was spent getting ready for the Great Yorkshire Pork Pie Competition an annual event for our business. In the past I have gone for the day but this year we decided it was worth going on Saturday and attending the Yorkshire Federation Master Butcher's Annual Dinnerdance in the hotel and setting up first thing Sunday morning rather than clash there and back in one day...a good choice as you will later! Ofcourse I wouldn't have done this alone - my friend Jill came with me, I was so appreciative of her help and support. Each year the organisers secure a good rate for Bed and Breakfast in the Cedar Court Hotel and I must say the room was wonderful. We set off lunchtime on Saturday and after a short coffee stop we checked in around 4pm. After a rest and a shower we had a drinks reception followed by the Dinner. It was a great night. The organiser is Robin Moule and he ensured we were on his table - definitely the best table in the hall - certainly not the quitest!!! lol! After a lovely breakfast we made our way to the exhibition hall where the prestigious prizes awaited! Amongst the host of trophies and shields was ours!!!! The judging took place over a period of a few hours, during which time we caught up with customers and made new contacts. The recipricant of our award! (Robin is taking the photograph) I will be receiving a copy shortly. As the award ceremony came to a close it was noticeably foggy outside. Fortunately Jill had packed the van so we could make a speedy getaway. The fog persisted for the entire journey home but again, it was great to have company during such an ordeal.Once home, after unpacking it was time for a welcome bath. Jon said \"When you come out of the bath I'll show you your suprise!!!!\" - needless to say whilst I was in the bath I was racking my brains thinking about what it could be! I came up with 2 possibilities - either the doors had arrived for the final kitchen cupboards or he had concreted the area near the patio doors in the lounge following the discovery of a damp area under the laminate floor.It was the concrete!

{"title": "Christmas preparartion - thanks to Delia!", "date": "Thursday, November 3", "text": "I bought this book in Oxfam the other day. Must say I enjoy her programmes - so I've decided to make our Christmas Cake this week......but which one? Think I will make all of them!Last-Minute Sherry Mincemeat CakeDelia says,\"If you’ve been meaning to make a Christmas cake but haven’t got round to it, fear not – this one can be made at the last minute. In fact, you could bake it on Christmas morning and it would be ready for tea in the afternoon. For the topping, you can use any combination of nuts you like.\"Ingredients For the pre-soaking: 5 fl oz (150 ml) oloroso or other medium sherry 1 x 411 g jar Marks & Spencer luxury mincemeat 4 oz (110 g) ready-to-eat prunes, roughly chopped 2 oz (50 g) glacé cherries, quartered 6 oz (175 g) dried mixed fruits 2 oz (50 g) whole candied peel, chopped For the cake: 8 oz (225 g) wholemeal flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 5 oz (150 g) butter, softened 5 oz (150 g) dark brown soft sugar grated zest 1 small orange grated zest 1 small lemon 2 oz (50 g) brazil nuts, roughly chopped 2 oz (50 g) mixed chopped nuts 3 large eggs For the topping: approximately 18 walnut halves approximately 18 pecan halves approximately 23 whole brazils 1 heaped tablespoon sieved apricot jam 1 tablespoon brandy Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 3, 325°F (170°C). MethodBegin the cake a few hours before you want to make it and simply place all the pre-soaking ingredients into a bowl, stir really well, then cover with a cloth and leave in a cool place. When you are ready to make the cake, take a roomy bowl and simply place the soaked ingredients, plus all the rest of the cake ingredients, in it, all in one go. Now, using an electric hand whisk , beat everything together as thoroughly as possible, which will probably take about 1 minute. Then pour it into the prepared tin, smooth the top and arrange the whole nuts in rows across the surface – one row of walnuts, one of brazils, one of pecans, and so on. Finally, cover the top of the cake with a double circle of baking parchment with a hole the size of a 50p piece cut in the centre. Then place the cake on the centre shelf of the oven and bake it for 1¾-2 hours, or until the centre springs back when lightly touched. Then let it cool in the tin for 30 minutes before turning it out to finish cooling on a wire rack.The finishing touch is to heat the apricot jam and brandy together and brush the nuts with the mixture to give them a lovely glaze. Store the cake in an airtight tin and it will keep beautifully moist for 3-4 weeks.Scottish Whisky Dundee CakeDelia says,\" When people tell me they don't like rich, very moist fruit cakes at Christmas I always recommend a Dundee Cake. It has a lighter and much more crumbly texture than The Classic Christmas Cake and the addition of some Scotch malt whisky gives it a special Christmas edge.\"Ingredients 3 tablespoons whisky 6 oz (175 g) currants 6 oz (175 g) sultanas 4 oz (110 g) glacé cherries, rinsed, dried and cut into halves 3 oz (75 g) mixed candied peel, finely chopped grated rind 1 small orange grated rind 1 small lemon 5 oz (150 g) butter, at room temperature 5 oz (150 g) soft brown sugar 3 large eggs 8 oz (225 g) plain flour 1 level teaspoon baking powder milk, if necessary 2 level tablespoons ground almonds 4 oz (110g) whole blanched almonds (only if you don't intend to ice the cake) 1 miniature bottle (3½ tablespoons) single malt Scotch whisky (for 'feeding') MethodBegin the night before by weighing the fruit and peel into a bowl and sprinkling it with the 3 tablespoons of whisky. Mix well, cover and leave overnight.Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 3, 325°F (170°C). Put the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and fluffy – or use an electric mixer for more speed. Whisk the eggs separately, then, a little at a time, beat them into the creamed butter and sugar. Next, using a large tablespoon, carefully fold in the sifted flour and baking powder. Your mixture needs to be of a soft, dropping consistency so, if it seems too dry, add a dessertspoon of milk.Now, carefully fold in the ground almonds and then the currants, sultanas, cherries, mixed peel and orange and lemon zest. Then spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin, smoothing it out evenly with the back of the spoon. If you don't intend to ice the cake, arrange the whole blanched almonds in circles on top of the mixture, but do this carefully and lightly; if they are pressed in they will sink during the baking. Place the cake in the centre of the oven and bake for 2-2½ hours or until the centre is firm and springy to the touch. Let the cake cool in the tin for 30 minutes before taking it out to finish cooling on a wire rack. Then 'feed' it – make small holes in the top and base of the cake with a cocktail stick or small skewer, then spoon over a few teaspoons of malt whisky – wrap it in double silicone paper and store it in foil or an airtight container till needed. If you like you can feed it again before icing or eating.Light Glace Fruit CakeDelia says \"This is an absolutely delightful alternative Christmas cake; one for connoisseurs, I think. It's light in colour with a fragrant flavour and the glacé fruits look jewel-like when you cut it open. It works well with marzipan and icing or a glacé fruit and nut topping. \"Ingredients 4 oz (110 g) glacé pineapple, roughly chopped 6 oz (175 g) red and green glacé cherries, roughly chopped 8 oz (225 g) sultanas 4 oz (110 g) dried apricots, roughly chopped 3 tablespoons brandy 4 oz (110 g) pecan nuts, roughly chopped 4 oz (110 g) whole, mixed candied peel, chopped small 2 oz (50 g) angelica, chopped small 2 oz (50 g) crystallised ginger, chopped small grated zest 1 medium orange grated zest 1 medium lemon 8 oz (225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature 8 oz (225 g) caster sugar 4 large eggs 8 oz (225 g) plain flour, sifted 2 oz (50 g) ground almonds ¼ level teaspoon salt MethodBegin the night before by placing the sultanas and chopped apricots in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the brandy, cover and leave overnight. Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 3, 325°F (170°C). Add the rest of the nuts, fruit and peels into the sultanas and apricots. Tick everything off as you go. Now whisk with an electric hand whisk the butter and sugar in another large mixing bowl until pale and fluffy. Then beat the eggs and add them to the butter and sugar, a very small amount at a time, whisking well after every addition. When all the eggs are incorporated, lightly fold in the sifted flour and salt, followed by the ground almonds and then all the fruit, nuts, etc. Now transfer the mixture to the tin, levelling it off with the back of a spoon, and place the tin in the oven so the top of it is more or less in the centre. Bake the cake for 1 hour then place a double sheet of greaseproof paper over the top of the tin and turn the heat down to gas mark 2, 300°F (150°C), for a further 2-2¼ hours. When it's cooked it will have begun to shrink away from the sides of the tin and be springy in the centre when you press lightly with your little finger. You can leave this cake in the tin till it's absolutely cold then peel off the papers and wrap it in double greaseproof paper before storing in an airtight containerThe Classic Christmas CakeDelia says, \"This, with no apologies, is a Christmas cake that has been in print since 1978, has been made and loved by thousands and is, along with the Traditional Christmas Pudding, one of the most popular recipes I've produced. It is rich, dark and quite moist, so will not suit those who like a crumblier texture. Recently we took some of these cakes along to book-signing sessions up and down the country and were quite amazed to see so many people take a mouthful and then buy a book!\"Ingredients 1 lb (450 g) currants 6 oz (175 g) sultanas 6 oz (175 g) raisins 2 oz (50 g) glacé cherries, rinsed, dried and finely chopped 2 oz (50 g) mixed candied peel, finely chopped 3 tablespoons brandy, plus extra for 'feeding' 8 oz (225 g) plain flour ½ level teaspoon salt ¼ level teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg ½ level teaspoon ground mixed spice 8 oz (225 g) unsalted butter 8 oz (225 g) soft brown sugar 4 large eggs 2 oz (50 g) almonds, chopped (the skins can be left on) 1 level dessertspoon black treacle grated zest 1 lemon grated zest 1 orange 4 oz (110 g) whole blanched almonds (only if you don't intend to ice the cake Equipment You will also need an 8 inch (20 cm) round cake tin or a 7 inch (18 cm) square tin, greased and lined with silicone paper (baking parchment). Tie a band of brown paper round the outside of the tin for extra protection.MethodYou need to begin this cake the night before you want to bake it. All you do is weigh out the dried fruit and mixed peel, place it in a mixing bowl and mix in the brandy as evenly and thoroughly as possible. Cover the bowl with a clean tea cloth and leave the fruit aside to absorb the brandy for 12 hours. Next day pre-heat the oven to gas mark 1, 275°F (140°C). Then measure out all the rest of the ingredients, ticking them off to make quite sure they're all there. The treacle will be easier to measure if you remove the lid and place the tin in a small pan of barely simmering water. Now begin the cake by sifting the flour, salt and spices into a large mixing bowl, lifting the sieve up high to give the flour a good airing. Next, in a separate large mixing bowl, whisk the butter and sugar together until it's light, pale and fluffy. Now beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add them to the creamed mixture a tablespoonful at a time; keep the whisk running until all the egg is incorporated. If you add the eggs slowly by degrees like this the mixture won't curdle. If it does, don't worry, any cake full of such beautiful things can't fail to taste good! When all the egg has been added, fold in the flour and spices, using gentle, folding movements and not beating at all (this is to keep all that precious air in). Now fold in the fruit, peel, chopped nuts and treacle and finally the grated lemon and orange zests. Next, using a large kitchen spoon, transfer the cake mixture into the prepared tin, spread it out evenly with the back of a spoon and, if you don't intend to ice the cake, lightly drop the whole blanched almonds in circles or squares all over the surface. Finally cover the top of the cake with a double square of silicone paper with a 50p-size hole in the centre (this gives extra protection during the long slow cooking). Bake the cake on the lowest shelf of the oven for 4½-4¾ hours. Sometimes it can take up to ½-¾ hour longer than this, but in any case don't look till at least 4 hours have passed. Cool the cake for 30 minutes in the tin, then remove it to a wire rack to finish cooling. When it's cold 'feed' it – make small holes in the top and base of the cake with a cocktail stick or small skewer, then spoon over a few teaspoons of brandy, wrap it in double silicone paper secured with an elastic band and either wrap again in foil or store in an airtight container. You can now feed it at odd intervals until you need to ice or eat itCreole Christmas CakeDelia says, \"This recipe is for those who want a complete break with tradition and to try something completely new. On a visit to Trinidad, the wife of the chairman of Billington's, which imports the dark raw sugar of the West Indies, tasted a most delectable cake and was so struck by it that she managed to acquire the recipe from the wife of the local sugar plantation manager. Here I offer my own adaptation and would describe it as being much more fruit than cake; it's extremely moist, so much so that it could be eaten as a dessert with whipped cream. Don't be put off by the large amount of alcohol or the length of time the fruit is steeped in it; the wonderful flavour of the cake makes every drop totally worthwhile. This is too rich a cake to marzipan and ice so either leave it as it is or I think it's splendid topped with the Glazed Nut Topping. Then it should be stored without wrapping in a polythene box.\"Ingredients For the pre-soaking 3 tablespoons rum 3 tablespoons brandy 3 tablespoons cherry brandy 3 tablespoons port 1½ teaspoons Angostura bitters ½ level teaspoon ground cinnamon ½ level teaspoon ground nutmeg ½ level teaspoon ground cloves ½ level teaspoon salt 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract 1 level tablespoon molasses sugar 2 oz (50 g) glacé cherries, chopped 1 lb (450 g) raisins 4 oz (110 g) pitted no-soak prunes, chopped 8 oz (225 g) currants 4 oz (110 g) mixed candied peel 2 oz (50 g) mixed chopped nuts For the cake: 9 oz (250 g) self-raising flour 9 oz (250 g) demerara sugar 9 oz (250 g) butter, at room temperature 5 large eggs Equipment You will also need an 8 inch (20 cm) square cake tin, or a 9 inch (23 cm) round tin, greased, and the base and sides lined with a double thickness of silicone paper (baking parchment). MethodOne week before you intend to bake the cake, measure out the rum, brandy, cherry brandy, port, bitters and 3 tablespoons water into a large saucepan. Then add the rest of the pre-soaking ingredients, ticking them with a pencil as you go to make sure nothing gets left out. Now stir and bring the mixture up to simmering point, then, keeping the heat low, simmer very gently for 15 minutes. After that allow everything to cool completely, then pour the mixture into a large jar with a lid or an airtight plastic container and leave it in the fridge for seven days, shaking or stirring it around from time to time. When you're ready to bake the cake, pre-heat the oven to gas mark 1, 275°F (140°C). All you do is measure out the flour, sugar and softened butter into a very large mixing bowl, then add the eggs and either whisk or beat with a wooden spoon until everything is blended. Now gradually fold in the fruit mixture until it's all evenly distributed. Then spoon the mixture into the prepared tin, levelling the surface with the back of the spoon. Bake the cake in the centre of the oven for 3 hours without opening the door, then cover the cake with a double thickness of silicone paper and continue to bake it for a further hour or until the centre feels springy when lightly touched.Cool the cake for 45 minutes in the tin, then remove it to a wire rack to finish cooling. When it's completely cold, wrap in double silicone paper and then foil and store in an airtight container. There's no need to feed this cake as it already has enough booze, but it does improve with keeping for about 1 month before cutting."},

The only thing to report is our drawer organisers arrived, so Jon fit them on Sunday when we returned from Grosmont railway events. I have tried out a couple of NEW recipes - a strawberry victoria sandwich and a freezer roll. The strawberry recipe is a pretty standard one and the freezer roll is basically mine. I sorted out the freezer and came across some frozen burgers, meatballs and a haggis. I have cooked all 3 and made 3 different types of \"rolls\". We wont be having and BBQ's until next year so I have used the basic meat mixtures for winter warming snacks. All the meat from the burgers etc is all from our local butchers so I was determined to put it to good use. I have coffee with my neighbours regularly, this afternoon I will take over the above little sample to Rowena, and have a coffee. N is for nesting box - this photo I took only a few minutes ago, of Margie settling down to lay an egg. The girls continue to supply us with fantastic eggs.So a small update on what's going on here.

Are you that now? What is 1 thing you LOVE about what you do , or who you are?From the age of 7 I wanted to be a nurse. This lasted right up until I was 18. In the August holidays prior to my training commencing I visited a school friend who was just about to commence her teacher training. She was packing her books in a trunk. As I looked through her books I got the \"urge\" to teach!!! I had NEVER considered this at all....but the urge was all consuming, a calling if you like. A year later I too was commencing my teacher training. It led onto a career of 25 happy years. One of the best decisions in my life. My parents, infact everybody was gobsmacked at my change of direction, but Education was the tool which allowed me to change paths. I progressed to Deputy Head Teacher and decided to integrate my job with my home life, finally taking early retirement this year.What do I LOVE about what I do? I can support Jon in his business by helping with sales and marketing and being at home to help the family. I am able to take his mum shopping and to be there for her - as Jon's business often dictates his time and skills. The business is our bread and butter. I enjoy the simple things in life - walking with Freida and enjoying and appreciating where we live, this costs nothing but brings about a feeling of contentment. Money can not buy such times in life.This week's subject :It is Autumn (at least in the U.S). The weather is changing rapidly in several parts of the country. Please share a photo or 2 of what your area of the world looks like.Here are some photos of our village, taken a couple of days ago on one of my daily walks with Freida. This walk takes us up Handale, past the race horse stables, to the duckpond.There are many walks, a recent walk took us up another farm lane to Parkhouse Farm, which you can see herePlease remember to add the Coffee Klatch Friday button to your post and keep encouraging other's to joinThere you go......if you fancy joining in follow the link at the beginning of this post.﻿"},

I bought a fantastic coat from Oxfam for £20, my favourite brand being per una of M&S fame. I saw some boots I quite liked the look of too....I sent off for the boots in August, size 4 like I always get from M&S. They arrived, together with a change in temperature so I more or less forgot about them until this weekend. The weather forecast was particularly cold so I decided to wear my new boots. However on closer inspection I must say the quality was not that good. The fit was not comfortable and I feared \"chaffing\" might take place as the size seemed to be on the larger size. I read reviews on the M&S website, which were very mixed, but quite a few seemed to state the issue of quality etc. Problem was, I had no receipt - fully expecting there to be no problems. I contacted customer services who told me to take the boots back to a local store - which I did, together with the transaction code so the order history could be traced.﻿This I did - and was given a credit note for £85.00, the amount I paid for the boots. A really good response I felt - I had none of the original packaging etc. I will visit our local Clark's shoe shop where I have seen some similar ones, but at least I will be able to try them on and see what they look like in the real sense of matters!Once sorted, I will be sorted for the weather ahead!

It will probably mean we have 4 strips of granite round the sink as it is quite large. Either way £5 is a lot cheaper than breaking a piece of granite and making it worthless. The granite worktops have been placed in position, but again will be cut to size and sealed into place.I am particularly pleased with the roller shutter unit - this will be the only wall cupboard we have, apart from the glass units I showed a coupls of weeks ago.

{"title": "\"au revoir” Phil Thompson", "date": "Friday, September 30", "text": "Yesterday was the funeral of a dear friend of ours. I was asked to say a few words...these are the words.I first encountered Phil with Hilary one day in the record department of WH Smith & Son in 1974. I was doing Christmas relief work in my gap year before going to university. Hilary was my efficient, pristine manageress; nothing flummoxed her that is until Phil would pay her a surprise visit. It was obvious they were made for each other. Fast forward the clocks 12 years, November 1986. Ironically, similar age to Sherry today, I had returned home from teaching in Nottingham when my own Dad died, to look after mum. Cleveland Centre lifts – I recognised the voice – low and behold Hilary and Phil, man and wife. We had a quick exchange of news updates – they had two daughters, Sherri and Gemma, and lived in Guisborough. Fast forward 10 months – I was starting a new teaching job in Guisborough – walking out on my first day who should greet me but Hilary – both Sherri and Gemma were pupils in the same school! A few brief words again. A couple of months later Jon and I moved to Guisborough from Redcar – and guess who lived over the road? Yes Thompson clan. There followed 3 happy years of good neighbours and friendship – the laughs, the gin and tonic, the laughs, the meals, the laughs, the new year’s eves the laughs – yes it was a good 3 years.We moved but kept in touch briefly just catching up on news now and again, but the friendships forged would always be there.I was honoured to know Phil as a doting boyfriend – to Hilary that is, a loyal husband, a proud father and a good friend.It is my firm belief, from personal experience and which I hope is the same for Hilary, Sherri and Gemma that when somebody we truly love dies, they do not simply “go away” they do not leave us, they stay with us – in the very marrow of our bones. The joys we shared we will remember, and smile. The words they shared will be written in our hearts. That is how it is for me. My Dad’s words and aspirations stay with me to this day and are now part of my character, I am proud of this, and Hilary, Sherri and Gemma can be proud too.In life we come across people who leave a mark on us and whose words come back time and again. Phil has been one of those people to me – let me tell you some of the things I always remember –From Jon Hancock, one of my first head teachers – he taught me how to stand on a chair correctly – to this day I do this – with the back of the chair in front not behind. I don’t remember anything about him telling me advice about teaching, but I do remember the correct way to stand on a chair.From my mother – I learned that mules are dangerous slippers and you could easily break your neck when wearing them. I have never bought or owned a pair of mules in my life.From Christine Duck, a school clerk who I worked with for some years I learned that you should always use matching coloured clothes pegs when hanging out the washing – “What would the neighbours think if I did otherwise!” I must admit I don’t use matching pegs, but I think of Christine every time I peg out the washing.From Phil Jon learned that it was bad luck to re-name a ship – he pointed out this to me a couplke of weeks ago just about we were to board the ferry which incidentally had been renamed!From Phil I learned that the essence of a good Bolognese sauce was a few dollops of tomato ketchup! Even to this day I think of Phil every time I make a Bolognese sauce and yes I always add tomato ketchup! Next time you make a sauce – think of Phil, you will be surprised how often he will pop up in your thoughts – which are what we want – for us to constantly think of him and the impact he had on each of our lives.Now we must say \"au revoir” – yes French but expecting and knowing to see Phil again. One of the greatest Naval leaders was Churchill and it is one his quotations I leave you with\"I am prepared to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.\"Yes Phil – let’s see."},

Now I don't mind the ferry crossing because I put myself into a place of gay abandonment - after a nice meal, a bottle of wine I settled down for the night.......Now dear Jon KNOWS I am a light sleeper and after 23 years of marriage knows it is unwise to wake me unecessarily......so when the cabin light came on I awoke immediately.Jon, eyes like saucers was informing me the ferry was turning round - infact it had been for a while and he was convinced we were moving in a circle! The captain made an announcement \"Ladies and Gentlemen we are making a detour as a female passenger has left the ship and is in the water!\"Jon went outside to see what was going on and witnessed the rescue.See the amazing footage from the RAF here.Amazingly the girl survived!The holiday was fantastic and I will share our adventure later as we only returned yesterday and the kitchen is back on.Whilst we were in France we were aware that a hurricane was due for the |North East Coast the day we were returning on the ferry! Needless to say I managed to get myself in a state - a quiet state, just keeping my worries to myself. I must admit when Jon pointed out he had noticed the ship's name had been re-painted, this being bad luck did not really help. Then he pointed out the lower the deck the better or smoother a crossing would be - so to be on deck 1 or 2 was best....we were on deck 9!!! Prone to a bouncy crossing!!My fears were in vain - the crossing was very smooth.We left the ferry around 10am Monday and then came the motorbike ride home - in the wind!I can honestly say it was one of the most frightening moments in my life! I could feel the bike being buffeted by the wind, and held on for dear life.When we finally pulled up outside the front gates I felt a pope moment coming on - all I wanted to do was kiss the ground!Home safe and sound!Phew!For more ABC excitement follow the link on my sidebar."},

{"title": "Baking", "date": "Saturday, August 20", "text": "The Great British Bake Off series is back!Now I must say right now I am not a baker - in fact we don't eat much \"baked\" stuff! Yes I had a bread maker at one point but when there are just the 2 of us there is only so much bread we can eat in one day. Jon always has toast with his breakfast - and an occasional sandwich for lunch and that will be it! Say 3 slices in one day! I may have 1 slice with poached eggs around 11 but no more bread that day. So...the bread maker was not a good idea for us - as it encouraged us to have vast amounts of fresh bread in one day. Oh and the thickness issue was another - when I made my own bread - courtesy of a bread maker - the bread was cut like doorsteps - so well in the region of 4 slices per portion!So I buy bread from our local baker - in fact the bakery itself is next to Jon's workshop. One small sliced loaf lasts us a few days. All fresh, local and the slices are appropriate!BUT........the thing is with cooking programmes they entice you into the web of \"I can try that!\" which is what happened this week.During the programme the contestants had to perform 3 tasks - cupcakes, batten burg and 2 tier cake.Now I have made all these in shape or form - no we didn't have cupcakes - but we did have butterfly cakes  but what the programme brought back to me was the memories of my cake icing successes in my O level domestic science course.When we are out and about on our biking adventures Jon occasionally has a slice of cake with a cup of tea - but cake is something I don't really \"do\".............not being a sweet person! As a result of watch ing the programme I decided to make some cakes - Jon said he does like chocolate fudge cake - so the next day I set to and made 2 cakes and 12 cupcakes - they tasted delicious I am told, in fact Jon said \"They taste just like the real thing!\"I googled the recipe and this is the one I found which had so many good comments and positive feedback.Ingredients175g Self raising flour2 Tbsp Cocoa Powder1 Tsp Bicarbonate soda150g Caster sugar2 Eggs Beaten150 ml (1/4 pint) Sunflower oil150 ml (1/4 pint) Semi skimmed milk2 Tbsp Golden syrup For the Coating and filling 75g Unsalted butter175g Icing Sugar3 Tbsp Cocoa PowderDrop of Milk1. Pre-heat oven to 180ÂºC/350F/Gas Mark 4. Grease and line two 18cm (7 inch) sandwich tins.2. Sieve the flour, cocoa and Bicarbonate of Soda into a bowl. Add the sugar and mix well.3. Make a well in the centre and add the syrup, eggs, oil and milk. Beat well with electric whisk until smooth.4. Spoon the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25 - 30 minutes until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool before turning out onto a cooling rack.5. To make your butter icing, place the butter in a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually sift and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder then add enough milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.6. If the cake has risen a little too high then use a serrated knife to even off the top, now sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more butter icing.I have made another one today (Saturday) as we have friends coming for supper.....watch this space!"},

My previous laptop had gradually got worse and worse, getting to the point of frustration as it would take so may attempts and acts of patience to get online. The problems started creeping in gradually - a few minutes here, a few \"freezes\" here but slowly and slowly the problems developed until it was intollerable. Whilst I am no wizz kid and would never consider myself as a geek (heaven forbid _ I am a blonde after all) I did have the necessary knowledge (basic) to be able to re-format my laptop when things got worse. I also regularly de-bug, defragment and clear up disk space - but enough was enough! Jon is the technically minded one - so on Monday we tootled over to Curry's or is it now PC World - whoever - I think they are all the same now - we went there and after a relatively short time, talking to the geek and looking along the shelves we purchased this one.It wasn't as expensive as the rest but I didn't need the functions which a lot were offering.  The geek asked me if I do much online gaming - did I need a console etc etc (do I look as though I do?) and when we said \"No\" he suggested this one together with a security and office package - and a cordless mouse and case, oh and a flash drive.Arriving home I went through the necessary procedure to start up, link up and get online and here I am!It is a pleasure to use and now I realise how bad the previous one was.Similar thing happened in Homebase. I opened the door to an integrated fridge and was totally blown away! It was the basic model too - but nevertheless I was totally awestruck.Our current fridge is an integrated one too, but it is old and in a serious state of disrepair. A few of the door shelves have broken as have the interior shelves/racks too. It is under the worktop - so not the most accessible. I can hardly wait for the new one to arrive!It just goes to show how I have simply not noticed how  things have deteriorated around me and how we have put up with it all!"},

This was Jon's suggestion - I said it is ABC theme and it must contain a letter \"D\" so he came up with TuesDAY's breakfast! Hmmmm!Although it is summertime and apparently August,  the weather leaves a lot to be desired and we have lit the Rayburn! Originally we  tested it out so that when the colder months came along we would know what to do in a relative short space of time - but the weather has taken a definite turn for the worse and we needed to keep warm, hence the rayburn being on. We are still in the experimental phase - Jon is trying out a variety of fuel - mostly logs during the day and a mixture of logs and coal during the night, I am getting use to cooking with it. I have roasted a joint of pork and made a chicken curry - both quite nice, even if I say so myself.It seems quite a while since we were actually warm throughout the house and I am so pleased we had the Rayburn fitted when we did - nobody anticipated this drop in climate.

I don't want to disrupt the egg laying programme - we currently get 5 a day, so I am easing her off the eggs around teatime. Sometimes when hens become broody they become weak as they do not eat, but when I ease her off the eggs, she leaves the henhouse and makes her way to the food, so I am quite happy with this.The eggs remain wonderful and feature in my breakfast most days.....who could resist this?"},

{"title": "Cupboards!", "date": "Tuesday, August 2", "text": "In my previous life as a primary school deputy headteacher it was my job to lead a weekly school assembly. On one such occasion I was a tad unprepared and grabbed an assembly story book on my way to the school hall, my class in tow.As the assembled listened I read a story. It was about a woman in a village complaining to the elder about her house being too small. The elder told her to go home and put all the cows in the kitchen, the sheep in the living room, the pigs in the bathroom and the chickens in the bedroom. The woman returned home and did this, returning to the elder the following day. She was told to let one animal out each day. Over a period of time the woman did just that - as she did so she felt she had a tiny bit more space. As the animals were let out the feeling of getting more space increased until her house was empty and she was left languishing in the space....no longer feeling the house was small.As I read the story then, and as I recollect it now it made a great deal of sense especially with our current circumstances. Our house looks like a building site and will continue to do so for the next few months, but as we tackle each project we will have our sights set on what it WILL be like in a few months time.I currently am working in a kitchen which is a nightmare - but it is clean and in a few weeks my cupboards will look like thisand I will have a place for everything!For more ABC Wednesday fun follow the link on my sidebar."},

The cement had to \"go off.\" ie dry out. Jon's eyes were glowing with excitement and anticipation when he said \"Shall we light it?\"Now as I have mentioned before, Jon is an avid instruction manual reader and  has been reading up on the scientific operation of a Rayburn for weeks now. The Rayburn was not connected to the central heating system, it was so to speak a stand alone log burner. Jon brought in some kindle, paper and logs and lo the Rayburn was lit!In no time at all the fire was glowing and the room warmed up. Making use of the warm oven I popped a pie inside, would be defrosted and nicely heated through for Jon's dinner. The dial was moving in the right direction.Jon went into the bath and left me to enjoy the lovely warm kitchen. I thought it was a tad smoky but didn't worry too much - and put a couple more logs on.After a short while Jon came downstairs and I said I would go and have a bath too.Now Jon is a very calm, unassuming  chap, so when he said, \"Em don't go in the bath just yet, we may have a fire!\" I did indeed smile - thinking he was joking! He wasn't!There was a fire in the Rayburn.We threw a water soaked old towel onto the burning logs and then, using BBQ tools, Jon lifted the burning logs out and threw them into a bucket outside.After a while the flames inside settled and the fire was under control.Jon hadn't read the part of the instructions which stated \"Never light the Rayburn without filling the water tank with water!\" The thermostat control ie wires etc had melted with the heat of the flames!The new thermostat arrived today!"},
{"title": "Bird's Eye View.", "date": "Sunday, July 24", "text": "This is the plan of our new kitchen. The quality of the photographs is poor but it gives an idea of what it will all look like. The rear patio door, now 20 years old is to be replaced by a door and window. The door has a glazed top and the window is joined on - so the line at the top will continue from the door - it's just the computer software will only show certain options. The sink will be under the window and next to the sink is the dishwasher. The corner unit has concealed opening baskets and next to that are a couple of cupboards, again containing baskets. I am not having any wall cupboards - being 5'1\" I can't reach. However I am having a roller shutter unit which is visible next to the black pillar. The pillar wont be black - again the software shows hidden structures which need to be considered in the design. The roller shutter unit will store the kettle and toaster - and will be out of sight. Here the roller shutter can be seen and then we have a corner unit again with baskets which utilise the space next to a pan drawer unit. The drawer unit has lots of features which help with storage of pans, crockery and cutlery. Next to this is the rayburn - again software just has certain options and the range cooker has the same dimensions as the rayburn. The black wall shows the chimney breast - the walls will be pale yellow/green - or something similar to snug. Next to this is a space where we will store logs. The top gap between the rayburn and the drawer unit will be completed with a chopping board one of our farmer neighbours is making for us, from wood grown in our village. The cupboards above the drawer unit will go right up to the ceiling so there wont be any gaps - solid fuel = dust, another reason why I did not want wall units. They normally have a gap which is ideal for dust to settle! The glass cupboards will be for the various kitchenalia (is there such a word) I have accumulated over the years. I went for the glass doors so I would always have to ensure the cupboards were tidy! There are lights in these cupboards too. On the back wall we have a double larder/storage unit where all food stuffs will be stored. Again these have pull out baskets. Next to these is the built in microwave (where space is) and underneath, the fan oven - for the summer months (I think this is what they are called - we get them so rarely!) Next to this is the built in fridge-freezer.We may have an island/table but once the kitchen is fitted we will decide - we currently have a large table.We have spent a great deal of time thinking and discussing the various aspects of this and I can \"picture\" how it will work. So that's it! Order will be processed on Tuesday and delivery will take 4-6 weeks. This fits in with the various preparations which need to take place - the removal of current units, electrics, plumbing and plastering. The rayburn will be plumbed into the chimney sometime soon - then will be connected to the central heating system and we will fire it up for a trial run!Watch this space!"},
{"title": "Fortune!", "date": "Wednesday, July 20", "text": "For some time the fuel gauge on our pickup has been dodgy. We live with it by noting how much diesel we put in and roughly calculating how many miles we will get to the gallon. When I see \"we\" of course I mean Jon - he has a brain for such details and facts - I just drive! I normally drive for about 150 miles per diesel top - up. A couple of weeks ago I was putting some diesel in when the petrol pump \"clicked\" indicating the tank was full. I tried a couple of times - same \"click\". We reckoned the tank was full and I had about 400 miles worth of fuel. I carried on with my normal day to day routine. I don't do many miles in the pick up just tootle round the village, workshop and local shops. Major distances and journeys would  not be economical for the pick up - we use the van for such journeys.On Monday I was visiting a friend for lunch. Jon was using the van for a delivery so I used the pick up to travel to Grosmont, on the North York Moors. Whilst I was out a friend phoned and asked if I could go with her to the DIY store, in the pick up to collect some plastic sheeting for a gazebo project which she has had nothing but problems with. We agreed I would go to Redcar when I returned home from my afternoon in Grosmont. It just so happened then, at around 4.30 I collected Steph and we tootled off to B&Q a few miles away, collected the sheeting, then drove back to Redcar dropped sheeting and Steph off then made my way home. The main road to our village is shut at the moment due to some roadworks, so we are using the back farm lane - no problem for the pick up - it has a certain presence which allows it to have right of way! lol! Some people tend to drive a tad too fast but we know all the pulling in places so the route is no problem. Later that night we decided we fancied a bottle of wine. Jon had had a stressful day so off we tootled to Loftus. We went in the pick up as it is more suitable up the farm track. Wine purchased we made our way home and parked up the pick up.Tuesday morning - Jon left for work and later when it is my routine to go to workshop with Jon's snack I jumped into the pick up and turned the ignition key. Nothing! The engine turned over then nothing. All the lights were on but nothing was happening. I tried again - same!I phoned Jon who reckoned it had ran out of fuel. According to our (Jon's) previous calculations we should have been ok for another hundred miles - but obviously not.We went to the local petrol station in the van with the petrol can and filled it up. Today Jon read the manual and located the special button under the bonnet which is used in such circumstances - he showed me where to find it so now I know. In the olden days it was quite serious if a diesel engine was allowed to run dry but I am happy to say it started up first time today. First destination - petrol station.I couldn't help but think how fortunate I had been - tootling on the Moors, driving home from B&Q in rush hour with plastic sheeting on the back and driving home on the farm track - when Jon was with me? On any of these occasions if I had ran out of fuel it would have been a major inconvenience - but I didn't. The faithful pick up got me/us home - once home it just let us know it needed a drink! Now how fortunate was that?"},

First  it needs to be fitted into the chimney by means of a flu, then the whole thing needs to be plumbed into the central heating system.Our current kitchen \"evolved\" over a period of 20 years and like with all projects of the same nature some aspects work and others don't...so it is back to the drawing board. We have met up with a couple of kitchen planners and are getting somewhere near the best kitchen for our lifestyle.

{"title": "Cow Incident!", "date": "Saturday, July 16", "text": "Yesterday I was driving out of the village when I came across some fine cows in the middle of the road. We have a traffic diversion at the moment due to some building work, so the traffic was busier than usual. The cows were making their way into a luscious arable field - where they were NOT suppose to be! However, due to a broken gate they could easily have come out of, back onto the main road. I was in the pick-up which is quite an intimidating size to a cow so thinking quickly, I pulled as near to the gate as possible and put on my hazard lights. I then phoned Jon - he worked on a farm as a boy - he'd know something!In my mirror I saw a landrover approaching and recognised it to be a local farmer - he waved as he passed so I flashed my lights and he turned round. He knew whose cows they were so he made his way to tell the farmer involved.Left alone, me, the pickup and the cows I became slightly concerned when they made their way back to the nearside of the vehicle! Fortunately at this moment Jon turned up, jumps out his van and \"shoos\" the cows back into the luscious field. I told him Mick had gone to the farm re the cows so all was OK. \"If the cows come back just make yourself look big!\" was his advice. A mean trick I thought, considering I am about 5'1\" tall and there were about fifteen strapping cows! The cows seemed pre-occupied with eating the crops of the unfortunate arable farmer and I remained in the pick-up.A few minutes passed and the tractor in the distance told me help was on its way in the form of John, the cows owner's son and my neighbour, Emma, his future sister in law. Off they went into the field, John doing a wonderful \"one man and his cow\" interpretation and with a series of whistles, swearing and mad antics, managed to persuade the cows to head for the road. Meanwhile as motorists were approaching the potentially dangerous situation (some at speed) I indicated for them to slow down so as not to freak the cows As the cows were brought up to the front of the pickup I  stopped the  traffic (no problem for a teacher) and ensuring the cows didn't go in the wrong direction waited whilst  John and Emma  brought the cows up, along the road, across the field and onwards to their own pastures! I must get the names of the cows involved - would you believe the same farmer showed one of his special cows at the Yorkshire Show last week! Her name - Denise!!!Village life is never dull!"},

There were some recently felled trees which were available for a contribution to the \"Friends\" funds.We received a pick up full together with some useful tips on chopping wood. Our neighbour chops wood regularly so when we basically asked him about using a chainsaw he said he would be round in a few minutes to show Jon how it was done! We had had a long busy day but were keen to deal with the trees - so last night Jon and Malcolm worked until 9pm. Anne and I moved the logs and stacked them so they could dry out for a year.  Believe me, we were exhausted last night and slept like logs! (groan)We slept through the 7am alarm, rousing at about 7.40. The rayburn was to be delivered between 8am and 9am - so as we were both tired we said we would get up at 8! As I was just about to doze off for another few minutes I heard a van pull up outside our house - in our village we get to recognise the morning traffic - usually being Mick's tractor at 8am as he makes his way to Ronnie's farm. Yes - you've guessed - the Rayburn was early! We jumped out of bed and dressed as quickly as possible before flying down the stairs. The Rayburn was moved to the garage where a couple of hours later a few pals and neighbours together with Jon, rope, trolley and roller negotiated the Rayburn into the kitchen. She (we have called her Sheba as in the arrival of the Queen of Sheba - as never in the history of the Nesbitt household has something been discussed and planned to this degree) now rests on her own concrete plinth, made by Jon's fair hands in the kitchen.On Monday the heating engineer is coming to assess what needs to be done before we can fire her up and rock and roll!I am quite exhausted but love it!

I had never used an iPod before and was determined not to appear the dumb blonde that I am when it comes to new technology. The geek in the store was very helpful and did not try to blind me with science. I asked about an iPod and he told me all about the many games, movies and music I could download. I pointed out it was just the music I was interested in - so the shuffle was suggested. I was impressed by this as it was the cheapest option - the geek did not take the opportunity of flogging a more expensive option to the unsuspecting clueless blonde he was dealing with. (Mind you Jon was at my side!!!)Well we get home and I try it out. Now my experience of plugging anything into the laptop has been that the laptop takes over - ie it knows what to do and what to tell me to do! In this case .....nothing! Conversations with my technically enhanced nephew followed .......result nothing! After a period of utter frustration I worked out, all on my own what the problem was .....the device needed to be fully plugged in to the laptop - - I had not done this.....once done we were away!The main purpose of the exercise was to sort out some good old dancing music for my bash on Saturday. After a couple of failed attempts I succeeded - I not only had files of various music on my shuffle - I had a party selection which, via the help of a certain cable, I managed to play via our all round sound system!A great achievement I think!!"},

We then had to take the rubble to the tip and lay the new plinth ready for the Rayburn, due around the 2nd week of July. The flu is set in a different position from the Aga, this is why a new plinth had to go down - so the flu would go into the chimney in the correct position. It all got rather technical so I left it to Jon! lol! Once the Rayburn arrives the rest of the kitchen re-fitting can go ahead.It seems only a matter of minutes ago that I first mentioned my early retirement plans - and now it is 3 days away!

The activities seem to take place at Ramsey and as has become the norm, we met up with our friend Jane, a blogging friend of many years. (Infact this photograph was indeed taken by Jane.) We headed over to Parliament Square which leads up to the Mountain but the Mountain Road was closed due to an oil spill. In all the 4 years we have been visiting the island the closing of the Mountain Road has become common place. Oil spills are one common cause, but more than normal it is through road traffic accidents, often involving motorbikes. The mountain route forms part of the TT course and during the TT it is one way, so many bikers love to do a few laps of the course itself. I have been round it a couple of times but prefer Jon to drop me somewhere whilst he goes for a gentle tootle!!! (Wink!)We headed down to Peel, after waving goodbye to Jane and after a while headed back to Port Erin.Monday was race day so we took our place at Bradden Bridge    The sun was shining and we witnessed a great day's racing, seeing Michael Dunlop take a win.Tuesday was a special day for a special person!

The weather was just ideal for the journey to Heysham via Northallerton, Bedale, Leyburn, Hawes, (yes I did wave Weaver! lol), Ingleton, Kirby Lonsdale, Lancaster. The ferry crossing was a longer one, taking just over three and a half hours. We sat on deck and the breeze and grey clouds fooled us - days later we would realise we had really caught the sun.This was to be the third year in a row we were to stay in Port Erin. We came here, for a short trip out in 2008 and we fell in love with it straight away.!We arrived in Douglas and eventually as the bikes drove off the ferry we turned left and took the \"All Other Rotes\" journey out of  Douglas. As we headed towards Castletown the memory of the same journey from the last 2 years skipped into place. Taking the signpost to Port Erin, we soon found ourselves riding along the seafront and eventually turning into Port Erin, straight down Station Road to the promenade, where our hotel is situated.The sun was warm on our faces as we made our way to the reception. The receptionist recognised us from 2010 and informed us we are automatically booked in for next year. As 2013 is our silver wedding we have booked a room. Each year our room number drops - apparently the better the view, the lower the room number. 2011 - Room 12, 2012 - Room 8, 2013 - Room 4! Way hay!"},

It is affecting those of us who use BT Broadband - AOL, Virgin users are not affected so I am using a local cafe's internet facility to catch up here, and more importantly to see what everybody else has been up to.I can tell you, there has certainly been Tension in the household - the BT problem occurred as we were making our very first sale on Ebay!!! However, I was pleased to see the Aga go to a new home in Hull. A lady had wanted an Aga for years and being the good chap he was, her husband had the winning big on ours. Last night (Monday) he drove up from Hull, together with a trailer to take our beloved Aga to it new home. Yes I was emotional, yes I cried but felt reassured that it would be looked after in the new home. It has been part of our family for 20 years, in fact we bought it during the very first months of moving to our current home so the kitchen seems very strange without it.I am sure the picture of an Aga is somewhat rose-tinted against the harsh reality of seeing one dismantled, lying in various piles around the kitchen, not to mention the dust and soot. It was all nicely cleaned and hoovered ready for the collection, nearly at the cost of a vacuum cleaner I can tell you! The Aga is packed with an insulating material which looks like grit - certainly of the same size and consistency - but there was tons of the stuff packed around the internal workings - which, to cut a story short managed to escape from the cleaner and distribute themselves around the kitchen - the dust cloud was like something from a science fiction movie and it didn't help my sore throat! Why a sore throat......well on Saturday I had been singing along at the TAKE THAT concert in Sunderland! It was TERRIFIC I can tell you, we had the TIME of our lives.I think I have just recovered - in TIME to prepare for our annual TRIP over to the Isle of Man TT on Saturday. The arrangements are all made, ferry and hotel booked, Elsie, Freida and Ella booked into their various places of luxury accommodation and neighbours looking after hens.We are away for 8 days and I am sure we will have a fun time! It will be a good break from the work we have been doing - and indeed on our return the work will resume - talking of resuming work - I guess it is time for me to return home and chisel away at more TILES!

The doors were originally filled in with cardboard and newspaper - a far cry from what it looked like after we restored it.Whilst I am SAD to see it go, I know it will go to a new home where it will be loved and treasured, just as it was here.The top photograph was taken a few years ago - the blue object is a fairing from one of our motorbikes which we had a little drop on! It was just a cosmetic repair - costing best part of £1,00! When we sold the bike Jon told me to take it down - not a good thing for a prospective buyer to see! lol!Looking at the dresser (press) it has been used to store my various pieces of kitchen memorabilia over the years, but I have conflicting views over saving such stuff - it should be used really, on a regular basis. I tend to keep things \"away\" and then get upset if something is chipped when used. The consequence is a large collection of items never used - something I am hoping to address when the kitchen is revamped.What special kitchen memorabilia to you have? and how to you use/display or store?For m"},

There is little we can do to be honest as once the Aga is removed and dismantled, the concrete plinth will have to be modified for the Rayburn. This is because the  flu is located on the right hand side of the Rayburn, unlike the Aga where it is central. The flu goes straight into the chimney and as we don't want a flu-pipe on a severe slant we will re-position the stove itself. Jon will have to assemble a new plinth which he will do when we return. Once this has set we will be able to re-position and modify the units.The Rayburn is due to be delivered 2nd or 3rd week of July and everything will need to be in place by then. Normally I feel quite flat when we return from holiday but this year it couldn't be further from the truth.I am making plans for our holiday - the pets are all booked into their various places of accommodation and the neighbours are looking after the hens. Over the next few days I will be making copious lists for our holiday and ofcourse I have the Take That concert to look forward to on Saturday - I am very excited about everything coming along - I will just have to exercise a little.............."},

The doors at the right hand side of the picture look out onto the garden and it is still a bright room. The curtains need  hemming which we will work out more accurately when the carpet is down.  We have a large expanse of wall which we are working on next.The fireplace has been removed. This is not a wall with a chimney - only a flu for a gas fire. We had constant problems with the gas, bottled type as we do not have mains gas in the village.We are going to have a wall mounted modern electric coal effect fire and Jon will build a false chimney breast to give the room a feature, bookshelves etc will then be planned for the recess.The laminate floor is being replaced with a carpet. The laminate has been down for 12 years but we really want a carpet. The noise from the floor - ie 2 german shepherds tip tapping across the room of a nightime does become rather tedious. We will be drawing up our plans later this week and then work will commence. We will also be ordering the Rayburn which will look something like this - but ours will have a flu.

Definately white ceilings, coving, doors, architrave and skirting. Walls – hmmmm a creamy pale yellow and a sagey green? Will have a think!Enjoy the weekend!"},

It is calling to me!More of his work can be viewed on the gallery's website hereI think it will look fantastic on the snug wall - even the frame it was in will match the doorknobs! lol!Talking of doorknobs - must get on!

Just making sure there isn’t an inch of wallpaper on the walls ready for the plasterer coming on Friday. I only have today, tomorrow and Tuesday as we are in the Lakes on Wednesday re Jon’s business. The window is a nasty piece of work as it would seem gloss paint has been applied over old paper – so this is taking quite a bit of elbow grease to shift – but I’m on the case. Had a lovely day out yesterday with MIL – went to local for a carvery – delicious, just a shame we had to share a restaurant with the family from Hell! We are ruined really I guess as I always cook for the family. Our nephews absolutely LOVE cooked dinners and woof up all vegetables prepared for them – a joy to cook for really, but yesterday we witnessed children who were not use to eating vegetables and were not going to either – so why insist they eat them when out in public I ask? The tantrums, screams and shouting followed and I am sorry but in a public place ignoring such behaviour doesn’t wash with me. As a child mum would never bring attention to any bad behaviour – no she would speak very quietly, very directed, very much into my face and utter the words I dreaded…”Wait till you get home!” Yes – oh yes, how I feared those words. Still my MIL enjoyed herself which is all that matters. Next year however I notice Mothers Day is near her birthday again so we will be here – peace and quiet!  Right – back to work!"},
{"title": "For mum, with love.", "date": "Sunday, April 3", "text": "Each Mother's Day I wonder how I am going to deal with it. I try to be pro-active and busy myself with organising something family based as Jon's mum;s birthday normally falls round about the same time This year however, with Easter being when it is, Mavis's birthday was 2 weeks ago and we had the family here for Sunday lunch. Today we are taking my MIL out for Sunday lunch.When my mum was alive, we often went for Sunday dinner, she loved cooking for us both especially as we had full-time demanding jobs. On one particular significant Sunday, Jon and I had gone to mum's for Sunday lunch. As always after we had washed up I would take mum to the local supermarket for her weekly shop.On returning to the car I helped mum into the passenger seat with my usual joke..\"Do you want a hand up love\" I would say as I patted her bum when she was getting into the car.She always laughed, and this day was no different.But as she turned to look at me, laughing I was shocked to look and see how old and frail she seemed.As I walked round to the driver's seat I had to fight back the tears and put on a brave face.On our way home I shared what had happened with Jon. That night I had the most vivid, graphic dream about mum's funeral. I awoke distressed and upset. The following day, Monday I went round to mums. Had a cup of tea and a chat.The following day, Tuesday was a teacher training day and after school I popped in to see mum. She told me she had not been feling well, chest pains. I told her to make an appointment with the doctor.Later that night she phoned to say she had made an appointment with the doctor,for the following day, Wednesday. Jon was on early shift so he said he would take her.We were laughing with mum, as she said people might think Jon was her toyboy!At about 3am I awoke with a start.Jon awoke too.I told him I had a void in my soul....as simple and as graphic as that!He told me I was worrying about mum and he would ask mum to come and live with us.I said mum would be very touched by the thought, but she was independent and would prefer to stay at home.What I said went something like this...\"We will have to accept it Jon that one day I will be teaching away at school and there will be a message from the office to say there is a phone call for me. It will be Phyllis, mum's neighbour saying the curtains are closed.I will go round and mum will have died.\"I didn't sleep much after that.The next day I went to school and Viv, the school caretaker asked how mum was.I told her what I had told Jon , practically word for word.And so the day started as normal.Registration, assembly, teaching, I forget what now.At breaktime I was just sending the class out when the school secretary came into my classroom to say there was a phone call for me.I didn't give it a second thought, but as I was going into the office I asked Jan who it was on the phone,\"Phyllis\" she replied.My hand turned into lead and I could barely open the door, let alone pick up the receiver.\"Denise, your mum's curtains are still closed and it is 10.30.\"I knew.The headteacher, Christine said she would drive me to mum's, it was only a few miles from school.When we arrived I let myself in and there was mum, she had died in her sleep on 7th September, on what would have been Dad's birthday.A week later, at mum's funeral I chose this poem to be shared.From Ye Wearie WayfarerQuestion not, but live and labourTill yon goal be won,Helping every feeble neighbour,Seeking help from none.Life is mostly froth and bubble,Two things stand like stone.Kindness in another's trouble,Courage in your own.Adam Lindsay Gordon.I am surrounded by so many things which were mums and in fact are part of our everyday routines and practices.As a child, growing up there was one thing I always wanted, to make mum proud of me.Life hadn't been good for mum and I, but mum always put me first.The photograph I have chosen shows the love and pride in mum's face.It was taken at her surprise birthday party at home, November 2nd 1986.I am handing over the cake. As per usual, in our family, somebody missed my head off!But that is unimportant, it is mum's face which says it all!Mum always told me, that in the event of her death there would be a letter for me.The day she died, as I sat with her waiting for the doctor I went to the place she had told me about and sure enough, there was the letter.It stated how much mum loved me, was so happy for Jon and I, and we were to remember her with smiles, not tears."},

{"title": "Memory Lane", "date": "Wednesday, March 30", "text": "When I was stripping away the wallpaper yesterday I came across this piece of wallpaper. It was the very first design we used in what was then, our new home - twenty years ago. The previous owners used our now snug as a dining room. The carpet was a navy blue and I used this on the lower part of the walls with a navy and claret floral design above.     I also came across this carpet - the very best that money could buy. Again, some twenty years ago. I bought this when I was \"acting\" deputy headteacher for a few terms - the rise in my pay was put away and this is what we bought with it. An accident from our border collie Tess stained the carpet and despite endless treatments and cleaning the stain remained. I vowed then I would never spend such a great amount on carpet again - or at least one which would not clean up!     Well as you can see the stripping of the walls has finally finished and my preparation work for the plasterer has now finished. Jon now needs to do some door furniture stuff, put some light switches in and remove the radiator. The plasterer came last night to size up the job and he will be coming towards the end of next week This gives us a week then! Wayhay!        The room seems much bigger without the cupboards – so we have decided not to put them back – we will find somewhere else for them to go. For now I am using a table from the lounge to stand the TV on. I must say I am sleeping well – like a log  . Fortunately the amount of preparation in the snug is the most we will have to do downstairs as the remaining rooms have all been plastered since we moved here, nevertheless there is still plenty to do. Following the problems I had loading pictures the other day I am now using Windows Livewriter – much more reliable!"},

I am looking forward in seeing the room plastered because then we will have arrived at my favourite part of the project - chosing colours. However I am not rushing anything - Jon said we should enjoy what we do and we are so far. Must say the main colour wont be much different from what it was - I have always loved daffodil white but the chimney breast will be a shade different!We will be removing the curtain pole as I am having a roman blind made with the curtain fabric above.

Whilst I was writing this we received a telephone call to say the new door + window for the kitchen were ready - so we nipped round to collected them and they are now in the shed. All being well they will be fit next weekend. Once they are fit we can make the next move with the kitchen.

{"title": "J - just when you thought all was sorted!", "date": "Tuesday, March 22", "text": "ABC Wednesday is here againLike many people out there we are concerned about the rising costs of heating our home. Our central heating is oil fuelled. The tank holds 1,000 litres of heating oil - when we first had the oil tank installed it cost £200 for 1,000 litres. This winter we have been paying £300+ for 500 litres. We have gone back to the drawing board and decided NOT to replace the Aga I repeat NOT to replace the Aga. It only heats one radiator - a Rayburn will heat up to 10 radiators and is multi-fuelled. It will run on coal, peat and wood. Whilst when burning wood on it the heat will not be as intense as it would be if we used coal, nevertheless we have a good source of wood and logs in the village.As Jon is chief heating engineer we went to visit a chap who was selling his Rayburn in order to have a good discussion about the general running and maintenance of such a beast. Jon's eyes lit up at the sight of the various controls - thermostats, knobs, dials, levers, you name it, the Rayburn has it with bells on. Jon liked the idea of managing the efficiency with a twiddle of a few knobs.The Rayburn is slightly smaller than the Aga but this will not present any problems. Now colour - I am fancying a pistachio/green/aqua one - will fit in nicely with my colour scheme.If the nice weather continues we may have a period of time where we will let our Aga go out and be dismantled but no hurry just yet. We still have lots to do. Our Aga will be recycled and will be sold on to somebody else probably in part exchange for the refurbished one we will buy. Costs are cheaper than the Aga and should allow us to save considerably on our fuel bills!Watch this space!"},

He will sow some grass seed later. My potatoes have been chitting along nicely so I planted some of them in the small raised bed behind my greenhouse. I was going to fill all 4 sections but some friends popped in for a coffee so I only did 2 of the sections - I will finish the job tomorrow. Although I worked outside for a while I wanted to keep on track with my DIY target so I removed some more rails from wall 2 in the snug. Only 2 more to do by the end of the week.

This is how it looks now. My job this week is to remove all wooden rails and shelves. The fireplace will then be removed. The cupboards will remain but will be painted to match the doors. New skirting board will be fitted. Jon's moving onto lighting this week! The carpet will be replaced with a green one to link to the kitchen floor tiles.

It is in fact an original linen press and I had the drawers made to match. When we first moved here, our neighbour, Alice gave me the top - she kept the dog food in it, the doors covered in newspaper. We had it stripped and it sat on top of the drawers in our kitchen. Whilst our house is not small, it simply wasn't big enough to house this and give it it's true glory.I knew if it went to the salerooms it would not fetch it's true price, so today I contacted my good friend Phil at Eskdale Antiques. This is where we had our kitchen cupboards made. Phil has agreed to sell this for us - people visit his shop for good pine furniture and are people who would see the beauty of such a treasured item! Yes, a huge relief.Now - on with the preparations - \"Lead on MacDuff!\""},

The builder came today and this is what we agreed. He has done work for us before and Jon has done some engineering work for him so we all know each other. This now means I have a week to empty the snug - all the books must be packed away and the cupboards emptied.This is the type of door we are having - to match the rest in the house. Notice however where the knob is placed - the current ones  have the knobs slightly higher - inline with the door furniture but we are changing the fittings so they all look the same - aesthetically I think they will look much better. Before Saturday we are looking at the pipework behind the Aga and possibly moving the washing machine. Once the door is fitted we will move our focus into the snug for a week and probably fit the fire. Jon will be doing some electic work too as we are short on sockets and the lighting is poor! I say a week because on Tuesday (15th) we have a chap coming to measure up for the new door and window to replace the patio doors here in the kitchen. He said it normally takes him 2 weeks to make, deliver and then fit, so this should take us to the end of March. Once the door is fitted the fridge and freezer will be moved and the worktop modified. The cupboards will then be modified accordingly and my shelves will be fitted. The Aga can only be restored once the weather is warm enough for us to switch it off as it will need to be dismantled. Jon will do the work on the barrell and any necessary plumming jobs to improve it's performance during the summer - if we get one! lol! Once the Aga is restored it will be ready to try it out! September/October - it depends on the weather.The building jobs set the plan really and we are enjoying the process. We have to really as such tasks are out of our hands. Using reliable workmen is imperative. Tomorrow we are having a day off - if we get out on the motorbike it will give me chance to plan how the snug is going to be emptied.

Also - we would be in trouble if we had a powercut - as we do form time to time. Jon is going to strip it down and recondition the barrell - the main fuel source and this will increase it's efficiency.

{"title": "Three things.....big one, expensive one and a small one.", "date": "Friday, March 4", "text": "Big one -We have started on the journey of the big DIY adventure (?) here in the Nesbitt household. Yesterday we e-mailed the Planning Department informing them of our idea to change a window for french doors at the front of our house - where we get the sun on an evening. Looking up our drive the window you can see is the one in question, the front kitchen wondow. I had a chat with the voice on the end of the phone, I have her name and direct contact number. This will form part of the building work and this needs to be done first. The other building work involves knocking a doorway from the kitchen to the snug and replacing the kitchen patio door with a door and window - more worktop space under the window.Expensive one - we have ordered our Aga - it is a brand spanking new one , electric with AIMS fitted. We spent a good time discussing, comparing, deliberating and in the end we went for this option - yes it is cream. We were pleased (as one can be when having ones eyeballs taken out) with the deal we made. Our Aga will return to the big Aga factory in Shropshire where it will be recycled but will come out more stronger and efficient - a bit like a Dr Who moment - I forget what the correct term is - but I know you will understand. To be perfectly honest (am I anything but?) Agas are expensive - we know that but when it came down to it £1,500 was the difference - lots of factors came into the equation but it all boils down to the fact that we got a good price for ours, we bought our new one local (Malton) it has a 5 year warranty! It will be delivered in the summer - I am sure I will let you know when!Small one - yet very important - I am altering my beloved curtains this weekend and fitting (with the help of my neighbour Anne) these little things - eyelets. I removed the curtain tape from the curtains last night and bought the necessary tape and fittings today. This is my weekend project.! I have never been any good at hanging curtains - so this should be an eye-opener!Watch this space!"},

I would like to think we have been good neighbours. On many an occasion she has asked Jon to fix various things for her, which he did so gladly. Her sit on mower, strimmer, electrical stuff. When she had problems with her water supply we told her to use ours, even running a hosepipe through the paddock and into her drive. I have shopped for her, we phoned her regularly during the bad weather to see she was ok. A keen crafter I often placed orders for her via the internet. I would like to think she knew she knew where we were should she have ever needed anything.A week or so ago we heard she was returning back down South to be with her family. A few times I was in the paddock tending to the chickens and shouted over to her, the usual greetings or weather observations - you know the normal neighbourly exchanges - but she never said anything about moving.On Monday we were both walking to the mobile library so I asked her if she was all sorted re moving. \"Well there is so much to do ON MY OWN\" she emphasised! I asked her when she was planning to move - \"Wednesday or Thursday if I get everything done - without ANY HELP!\" \"It is so difficult when I haven't had any help from anybody!\" Fortunately at this point we were at the library van. She banged her books on the counter and announced she could be deleted from the records as she wouldn't be using the library anymore, because she was moving back down south. I made my choice of library books as she left the van, no further words were spoken.Yesterday, 6.30am the removal truck arrived and after packing and shifting various boxes etc. it left the village, followed by neighbour in car. The cottage is rented and we know our new neighbours - a young couple with a young baby. Robbie's family have lived in the village for 3 generations - all farmers. His parents are our neighbouring dairy farmers, his brother works on the farm too. Jon and Robbie get along together - it should be fun. We get on with all our neighbours knowing them all by name and always exchanging greetings when we pass in the village or at various events - but with departing neighbour? I just don't know."},

The hens, and Ernest all went into henhouse 2 and have been going in every night now and laying their eggs in one of the nesting boxes. This is Great News! We are now up to full production.

We thought we had it all sorted really.......we would trade in our current Aga for a reconditioned electric one! Then...................I was doodling about on the laptop and I came across an Aga dealer offering a brand new one at a competative price - so competative it was cheaper than a reconditioned one! We decided to have a drive to Catterick and have a close look at a reconditioned one.Whilst we were out that way we popped in to see Pat and The Farmer for a coffee! What a lovely day we had. Jon and the Farmer were having a deep discussion about Agas - at one point Jon was on the floor with his head practically inside the Aga! Pat and I were enthusing about the joys of chicken keeping (see Pat's chickens above)I have the feeling we will we popping in again! Pat and the farmer live so near to a popular biking road we use often and it always nice to know a place where we can stop and warm up!Yes a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Change of plan!", "date": "Saturday, February 26", "text": "Yesterday we had a drive over to our local Aga Dealer, in Malton, and had a long look at the colours. The cornflower blue has been replaced by a powder blue which didn't do anything for either of us. Navy blue was a possiblility and would have fitted in with the house colour - ie we live in an ex-police house which has navy blue garage doors and guttering, but we felt it was too dark for the kitchen. I was keen on a black one but again too dark. In the end we decided to stay with cream! The curtains which I am using for the theme throughout the downstairs of the house have a cream background so I will use this as an inspiration for the kitchen cour scheme - so duck egg blue could still feature. The Aga will be replaced once the weather improves and our current Aga isn't in use. This will be part exchanged, refurbished and sold on by the dealer. The new Aga will be much more efficient as it will have an electronic timer. The Aga Intelligent Management System (AIMS) The Aga Intelligent Management System (AIMS) is a sophisticated program, which allows you to adjust the output of your Aga to suit your way of life using a remote-control handset. In short, it means that your Aga can sleep when you sleep and only operate at normal power when you need it. The AIMS program offers you:· Ultimate flexibility · Day/Month/Year selection · Two pre-set active periods each day · Holiday mode · Override featureWhat can AIMS do for you? Using the pre-set mode, your 13-amp electric Aga will:· Cook breakfast in the morning at normal temperature· Drop to a low temperature during the day· Return to normal temperature to cook dinner· Enter slumber mode at the end of the dayShould you go on holiday, the system can also program your Aga to: · Remain on the lowest energy setting or switch off· Automatically restart in time for your arrival homeIn addition, the holiday mode allows for full day/month/year selection to allow for longer holidays and any program setting. Any program setting can also be easily overridden by the simple pressing of a button on the Aga itself.I currently have a seperate electric cooker which I use in the summer, but this will be sold as the AIMS system will allow the Aga to be used instead!Am getting excited now!"},

Well on Sunday we were working in the garden (see posts below for discovery under motorbike seat!) and would you believe there was FIFTEEN eggs in the hedge all together? I brought them all into the kitchen and placed them in a large bowl of water - the fresh ones remained on the bottom of the bowl whilst the other, not so fresh were a tad lighter. The lighter ones I dried and marked and placed them back in the nest - the rest I washed and used.I noticed Mabel was acting strangely too - she is laying eggs in the front lawn, behind an old wooden garden seat used by the birds when they are feeding from the tree!Later that night we had a change in the sleeping arrangements - Ernest and Mabel were joined by Margie and Olwyn - the night after however we were back to the regular arrangement margie, mabel and Ernest in Henhouse 1and here we can see from the left, Bev, Olwyn, May and Eva! We know how cold the night is going to be by how they settle - if they cuddle together we know it is going to be cold. If - as is the case here they are quite spaced out it tells us the night is not so cold! Whilst I was watching the birds feed look what I spotted heling himself to some bird food - a wonderful pheasant who lives at the bottom of the garden! So, all seems well with the Nesbitt hens! We STILL need to find where Bev is laying her eggs though - goodness knows how many she has stashed away!More next week!For more ABC Wednesday fun visit here"},

Today, Jon decided to check the motorbike over as it will need to have an MOT test asap so it will be ready to tax for March 1st. The battery was flat so Jon had to charge it up. When he removed the seat – look what he discovered! A door mouse had made its home there over the winter months. It had nibbled through the plastic bag containing the map book and also part of Jon’s waterproof trousers. I quickly got the camera and captured the moment! He didn’t seem bothered by Jon or myself and Jon checked over the various electrics and wiring to ensure it had not nibbled through anything important It would appear it hadn’t. The Dormouse and the Doctor by A. A. Milne There once was a Dormouse who lived in a bedOf delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red),And all the day long he'd a wonderful viewOf geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).A Doctor came hurrying round, and he said:'Tut-tut, I am sorry to find you in bed.Just say 'Ninety-nine' while I look at your chest....Don't you find that chrysanthemums answer the best?'The Dormouse looked round at the view and replied(When he'd said 'Ninety-nine') that he'd tried and he'd tried,And much the most answering things that he knewWere geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).The Doctor stood frowning and shaking his head,And he took up his shiny silk hat as he said:'What the patient requires is a change,' and he wentTo see some chrysanthemum people in Kent.The Dormouse lay there, and he gazed at the viewOf geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue),And he knew there was nothing he wanted insteadOf delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red).The Doctor came back and, to show what he meant,He had brought some chrysanthemum cuttings from Kent.'Now these,' he remarked, 'give a much better viewThan geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).'They took out their spades and they dug up the bedOf delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red),And they planted chrysanthemums (yellow and white).'And now,' said the Doctor, 'we'll soon have you right.'The Dormouse looked out, and he said with a sigh:'I suppose all these people know better than I.It was silly, perhaps, but I did like the viewOf geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).'The Doctor came round and examined his chest,And ordered him Nourishment, Tonics, and Rest.'How very effective,' he said, as he shookThe thermometer, 'all these chrysanthemums look!'The Dormouse turned over to shut out the sightOf the endless chrysanthemums (yellow and white).'How lovely,' he thought, 'to be back in a bedOf delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red.)'The Doctor said, 'Tut! It's another attack!'And ordered him Milk and Massage-of-the-back,And Freedom-from-worry and Drives-in-a-car,And murmured, 'How sweet your chrysanthemums are!'The Dormouse lay there with his paws to his eyes,And imagined himself such a pleasant surprise:'I'll pretend the chrysanthemums turn to a bedOf delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red)!'The Doctor next morning was rubbing his hands,And saying, 'There's nobody quite understandsThese cases as I do! The cure has begun!How fresh the chrysanthemums look in the sun!'The Dormouse lay happy, his eyes were so tightHe could see no chrysanthemums, yellow or white.And all that he felt at the back of his headWere delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red).And that is the reason (Aunt Emily said)If a Dormouse gets in a chrysanthemum bed,You will find (so Aunt Emily says) that he liesFast asleep on his front with his paws to his eyes."},

The group is a great group of people and over the course of the months we have all been attending, we have become great friends. We laugh so much - it is a great night.Two weeks ago I had an unpleasant incident with some kippers - I think I mentioned it briefly here. Basically after 24 hours of intense bodilly functions I was amazed to discover at my weekly weigh-in that I had GAINED 2 lbs!!! This last week has been a week of gay abandonment! The Thursday saw me and  a couple of my girlfriends enjoying the  birthday of one of the group. The other member, the chef is an absolute master in the culinary skill/knowledge department....so lunch was out of this world! Friday - I bought a meal deal at Sainsburys - absolute corker of a deal which I managed to get two fabulous meals from. Sunday - it was raining and Jon ; I went to Whitby for fish and chips. Monday was Valentine's day and we had an absolutely FANTASTIC meal out at our favourite restaurant. Prawn Cocktail, Sirloin Steak, Cheese & Biscuits and wine. Tuesday and Wednesday - nothing spectacular but nothing particularly good either - diet wise. I wondered whether or not to go to Slimming Club - in the end I went....dreading the result when I ambled onto the scales. Result?

{"title": "Ere, there and everywhere!", "date": "Tuesday, February 15", "text": "It's quite entertaining keeping hens! Over the past few days it has been great news to see them get back into the egg laying process. I guess like people (well me) some of them are not morning creatures, whilst others are. This morning when I let them out of their respective henhouses I found two nestled away. By the colours I know these were from Eva and May, the two orange coloured hens. Absolutely gorgeous too I can tell you!Ernest has settled in just fine. He sleeps in Henhouse 2 with his flame Mabel, but on some occasions Bev and Margie spend the night in there too!  This is henhouse 2 (former goosehut) as I took this photograph I could make out the form of Mabel inside, settling down to lay an egg. Yes, sure enough she was inside .....whilst Ernest waited outside!Our hens have a very good life really - they certainly have lots of space in which to roam. They cross over the front lawn, onto the wall. under the fence and have a real good forage in the field next door. Whilst I was taking the photographs I noticed Margie, the white hen hanging away from the rest of the hens.  Look why! She has been making a nest in the hedge between the wall and the field. Sure enough, when I went back outside about an hour later there she was!I also noticed Bev hanging around the same part of the fence - so now I am wondering if she is laying some in there too? Bev lays blue eggs and there hasn't been any over the past week - so somewhere there is a clutch of blue eggs!I am enjoying documenting our hens - if you would like to receive my daily hen news just drop me a line to my e-maildenise dot nesbitt at bt internet dot comFor more ABC Wednesday fun go here"},

I think over the past weeks I have realised I am a cheerful person and the reasons I have stated really should form part of a regular mantra. The three reasons I am stating this week are basic yet so central to my cheerfulness/contentment but really should NEVER be taken for granted.16, I have good health. 17. I have good friends.18. I have a good, loving family.This week something happened which has really annoyed me. I am not one to rant yet as the days have passed I find myself thinking more and more about it. On Wednesday we had a visit from a firm of financial sdvisors, endorsed by my teaching union. We read the literature prior to his visit and were aware he would try and sell us something be it life insurance or investment suggestions - neither of which we intended using the firm for - we just wanted to know my entitlement/settlement details. I have life cover etc. Anyway I am rambling - he asked me if there was anything I intended to buy. I said I would like to buy some artwork. Art was ALWAYS my favourite subject to teach and I felt this would be a good momento of the 25 happy years I spent as a teacher. I also thought Mackenzie Thorpe would be an appropriate choice - he is a local artist and his work features the local Yorkshire Moors......however I think I just may go for a something by the amazing artist Jackie Morris - will share more later!Well this chap was so against MY choice - he dismissed it straight away. Shortly after he left, saying he would return at a later date - well so he thought. We will NOT be setting up another meeting thank you VERY much and I WILL be buying some pictures THANK YOU very much!The very nerve!

I have been letting the hens out at different times and slowly introducing them to each other. Today is the first time they are all out together and as I type away I am aware that a drama is about to unfold!Ernest is holding his own and is keeping the hens amused. There seems to be some friction between a few of the hens but I am hoping this sorts itself out. Whilst I have been quite in control of the situation my managing time in/out of the henhouses I know that sooner or later I am just going to have to let them be together and sort out any issues.A couple of hours ago I was aware of quite a comotion in the paddock. Mabel was clucking very loudly, obviously wanting to be in Henhouse 1, on the shelf laying an egg. Unfortunately Eva had the same idea and was sitting quite happily on the shelf. Fast foreward a couple of hours and a few minutes ago I popped round to find Ernest and Mabel on shelf in Henhouse 1, sitting quite happily together. Henhouse door is open, so it will be interesting to see what develops over the next couple of hours!Watch this space - I will keep you updated on any happenings!More action can be discovered over on ABC Wednesday's blog!﻿"},
{"title": "Showhouse Stuff!", "date": "Sunday, February 6", "text": "We live quite a cocooned life really, so as we have been thinking about our future home improvement plans we thought we would visit a couple of show homes to get some basic ideas and to see what is happening in the big world of DIY. In June we will have lived here for 20 years so we are totally out of touch with what is available now. Now I know showhouses are very modern and basic - our house was built in 1956 so we don't want it to look like a showhouse (as if) but there were elements we saw which we both liked. Excuse the colour issue here - not sure what's going on. We both liked the layout of this kitchen/diner. The picture above was taken looking straight at it, and then I turned to my right and took the adjoining wall - you can see the wall cupboards continuing. This layout would be similar to what we could do in our kitchen - but through the doorway would be our utility room leading out onto the patio. The downlighters are something we want throughout the downstairs of our house. We loved the pull out cupbards the lights under the units were quite something! We are having a shower fitted above the bath - the lights were colour changeable - we liked that idea! We liked the french doors - the front of our kitchen overlooks the front lawn - where we get the sun on an evening - an ideal place for a BBG and sitting area! We liked that idea. To the right you can just see Jon's arm - behind him was a door leading to the utility room - in our case the door would lead to the snug where we would just have a wall mounted TV and sofa. We saw a few wall-mounted TV's and modern fireplaces - again, something to think about! We looked at 4 showhouses - the idea of having a bold wallpaper on one wall seemed to be the in thing, but as our walls are to be re-plastered we will just be having emulsion - however I do fancy stepping outside my comfort zone of magnolia and experimenting with some colour! I quite fancy an aubergine chimney breast!!!! At one showhouse we met another couple It just so happened the chap was an electrician - so he gave us his number and we'll be contacting him this week to come round and give us some quotes. He works in a lot of modern houses so he had knowledge of the latest kit AND can get a great discount!All in all a good day. I feel focussed."},

It is a wonderful feeling when the horses in the ajoining fields fit in with our pace and walk along side us - a great way to start the day!3.

Its urge to cross the road justifies any means to do it. -Shamel: Because it saw a colorful rooster.-Sigmund Freud: To wonder why the chicken crossed the road is an indication of suppressed sexual desires.-Buddha: asking such a question is denying the nature of all chickens.-Jim Carry: Finally! I thought it’ll never cross!!!-Stephen Segal: You tell me!-Charles de Gaulle: Maybe it crossed the road but not the highway!-Einstein: whether the chicken crossed the road or the road itself moved towards it, this all depends on the chicken speed multiplied by the number of its footsteps.-George W Bush: This action is a flagrant violation of the UN resolutions. Just the mere notion of the chicken crossing the road without punishment is considered a threat to democracy, freedom and justice. Hence, this proves to us that we should’ve unquestionably destroyed that road long time ago. So, to keep piece in the region, and in order to protect the values we fought for, we decided to send our troops to demolish all poultry farms in that area. This way, no other chicken will be tempted to cross the road again. -Hamlet: This is not the question.-Othello: It felt jealous and decided to revolt.-Nietzsche: because when you look at the road for too long, the road will start looking at you.-Shakespeare: It didn’t cross the road, but the road tempted the chicken to cross.-Oscar Wilde: I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.-Mu`ammar al-Qadhafi : I forgot.I laughed at the above - I know many of you reading this will have to...But getting back to the story....If you remember, last week I told of the iminent arrival of our banty cockerel - companion to Mabel, our hen who had taken up residence with neighbours. Well, the neighbours were moving so it was decided that Mabel would return to the Nesbitt Henhouse complex, together with loverboy himself!All was planned, so on Saturday night Mabel and Cockerel arrived in their hackney sack cab!They were placed into Henhouse 2 and left for the evening. It was at this point I asked neighbour if he had a middle name.\"Ernest\" was the reply - hence the appropriate name for cockerel.Foolishly, on Sunday morning I opened the door.Ernest and Mabel scuttled out and Ernest spent no time in making a dash for field next door where he spent a cpouple of hours. I let the other hens out and after a while was marvelling at the way they were all integrating - Ernest included. As I chatted to my SIL on the phone I saw Mabel walk along the pavement OUTSIDE the house, ie next to the main road. I dashed outside to see her cross the road, walk through the farmer's field, back to neighbours. Apparantly she was wanting to return home to lay an egg. We left her settle. At dusk I was ushering the hens into their henhouse. Ernest followed them in, but Olwyn, large brown one started pecking him. He made a swift exit into henhouse 2, closely followed by Margie the white hen. Later, Mable was brought back and placed into the same henhouse and soon settled down with both Ernest and Margie, Ernest in the middle of them both. We are leaving them settle for a couple of days - I am taking water and fresh food every morning and evening. In a couple of days we will let them out and see what happens!Watch this space!To see more ABC Wednesday contributions visit here"},

For round 8 I am using my home and life as a theme, sharing various posessions and keepsakes.B is for Bev - one of our hens.Bev is a Black Marran breed and gives us Blue eggs!﻿We have not had many eggs of late but a few weeks ago Olwyn started laying the occasional egg. Olwyn is one of the larger brown ones. A few days ago Bev joined in with the laying and now lays an egg each day. When I let the hens out each morning there is usually 1 or 2 eggs in the henhouse. Eva or May have joined in again, I know this by the colour of egg. Last year Bev became broody, along with Mabel and spent a while over the road with a neighbors eggs. Bev was not successful in hatching hers, but Mabel was. Sadly the snow was the unexpected hazard and her chick died. Bev returned here and after a short period of establishing a pecking order, soon integrated with the rest of our hens. In the meantime it would seem Mabel has a fan! A banty cockerel who sits by her side day after day and follows her wherever she goes. She will be returning home sometime this week - together with the new love of her life.

My little finger on my left hand is bent.This is a result of a fall in a netball match, teachers v. pupils, back in 1980.It remained weak and lo and behold I dislocated it again about 8 years ago.Quite simply it was knocked and jumped out of joint.One day I will get it fixed, but know it will be painful!2. My middle name is Elizabeth, after my nana who was Eizabeth Ellen, known as Dolly.The family came over from Germany just at the beginning of the war.Her father was a clockmaker. The name was Schumacer, so I may be related to Michael!3. When I was 16 I worked as a nurse aid in a local hospital, now demolished.I was based on the men's medical ward.One job I had to do was to \"prepare\" the patients for surgery.This meant shaving private areas with a razor!4. I can play the spoons.I find the older, soup spoons are the best.5. I enjoy pease pudding .I did not eat it for over 15 years following a school dinner episode when I was 7.On a table of 6, I was the only one who liked it, so I swapped my dinner with the others on my table in return for their pease pudding.I ate a whole plate full!I wasn't very popular that afternoon!6. I have evil thoughts about a former teacher, Mr. Pallister.When I was 9 and not liking cheese pie or coconut pudding he made an example of me in front of the whole junior school, by forcing me to eat them both!\"People like me pay taxes so people like you can have free school meals!\"Were the kind words he said at the time.Soon after my dinner I played skips and was sick.I was so frightened I ran home to Auntie Dot.I can picture her to this day, baking at the kitchen table.She walked straight to the school, apron on, rolling pin in hand.My family had a whip round and from then on I did not have a free school meal again, even though I was entitled to them.7. I was banned from Weightwatchers in 1986.I was in the meeting with my friend, we were chatting quietley. However the leader was not happy with this.She turned and shouted \"Would you like to share the secret of your success with the rest of the class Denise?\" She bellowed!\"Before I came to Weightwatchers I would have a cooked breakfast, go to school and have tea and biscuits.At playtime I would have more tea and biscuits.Lunchtime I would have a school dinner.Afternoon break, tea and biscuits.Home for tea then out for a few drinks with friends, followed often by fish and chips.Home for cocoa and a biscuit!\"I replied.\"And what now?\"She asked..\"I don't have a biscuit with my cocoa!\"Was my reply!\"Your attitude is not welcome here at Weightwatchers!\"Meanwhile she had been holding a bread roll up which she had poked her finger into...to show us how much starch was in the bun.As we stood up my friend shouted..\"If you are going to abuse that roll I have it?\"We never went back, but I did loose 20lbs!Over to you!"},
{"title": "Sharing my plans for the kitchen", "date": "Saturday, January 22", "text": "I am joining in a new meme this week and what better way than to introduce myself by showing you round my kitchen - as it is now. I LOVE this room as I love cooking and will be really inspired when the work is finished.This wall is between the snug and the kitchen - because the kitchen is SO warm when the Aga is on we feel there is sufficient heat to warm both rooms - so we are knocking through into the snug and having double doors here. All of the wall cupboards are going to become base for book shelves. The dresser is going to be painted and will go on the far left wall next to the window. I am quite fancying a pale sage green colour for the units as the granite worktops have a green hint of colour. The base units will be used elsehere too﻿ The Aga will stay put but the lids will be replaced and the black top re-enamelled, it should look like new Jon wants to strip down the inside﻿ and refurbish any worn parts. To the right of the Aga we are having a cupboard fitted which will do right up to the ceiling - no gaps for dust. This will be covered with a shutter so the microwave etc will be hidden. The patio doors (which are old anyway) are being replaced by a single door and ajoining window. This will allow another unit to be fitted under the window. The washing machine and fridge will be housed here, integrated. The white appliance you can just see is the dishwasher. This will hidden when another wooden panel is fitted infront of it, making it integral too. All tiles are coming down, all wall cupboards are coming down and being used  for storage in the porch﻿. You will notice just behind the sink the wall dips back. I am having a shelf fitted and my crockery (all white) will sit here - straight from the dishwasher. The cupboard in the left corner, currently home to the washing machine will become my pantry. It was one originally but the door was in the hall. We moved it into the kitchen. The floor tiles will remain and again the cupboards will be painted.I am clicking at my heels to begin! The colour theme will run through the house - inspired by my curtains.How is this for coincidence - I googled \"Next Alium Curtains\" a few minutes ago - these are the curtains I have in both the snug and large lounge - bought for next to nothing at the Next Clearance. I love them. Anyway, I came across a link in Google images to a lady who is selling a pair - large size (the curtains not the lady)...and now I have bought them so will have sufficient to make a kitchen blind! Way hey!"},

The plans we have for updating the house are coming together. I am particularly happy about the decisions we have made for the kitchen. The pine units are staying, be it a bit of moving and shaking but we are reversing the doors and having a shaker theme. The Aga too is staying and is having a make over. The dust produced from a solid fuel Aga is a huge amount so I don't want any coving or fancy pelmets on any of my cupboards anymore. I have had 20 years of it. All wall cupboards are coming down but going elsewhere in the house. I am a frugal person to heart and I just can not replace the units for the sake of it. No - they are all staying - I look forward to sharing the pictures of our progress.2. My neighbour has agreed to come with her sewing machine and help me get to grips with mine. One of my New Year's Intentions was to develop my sewing ability. Margie use to be a lecturer in Home Economics and is an excellent sewer. We had a good chat today and we even discussed making loose covers for our settees! lol! Still - watch this space and be prepared to be amazed/shocked/disgusted! Time will tell!3.

It is solid fuel (amthrocite) and we have it on in the cold months - which let's face it is most of the year Generally speaking Jon usually lights it around the end of Septemmber/beginning of October and we keep it going (well Jon does) until warm Spring days. As you look at it - the bottom left door is the door which is opened when the ash pan is taken out. The top right door is the hot oven and the bottom right door is the warm oven. The lids on top shield the hotplates - the left one is the hot one and the right one is the simmering one. The black square box behind the hotplates is the entrance from the flu to the chimney, this means any smells go straight up the chimney - burning food and all! If I put something in the oven I have to use a timer so I don't forget about it!Needless to say, especially when there is a bit of a wind up, the kitchen is warm, very warm and being the frugal person I am, I like to make the most of it. I ALWAYS wash something after teatime knowing if I hang it on the airer it will all be dry in the morning, so indeed when this is the case I go into Widow Twanky mode and wash everything in sight! I also like to make the most of the ovens and have something slow cooking all the time, or at least most of the time. In a few days I have cooked enough meals to keep us going for a month!Over the next few months we are re-modelling parts of our house and the kitchen is one of these parts. I look forward to sharing our progress and thoughts - with lots of pictures!This is Round 8 of ABC Wednesday and this time I am using our home as a theme and look forward to sharing various possessions, keepsakes and favourite objects over the next few weeks!"},

This photo was taken yesterday when she followed me down the drive to collect the evening paper from my neighbour Ro. Ro always laughs as she knows when she sees me coming down the drive Eva will be following. The hens reward us with wonderful eggs - sparse at the moment as they don't like the cold weather, but hopefully spring will remind them why we got them in the first place! My faithful companion Freida. We go for walks everyday and when she sees her lead coming off the hook she makes the most hilarious wolf howl you could imagine, so funny from such a quiet dog. Being married to an engineer is a godsend! This is part of his actual precision work and is his main job, however Jon likes to understand how things work - so from fixing the washing machine, hoover, fuse box and plumming, Jon has a thorough understanding and working knowledge!

{"title": "Thought for Thursday", "date": "Thursday, January 13", "text": "This morning I received my thought for the day, courtesy of www.innerspace.org.uk Think Differently The world is what you think of it.  So think of it differently and your life will change. When you wake up, instead of thinking: Can I sleep just a little bit more?  Think differently: What can I read right now, that's inspirational or motivational?  When thinking about exercise, instead of thinking: What difference will it make if I just skip a day?  Don't I deserve a day off? Think differently: What should I listen to while I workout to make this session more fun? When considering eating healthy, instead of thinking: What foods am I going to have to give up?  Think differently: What foods that I like will I get to eat more of?  What new recipes can I experiement with? Last night at Slimming World I maintained my current weight – a loss of 9.5 lb which means although I initially lost 12lb I gained 2.5lb over Christmas and the times our classes were cancelled due to bad weather – so I guess I have got to move up the action bar and make a determined effort this week. This quote therefore did seem to ring a few bells. The change in the weather helps and the general temperature does seem warmer – which is a good thing here as we ran out of oil last night and the Aga is making its way through the last bag of coal….hopefully we are having a delivery of oil this afternoon and the coalman is on our case!"},
{"title": "Zen Fun", "date": "Tuesday, January 11", "text": "Z﻿Well here we are week 26 of ABC Wednesday Round 7. I worked out that this is my 182nd ABC Wednesday contribution and this fun weekly meme is set to continue to Round 8! As Wednesday approaches I do find myself thinking what can I possibly think of next, and in this amazing world we live in, there is always something out there. Ofcourse there are some letters more complicated than others, X in particular but people ALWAYS come up with something and when you visit the ABC Wednesday Blog you will get a taste of the great imagination and creativity we see each week. Although it is known as ABC Wednesday we tend to start posting on a Tuesday due to time differences across the world so her is my Z contribution!It is only recently I have come across the  Zen philosophy ......as Wikipedia puts it....Zen is a school of Mahāyāna Buddhism. The Japanese word Zen is derived from the Chinese word Chán, which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word dhyāna, which means \"meditation\" or \"meditative state.Zen emphasizes experiential Wisdom in the attainment of enlightenment. As such, it de-emphasizes theoretical knowledge in favor of direct realization through meditation and dharma practice. The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahāyāna thought, including the Prajñāpāramitā literature and the teachings of the Yogācāra and Tathāgatagarbha schools.The emergence of Zen as a distinct school of Buddhism was first documented in China in the 7th century CE. From China, Zen spread south to Vietnam, and east to Korea and Japan. As a matter of tradition, the establishment of Zen is credited to the Persian [1] or South Indian prince-turned-monk Bodhidharma, who came to China to teach a \"special transmission outside scriptures, not founded on words or letters\".Bearing this in mind I thought the following competition was a fun way to illustrate this today! I would also like to make a special mention of one ABC blogger, Gerald who has, like so many others been part of ABC Wednesday since day 1 and writes Haiku and other fantastic poetry! Thanks so much Gerald - Enjoy!  ZEN HAIKU FOR COMPUTER USERS A contest was held to replace the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft error messages with Haiku poetry messages led to the following beauties. ((Formal Haiku poetry has strict construction rules; each poem has only 17 syllables; 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second line, 5 in the third line.

{"title": "Y is for Yorkshire", "date": "Tuesday, January 4", "text": "Yorkshire is a historic county of northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom.Because of its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been increasingly undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration, such as Yorkshire and the Humber and West Yorkshire.  Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoiled countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities. Yorkshire has sometimes been nicknamed God's Own County.[ The emblem of Yorkshire is the white rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the White Rose on a dark blue background, which after years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. Yorkshire Day, held on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its own dialect.  I was born in North Yorkshire and although I spent 10 years in Nottingham, I returned in 1986 when my Dad died. I love the yorkshire scenery, people and dry sense of humour so I thought for ABC Wednesday  I would share some yorkshire fun!    Yorkshire people are a very particular breed: they can be dour, they speak their minds and they are hard working, friendly and kind. Yorkshire people refer to their county as 'God's own county,' and indeed can boast some of the most beautiful countryside in Britain. Yorkshire man takes his cat to the vet.Yorkshireman: Ayup, lad, I need to talk to thee about me cat.Vet: Is it a tom? Yorkshireman: Nay, I've browt it with us.  A Yorkshireman's dog dies and as it was a favourite pet he decides to have a gold statue made by a jeweller to remember the dog by.Yorkshireman: Can tha mek us a gold statue of yon dog?Jeweller: Do you want it 18 carat?Yorkshireman: No I want it chewin' a bone yer daft beggar.  A Yorkshireman's wife dies and the widower decides that her headstone should have the words \"she were thine\" engraved on it. He calls the stone mason, who assures him that the headstone will be ready a few days after the funeral. True to his word the stone mason calls the widower to say that the headstone is ready and would he like to come and have a look. When the widower gets there he takes one look at the stone to see that it's been engraved \"she were thin\". He explodes, 'Blimey man, you've left the \"e\" out.'The stone mason apologises and assures the poor widower that it will be rectified the following morning. Next day comes and the widower returns to the stone mason, 'There you go sir, I've put the \"e\" on the stone for you.' The widower looks at the stone and then reads out aloud, 'E, she were thin.'"},

People born in the Year of the Rabbit are reasonably friendly individuals who enjoy the company of a group of good friends. They are good teachers, counselors and communicators, but also need their own space.According to Chinese tradition, the Rabbit brings a year in which you can catch your breath and calm your nerves. It is a time for negotiation. Don't try to force issues, because if you do you will ultimately fail. To gain the greatest benefits from this time, focus on home, family, security, diplomacy, and your relationships with women and children.

{"title": "X marks a spot!", "date": "Tuesday, December 28", "text": "X-Men - DefinitionWhen googling around I discovered some facts which just so happened to fit in with my ABC Wednesday project. This little idea of mine is now in its 4th year soon to be entering Round 8! X is always a challenge, yet I know people will embrace it with imagination and resourcefulness.    The cover of Astonishing X-Men #7 by John Cassaday, featuring (from left to right) Wolverine, Emma Frost, Cyclops, Lockheed, Shadowcat and Beast The X-Men are a group of comic book superheroes featured in Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, they first appeared in X-Men #1 (September 1963). The team’s original incarnation failed to find a large audience. However, after a 1975 reformation, the X-Men grew to become one of the most hugely popular franchises in the comic book industry, producing dozens of spin-off series and turning many of the writers and artists involved in the series into industry stars. Since the early 1990s, the X-Men have been adapted into many other media, most notably two animated television series and a string of blockbuster Hollywood movies. The X-Men are mutants, human beings who, due to a quantum leap in evolution, are born with superhuman abilities. Mutants are often hated by regular humans both because of ordinary bigotry and because humans fear that mutants are destined to replace them. This fact is worsened by a number of mutants, most notably the team's arch-nemesis Magneto, who use their powers to try to disrupt and dominate human society. The X-Men were gathered by the benevolent Professor X to protect a world that hates and fears them from Magneto and other threats. Herein lies the sociopolitical undercurrent of the franchise. Mutants are often seen as a metaphor for racial, religious and other minorities that face oppression. Professor X has been compared to African American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Magneto to the more militant Malcolm X. Another civil rights metaphor the X-Men have is gay rights. Comparisons have been made between the mutants' situation, including the concealment of their powers and the age they realise these powers, and homosexuality, as was illustrated in a scene of the X-Men film X2 that had Bobby Drake \"come out\" as a mutant to his parents. The X-Men series itself is known for containing a richly diverse cast of characters and is perhaps the most multicultural book in comics. So appropriate today when I know Xenophobia will feature in ABC Wednesday.For more ABC fun, visit here – always welcome to hop aboard!"},

For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.\" When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet: 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.'\" Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.\" When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.Thank you for the comments about our nativity set.

I will designate jobs - important ones like making sure everybody has drinks nd the likes!This is the menu * denotes this dish is prepared and in the freezer!Tropical Fruit Salad in something alcoholicTurkeyRoast leg of lambRoast beef(all of the above will have cooked through the night in the aga)Home Roast Parsnips & Potatoes*Mashed champ potatoes (with cream & spring onion)Vegetable Bake*Green veg (brussels  *, cabbage & brocolli)Peas *Yorkshire PuddingsGravyChipolata Sausages/bacon rollsStuffing Balls*Desert..Vanilla Scones, *Fruit, Clotted Cream with CointreauRaspberry TrifleThe vegetable bake is my own recipe heavily influenced by M&S. Here is how I make it:-Half a white cabbage - chopped and lightly steamed.1 large onion  -  chopped and lightly steamed.4 large potatoes partly cooked2 Big hand fulls of green beans chopped4 carrots cooked and chopped3 tomatoes finely chopped1 cooked cauliflower finely choppedStir all together and add 3 beaten eggs, half a pint of milk and grated cheese and season to tastle.Place in a casserole dish and cook - you will thank me for this recipe it is awesome.The picture is of the stuffing balls now in the freezer. I like to keep things simple and used a packet of paxo sage and onion stuffing to which I added some seasoning I was given at the Great Yorkshire Pie Show in October. Not sure what it is but it was to add to sausagemeat to add flavour - so I have now added it to the stuffing mix together with plenty of cooked onions. I tasted a sample and it certainly had a kick to it!For desert I am trying something different - the vanilla scones, made with yoghurt are absolutely delicious. I know I have gone on before about them here but the taste is just out of this world. I will serve them on a large platter with lots of clotted cream and a variety of fruit. The cream with contreau again is awesome. I did make some up with this cream and orange curd - awesome!I only need to get the odd thing in which I will do locally. I didn't dare order any shopping on-line as the deliveries have been cancelled due to the bad weather!"},
{"title": "It's back!", "date": "Thursday, December 16", "text": "The view of the Moors on our way home today!Well the weather forecast was correct yet again - down to the time of day we would get more snow! We had to go to County Durham today so we were keen to get any running around done - and we just did.As we left the village this morning the fluttering snow stopped just after 11am and as we drove towards Durham the roads were clear. Coming home however we could not get away from the fact that the area which seemed the worst hit was once again the North York Moors - indeed as we were driving home the all too sure signs of the effects of snow were all too clear. Cars, fearing for their traction were definately driving slower and as we watched on, clear roads were suddenly covered by the drifting snow off the moors. Apparantly this bout of snow is going to be worse than the last one due to the icy cold wind which as I speak, I can hear howling away outside.I was listening to \"Thought of the Day\" the other morning on the Chris Evan's breakfast show. The pastor was talking about a journey she had made on a motorway, during the snow we had a few weeks ago. As she approached a convoy of military vehicles - where we often see the brigades of servicemen in the rear, instead this convoy was transporting shepherds, together with their sheepdogs. What a sight that must have been at this time of year! The army have indeed being active in rescuing many rural communities, people and animals alike.All the sheep in our village farms are now inside the barns and outbuildings - we hear them as we lay in bed as we are just over the road from Ronnie, a sheep farmer. Let us hope the winter conditions are not too devestating for the farmers and sheep alike.I enjoy Radio 2, but my big favourite is Classic FM. One of my all time favourite christmas music was played today and it did make me think about what is going on around us.Christmas music is so moving, no matter what your preference don't you think - do you have a favourite piece/carol?"},

An angel of the Lord appeared to them. And the glory of the Lord shone around them. They were terrified.  But the angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy. It is for all the people.  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord. Here is how you will know I am telling you the truth. You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.\" Suddenly a large group of angels from heaven also appeared. They were praising God. They said, \"May glory be given to God in the highest heaven! And may peace be given to those he is pleased with on earth!\"  The angels left and went into heaven. Then the shepherds said to one another, \"Let's go to Bethlehem. Let's see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.\"  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby. The baby was lying in the manger. After the shepherds had seen him, they told everyone. They reported what the angel had said about this child. All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them."},

{"title": "Thawing?", "date": "Friday, December 10", "text": "Last night, from the various sounds coming from the roof, it would seem we are in for a thaw. The weather forecasts have been very accurate so far so it is with a heavy heart I read that we are due for another dose of snow next week.We live just off the A171 Whitby coast road and it has certainly been in the news this week, in particular on Tuesday. Jon and I had to go to Guisborough and as we set out it started to snow - nothing drastic - just a steady even fluttering. We weren't long in Guisborough and coming home the snow started to lay thicker and heavier. Now the A171 is an unforgiving road with many blind bends and hidden summits. It is important not to brake unecessarlily as this can lead to skidding and there are many ditches along the side. One of the dangers on the moor road is drifting snow. One minute you are looking at white fields on either side of the road - the next the wind carries the snow across the road which suddenly is not visible and you are surrounded by a vast whiteness - yet you know the ditches are there!As we use the road daily we are aware of the many blackspots - so as we left Birk Brow and headed down the sloping road the car in front was indicating left. The car began to turn left, then changed its mind and reversed back onto the main road, straight into our path. Now this junction is a notorious black spot - indeed it claimed the life of our neighbour some years ago and I always think of Peter everytime I pass. Jon was driving and by his quick thinking swerved round the car and carried on. Fortunately nothing was coming toward us!The snow was pelting down by this time and as cars in front of us drove cautiously towards Whitby we eventually turned left towards our village. The road was barely visible but we managed to get to Jon's workshop and on the way home came across a vehicle which could not get over the brow of a slight hill in the road. It was still snowing heavily but Jon stopped and towed the car over the brow and onto a part of the road where the driver could carry on. Would you believe we knew the driver? His dad was our best man! lol!Shortly afterwards the roads were closed. Mayhem! There had been various accidents and incidents. If we had been any later we too would have been stranded for a few hours.Our location leaves us with two routes - the moor road and the coast road. The coast road involves saltburn bank - to give you an idea of the adverse conditions we have had to dope with here is a video of Saltburn Bank taken last week. The coach driver now has his own following!"},

I was a big fan of the Beatles and would sing along to their songs. The partnership of Lennon & McCartney saw some of the very best songs from the 60’s and 70’s. I wasn’t really old enough to go to any concerts of “gigs” as they are sometimes called – I was only about 9 when they first hit the headlines. My uncle ran a music quiz at a local pub - an avid record collector  he would buy the latest records and play them for me – and test out his questions!  I remember reading that the Beatles were touring England and I actually wrote in to parlaphone records giving our address and mentioning we had a spare bedroom – can you imagine?  Like many people I grew up with the Beatles, their subsequent split and followed the various projects which followed. I was a big fan of Paul McCartney and Wings, loved George Harrison’s “My Sweet Lord”, Ringo’s quirky, jolly songs and the many songs of John & Yoko. I heard about John Lennon’s death during my first year of teaching The staffroom was stunned. As the facts became known the feeling of utter disbelief and denial came to us all.    Were you a Beatle’s fan?  Favourite Beatle’s Song? Can you remember where you were when you heard the news?"},

As we came up our drive there was lots of activity across the front lawn.﻿ The icicles just outside the window are now beginning to thaw!

He was there for quite a while.The hens will not venture out into the snow - I have moved them from the hen hut into the empty goose hut (sigh) as there is more room for them to potter during the day I close the door, once I have given them clean sawdust, food and water and they are quite secure. I am aware of paw prints in the snow each morning when I go through the garden to the hen hut and I am worried that if I left the door open a hungry fox could quite easily pop inside for breakfast. Beyond the back of our garden are open fields and countryside so we know there are many wild animals out there.We are entering Day 12 of the snow and whilst it would appear a thaw seems to be happening - the roads are treacherous due to ice so again I am staying put! I normally go to our village church for advent but all services are cancelled due to the bad weather so later today I think we are getting the tree down from the loft and decorating the house - watch this space!"},

Listening to the Radio this morning - broadcast from London there was great excitement as a \"flurry\" of snow descended outside the studio - so romantic yet a thousand miles away from the reality of a week long snow storm. The sheep I featured a couple of days ago (Ronnie's) are no longer outside in their respective fields - they are now inside the barns needing feed.Fortunately I do not need to venture anywhere - I can't anyway as Jon is using the 4x4 to get to work and these are the only vehicles suitable in the current conditions. I have an intent fear of driving in the snow due to a bad experience in a BMW - renown for their inability to move in any snowy condition so I am quite content to stay at home. I have a cold too, so best to stay snug as a bug in a rug - and the perfect place is in our snug - so - sitting in the snug - this was the view from the window a few minutes ago Yes, it was snowing again! More road closures! We are just off the A171 Guisborough to Whitby Road which is currently shut due to the weather conditions and the village is so quiet. Last week our village was in the news and indeed on National television when a coach veered off the road on a nasty bend. The problem with driving over the moors is the snow can drift across the road quickly and the road can not be seen - hence the amount of accidents when vehicles go into the ditches. The mistlethrush was after some breakfast  The barns over the road where the sheep are now being looked after.Having a cold I must admit I have a craving for oranges and lemonade - it takes me back to mum - this was always what she prepared for me when I had a cold.......so I am in the best place for sure - watching the world outside from my window! The pictures above would appear Black and White - this is not the case - this is how dull the sky is right now - so her's something to brighten the day...Weather forecast is pretty much the same - more snow, more winds and colder temperatures!"},

We have to ensure we have sufficient oil to keep the central heating going and we are stocked up with coal for the AGA.  I don’t really mind the bad weather – as long as I do not have to venture very far! If it does snow I will be out and about with my camera. We are surrounded by farmers and we see them preparing their land and animals for the cold spell. Animals seem to have their own inbuilt weather forecast system!

Nod, by Walter de la Mare, 1873-1956  Softly along the road of evening,In a twilight dim with rose,Wrinkled with age, and drenched with dew,Old Nod the shepherd goes.His drowsy flock streams on before him,Their fleeces charged with gold,To where the sun's last beam leans lowOn Nod the the shepherds fold.The hedge is quick and green with brier,From their sand the conies creep;And all the birds that fly in heavenFlock singing home to sleep.His lambs outnumber a noon's roses,Yet, when night shadows fall,His blind old sheep-dog, Slumber-soon,Misses not one of all.His are the quiet steps of dreamland,The waters of no more pain,His ram's bell rings 'neath an arch of stars,\"Rest, Rest, and rest again.\""},

Following on from the comments last week regarding the various village scenes I photographed earlier this year I thought i would share part of our village for my ABC Wednesday contribution. Many of you picked out Ronnie’s sheep as a favourite, so this morning it seemed appropriate to capture the sheep grazing in the field which we look out upon. The barn to the right of the picture will be the place the ewes will give birth to their lambs in the spring. I say spring, yet each year the lambing season seems to get earlier and I would suspect that come January we will hear the sounds indicating the arrival of the new lambs.     Walking on the path parallel to our house this scene shows the part of the village where we live. Again Ronnie’s sheep can be seen in the distance and the white house with the red tiled roof is our house. The hedges have been recently cut by James, son of David from Redhouse farm.   Further along the same lane the view of our village church is quite clear.    Most days I leave our house (to the left of the wooden fence above) and pass the field next door – home to Dan, one of the racing horses who live in the barn!  Dan was in the distance when I walked down our drive but when he saw me he knew I would have a carrot…….     So he galloped across the field……   and enjoyed his carrots!          Walking down the village we passed my friend Rowena’s house. We often have a cup of coffee together.     Further along is the village pub – we often go to the restaurant – he fillet steak is awesome and they have a buy one meal get one free offer! bargain!   The roaming fields seem to go on forever! A real rural feeling!     Walking back towards our house we passed the red tractor and car – belonging to Mick and Audrey who celebrated thie Ruby wedding anniversary last weekend. Along with other neighbours we attended a surprise party.     The red berries indicate a harsh winter is in store!           I take Freida for a walk every day and always enjoy the tranquility of our rural location. We have lived here for nearly 20 years and feel a definate part of the community. I guess the surroundings have played an important part in our contentment – we are home birds and enjoy our life here in the village. We are not ones for going out – enjoying our home and the company of family and friends."},

Initially we were thinking about Guisborough where all of the local churches and organisations take part in a procession leading up to the Cenotaph. The Salvation Army band leads this and it is all very grand. Loftus is our local market town so we decided to go there instead. A much smaller affair yet just as important and relevant. As we took our place in the crowd we became aware of a light aircraft flying in the sky. We knew the pilot – when Jon pointed out it was a yellow and white Tigermoth it could only be Peter Jackson, a friend and neighbour. We assumed he was out on a Sunday morning fly about – as he often is. However as we watched him fly over the market place he released a plume of red poppies which flew down over the crowd. How unexpected yet so moving!   But the freedom that they fought for, and the country grand they wrought for, Is their monument to-day, and for aye.Thomas Dunn English"},

(Sun, Oct 16).  Bentley’s Steve Martin has been bidding for several years to win one of the supreme accolades. He was reserve supreme pie champion in 2008 and put this year’s remarkable double down to the efforts of his entire shop team.  The championship-winning pork pie, which had earlier been awarded first prize and the Interbake Shield in the small pork pie class, received the Ted Jones Supreme Pork Pie Trophy, presented  personally by Mr Jones, a retired butcher from Wadsley, Sheffield. He his wife Margaret have been involved with the Great Yorkshire competition since 1988 and both again acted as judges this year. There was also a product donation from William Jones Packaging, of Cardiff.  Bentley’s Butchers first prize thick pork sausage, recipient of the Ripon Select Foods Shield, went on to be crowned supreme champion, receiving a new trophy and product donation presented by Towers Thomson, whose Yorkshire base is in Mexborough. There was also a further product donation by W R Wright & Sons, of Liverpool. For good measure, Bentley’s finished runner-up in the black pudding class, with the shop also highly commended for entries in other show classes.  The reserve supreme pork pie championship fell to the first prize large pork pie from Woods Butchers, of Carcroft, Doncaster, which received the Willis Hall Cup for Pork Pie Excellence. The late Yorkshire playwright was a great fan of the competition, judging on a number of occasions. Woods is no stranger to success in the content, being chosen as supreme pork pie champion in 2005, black puddings champion in 2006 and reserve supreme pie champion in 2007. At this year’s renewal, Woods was also third in the small pork pie class  The 2010 reserve supreme sausage championship, recipient of the Devro Quaich, was awarded to the first prize Oris Shield-winning thin pork sausage from defending champions H Hofmann & Sons Butchers, who have a total of five butchers and bakers’ shop in Wakefield town centre and Normanton. The business has been taking part in the Great Yorkshire competition since its inception, winning numerous honours over the years, including the supreme champion sausage and pie titles in 2005 and 2006 respectively. This year, Hofmanns also won the speciality sausage class and Gordon Rhodes Shield with its pork and leek sausage, as well as finishing runner-up in three further classes – small and large pork pies and thick sausage.   The black pudding championship fell to Wharfedale butchers George Middlemiss & Sons, of Otley, while the champion beef burger came from Paul Flintoft Butchers, of Kippax, Leeds, the 2009 reserve supreme sausage champion. Both classes were sponsored by W R Wright & Sons, the latter for the first time this year.  A ‘New Kid on the Block’ awards category introduced for first-time entrants fell to Howgate & Farrar Butchers in Woodlesford, Leeds, with their third prize thin pork sausage. This brand-new class, designed to encourage fresh blood to enter the competition, was sponsored by Cleveland-based moulds manufacturer Jon Nesbitt Engineering, of Liverton. H Weatherhead & Sons Butchers, of Pateley Bridge, champion black pudding maker in 2009, this year won the speciality cold eating pie class and the John Spencer Memorial Trophy with its pork, stilton and cranberry pie, also taking the runners-up prize with a second entry. Last year’s speciality sausage class winner, competition debutant Parkin Butchers, which has shops in Epworth, near Doncaster, and Crowle, just failed to pull off a repeat victory when runner-up in the same class with its pork and chive sausage. Ellisons Butchers, of Cullingworth, came third with its speciality Toulouse sausage. Mirfield butcher Shaun Fairweather was awarded third prize in the large pork pie class, Arthur Haigh Butchers, of Thirsk, finished third in the black pudding class, Weegman’s Butchers, of Otley, came third in the speciality pie class, and Sutcliffes Butchers, of Skipton,  third in the thick pork sausage class. Headingley Farm Butchers finished second in the beef burger class, the third prize falling to Sharlands Butchers, of Paddock, Huddersfield. The competition, organised by the Confederation of Yorkshire Butchers Councils, was being held for the 22nd year. It attracted 300 entries from 50 butchers across the county. Joining sponsors and product donators in presenting the trophies were Confederation of Yorkshire Butchers Councils’ president George Haigh, of Meltham, Holmfirth, and John Taylor, president of the National Federation of Meat & Food Traders. Among the judges this year was the 2008 and 2009 Great Yorkshire supreme champion pie-maker, Andrew Voakes, of Voakes Pies, Whixley, York.

Mabel however succeeded and hatched one chick. This morning when I went over to let the hens out she was first out, together with her chick!    Mabel is an excellent mother and will not allow the other hens anywhere near her chick. She will be staying over with the neighbours and raising her chick until further notice. We are not sure what sex the chick is – we will be able to tell in a few weeks when we will be able to choose a name. The weather here is quite dire at the moment and it looks as though it will continue to rain throughout the weekend so it doesn’t look as though we will be venturing out on the motorbike.

{"title": "K is for Kidney Beans.", "date": "Tuesday, September 28", "text": "“The only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook”Julia Child I nearly had to reach for the dictionary for inspiration today - but there was my answer literally under my nose!As I mentioned a couple of ays ago, I am on a diet! A strange time of the year for such a drastic measure you may think but as the colder months approach I will have to start wearing my winter biking trousers and if I remember from last time they were starting to feel tight - so I am operating a proactive approach rather than a reactive one. I am following Slimming World as I find this suits me. Basically I can have vegetarian days (green) which I quite like as well as meat inclusion days (red).We do not have a great variety of local shops so I have to choose ingredients which I can find on our doorstep - kidney beans for an example! What you see above is what I had for breakfast this morning. I first make up my kidney bean mixture - I blitz half a can of tinned tomatoes + 2 level teaspoons of curry powder + 1 level teaspoon of chilli powder. Next I add one tin of kidney beans and blitz quickly so it is still quite crunchy and not too mushy. This mixture can then be added to a baked potato, spread on crispbreads with fat free cottage cheese or in the case above - added to scrambled egg! Absolutely delicious!Last week I lost 2.5 lbs and will know how successful I have been this week when I get weighed on Wednesday evening - so I will update then.I promise I wont go on - nothing worse but from time to time i will share any good recipes and good news!"},
{"title": "All Change!", "date": "Saturday, September 25", "text": "“To be interested in the changing seasons is a happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring.”George Santayana         Having read recent comments it made me realise how fortunate we are to have the beach on our doorstep. I guess sometimes I take this for granted and only visit a couple of times a week, excuses ranging from it being too cold, too wet, jobs to do, etc. etc. you know how it goes! Yesterday I was reading somewhere of somebody who longed for the beach and really enjoys visits there as they feel really charged up and energised by such a visit. It really gave me a wake up call and I figured that I should embrace each daily walk and venture down on the beach come rain or shine. There are people who may not have access to a beach - so they can share my visits! That said - this morning the wind was howling and the rain was threatening to fall, so I wrapped up well and Freida and I drove to the beach. It only took us 5 minutes to get there and we had a great time.I felt it appropriate to post the photographs in black and white as it just seemed to capture the mood on the beach. The sea was anything but calm, as it had been earlier in the week.The weather forecast is not good for the North East coast and I now feel it appropriate to assume the next few weeks and months are going to continue to get colder and  wetter - if any sunshine or clear days happen to come along that will be an added bonus, I am certainly not expecting as such......so there are jobs to be done - the garden needs putting to bed, there are apples needed picking and chutneying, various tidying up, leaves constantly sweeping and I think we may have to light the Aga soon! Yes, changes are happening and in keeping I have changed the appearance of my blog - much more appropriate don't you think?"},

{"title": "J is for Journey!", "date": "Tuesday, September 21", "text": "~ Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome. ~ (Arthur Ashe)     This morning I had a fantastic time on the beach with Freida. As usual we had it all to ourselves and as the sun was warm and the air was still it was a fantastic space to be. Whenever I am near the sea I always think of the times I was away from home and missed the open coast so much. I returned home when my Dad died and I knew the time had come for me to return home and look after mum. I will never forget the journey home as I knew my life was about to change, but little did I know how much. A few months later I met Jon. A holiday had been planned with friends to France for 5 weeks. It was during this time I realised I had met “Mr Right”. The journey home was a very significant one as I knew it would be the last journey I would make , as a single woman. We were married a few months later. What significant journeys have you made in your time?    The Journey  One day you finally knew what you had to do, and began,though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice --though the whole house began to trembleand you felt the old tug at your ankles.\"Mend my life!\" each voice cried.But you didn't stop.You knew what you had to do, though the wind priedwith its stiff fingers at the very foundations,though their melancholy was terrible.It was already late enough, and a wild night,and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds,and there was a new voicewhich you slowly recognized as your own,that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeperinto the world,determined to do the only thing you could do --determined to savethe only life you could save.  ~ Mary Oliver ~"},

{"title": "H ……Hole of Horcum", "date": "Tuesday, September 7", "text": "Whenever I am out and about I like to think what I can post for my weekly ABC Wednesday and as H approached it was perfect for the Hole of Horcum, an area of outstanding beauty not far away on the Whitby to Pickering road. We travel on this road almost weekly and I had been watching the changing colour of the Heather – knowing it is always at its best at the end of August/beginning of September! The photograph above is one I took in 2003 but the rest of the images were taken last week, 1st September.     We found ourselves with a free afternoon and with the weather being good we decided to go out for a tootle on the motorbike. I knew exactly where I wanted Jon to take me and so we headed up towards the Hole of Horcum. Just as we parked in the carpark the action kicked off with an ambulance with its blue light flashing pulled alongside us.   Apparantly a lady had collapsed right at the bottom of the valley and needed to be taken to hospital. The words “Air Ambulance” were mentioned so we knew a Helicopter was on its way! We sat patiently, enjoying an icecream and eventually the helicoptor arrived. I took several photographs but I think the one below captured the moment! The lady was fine and I was well pleased with the extra H for my planned Hole of Horcum idea. We headed home and would you believe as we travelled through Danby a hedgehog crossed the road! The moment was witnessed by both Jon and myself but there was not time to photograph the incident!          The Hole of Horcum is a massive natural amphitheatre that was carved out of the rock of the North Yorkshire Moors by the action of glacial ice flows - an interesting place in itself but also the location of much activity during the prehistoric period. It is situated at the western end of the ancient trackway known as the 'Old Wife's Way' which leads east towards Blakey Topping and it is also the location of several Bronze Age round barrows, dykes and settlement sites further to the southwest on Levisham Moor.Gallows Dike consists of a 3 metre wide and roughly 2 metre deep ditch with eroded 4 metre wide banks on either side that runs roughly north-south over a small raised section of land close to a kink in the A169 road on Saltergate Moor. There are 3 round barrows close by and it is possible that as well as being burial monuments they could also have served as territorial markers - they are probably slightly later in date than the bank and ditches. There are also several cross dykes running northwest to southeast further to the southwest beyond the Hole of Horcum and these also have round barrows nearby or associated with them. A much damaged series of banks and ditches known as Horcum Dikes also run north-south along the east side of the glacial hollow.To the southwest of Levisham Moor there are several burial mounds and further later Iron Age earthworks, there are also associated field systems and enclosed settlement areas, one of which showed evidence of being involved in iron making and thought to have been in use well into the Roman period."},

Breakfast for the hens – layers pellets, grit, oats and their favourite which is just cooking right now – rice! They tend to prefer rice with their meals now – ruined! I enjoy Monday morning especially after a good weekend which we certainly had!  It is that time of the year when many people have to start thinking of the C word! Butchers are amongst this group as C time is big business. I am sure you have noticed “Join our Christmas Club” notices in many butchers – a way to start saving up for the inevitable feeding of the 5,000 over the holiday period. One very popular item is the large pork pie – at Christmas they are made for special orders, 1lb, 2lb and gala sizes. As you know hubby Jon is a tool and mould maker and now is the time for the butchers to place any orders with him, in time for the Christmas demand. Contacting and keeping in touch with our customers is my job and on Friday I spoke with new customers in Ingleton, a village in the Yorkshire Dales and one of our favourite routes. Incidentally it is this very route which we use when we make our annual pilgrimage to the Isle of Man each June, so what better excuse to call in yesterday.    We stopped for a picnic about 6 miles from Ingleton near Ribblesdale viaduct.         I took the picture below as the group of bikes looked really colourful against the blue sky.   In Ingleton once we had spoken with the butcher we had a cup of tea and a huge cake. We shared the cakes, Jon went for a huge strawberry creamcake and I chose a vanilla slice. Really one would have been quite enough shared, but no we had to indulge! It wasn’t a wise choice considering the route home! No sooner had we got back onto the motorbike and began to wind our way round the roads home did I feel a little green around the gills! Fortunately the feeling soon disappeared as I concentrated on the route home. We always like to return home via a different route so we came home via Skipton, Harrogate, Thirsk, Helmesley and over Blakey Moor – one of my favourites!       Ralph’s Cross – I know we are nearly home when we pass this! A great day – 200 miles in all!  For more Monday macro shots visit here"},

We did manage a blast to Whitby on Saturday, originally heading over to Scarborough as I wanted to go to Marks & Spencer’s for their special meal deal which is currently on – you know the type where 2 people can eat well for £10! We had the tank bag on the motorbike all ready to pack our purchases in but even as we headed for Whitby the skies looked black!Just as we arrived in Whitby the heavens opened and we had quite a dramatic downpour! I say dramatic as we were under cover of the railway station roof at that point! Parking was a bit of an issue, not sure what is going on there but as the skies continued to look darker we decided the politics of the bike parking could wait until another day and we would make a dash for home.Now normally the distance from Whitby to our house can be covered quite quickly on the motorbike – but as we just came onto the Moor Road the blackest of clouds in the distance must have noticed us and headed our way with speed! The raindrops seemed to be the size of golf balls as they hammered loudly onto our helmets! Rain thrashed against us and as it hit our leathers the cold rain found its way down our trousers and into our boots! We were drenched in the time it took us to get home!Yesterday was no better. The weather forecast said it would get out later – but how late was the big question! 5pm and it was still high wind, mist and raining!I decided to do some work on a current Christening Commission I have – the Christening is in September, the date we will know later this week. I always like to give my clients a couple of ideas to work with.This first one has a more formal approach:- The second one is a more relaxed approach – which do you like?On the inside of the front cover is a detailed page with Harry’s birth details.Once the date is known I will work on the insert details and an RSVP.I love anything like this – I was in my element! The card itself is 12cm x 12cm – just the perfect size for a christening I think! I will be in my study for quite a few days now as I am preparing work for an exhibition in October. It will be in our local village hall and will consist of individual greetings cards and my Christmas collection. I am quite excited about it. I will be taking orders for Christmas as well as selling many of my cards on the night itself.

{"title": "Chicken update!", "date": "Saturday, August 28", "text": "This morning when I let the chickens out I noticed a pale blue egg! This means that Bev has started laying again after her broody period. I knew she would eventually start laying again but was a bit concerned that the attitude of the other hens towards her would put her off, but it would seem things are getting back to normal! The bullying has settled down but she does tend to keep herself to herself! This morning I fed them their favourite treat, cooked boiled rice mixed in with their layers pellets and some grit!     On a small farm just over the hill there lived a farmer named Farmer. He took some kidding about his name, but not much, mostly because he didn't talk to many folks. He lived alone with his wife, Mrs. Farmer, whom he loved very much. And they had a chicken, whom he also decided he loved very much.\"I love this chicken,\" he said to his wife one day.\"Yes, I love her too,\" said the wife. \"She's a nice chicken.\" \"By cracky, I'm going to write a love poem for her.\" \"I'm not so sure people should write love poems for chickens,\" she warned, but his mind was already made up.Mr. Farmer worked on his poem for an hour. He had never written a poem before, so he didn't know how bad this one was. It went: Roses are red,Violets are blue,You're a great chicken,Cock-a-doodle-doo. He thought it was good enough, and he wrote it out in his best handwriting and brought it to the chicken early the next morning, and set it down in front of her so she could read it.The chicken looked at the poem with one eye, then the other. Then she hopped on the paper and scratched with her talons, until it was nothing but shreds. The farmer frowned and walked away silently.He was downhearted, but Farmers don't give up so easy. He said to his wife, \"I love this chicken.\"\"Yes, I love her too,\" said the wife. \"She's a nice chicken.\"\"By golly, I'm going to write a love poem for her.\"\"But you did that already, and she scratched it up.\"\"That just means my poem wasn't good enough. I'll write a better poem.\"\"I'm still not sure people should write love poems for chickens,\" she warned, but his mind was already made up.Mr. Farmer worked on this new poem for five hours. He had only ever written one poem before, so he didn't know how mediocre this one was. It went: Dearest chicken, lovely bird,Love is not too strong a wordFor the way I feel for you,And hope you feel it for me too.I love you more than I can say,And even more each passing day. He wrote it out as before, and brought it to the chicken early the next morning. He set it down before her, anxiously watching for some sign of approval.The chicken stared at the poem for a second. Then she pecked at it. And pecked again and again, poking holes in the paper until every word was obliterated. The farmer grimaced and walked away, choking back a sob.But a Farmer does not admit defeat so readily. He said to his wife, \"I love this chicken.\"\"Yes, I love her too,\" said the wife. \"She's a nice chicken.\"\"By God, I'm going to write a love poem for her.\"\"But you did that twice already, and she tore 'em both up.\"\"That just means they weren't good enough. I'll write a better poem.\"\"I'm pretty sure people shouldn't write love poems for chickens,\" she scolded, but his mind was already made up.Mr. Farmer worked on this third poem for three whole days. He had only ever written two poems before, so he didn't know how good this one was. It was, in point of fact, the greatest love poem ever written by anyone in the whole history of poetry. It went: As grains in the cornfield, for thee have I shucked,Words of love do I offer, yea of praise and renown,Winged yet earthbound, as seraphs cast down,To thee have I whisper'd, to me hast thou clucked.Pulchritudinous poultry, from beak to thy legs,To gaze at thy galliform soul is to singOf the unbested arm and the untested wing;I toast thy fowl beauty as I toast thy fresh eggs.Say not love is folly 'twixt chickens and men;For hath not my heart forged a bond with thy breast?Yea, a thick bond, which thickens, like mud in a nest,And quickens my pulse for thou pullet, thou hen.O chicken, surpassing the swallow or dove,As thou swallow my corn, spurn not my love. He finished writing it just as the sun came up on the third day. He brought it to the chicken, and bowed low as he placed the parchment before her.The chicken looked at the poem for almost a minute. Then she clucked musically, and the farmer's heart filled with joy.Then she turned around, and pooped right onto the sonnet. She defecated again, and again, until every word was smothered in chicken droppings. Mr. Farmer stumbled back to the house. He could barely see for the tears in his eyes. That night, he said to his wife, \"I love this chicken.\"\"Mmm, so do I,\" she agreed. \"May I have the other drumstick?\"For more camera critters visit here"},

We had never been on some of the roads before, but the scenery was utterly spectacular!                   We stopped in Reeth and had a wonderful picnic. I say wonderful as it was a bargain! I only had a few minutes to prepare so I threw some eggs in a pan and hard boiled them. There was some bread buns in the freezer which I had bought for the price of 10p! I buttered the partially defrosted buns knowing by the time we would stop for lunch they would be just nice. I nipped to the local post office who do the most wonderful yorkshire ham. 6 slices for the 6 of us! Desert was a pineapple, again bought at a reduced price of 35p! It was quite a sight when we set up our picnic area on the green at Reeth and Jon produced his penknife and sorted the pineapple out! We did get some stares but hey even bikers can have a healthy picnic! None of those dodgy burgers for us! We rode to Hawes and after an icecream and a chat with friends we mad our way home via Leyburn, Bedale, Northallerton and Stokesley! A wonderful mystery tour! In fact Fantastic!"},

Mine would have to be tea, in fact 9 times out of 10 I would choose tea. I have to really be in the mood for coffee and just can not take it first thing! Over the years my tastes have changed from sweet tea, black tea, strong tea and now I am developing a taste for herbal tea. For some years Jon has been having black tea as he heard about the health benefits and although I tried it for a time I really can not say I liked it that much.  I guess the whole healthy eating issue is really big business right now, people wanting to know quite rightly where their food comes from and the effects the food process has on the environment, so I was quite impressed with the free samples which came with this month’s BBC Good Food Magazine! I hope the good earth tea bags will be available locally! Reading some of the information on their website I noticed the benefits of elderberries, this interested me as I notice the elderberries are beginning to ripen, so I would say another week before we start collecting them in.       Looking at the photograph now urges me to have another cup……so what is your preference?

On the 14th and 15th August, York Minster  holds a Stone Carving Festival for Masons, Carvers, Sculptors and Apprentices from across Britain and abroad. The Stone Carving Festival was the first to be held at York Minster in ten years since the hugely successful York Stone Festival in 2000 when the octagonal stone bench in Dean’s Park was created.Up to eighty Masons and Carvers worked on stones in the Minster School Grounds. The stones were auctioned off to the public and all the proceeds were divided between York Minster Fund and York Against Cancer. We arrived just as the auction was taking place – these were some of my favourites!             It was quite amazing really, but the top one was definately my favourite! The sky over the minster shows what a glorious afternoon’s sunshine we had!

{"title": "Memory Lane!", "date": "Monday, August 16", "text": "Rosehips  Last week during one of our daily walks I came across some rosehips growing amongst the hedgegrow of Parkhouse Farm Lane.  During World War II, in a rare show of Governmental frugality, the ministry of health put forth a scheme to begin gathering rosehips, which hold 20 times the amount of vitamin C in oranges (rosehips contain 2000mg of vitamin C/100g of fruit). Due to the lack of fresh fruit and orange juice being imported at the time, it was essential for the people of Britain to get a good dose of vitamin C from somewhere and the wild larder provided.As a child I remember collecting these by the sack full and taking them to school as part of this scheme. (Many years after the second world war I hasten to add! lol!) I vaguely remember getting some sort of badge for my efforts but the size of the badge  nowhere comparabled with the sack loads of rosehips both myself and my family collected from Eston Hills. Rosehip Syrup: 500g Rosehips 500g Sugar/Caster sugar 2 pints of water (first infusion) 1 pint of water (second infusion)   Give the hips a good clean and remove any stalks. Place in a stainless steel pan and pummel the hell out of them with a potato masher, you can if you prefer, roughly chop them with a knife, but if you need to vent any frustration: Potato masher. Boil 2 pints of water in a kettle, pour over the rosehips in the pan and bring to the boil, then remove from heat, cover and allow to infuse for 30-40 minutes. Strain the contents through muslin or an old pair of tights (my personal favourite) into a bowl. For the second infusion transfer the pulp back into the pan, pour over a pint of boiling water and repeat the process as before. This removes all those irritating hairs. Combine the strained liquids into a fresh saucepan and bring to the boil reduce by half. Add the sugar and boil fiercely for 5 minutes till all the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and pour into a warm, sterilized bottle or jar and leave to cool. Store in a warm place and consume within a week or two. To make it last longer, you could add a small amount of tartaric acid as you would when making elderflower cordial. What to do? Moving with the seasons, rosehips are only ever available at this time of year before the first frosts begin to take their toll on them. Therefore it seems only right to use the syrup for something to warm the soul. Either drizzled over a steaming apple & blackberry crumble or combined with other liquids to make a delightful hot drink… Rosehip Toddy: Other than a good woman, this is the perfect fireside companion, absolutely incredible, possibly even better than the original and that’s saying something! Put a good slog of whisky in a mug (Glenmorangie original is quite delicate and a perfect partner, if not than a nice blended whisky like Famous Grouse…do NOT use Bells!) Add a little rosehip syrup and the juice of a 1/3 of a lemon and top up with boiling water. You may want to experiment with quantities as everyone has their personal preference. This drink is certainly packed to the hilt with vitamin C; it may even be useful to soothe a cold! For a children’s version, simply leave out the whisky. For a good cocktail, hot or cold, a rich dark rum, rosehip syrup, apple juice and a slice of lemon will be enough to get any party started…a good addition to Halloween and bonfire night! The leaves make a fine aromatic tea and can be used alongside the syrup; the syrup can even be used as a cordial. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend making a batch of rosehip syrup. It’s one of those perfect Sunday afternoon projects. Go for a walk, get your rosehips, make syrup, and enjoy a Rosehip toddy the very same day. I wonder what it would be like in mulled wine? I will have to find out later…midday is a bit early for that kind of thing! For more Monday macro shots visit here"},

Last seen August thirteenth nineteen eighty six Answers to the name of John Henry Davison, Dad.          The greatest gift I ever received come from God, I call him Dad!  -         Anonymous  John Henry Davison came into my life when I was 7. Mum had just got a  new job at the prestigious ICI, Wilton Training Centre. One of the Training officers was John Davison, or Jack as he was known. Mum was one of the secretaries. This was her first job following the  harrowing divorce she had gone through, a visit from the bailiffs to  strip the house we lived in, seizing  goods to cover my biological  father's bankrupted business debts, a nervous breakdown.Mum borrowed the deposit for a small terraced house from her 2 brothers,  Uncle Bob and Uncle Stan. It needed lots doing to it, including total  rewiring.  We all know how single women are targeted by unscrupulous workmen, and back in the 1960's things were no different, so Jack helped Mum by  making sure she was not taken for a ride. He also helped where he could,  as electrics were his \"thing!\"The very first time he came to our house I was introduced to \"Uncle  Jack!\" Years later I learned he had been more nervous than me! I was playing  with my doll's house.He spent time talking to me and I liked him. He re-wired my doll's  house, I had the best there was! Independent switches in each of the  rooms, as a real house would.Over the years a friendship developed and he would visit us every  Saturday. It was quite a treck for him as he did not drive and travelled from just  outside Guisborough.Mum eventually introduced him to her own parents.My Grandad, a man of  few words took him out for a walk! He wanted to know his intentions as  Mum had been through so much.Jack assured him he had her and mine best interests at heart.Grandad  was re-assured and a great friendship was kindled between them.On one of his visits as Jack sat with Nana  who was quite ill. Nana drew him close and asked  him to promise he would look after Madge and Denise....he promised.On June 17th, 1970, Nana died.On November 1st Uncle Jack and mum were married, the day before mum's  birthday.We moved to a bungalow and after a couple of years we all moved to  Guisborough,Dad's home. Mum and I loved this change although by this time I was at University.Mum and Dad were both still working at ICI.  Dad had a very stressful job and in 1983 he suffered a massive heart  attack. It resulted in him having to stop work.In those days ICI was one of the best emloyers, with very good benefits, both Dad and Mum left with \"Golden Handshakes\", mum deciding to leave in order to ensure Dad had the rest he was to need.Happy with their bungalow in Guisborough, they bought a static caravan  at Rosedale Abbey. They loved to visit and stay whenever they had the time. Infact, the photograph above was indeed taken in the caravan, by mum.On the morning of August 13th 1986, whilst staying at the caravan, Dad  told mum he would prefer go home. He wasn't feeling very well. They had  planned  on going to Danby Country Show, one of their all time  favourites.They packed up and set off for home. It would have been a very busy day  on the roads, due to holiday traffic, -the Whitby to Guisborough Road in particular!As the car passed Gisborough Hall, Dad brought the car to a stop and  slumped forward.He had died, literaly at the wheel.I was teaching in Nottingham at the time.I received the news later that afternoon and returned home the following  day.This was to be a turning point in my life. I was to return home and look  after mum.I had a fantastic relationship with Dad, he was indeed my Dad.Notice  how he suddenly evolved as Dad from Uncle Jack? It was the same in our  relationship.I don't know when it happened, it just did. One day I just called him  Dad!Dad recounted the event to mum..he had cried at the time, privately,  with pride and love.I often sit  in Dad's chair and remember him....I will take great comfort in doing that today, August 13th 2010!When Dad was at school he learned the poem \" Meg Merilles\" off by heart. This he would recite when his teacher asked the class to stand up, one by one and sing. Dad was incredibly shy as well as tone deaf, this was his contribution. he often recited this, infact at the drop of a hat!Here is the poem in it's original form, for Dad!    Meg MerriliesOld Meg she was a gypsy; And liv'd upon the moors:Her bed it was the brown heath turf,    And her house was out of doors.Her apples were swart blackberries, Her currants, pods o' broom;Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,    Her book a church-yard tomb.Her brothers were the craggy hills,    Her sisters larchen trees;Alone with her great family She liv'd as she did please.No breakfast had she many a morn,    No dinner many a noon,And 'stead of supper she would stare     Full hard against the moon.But every morn, of woodbine fresh     She made her garlanding,And every night the dark glen yew     She wove, and she would sing.   nd with her fingers old and brown     She plaited mats o' rushes,And gave them to the cottagers     She met among the bushes.Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen,     And tall as Amazon:An old red blanket cloak she wore,     A chip hat had she on.God rest her aged bones somewhere —     She died full long agone!John Keats"},
{"title": "D is for Dairy Cow!", "date": "Tuesday, August 10", "text": "We learn something new every day don't we? Well yesterday I learned that the Dairy cows I pass when Freida and I go up Handale are of the breed Holstein, typical black and white colouring. They belong to our neighbours, Blue House Farm. I asked Sue what the colored tape was on the bottom of the cow's tail and she told me the various colours indicate how often the cow gives milk and of any antibiotics the animal may be taking. I found this quite interesting really and now you know too! lol!  In this photograph in the background is the North Sea, so you can appreciate how close we are to the sea. In the ear of the cow is a tag so the milk produced by each cow can always be traced. Each cow has a name and it amazes me that Sue and Phil, infact all of the family can identify the various cows in the herd! I find cows such lovely animals and would make such a lovely subject for a painting...now there's an idea!         The main function of a dairy cow is to produce milk. In the UK & Ireland and many countries across the world, the Holstein is the predominant breed because of its ability to produce high volumes of milk efficiently.  As the average cow in the UK was born before 1995, and the UK Holstein population has been improving quickly for at least the last decade, this means that the average cow in the UK will no longer have a positive PTA. In fact only around 40% of milking cows will be positive for PIN.  The calf  Calves can be born throughout the year, unlike e.g. sheep where lambs are usually born in the spring. When the calf has been born, the mother licks it to remove the birth fluids. The calf is able to stand within a few hours of birth and will drink colostrum from the cow’s udder. Colostrum is a special milk produced for the first 24 hours or so after birth and protects the new-born calf from disease.In modern farming systems the calf is taken from its mother within a couple of days as she is needed to produce milk for sale and it is less stressfull for both the mother and calf. The farmer feeds the calf milk from a bucket for the next 6-8 weeks until it is weaned (can survive on solid food). The calf must, by law, be identified with a tag which is inserted into its ear shortly after birth. Calves may be dehorned when they are a few weeks old. This procedure does not hurt the calf but stops the horns from developing and causing possible injury to other animals or humans. Bull (male) calves are usually reared for beef either on the farm or at another farm which specialises in beef production. In exceptional cases where the bull is of superior genetic merit, it may be used for breeding. Heifer (female) calves usually stay on the farm and are reared for entry into the milking portion of the herd.  Milking  Before a heifer can produce milk she must have a calf. Heifers are mated at 18-24 months old. Artificial insemination is the usual method although natural service may be used. If all goes according to plan, the heifer will be pregnant for nine months before giving birth. Once the heifer has given birth she will begin to produce milk. (She will be called a heifer until she has her second calf when she will be called a cow). Milk is removed from the heifer using a electricity-powered milking machine which mimics the natural sucking action of the calf. The milking machine has a ‘cluster’ of four rubber cups which are attached to the heifer’s four teats. Gentle suction is applied to the teats and the milk is drained into a system of pipes leading to a refrigerated tank where the milk is stored until it is collected by a tanker, usually once a day. The herd is usually milked twice or occasionally three times a day.  Frequency of calving  Ideally the cow should calve once a year. Because the gestation period (pregnancy) is nine months, this means that the cow needs to be mated three months after she had her last calf. The cow continues to produce milk throughout most of her pregnancy until about three months before she is due to calve when she is ‘dried off’ i.e. the farmer stops milking her. This allows her to rest and be ready for her next lactation (milk producing period). The lactation period lasts for about 305 days. If a cow does not calve every year, the amount of milk that she produces will gradually get less.In her lifetime, a cow will have on average, 4 calves and 4 lactations.  Feeding the cow  In order to be able to produce milk, the cow must eat large quantities of food and drink large volumes of water to obtain the nutrients that she needs. The cow is a ruminant which means that, unlike humans, she can make use of fibrous foods such as grass. In the UK & Ireland, most grass grows in the months between March and November. The herd grazes outside during this period. Surplus grass is preserved for the winter months. The most common form of preservation is in the form of silage which is fermented grass. Drying grass in the sun is another method of preservation which produces hay. Cows will eat silage or hay in the period between October and April when they are kept indoors.Because we expect the modern dairy cow to produce large volumes of milk, her grass-based diet needs to be supplemented with extra energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. Concentrates are used for this purpose. Concentrates are mixtures of cereals, rape meal, sunflower meal, peas, soya, vitamins, minerals etc which are ground and pressed in animal feed manufacturing mills to produce small, brown pellets.P.S.

(Updated)   \"A Royal Commission is a broody hen sitting on a china egg.\"Michael Foot     A few days ago a couple of our hens started clucking loudly and did not want to venture out into the garden. Later we discovered they were sitting on some eggs inside the henhouse. As we do not have a cockerel the eggs are not fertilized and so will not produce any form of life – try telling that to Mabel and Bev! They decided to make their “nest” at the back of the henhouse and when anybody goes anywhere near them they become agitated and puff themselves up in an effort to appear the tough gals they are to fend off unwelcome interest!  Now as we do not want any chicks (been there, done that) we have to discourage them from sitting. They have become rather touchy and will not let the other hens anywhere near the nesting spot. The hens tend to lay the eggs together so now they have decided they are going to sit the other hens stopped laying!  We moved the remaining hens into the newly furbished goose hut and thankfully their abundant laying has resumed.  One day last week Mabel and Bev left their nesting spot to venture out for some food. I quickly took away the eggs and shut the henhouse door. They seemed to be okay to start with – then I noticed Bev sitting in the middle of the paddock making a loud clucking sound. I could not see Mabel anywhere and then I spotted her – sitting on the roof of the henhouse!             It was obvious she was trying to still connect with the non existent eggs and was prepared to sit there for some time.   Eventually I opened the henhouse door and within seconds she jumped down and made her way inside!  Talking to our neighbours last Friday - who also keep chickens we discovered they have some eggs they want hatching so Saturday afternoon Mabel and Bev left for a short vacation, being transported under the arms of hubby & neighbour. They are now housed in a coop with some fertile eggs for company! Will keep you updated on the progress!

No sooner had I finished painting she wandered off.               I think the lounge is one of my favourite rooms in our house as it is so light. What is your favourite room in your house?

Westgate Road is definately a place for bikers as it is filled with shops stocking everything needed for motorbike owners. I have been thinking about learning to ride a motorbike for some time but being short there is always the problem of my feet not reaching the ground, but in one shop I came across one bike which seemed OK and the colour was right too! I don’t think I would get a new one, no an old one would be more suitable…….watch this space.         We had fish and chips for lunch and the portions were absolutely mammoth! We all finished our plates but really I felt so full. Only a matter of minutes later we were back on the motorbike making our way to Darlington! Being on the back of a motorbike, in leathers after fish and chips is not a very comfortable place to be!  As we are so near the seaside we know some good fish and chip shops, especially in Whitby and Scarborough. In my pottering about with various blogs I came across this poem and had to share, it really sums up the whole fish and chip thing!  Enjoy!  FISHING CHIPS by Stan Ski!

The Bike, Saturday afternoon at Thornton le Dale   Another full weekend as it was the annual Cock of the North Races at Scarborough. Saturday was a real scorcher, too hot to be on the motorbike but we did manage a blast to Scarborough and then on to Thornton le dale for an icecream.    This picture is not a particularly quality one but it does capture the moment Ryan Farquer took the checked flag when he won the race. We have got to know Ryan over the years and he is always so approachable and friendly. A special friend of ours over in the Isle of Man celebrated his 17th birthday last week so we bought a Cock of the North T-Shirt and Ryan signed it. Notice the way he took so much time and effort to make sure it was a nice neat autograph. One of his team, Ray held it so no creases occurred!    It all seems so far away from today now that the regular routine kicks into action and that means the quiet dog on the settee opposite, snoozing away, will shortly be howling with excitement when I pick up her lead and take her for a walk up the lane where currently the honeysuckle is in full bloom.

Let's put it aside!Life is so large and the world is so wide. Days are so short and there's so much to do, What if it was false--there's plenty that's true. Say! Let's forget it! Let's brush it away Now and forever, so what do you say? All of the bitter words said may be praise One of these days.  Say! Let's forget it! Let's wipe off the slate, Find something better to cherish than hate. There's so much good in the world that we've had, Let's strike a balance and cross off the bad. Say! Let's forgive it, whatever it be, Let's not be slaves when we ought to be free. We shall be walking in sunshiny ways One of these days.  Say! Let's not mind it! Let's smile it away, Bring not a withered rose from yesterday; Flowers are so fresh from the wayside and wood, Sorrows are blessings but half understood. Say! Let's not mind it, however it seems, Hope is so sweet and holds so many dreams; All of the sere fields with blossoms shall blaze One of these days.  Say! Let's not take it so sorely to heart! Hates may be friendships just drifted apart, Failure be genius not quite understood, Say! Let's get closer to somebody's side, See what his dreams are and learn how he tried, See if our scoldings won't give way to praise One of these days.  Say! Let's not wither! Let's branch out and rise Out of the byways and nearer the skies. Let's spread some shade that's refreshing and deep Where some tired traveler may lie down and sleep. Say! Let's not tarry! Let's do it right now; So much to do if we just find out how! We may not be here to help folks or praise One of these days.

From time to time socks will go amiss so rather than waste time searching I have a large bag I drop them into and will have socks re-united moment where I find partners for all the lonely socks I have! Strange, quirky, odd but true.The second picture tells a story! Just off the picture is another of Jon'e work T-shirts so there are 3 in all on the line. so this tells me Jon did 3 sessions in the workshop. This doesn't necessarily mean he did 3 days as sometimes he may change his shirts if they are gruby, as is often the case.The other two T-shirts tell me that we have been out on the motorbike on at least 2 occasions over the past few days. This is the case as we went to Whitby last Thursday night and to Scarborough on Saturday. The T-shirts also tell another story! If you look closely wou will see that they are both dated - TT  Road Races 2008 and Mad Sunday 2010! Yes we bought the Tshirts when we went to the isle of Mann TT Races in both those years. We went in 2009 too and indeed have the T-shirts but Jon didn't pick them out on these occasions. Each year we go over to the Isle of Man there is always an abundance of  TT merchandise to buy and we always buy the T-shirts. Whenever we go out on the motorbike Jon always wears a TT Tshirt - they are definately amongst his favourites and he has 5 so there is always a clean supply on the off chance we get out on the motorbike!My world as I always say is a simple, contented world and having the hum of the washing machine ringing in my ears first thing each morning is part of the everyday life here in the Nesbitt household!Laundryby Ruth MooseAll our life so much laundry;each day’s doing or not comes clean,flows off and away to blend with other sins of this world.Each day begins in new skin,blessed by the elements chargedto take us out again to do or undo what’s been assigned.From socks to shirts the selves we shed lift off the lineas if they own a life apart from the one we offer.There is joy in clean laundry.All is forgiven in water, sun and air.We offer our day’s deeds to the blue-eyed sky,with soap and prayer,our arms up, then lowered in supplication.To see other Worlds visit hereTo join in our ABC fun visit hereIt is 1.30pm and comments are disappearing somehow!

They epitomize modern day living and have sentiments of happiness, modernism. They are eclectic, enigmatic and a joy to work with. Native to South Africa, Gerberas have been cultivated to our European demands.  One of the most popular of all flowers, they can be seen in almost all flower shops!      I always think it is such a shame when a bouquet of flowers dies. What was once  an outstanding example of nature in all it’s loveliness, declines into a bunch of lifeless petals.   Last week Jon bought me a wonderful bouquet for my birthday. A week later it is still blooming and I remove the fading flowers on a daily basis.

Jon had to go to the workshop first thing so I pottered about at home with daily chores but at 11am we had to drive to Thirsk Auction Centre to drop something off for one of our customers.   Once a month a “Fur and Feather” auction takes place and our customer has a stall in the farmer’s arket selling his award winning pies, so once we had spoken with Andrew Voakes we had a look round the auction. There were lots of chickens, ducks and geese in cages awaiting auction. There were some amazing breeds which I have never seen before. Jon did say it would be a good place to buy some goslings when we are ready! This sounded good to me.  Home to get changed and head out on the motorbike, such a lovely day we have to make the most of them!  We headed up to Scarborough, to a farmshop we had spotted on the Cloughton Road. We had lunch, a late one at 3pm. Jon had homemade chicken and leek pie, I went for pea and ham soup, with lovely crusty bread! It was delicious!           After we had eaten we had a walk round the various buildings and saw some very interesting pigs!                The cockerel took great pride in strutting his stuff!     We came home via Pickering and when we walked through our gate the hens were sunbathing. They love to find a place where they can spend a couple of hours soaking up the sunshine!                   We had a BBQ and spent the best part of the evening sitting on the patio. The patio goes across the back of the house and up the side of the lounge, so we can always find a sun spot!  Once the sun went down the night was chilly so we continued with the gin & tonics inside!  “May you have warm words on a cold evening, a full moon on a dark night and a smooth road all the way to your door.”"},

Needless to say I had some help!Jon was busy with the hedges which run round the house so between us we had a busy day!Sunday’s forecast was another hot day! We are not football fans so we decided to make use of the quiet roads so we headed over to the coast. Whitby was busy as ever but the air was cool, obviously as it is on the coast – so we went to Bridlington via Pickering, Malton, and Fimber.   Bridlington is a typical victorian seaside town and is full of amusements and fairground attractions but it still has places of interest!  I always say “Hello” to Flambourough for my blogging friend Chris!The seagulls always fascinate me and I thought this scene was quite amusing as each bird seemed to have their own special place! Returning home from Bridlington the roads were very quiet! This could have had something to do with the fact that we left just after 3pm – kick off time for the England v Germany match! As we were getting ready to leave we could hear the shouts of elation and cheering from the various pubs who were showing the match! By the time we reached Whitby the atmosphere had changed somewhat and the faces around the cafe, listening to the match said it all! The final result was 4 – 1 to Germany!     *  What’s the difference between the England team and a tea bag?

He stopped and asked, “Can you manage dear?” To which the old lady replied, “No way. You got yourself into this mess, don’t ask me to sort it out!”    * What do you call an Englishman in the knockout stages of the World Cup? A referee.    * What’s the difference between Wayne Rooney and Shrek?

We sail along and usually all is well...then there are the moments!I am a great lover of  quotations, sayings, and poetry. I subscribe to a couple of daily quotation sites and  cast my eyes over them quickly as like most things some are better or more appropriate than others. Yesterday's however made me sit up and listen!You are the master of your mindso you can choose to create the results you want.Remove the weeds of unwanted feeings & undesired outcomes& plant seeds of positive thoughts.Then sit back & watch the fruits appear ... Tip:be patient, otherwise unripe fruit only causes indigestion!A few days ago something happened which not only annoyed me but upset me deeply! It was something concerning a friend, or at least somebody who I had regarded as a friend. Being the sensitive soul that I am I found myself thinking about what had been said!As I was so preoccupied with the matter I missed certain things going on around me! The rose which I planted in memory of  Dad was in full bloom, yet I had failed to notice. As I sat quietly on the kitchen patio the perfume of the rose allerted my senses and I was so pleased to see the rose in all it's loveliness beckoning me to look at it, in full flower. I bought this specific rose because of it's reliable flowering - it is in bloom on Father's Day! Yes, I had missed Father's Day - a day when I always take time to remember the wonderful time I spent with Dad. When I thought about it however I did feel so much better - positive thoughts I guess! I had been working in the garden for quite some time - one of the jobs which I find very tedious is the weeding of the patio! It covers quite a large area and takes me a few afternoons. I always listen to the radio as I do the laborious task but as I worked away the words of the quotation came back to me :-\"Remove the weeds of unwanted feeings & undesired outcomes & plant seeds of positive thoughts.\"As I worked through the afternoon the hurt I had experienced became lesser and lesser and eventually I felt so much better. I looked at the flowers which had been planted earlier in the season and as I took in their beauty I found myself thinking more positively! By this time I was  looking over the garden and it was about then that the chickens came to see me, and I can never fail to look at the girls without smiling!The person who hurt me was posessed by a need to lash out at me - and I recognise this, however that is their sad action. I am protected by a wonderful husband a good family and sound friends who have witnessed what has happened knowing I did not deserve what was done. I can move on knowing this but the person involved will not benefit from the same generosity and good feelings.The following popped up today - says it all!\"Comes a time in life when you have to let go of all the pointless dramaand the people who create it,and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hardthat you forget the bad and focus solely on the good.After all, life is too short to be anything but happy!\" For more skywatchers see here!"},

We came here, for a short trip out in 2008 and we fell in love with it straight away. I had enquired about a room for 2011 a few weeks ago  as it is necessary to book so far in advance and was dismayed to learn there were no vacancies. I had a frantic day of phoning round the island for accomodation and managed to find a guesthouse in central Douglas. With this knowledge therefore we headed for Heysham ferryport on Friday morning and along with the hundreds of other bikers waited to board the ferry.A chap nearby started chatting to us and the subject came round to accomodation - and then he began his worrying, nay alarming tales of B&B/Guesthouse disasters in Douglas! We were both listening intently, eyes opening more and more as each disgusting detail was described with graffic detail! Fortunately at this moment the bikes were summoned to board the deck and so we did not see this guy anymore but his words were ringing in my ears for a very long time, however I didn't say anything to Jon, as I was still in shock - so much so that I didn't eat anything once on the ferry!We arrived in Douglas and eventually as the bikes drove off the ferry we turned left and took the \"All Other Rotes\" journey out of Douglas. As we headed towards Castletown the memory of the same journey from last year skipped into place. Taking the signpost to Port Erin, we soon found ourselves riding along the seafront and eventually turning into Port Erin, straight down Station Road to the promenade, where our hotel is situated.We pulled up and as I got off the bike Jon said\" Denise, we have GOT TO try and get in here next year!\" I knew then that Jon had also been alarmed by the B&B stories just as much as I had been and he too deciding not to share his worries with me.The sun was warm on our faces as we made our way to the reception. The receptionist recognised us from 2009 and before she even booked us in I asked her if there were any vacancies for 2011. \"Oh there's no problem, I have automatically allocated you a room\" was the wonderful reply! Apparently I had spoken to another member of staff who did not know this valuable piece of information!

After such a wonderful time away in the Isle of man we returned knowing he was unwell. Initially we thought it was arthritis again and infact had been giving him the medicine which had worked so well previously, but when we took him to the vet it was confirmed it was a mental problem, caused by anything from a stroke or a tumour. His legs were strong, as was his wings but his mind was suffering some sort of dementia.As he lay on the vet's table looking weak and dishevelled I thought of how he had always been so clean and elegant, constantly pruning himself in order to maintain his majestic appearance. The photograph below illustrates this perfectly!He would have been mortified with how things had worked out and so we felt it was the right thing to do, guided by the advice from our vet to allow him a release from the place where he was.Jon stroked his neck, I stroked his chest and as the medicine worked Jo closed his eyes and went to sleep.“How do geese know when to fly to the sun?Who tells them the seasons?How do we, humans know when it is time to move on?As with the migrant birds, so surely with us,there is a voice within if only we would listen to it,that tells us certainly when to go forth into the unknown.” Elisabeth Kubler-Ross"},

Today, Sunday we awoke to the sound of rain hammering against the window = although this seems to have died down we are not anticipating nice weather for the rest of the day, Monday apparently is going to be a nice day!It seems ages since I wrote anything here, due to just being busy I guess, I do try to keep up with my cookery challenge and am pleased to think I am experimenting with new recipes on a weekly basis! However life goes on and I thought it was time I touched base!I am pleased to report all is well in the Nesbitt household, Freida has really settled in well and loves her visits to the beach. The calming influence she has is quite opposite to the stress poor Wilma suffered, but Freida enjoys the simple pleasure of sharing a room with any obliging soul! Indeed as I ramble on here she is sleeping on the settee opposite, occasionally checking me out with one big searching eye! Elsie too seems calmer, although she has her moments of sheer thuggery all in all the household is a calmer place.The hens have truly settled into a routine of delivering lovely fresh eggs on a daily basis and as you can see from the picture even ventured into the house a few weeks ago. This is not to be encouraged as we know what hens do - but they were scratting about by the kitchen patio door hinting they wanted feeding when Elsie trotted in from the garden and poor Eva ran into the house!It is approaching our annual pigrimage to the Isle of Man for the TT Races. We are staying in Port Erin again, but sadly the hotel was booked up for 2011 would you believe, so we are trying Douglas next year to see the events from a different perspective! Anyway that is a whole year away, we have yet to enjoy this years events! We leave on Friday 4th and stay until June 12th. I have a wedding commission to finish and once this is safely put to bed I can begin preparing for our holiday. All animals are booked in at various kennels/catteries/neighbours and the hens and Jo will be looked after by John and Trish from over the road. It is a good arrangement we have with them, as in 5 weeks when they go to Turkey I will be looking after their hens and cats, so it is a case of returning the favour!Thos eof you who listen to Radio 2 may have heard me on popmaster a couple of weeks ago! It was so much fun! The questions were unbelievably difficult and I came away with 6 points! But I was proud! A couple of days later I received a postcard from a couple of listeners I have never met - they said how much they had enjoyed listening to me and that there should be more people like me on the programme! I tell you, fan mail eh? lol! Yesterday I was on BBC ! when I phoned in to ask a question - you can see it here, I am on about 1 hour 10 minutes into the programme! lol!Enjoy the Bank Holiday!"},

Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and use to line a 23cm round x 3cm deep loose-bottomed, fluted tart tin – press into the tin if you find this easier. Prick the base several times with a fork and pop in the freezer for 10 minutes.3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Line the pastry with baking paper and baking beans and blind-bake for 10 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and bake for a further 5 minutes or until the pastry is dry and pale golden.4. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, crème fraîche and Parmesan. Stir in the thyme, broad beans and red peppers and season with plenty of black pepper.

Responses are all very well, but it is the follow up which is a true test of success, so to receive a deposit for a definite booking was a good measure of future commissions.With Jon's business it is all about bureaucracy and I am working on policy statements regarding Health & Safety, Quality Assurance etc. Sounds boring but it does bring back memories of the policy statements I was involved with in Education so I am finding it quite enjoyable in a strange way!Keen to keep up with my cookery challenge, ie to develop or try a new recipe each week today I am sharing my Herby Potato Recipe, a recipe of my very own, inspired by a jar of mustard!We were with one of Jon's customer's last week and for lunch I had warm potatoes together with a lovely fillet steak kebab. The customer runs a farm shop and had a variety of interesting jars on sale, amongst them I saw a jar of Horseradish Wholegrain Mustard. On our return home I cooked some roughly cut potatoes and stirred in a couple of tablespoons of the mustard together with 2 beaten eggs. I then transferred the mixture to a greased oven dish and cooked for 15 minutes. Absolutely awesome!

My mind cast back to last week when I remember removing an empty plate after he had heartedly tucked into ....yes you've guessed Lamb Biryani!

One ingrediant which I could not find anywhere was vine leaves. Determined to locate some I found a wonderful online shop here. Ofcourse I had to have a browse and really liked the sound of this rice it is an authentic biryani rice. Really easy to use, just microwave for 2 minutes. I did try one portion out and it was awesome. I simply chopped up some hard boiled eggs with it and the meal was just so..... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! There was some rice left which I added to some sausage meat and made a batch of scotch eggs.At the weekend I cooked joint of lamb and we were left with the leftovers. Rather than just have sandwiches I cooked a pack of the biryani rice, added lamb gravy, left over carrots, parsnips & swede, some pansata and allowed it to simmer away slowly! The result was out of this world! A great way to use left overs!Mrs Nesbitt's Lamb Biryani I will be using this online store again and would urge people to have a browse.

Sadly the series has come to an end but it has inspired me and I have the book so I am using it when I have the chance. This was gorgeous. I made the recipe up then froze in portions. The picture above is dinner thawing ready for tonight.I notice Masterchef is back so I will be watching in earnest for new ideas to try for my Cookery Challenge!BastichioIngredientsMiddle Layer – Meat Sauce:2 tablespoons vegetable oil500g pork mince5 tablespoons olive oil2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped2 fat cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped1 well rounded teaspoon ground cinnamon2 heaped tablespoons dried mint1 chicken stock cubeA really good handful fresh flat leaf parsley, finely choppedAbout 500g tomato passataA good sprinkling of paprikaHalf teaspoon sugarSalt and freshly ground black pepperBase Layer – Pasta350g penne pasta1 chicken or vegetable stock cubeA third teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg1 rounded tablespoon butterAbout 200g Greek halloumi cheese, grated8 tablespoons of the béchamel sauce2 egg whites from large eggs, lightly beatenTop Layer – Béchamel200g butter, melted and cooledHalf teaspoon grated or ground nutmegPinch of ground cinnamonPinch of salt2 egg yolks from large eggs2 pints milk200ml crème fraiche150g cornflourAbout 100g Greek halloumi cheese, gratedMethodYou will need a rectangular oven dish measuring approximately 33cm x 29cm and 7cm deep.Begin by heating the vegetable oil in a large saucepan and then add the mince.Fry the mince over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until it browns, stirring most of the time to break down any lumps and to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.Now, drain away most of the fat; no need to sieve it, just gingerly tilt the saucepan over the sink  and use the lid or a slotted spoon as a barrier to stop all the mince from falling out.Now return the pan to the heat, add the olive oil, onions and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes.Add all the other ingredients – the cinnamon, mint, crumbled stock cube, parsley, passata, paprika, sugar and a seasoning of salt and freshly ground black pepper and give it all a really good stir.Partially cover with the lid, and leave to simmer on a low heat until about 10 minutes before it’s time to assemble the bastichio, stirring every now and again.Now bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil and add the stock cube.Add the penne and cook according to the packet instructions.For the béchamel: while the meat and the pasta are happily simmering away, in another saucepan place your cooled, melted butter, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and egg yolks and gently whisk until well combined (a balloon whisk is best for this sauce).Add all the milk and crème fraiche and whisk again to incorporate.Set this aside for a few moments so that you can attend to your pasta.When the pasta is ready, drain most of the liquid away reserving about 2 or 3 tablespoons. Then pour all the pasta with the reserved liquid straight into the base of your oven dish and whilst it’s hot and steaming, add the nutmeg, butter and the halloumi cheese and mix really well..Set aside for a couple of minutes to cool down slightly and then stir in your egg whites.Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees C.Now all we need to do is to finish making our béchamel.Take the pan with the milk and add the cornflour, whisking as each tablespoon goes in.Now place the saucepan onto a medium heat and start whisk well! That’s the secret; don’t stop whisking the sauce until it’s completely ready. It will look slightly unattractive and lumpy at the start, but don’t panic as it will transform into a beautiful, glossy sauce by the time it’s done.As the sauce starts to thicken, turn the heat down slightly and stir a bit harder, so that it doesn’t catch the bottom of the pan.When it starts to bubble gently, remove from the heat and stir about 8 tablespoons of the béchamel into the pasta.Next, take your slightly cooled meat sauce and slowly spread all over the pasta, to cover it completely.And finally, spread your lovely béchamel over the meat sauce and sprinkle generously with the grated halloumi cheese.Place it in the top third of the oven for about 40 minutes until it’s nicely browned. Alternatively, once it has cooled pop it in the fridge until tomorrow when you can bake it fresh! Just remember to take it out of the fridge at least a couple of hours before you’re ready to bake it, and that it will require a longer cooking time: 1 hour or so, again until it’s nicely browned and bubbling and making sure the mince is piping hot.Leave to stand for about an hour before dishing up (or preferably a bit longer if you can resist) as it allows the juices to settle and absorb, and makes it easier to cut into pieces. It’s definitely worth the wait, I promise!Serves about 8 hungry people."},

I added some polenta powder which made the kebabs too crunchy, I also added spices.....but far too many, a definate flop...SO I decided to follow Delia's ingredients & method to the letter.The result I must say was bland, very bland and far too moist...so I blitzed 2 slices of bread in the processer and added chilli, more masala and pepper. Result was lovely! I served with some creme freiche which I added lemon juice and pepper to....so the ammended recipe will read as such...Shami Kebabs Nesbitt style225g minced lamb1 chopped onion225g tinned green lentils, drained weight1 heaped tablespoon  masala1 teaspoon salt flakes1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns, with a pestle and mortar1 tablespoon chilli powder1 small egg, beaten1-2 tablespoons groundnut or other flavourless oil1 rounded tablespoon seasoned flour2 blitzed slices of bread to make breadcrumbsMethodPlace the quartered onion in a mini-chopper and chop finely, then add half the lentils and switch on again till the lentils have become a purée – you will need to push them down a couple of times in the chopper as you go. Now combine the puréed lentils with the meat, the rest of the lentils, themasala, chill,i salt and crushed peppercorns.Use a fork (or your hands) to mix everything well, then add the beaten egg an mix again. Now using your hands, form the mixture into 12 patties. To cook them heat 1 tablespoon or the oil in a large frying-pan and, when it’s hot, dip the patties into seasoned flour and fry them for 2-3 minutes on each side, adding more oil if necessary.Finish off in the oven or just miss the pan bit out and cook in oven.Serve as above, with some mango chutney on the side.Green salad would be nice or a simple dip!"},

It was the very first time I had made this and as I was writing about it on Facebook, our good friend, the whirlwind of Lisa Askew replied telling me she was going to Texas the next day! As Lisa is such an amazing woman I told her I was going to dedicate my cornbread after her, so instead of Texas Cornbread it would be known as \"The Amazing Lisa Askew Cornbread!\" I was so glad I did this because when I tasted the cornbread I found it rather bland.

This Lemon Meringue has got to be the best I have ever produced. A basic base of crushed digestive biscuits and melted butter and the filling was as follows:- 1 cup white sugar2 tablespoons all-purpose flour3 tablespoons cornflour1 1/2 cups water2 lemons, juiced and zested2 tablespoons butter4 egg yolks, beaten4 egg whites6 tablespoons white sugar My added ingredient was asachet of  lemon & lime (sugarfree) jellyTo Make Lemon Filling: In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 cup sugar, flour &cornflour, Stir in water, lemon juice and lemon zest. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a boil. Stir in butter. Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to cook while stirring constantly until thick. Leave to cool then stir in lime jelly mixture & spoon over biscuit crust.To Make Meringue: In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add sugar gradually, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over lemon filling   To the mashed potatoes I added an egg together with the butter. Normally I use 1 egg in the yorkshire puddings but yesterday I used 2...spot the colour!Last week we had some bought fishcakes which left a lot to be desired. I decided to make my own with some fish I had in the freezer, just some prawns, pollock and haddock which I steamed and added to some mashed potato & beaten egg. I then rolled in flour, egg & breadcrumbs! Awesome.The scotch eggs were from my Hairy Bikers Cookbook, certainly not traditional as spices were added. I used minced beef together with a selection of ground cumin, corriander and basic curry powders...again a great recipe from my new book! The eggs were softly boiled and gave a much nicer consistency!"},

{"title": "For Chris", "date": "Friday, January 15", "text": "Yesterday we had to attend the funeral of a very dear friend, Christine who died last week as a result of a traffic accident whilst out on her motorbike. It was a freak accident really and could have happened to anybody, but sadly for us and all of Christine's family her number was up!The service was to be held at our local church, All Saints in Easington. We knew there would be a lot of people attending the service as Chris was so popular. The church was absolutely full with a huge crowd of people standing as there wasn't any seats left. The service was to begin at 1.15pm and by 1pm the place was packed with many standing outside.During the service we learned lots of facts about Christine, facts which we wouldn't have known. After the many years I have known Chris I did not know she not only loved poetry but wrote some herself. Her favourite poem was Wordsworth's Daffodils which we are all familiar with. The poem 'Daffodils' is also known by the title 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud', a lyrical poem written by William Wordsworth in 1804. It was published in 1815 in 'Collected Poems' with four stanzas. William Wordsworth is a well-known romantic poet who believed in conveying simple and creative expressions through his poems. He had quoted, \"Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\". Thus, Daffodils is one of the most popular poems of the Romantic Age, unfolding the poet's excitement, love and praise for a field blossoming with daffodils.William Wordsworth wrote Daffodils on a stormy day in spring, while walking along with his sister Dorothy near Ullswater Lake, in England. He imagined that the daffodils were dancing and invoking him to join and enjoy the breezy nature of the fields. Dorothy Wordsworth, the younger sister of William Wordsworth, found the poem so interesting that she took 'Daffodils' as the subject for her journal.\"Daffodils\" (1804)I WANDER'D lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils;Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the Milky Way,They stretch'd in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed -- and gazed -- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude;And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.By William Wordsworth (1770-1850). It is such a shame that often we only discover things about people when it is too late to talk. I asked Jon if he had a favourite poem and he said whilst he wasn't a great lover of poetry he did like \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling. He went on to say that he didn't think it was appropriate for a funeral but I think it would be OK. My favourite poem is by EE Cummings. I particularly like it for the words in the final line sum up the great feeling of walking on the beach and being so near to the sea. When I was teaching in Nottingham, in the East Midlands I often read this to my pupils and described the coastline I was brought up with which is now an important part of our walks and indeed we can see the North Sea from our house, so it is fitting!maggie and milly and molly and mayby E. E. Cummingsmaggie and milly and molly and maywent down to the beach (to play one day)and maggie discovered a shell that sangso sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles,andmilly befriended a stranded starwhose rays five languid fingers were;and molly was chased by a horrible thingwhich raced sideways while blowing bubbles:andmay came home with a smooth round stoneas small as a world and as large as alone.For whatever we lose (like a you or a me)it's always ourselves we find in the sea Do you have a favourite poem?"},

Bless!Ingredients8 free-range eggs500g/17½oz pork sausage meat1 tsp dried sage½ tsp dried thymepinch cayenne pepper½tsp freshly ground black pepper4 tbsp plain flour125g/4½oz fresh white breadcrumbsvegetable oil, for deep fryingMethod1. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook six of the eggs for 4-5 minutes until they are medium- to hard-boiled. Drain and run under cold water until cooled (this will prevent the yolks from discolouring). Peel and set aside. Beat the remaining two eggs together in a bowl and set aside.2. In a bowl, mix together the sausage meat, sage, thyme, cayenne pepper and freshly ground black pepper until well combined.3. Divide the sausage mixture evenly into six portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten out to form a thin patty. Wrap each patty around the peeled boiled eggs, smoothing out the join and making sure there is no egg left exposed.4. Roll the scotch eggs in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg and roll in the fresh breadcrumbs. Dip the coated eggs once more in the egg, then again in the breadcrumbs.5. Half-fill a deep, heavy-based pan with the vegetable oil and heat Fry the scotch eggs in small batches for 4-5 minutes, turning the eggs occasionally, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.6. Serve the scotch eggs immediately, sliced in half to reveal the soft yolk."},

During the Christmas break he was working on the work's van when there was an incident with a spanner which he managed to bash his hand with. Initially this just seemed to be superficial, but as the days went on a swelling started to develop which was causing him pain and discomfort. A routine visit to the surgery on Wednesday found us on our way to the hospital. Jon was seen quite quickly and whilst I waited in the waiting room he was whisked off for treatment.........all of nearly 3 hours! Imagine my surprise and horror when Jon emerged with a plaster cast on his arm, supported in a sling!It would seem a metal turning has been trapped near to his wrist and although not threatening initially, when Jon bashed his hand the turning was pushed near to the joint, hence the pain! As I write this, Jon is back at the hospital having it dealt with. Our neighbour John, kindly took him in his landrover!I must say the time I spent in the waiting room was interesting to say the least!I'll keep you posted re Jon's progress and rmind me to tell you about the lady who came in with a flapjack injury!I tell you, you certainly hear it all in A&E!"},

I did have a road accident many years ago when travelling to school. I hit a patch of black ice on what is a notoriously sharp bend in the village and my car ended up through a fence in a field. Every time we have snow the same thing happens to many motorists, only yesterday we spotted a car in the same position.  We went for a drive up to Danby Beacon, the highest spot on the North York Moors, it is only a short drive away.  We saw a few grouse surfacing from the shelter of the grounds. It was very bleak and we were one of the few 4x4 vehicles we saw.  The roads were barely visible and we returned home to keep warm and safe. We have had many garden visitors including some thrushes.

It continued to snow throughout the day really on and off! No card passed just the council gritter, a couple of tractors and 4x4's. Jon went to the workshop in the pick-up but had to return for various solutions to deal with the frozen padlock to the compound.I do not like driving in the snow and was home all day as I was expecting some shopping deliveries. The first phone call came early as we were at the breakfast table. This was from Asda. Apparantly the vans had encountered problems from 5pm Saturday and had not been able to get to some locations, the phone call was just allerting me to some problems that may affect us. He left me with his mobile number and I had a good think. If he could get to either nearby Guisborough or Redcar I had friends who could take delivery and we could go later in 4x4 and collect. Sorted.The second call came from Tesco, who were delivering our lovely free range turkey for Christmas Dinner. I must admit I panicked when the caller announced they were from Tesco. However it was just to say the delivery would be slightly later, but would arrive within 30 minutes. Phew! 10 minutes later I had the turkey, now safely stored in the cold garage.Back to Asda, after a couple of calls the delivery chap was on his last delivery in Redcar as he couldn't get any further, so he delivered our shopping to one of our neighbours from 22 years ago when we lived on Castle Road.John arrived from work and we went to Redcar. The roads were trecherous and although we were Ok in the pick up and Jon is skilled with driving in such conditions, we managed to get to Redcar. There were quite a few cars on the roads, but taking things very carefully. We were greeted by Marjorie and we had a brief exchange of cards & greetings before we headed home.When  we unpacked we discovered several chilled items were missing so despite my best planning efforts and avoidance of having to go out and shop anymore, it would seem I have to and I have concerns about the size of the turkey!

From the left, Olwyn,(Dark Brown) Eva, May,(Beige) Margie,(White) Bev, (Black) Mabel, (Dark Brown)They now have a regular routine and go to bed independently when the darkness is approaching, usually around 5pm.By watching their movements I am now confident that all 6 hens are laying eggs on a regular basis. We are getting between 4 and 6 eggs every day, Top left BevTop Right MargieBottom left Olwyn & MabelBottom right Eva & MayThe taste of the eggs is outstanding and we have eggs for breakfast every day and I am discovering new recipes evry day. One recipe I am going to try is this one:-Indulgent spinach, bacon, cheese and potato frittata recipeIngredients: * 100g of lardons (we used home cured ones, chopped streaky bacon slices will do at a pinch) * 2-3 medium potatoes, peeled, sliced and cooked until soft * 2-3 tblsps of chopped parsley * 6 large eggs * 200g of spinach * 50g of mature cheddar cheese (cut into squares) * 15g of grated mature cheddar (topping) * 2 tblsp of olive oil * 1 fat garlic clove (chopped very fine) * Good twist of ground black pepperMethod:1. Fry the bacon lardons in the olive oil until crispish (soft on the inside, browned on the outside). Peel and cook the potatoes. When the bacon slices are ready, set them aside. Meanwhile prepare the other ingredients.2. Wash and wilt your spinach (the wash water will cling to the leaves.) Pop into a large saucepan (lid on) for 2-3 minutes until they wilt. Remove, wash with cold water and strain in a colander.3. Chop your cheese, whisk the 6 eggs with a fork and chop your herbs and add them to the eggs along with the other ingredients.4. Heat the bacon infused olive oil gently in a large  pan. Add the finely chopped garlic. When the oil is hot and the garlic golden pour the beaten egg (with the chopped cheese, bacon, spinach and herbs) into pan. Immediately turn the heat down to the lowest setting. After a mnute or so arrange the cooked potato slices over the top, sprinkle the grated cheddar and leave for 15 minutes. Do nothing. Set the timer for 12 minutes!5. When the timer goes off set your grill to the highest setting so that it will be sizzling when you transfer the frittata from stove top. Finish under the high grill for 30 – 60 seconds.6. Serve immediately with a green salad.“The codfish lays ten thousand eggs, The homely hen lays one; The codfish never cackles, To tell you when she's done; And so we scorn the codfish,While the humble hen we prize;Which only goes to show you, That it pays to advertise”This was the scene from my study window a couple of years ago. I am not sure what the predictions are for the Christmas period but I would be surprised if we had snow. I love snow at Christmas simply because the village looks lovely but when people have to make car journeys it all gets rather dangerous. I do not like driving in the snow, despite having a 4x4. Jon however is in his element and rises to the challenge.A few Christmas cards have started to arrive but I am keeping them all until the weekend as it is the village carol service at the village pub, the Waterwheel and this is when I feel christmas has started and I get in the mood for the festivities. We will bring the tree down from the loft and hand a wreath on the gate. I also need to think about our own christmas cards......I always try to find a suitable picture and keep the design simple!Hmmmmmmmm!"},

When she used a certain type of white eggs in one of her dishes again all white eggs were being sold out at an alarming rate.The one programme which has revolutionised my attitude to food and cooking has got to be River Cottage, specifically the inspirational Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.Over the years Hugh has promoted and inspired us toGrowing your own vegetablesCooking hearty meals with  local produceKeep Chickens, Geese and DucksBuy ethically produced foodsPreserving & Pickling what we growMake our own Cider, Beer and WineMake our own craftsManage our landDiscover and Harvest Wild FoodsExchange seedsAll this had led us on the journey towards a simpler, greener life!I have connected with some great people along our journey who are also inspired by this wonderful man.One of the best places to exchange ideas and discover more about various issues is through a forum.

{"title": "Meet Freida!", "date": "Monday, November 16", "text": "Freida Sunday 15th NovemberHere she is!On Sunday we took both dogs up the lane, something we were never able to do with Elsie and Wilma, it has been so so many years since Jon & I walked the dogs together. We were out for about 40 minutes and the dogs were walking alongside each other, both to the left of Jon & I.After lunch as it was such a lovely day we decided to try putting both dogs in the back of the van and take them over the moors. We put both in the van and had a cup of tea whilst they got use to the situation.About 10 minutes later we drove up to Danby Beacon and walked along the paths. Freida was definately happier when we were in front as she was pulling when Jon and Elsie were in the lead. There were quite a few of sheep on the moors and Elsie seemed to be showing a bit too much interest, despite being on the lead so we decided to quit qhilst the going was good.We put both dogs in the back of the van and headed over to Jon's mum. Mavis has 2 dogs so it was a good test. Again we kept hold of the dog's leads and all seemed to get along fine.Returning home I fed the dogs and Jon let both out into the garden. The coming and going through the kitchen patio doors was always a place of tension as it was here the altercations would take place, but Elsie and Freida seem to manage, but under strict supervision! Just as Jon was bringing in the coal Elsie snapped at Freida. Now when this happened with Wilma there was an almighty scrap often resulting in a vet's bill, but Freida wasn't phased. Jon reprimanded Elsie and Freida carried on as normal.So this is the current situation which we are working through.Watch this space!"},
{"title": "Resumed......Normal Service", "date": "Sunday, November 15", "text": "Fingers crossed please!Last week we recived a phone call from Jill of Cliff Top Kennels, near Scarborough. A German Shepherd had been brought in by Scarborough Council who found it wandering the street. We know Jill well as this is the place we take our dogs. She always had a soft spot for Wilma as she is an animal trainer and behaviourist so she understood Wilma' problems.Jill told us about the dog and left it with us.We had a good discussion and told Jill we wanted to take it further. She suggested we take Elsie to the kennels and see how they got along. Yesterday we did this and all seemed to go well. Needless to say I was quite nervous due to the 3years of constant stress arising from Wilma and Elsie together.As all seemed okay we brought the dog home. Her name seemed to be unclear, either Kia or Kiora. The story was that she had been a family pet but somehow found her way to neighbours who kept her. These neighbours then went on holiday and left her with some other neighbours who kept her but not securely, hence the warden finding her in the street! The warden took the dog to Cliff Top Kennels as they are a registered kennel for such cases in Scarborough. The owners, on holiday were contacted and the situation was explained. They would have to pay the kennel fee of £10 per day whilst she was staying there.Basically they refused saying the dog wasn't there's really etc etc no, they wouldn't pay and didn't really want the dog back!Various procedures had to be followed involving he kennels (Jill) The Council and the \"Owners\" at 5pm on Friday evening the dog became the property of the kennels (Jill)Last night was her first evening with us and all seems okay.Yes there have been a couple of scuffles but minor ones, just Elsie bullying her a bit and ascerting who is boss, as we expected.This morning we took them out for a walk together, around the lanes featured in the photographs above and it was a joy to have a dog each wlaking next to us on their leads, something we haven't been able to do for the past 3 years.Currently she is lying next to me asleep on the settee sleeping contentedly!Her name...Frida! After one of my aunties.So, for the next few days we are hoping she fits in and Elsie accepts her!Watch this space!"},

{"title": "November!", "date": "Sunday, November 1", "text": "Our GardenI love Autumn! Walking round the garden this afternoon I became aware as I always do at this time of year, of the beautiful colours nature keeps for this time of the year.In the shrubbery in the middle of the back lawn, a yellow rose has climbed high above the trees and shrubs to glow such a wonderful shade of yellow.This is not a miracle, it is the yellow rose I planted in mum's memory...tomorrow, November 2nd would have been her birthday. It would have been Wilma's too. We do not know the exact date Wilma was born, but we know it was the beginning of November, so we thought it would be fitting to use November 2nd.Over the past few days we have been thinking a great deal about Wilma and the journry we took together.Wilma was 5 months old when we adopted her from German Shepherd rescue, Newcastle.To this day I can still picture both her and her sister in the pen, desperately trying to get away from the humans who were peering at them. They had been rescued from a shed in a back garden, strewn with broken glass and rubbish. For the first five months of their lives they had been kept alone, with no human or animal contact. They had no socialising skills at all. One of the pups was spoken so we said we would give a home to the other one, subject to a vet check on our sutability.A couple of hours later as we walked through the door the phone was ringing to say the necessary vetting had been successful and a pup was ours. We jumped into the car and travelled back up to Newcastle returning home with our 5 month german shepherd.Over supper we named her Wilmahah, a sound german name.Wilma as she was to be called, soon found a corner of the kitchen where she felt safe, indeed spending 2 weeks there, nervously peeping round the corner now and again.The first few weeks saw her finding the courage to venture into the lounge and immediately return to her corner. Eventually she built up her visits from a few minutes to a few hours and eventually would spend whole evenings with us.Her stable, down to earth companion was Max who kept her on the right track. Jon spent hours upon hours with Wilma, teaching her how to play, fetch the ball and to have confidence and fun.Wilma would never be a normal dog but we loved her and watched her grow in confidence.She would always be nervous about people and when we lost Max in 2006 we brought Elsie into the Nesbitt household. Looking back it was a mistake but hindsight is a marvellous thing!Although initially they got on fine something happened during the December and both became hostile towards one another. What sparked this off we will never know but one thought I have is Wilma had jumped at Elsie as she did with Max and this set the ball rolling for the many scraps which followed.Life for the past 3 years has not been easy here. German Shepherds are a large breed and to have so much energy between two bitches was a nightmare. Yes both Jon and I \"managed\" the situation but it affected Wilma which saw her anger spilling over in a way we had never seen before. Whilst she doted on both Jon and I and our family and friends, many who visited here were not at ease.Wilma and I spent a lot of time together, walking and playing and being in the home together. All would be well and at luchtime Jon would take her to the workshop, leaving Elsie with me. So now Wilma is not here, now she has peace.No more worry, she is in a place where she has salvation from the perils she faced here.Elsie is missing her, she must be wondering what is going on but together we will go forward.For the moment it will just be Elsie as the Nesbitt dog and we can get our home back on track and have some peace and quiet and live in a calm atmosphere! Well as calm as the Nesbitt household will ever be!"},

Wilma suffered an almighty gash to her head exposing part of her skull, and when her nose was bleeding we were fearing internal bleeding or even brain injury.

This was an oil painting I did one day when Peggy decided to pose for me outside the kitchen window. I had never used oils before and was finding it difficult. When she stood there I knew it was something I could paint as I knew the subject so well, unlike the flowers in the text book I was following. No sooner had I finished, Peggy walked away. I did not add anything more to the picture, I felt I had captured her just right...the big blue eyes always staring through the window and the long orange beak. Jo was named after Jon's grandad. Peggy, after Jon's grandma and Dolly after my nana. Sadly Peggy and Dolly are no longer with us and Jo is a widower.

This got me thinking about what I would write, so this afternoon when we went out on the motorbike to Whitby I started playing around with some words. Arriving home I continued to think about it as i cleared out the henshouse, put the hens to bed and finally put Jo into his shed.\r\rHope you like it!\r <!--  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} @page Section1 {size:595.3pt 841.9pt; margin:18.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt; mso-header-margin:35.4pt; mso-footer-margin:35.4pt; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} -->   \r <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face {font-family:Verdana; panose-1:2 11 6 4 3 5 4 4 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1593833729 1073750107 16 0 415 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} @page Section1 {size:595.3pt 841.9pt; margin:18.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt; mso-header-margin:35.4pt; mso-footer-margin:35.4pt; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} -->   Childhood spent in street house with a yard out the back  twas a little palace for nothing did I lack     The hills were our playground for hours would we roam  and as the sun began to set we’d make our way back home     For hours on my roller-skates I’d skate near the chippy  this was the 60’s you see our neighbour was a hippy!     Carol was her name, her sewing skills deserve merits  Eric was her new husband and in his yard kept ferrets!     I remember one occasion a bit hard up perchance  she whipped down the curtains and made a dress for a dance!     For family outings we’d head down to the sea  we’d have egg tomato sandwiches, Mum, Auntie Dot and me.     We’d go for little outings when Uncle Moss bought a car  it was an Austin 30 but we didn’t go too far!     You see seconds away was the countryside   and through the leafy lanes  our little car would glide     The memories still linger my family sadly gone  but the same love of nature I now share with hubby Jon     Not in an Austin A30 do we travel on our tours  but on a blue motorbike we tootle over the moors.     The love I have of nature, the countryside and sea  bring back my childhood memories a good thing, you must agree!"},

{"title": "Coming Home!", "date": "Thursday, September 17", "text": "This was the view from our cabin window as we returned home from France.Judging by the sunset, it was taken just as we were approaching the North East Coast.As we travelled up the coast it was really great to pick out landmarks surrounding our area.Like so many people although I love travelling and touring, the journey home is always the best.We did have a great time, a proper adventure which is just the way we like to do holidays. We can not plan the weather or routes, we just go with what we find.It is good too, that we both have the same attitude.Jon and I share so much of our life together and as we travelled home I was thinking about the new projects which were waiting for us back at home.This filled me with excitement and a buzz!and true appreciation of a happy marriage.When I first met you,I knew that I had come at last home.Home after wandering,Home after long-puzzled searching,Home after long being wind-born,Wave-tossed, night-caught, long being lost.And being with you was normal and needfulAnd natural as sleeping or waking.And I was myself,Who had never been wholly myself.I was walking and talkingAnd laughing easily at last.And the air was softer,And sounds were sharper,And colours were brighter,And the sky was higher,And length was not measured by milestones,And time was not measured by clocks.And this end was a beginning,And these words are the beginning -Of my thanks.A.S.J.

{"title": "Senior Moments.....the latest!", "date": "Wednesday, September 16", "text": "In an effort to keep myself organised and to prevent unecessary faffing about with keys, purse and mobile, I bought myself a little bag, just big enough to hold the three key items of my everyday goings on.Jon is a key security conscious individual, I on the other hand lack the organisation required to carry out such a well defined role.Yesterday we had to travel to Huddersfield and York re Jon's business.\"Your purse in on the kitchen table!\" Jon informed me.Great stuff! All I needed was cash/cards to buy lunch.I was aware that I had not seen my bag for 24 hours, but I knew I had had a conversation on my mobile so I wasn't too worried.\"Have you got your phone?\" Jon asked....I told him I hadn't but I wasn't worried due to the conversation thingy!Last night, on our return home I decided to have a quick look, but found nothing!As I let Wilma out for her evening stroll around the garden I used our home phone to ring my mobile.In the dark, on the patio I could hear it ringing, so I toddled off to bed, somewhat reassured.This morning as I was sorting the general everyday doings of the Nesbitt household I went in search of my mobile, assuming it was in the pick up.....but I couldn't find the keys.I phoned Jon at the workshop and asked him if he had noticed the pick up had been left unlocked, locked it not knowing my bag was inside containing keys & phone.\"Quite possibly!\" Was his reply.We have spare keys so using these I unlocked the pick up and had a good search!Nothing!Came back into house & called my mobile from the house phone.Once again I could hear it.I walked round the house, drive and finally the garden.There was the sound coming loud and clear......from the area next to the chickens!I followed the sound and sure enough, there in the branches of the sycamore was my bag containig my phone and keys.I remembered, on coming home Mabel, the wayward hen had escaped and I had gone over to urge her back to the safety of the chicken run!Putting my bag in a safe place to allow me to deal with the situation!All is well!Another typical day in the Nesbitt household, where, it doesn't matter if you are crazy but it sure helps you fit in with everone else!"},
{"title": "ABC Wednesday....I!", "date": "Tuesday, September 15", "text": "Eventually I will get everything sorted here on my new blog!I was talking with my best friend Maria this morning and was telling her all about the problems I was having with my previous blog! Thing is, my blog is a place where I ramble on, just like Maria and I do when we get together, even pausing for air now and again. But my previous blog would not let me post...no everything was all jumbled up and not clear, so after I had rambled I then had to edit, justify etc etc and this annoyed me, because when I had done everything Blogger wouldn't carry out my corections. Imagine rambling on to a friend then saying, hang on, I can improve that last sentence, or oh was that correctly put? Well enough is enough! This is my new blog and I am so pleased to be here!ABC Wednesday, a wonderful opportunity to share my new place...my very own space! lol!I is for.....Innovation!One of the really exciting aspects of my wedding stationery business is the constant challenges I find being asked of me.Recently Katie and Andrew asked me to design and make a seating plan which would have the WOW factor! Well here is the result! The responses I received at the Evening Reception certainly encouraged me to develop this into another service I can offer and indeed I have designed 3 more to be launched at the next Wedding Fayre I will be exhibiting at on October 18th!Watch this space! Whilst we were staying with Dorothy we visited Oradour, a small village not far from St. Christophe. It is a village which was brought to the ground in 1944. Around 2 p.m. on 10 June 1944, four days after the Allied invasion of Normandy, approximately 150 Waffen-SS soldiers entered the tranquil village of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limosin region of south central France. For no apparent reason, Hitler's elite troops destroyed every building in this peaceful village and brutally murdered a total of 642 innocent men, women and children, an unexplained tragedy which has gone down in history as one of the worst war crimes committed by the German army in World War II. On that beautiful Summer day, the defenseless inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane were rudely dragged out of their homes, including the sick and the elderly, and ordered to assemble on the Fairgrounds on the pretext of checking their identity papers. After all had been assembled, they were forced to wait in suspense with machine guns pointed at them. Then the women were separated from the men and marched a short distance to the small Catholic Church, carrying infants in their arms or pushing them in baby carriages. The men were then ordered to line up in three rows and face a wall that bordered on the Fairgrounds. A short time later, they were randomly divided into groups and herded into six buildings: barns, garages, a smithy, and a wine storehouse. Around 4 p.m., a loud explosion was heard which was interpreted by the men to be a signal for the SS soldiers to begin firing their machine guns. Most of the men were wounded in the legs and then burned alive when every building in the village was set on fire at around 5 p.m. By some miracle, 6 of the men managed to escape from one of the burning barns and 5 of them survived. They testified in court about this completely unjustified German barbarity against blameless French civilians. The Oradour church only had a seating capacity of 350 persons, but 245 frightened women and 207 sobbing children were forced inside at gunpoint while the men were still sitting on the grass of the Fairgrounds, awaiting their fate. The women and children were locked inside the church while the SS soldiers systematically looted all the homes in this prosperous farming village. Then around 4 p.m. a couple of SS soldiers carried a gas bomb inside this holy place and set it off, filling the church with a cloud of noxious black smoke. Their intention had been to asphyxiate the women and children in the House of God, but their plan failed. As the women and children pressed against the doors, trying to escape and struggling to breathe, SS soldiers then entered the crowded, smoke-filled church and fired hundreds of shots at the hapless victims, while other SS men stood outside ready to machine-gun anyone who attempted to escape. The soldiers fired low inside the church in order to hit the small children. Babies in their prams were blown up by hand grenades, filled with gas, that were tossed into the church. Then brushwood and straw was carried into the stone church and piled on top of the writhing bodies of those that were not yet dead. The church was then set on fire, burning alive the women and babies who had only been wounded by the shots and the grenades. The clamour coming from the church could be heard for a distance of two kilometers, according the Bishop's office report. The fire inside the church was so intense that the flames leaped up into the bell tower; the bronze church bells melted from the heat of the flames and fell down onto the floor of the church. One SS soldier was accidentally killed by falling debris when the roof of the church steeple collapsed. Only one woman, a 47-year-old grandmother, escaped from the church. Taking advantage of a cloud of smoke, she hid behind the main altar where she found a ladder that had been left there for the purpose of lighting the candles on the altar. Madame Marguerite Rouffanche, the lone survivor of the massacre in the church, managed to escape by using the ladder to climb up to a broken window behind the altar, then leaping out of the window, which was 9 feet from the ground. Although hit by machine gun fire and wounded 4 times in the legs and once in the shoulder, she was able to crawl to the garden behind the presbytery where she hid among the rows of peas until she was rescued, 24 hours later, at 5 p.m. the next day, and taken to the hospital in Limoges where she was admitted under an assumed name. It took a full year for her to recover from her wounds. In 1953, she testified before a French military tribunal in Bordeaux about the massacre of the women and children in the church. We were speechless as we gazed at the destroyed living testament to the devestation which had fallen upon this community. It made me think of where my world would have been were it not for the sacrifices of those who fought during the world wars. A few days later we travelled to Belguim and saw the lines of the graves of the fallen. Sombre indeed but a reminder of just how many fought for our freedom!   I am joining in a Monday themed poetry projectHere is my poem, based on what I saw at Oradour!A Village......Alone against the demons of destruction,within the ranks of perecutionthe officers bringing a solutionwhen they acted as a pollution, to the purity of the peoplewho were helpless and weak.....when death did them seekand put an end to their lives.They marched as an aliance,with heavy boots of defianceand crushed hopes of any lifedue to struggles and strife...of power!You can see here what it is about!For more My Worlds to ponder visit here"}
